    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the fact that 20 milligrams per day of oral&#xD;
      Zeaxanthin as a supplement to patients with Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and exudative&#xD;
      age related macular degeneration (ARMD) undergoing combination therapy with intravitreal&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (Avastin), intravitreal Dexamethasone and PDT laser photocoagulation and improves&#xD;
      anatomic and visual outcome compared to patients not receiving oral Zeaxanthin. Study&#xD;
      patients will be taking AREDS(PreserVision) and multivitamins (Centrum Silver); in addition&#xD;
      one-half of the patients will receive 20mg of oral Zeaxanthin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the current treatments for choroidal neovascularization in exudative age related&#xD;
      macular degeneration (ARMD) involves a combination of laser photocoagulation (PDT) and&#xD;
      injections of an anti-inflammatory (Dexamethasone) and an anti-angiogenic (Bevacizumab). This&#xD;
      combination therapy is designed to stabilize vision, improve vision in selected cases and&#xD;
      reduce the total number of treatment cycles overall compared to other methods of treatment&#xD;
      presently in use. Many retinal physicians are treating exudative ARMD with an ocular&#xD;
      injection every 4 weeks for a number of years. Combination therapy has reduced the number of&#xD;
      treatment cycles to less than 3 for many patients; and in preliminary studies, patients&#xD;
      taking 20 milligrams of dietary oral zeaxanthin required even less treatment cycles to&#xD;
      achieve stability. In this trial, the only variable will be the oral consumption of 20&#xD;
      milligrams of zeaxanthin daily taken in half of the patients randomized to this group. The&#xD;
      remaining half patients with still undergo combination therapy, but without taking 20&#xD;
      milligrams of oral dietary Zeaxanthin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zeazanthin is found in many foods and low doses of zeazanthin are commonly added to many&#xD;
      multivitamins already on the market. All products with Zeazanthin is a constituent, including&#xD;
      EyePromise Ten, have excellent safety profiles and no side effects or adverse events have&#xD;
      been reported thus far with this supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zeazanthin is in many eye supplements and is being studied by the NEI, National Eye&#xD;
      Institute, as part of the AREDS-2 study looking at the benefits of Lutein, Zeazanthin and&#xD;
      Omega 3 Fish Oils on AMD progression. The patients will be taking 20 milligrams a day of&#xD;
      Zeazanthin. The United States and global safety organization have established an ADI&#xD;
      (acceptable daily intake) of 2 mg/kg body weight/day of Zeazanthin. This equates to 155 mg&#xD;
      per day for 177 pound person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Millions of doses of EyePromise Ten have been taken without side effects. The new part of&#xD;
      this trial, again is taking 20 milligrams of Zeazanthin while being combined with medical&#xD;
      injections and laser treatments. Zeazanthin is one of the two pigments obtained from the diet&#xD;
      that deposit in the macula and give it the yellow color. While obtained from the diet the&#xD;
      retina accumulates it up to 1000 times higher levels than anywhere else in the body. Numerous&#xD;
      scientific and clinical trials suggest that it is critical to the protection of the retina&#xD;
      and in reducing risks and progression of age related macular degeneration.&#xD;
