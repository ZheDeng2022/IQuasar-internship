  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be a randomized, control, multicenter phase III study of recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic (R/M) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with Gemcitabine (Gemzar, Lilly) and&#xD;
      cisplatin regimen (GP) or 5-Fluorouracil plus cisplatin regimen (FP). The population consists&#xD;
      of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) that failed the radical&#xD;
      radiotherapy or chemotherapy-naïve advanced NPC (stage IV). The effectiveness and side&#xD;
      effects will be evaluated according to Standard WHO response criteria and NCI-CTC AE V3.0.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is most commonly seen in Southeast Asia, especially in&#xD;
      southern and southeastern China ,where the incidence rate has been documented between 10 and&#xD;
      150 cases per 100,000 population per year. NPC is a radiosensitive tumor, and radiotherapy is&#xD;
      considered to be the treatment of choice for most cases. The 5-year survival rate (all&#xD;
      stages) is around 50% .In other words, more than half of the NPC cases will eventually fail&#xD;
      radiotherapy and reasons of the failure are both local relapse and remote metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these advanced or metastatic NPC, chemotherapy is the most important therapeutics,and&#xD;
      they are relatively responsive to chemotherapy compared to other head and neck cancers. The&#xD;
      backbone of the treatment for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) NPC is cisplatin containing regimen,&#xD;
      which is also regarded as the standard regimen for other squamous cell carcinoma of head and&#xD;
      neck (SCCHN). The FP regimen is widely used in R/M NPC patients now and its response rate is&#xD;
      around 40%-65%,but the response period is usually short and the adverse reaction is frequent&#xD;
      and badly tolerant, which influent the treatment compliance seriously. What's more, the&#xD;
      catheters and pumps are necessary for continuous infusion of 5-Fluorouracil, which add to the&#xD;
      cost, immobility and inconvenience of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical data show synergistic activity between gemcitabine and cisplatin&#xD;
      without overlapping toxicity. Several clinical trials enrolling a minority of advanced NPC&#xD;
      patients suggest GP regimen has promising effectiveness and well tolerated side effects, and&#xD;
      they indicated a potential possibility that the GP regimen comes to the standard first line&#xD;
      choice instead of the FP regimen&#xD;
