  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effectiveness of treating&#xD;
      cartilage lesions found during knee arthroscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal wear-and-tear on the knee can cause tissue, or cartilage, in the knee to soften over&#xD;
      time forming chondral lesions. Worn out cartilage is often found during knee surgery for&#xD;
      other conditions. Typically, surgeons will remove any worn out cartilage that is found using&#xD;
      a procedure called debridement. However, the investigators do not know if surgically treating&#xD;
      the worn out cartilage is better than leaving the tissue untreated, so it is necessary to&#xD;
      compare the two. Patients who are found to have worn out cartilage during arthroscopy, will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either receive treatment (debridement) or non-treatment (observation)&#xD;
      of their cartilage. Patients without worn out cartilage will also be included in this study&#xD;
      and observed postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of treatment of worn out&#xD;
      cartilage (versus non-treatment of worn out cartilage and versus patients without worn out&#xD;
      cartilage), on self-reported knee pain following arthroscopic meniscectomy using a&#xD;
      double-blinded randomized controlled trial design. Secondary objectives of this study include&#xD;
      examining the effects of treating worn out cartilage on other outcomes (subjective knee and&#xD;
      general health scores and knee measurements including range of motion, presence of effusion&#xD;
      and quadriceps circumference) and also to calculate the intra-operative costs associated with&#xD;
      treatment, including the amount of time and instruments needed for debridement.&#xD;
