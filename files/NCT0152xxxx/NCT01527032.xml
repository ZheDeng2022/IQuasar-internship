      High-dose melphalan (MEL) with autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) is an effective therapy&#xD;
      for systemic AL amyloidosis (AL), but treatment-related mortality (TRM) has historically been&#xD;
      high. The investigators performed a phase II trial of risk-adapted SCT followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      dexamethasone (dex) and thalidomide (thal) in an attempt to reduce TRM and improve response&#xD;
      rates. Patients with newly diagnosed AL involving £2 organ systems were assigned to MEL 100,&#xD;
      140, or 200 mg/m2 with SCT, based on age, renal function and cardiac involvement. Patients&#xD;
      with persistent clonal plasma cell disease 3 months post-SCT received 9 months of adjuvant&#xD;
      thal/dex (or dex if there was a history of deep vein thrombosis or neuropathy). TRM was 4.4%.&#xD;
      Thirty-one patients began adjuvant therapy, with 16 (52%) completing 9 months of treatment&#xD;
      and 13 (42%) achieving an improvement in hematological response. By intention-to-treat,&#xD;
      overall hematological response rate was 71% (36% complete response) with 44% having organ&#xD;
      responses. With a median follow-up of 31 months, 2-year survival was 84% (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval: 73%, 94%). Risk-adapted SCT with adjuvant thal/ dex is feasible and results in low&#xD;
      TRM and high hematological and organ response rates in AL patients.&#xD;

      adjuvant thal/dex (or dex if there was a history of deep vein thrombosis or neuropathy).&#xD;
      Organ involvement was kidney (67%), heart (24%), liver/GI (22%) and peripheral nervous system&#xD;
      (18%), with 31% having two organs involved. TRM was 4.4%. Thirty-one patients began adjuvant&#xD;
