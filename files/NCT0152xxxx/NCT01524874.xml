  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of vitamin D (VitD) in the prevention and treatment of human health conditions&#xD;
      has gained increased attention in recent years. As a result, medical providers of all&#xD;
      categories are screening clinical VitD status frequently, yet become challenged with how to&#xD;
      best advise patients regarding repletion of VitD status, i.e. which form of VitD replacement&#xD;
      is most effective. It has been recognized that to achieve significant effects - serum&#xD;
      concentrations &gt;30ng/ml (75 nmol/ml) - it is necessary, as well as safe, to recommend&#xD;
      substantially higher doses than were previously thought sufficient. These higher doses can be&#xD;
      easily achieved orally. This clinical trial aims to compare absorption of three available&#xD;
      forms of this fat-soluble vitamin, due to the potential differences in absorption of&#xD;
      different preparations. High-quality powdered, chewable and lipid-emulsified VitD are readily&#xD;
      available as supplements, yet these have not been systematically compared. This three-arm,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will compare the difference in serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol&#xD;
      (25-OH)D concentration between the three arms at baseline and after random administration of&#xD;
      one of the three VitD preparations for 12-weeks at a dosage of 10,000 IU VitD per day. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the three forms of vitD will result in an equivalent increase&#xD;
      in serum 25OHD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VitD has numerous hormonal effects, including regulation of Ca2+ and Mg2+, as well as effects&#xD;
      on numerous genes, including insulin and androgens. Mounting literature demonstrates&#xD;
      associations between VitD insufficiency and cancer, diabetes and heart disease. VitD&#xD;
      insufficiency, defined by concentration of serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD) &lt;33ng/ml&#xD;
      (82.5 nmol/ml), is common at all latitudes; the prevalence is estimated at ~35% in &quot;healthy&quot;&#xD;
      populations. VitD testing and replacement is gaining popularity in clinical practice. It is&#xD;
      not known whether there is a difference in the effect of equivalent doses of emulsified vs.&#xD;
      non-emulsified cholecalciferol (VitD3) supplementation, reflected by quantitative changes in&#xD;
      serum 25-OHD. However, clinical observations revealed that in an average of 4.4 months,&#xD;
      subjects taking 4000 iu daily of the emulsified form of cholecalciferol improved their 25-OHD&#xD;
      levels by 6.76 ng/mL more than those taking 5,000 iu daily of the non-emulsified form. The&#xD;
      safety of taking 10,000 IU/day has been confirmed. Taking this dose for 12 weeks should cause&#xD;
      a robust increase in serum 25-OHD. This study will provide preliminary data comparing three&#xD;
      high quality VitD3 supplements, one a powdered capsule, one a chewable tablet, and the other&#xD;
      a lipid-emulsified liquid. Future studies will compare the &quot;better&quot; supplement to&#xD;
      conventional VitD replacement using VitD2.&#xD;
