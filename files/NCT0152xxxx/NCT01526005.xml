  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though the health risks and societal costs of cigarette smoking are well-known, roughly&#xD;
      19.8% of American adults continue to smoke. While most smokers endorse a desire to quit, very&#xD;
      few (&lt; 5%) will actually quit in a given year without treatment, and only about 20-25%&#xD;
      achieve abstinence after 6 months or more of effective treatment. Therefore, there continues&#xD;
      to be a vital need to improve outcomes for cigarette smokers seeking treatment. Current&#xD;
      first-line medications for Tobacco Dependence include nicotine replacement therapies (such as&#xD;
      the patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray, and inhaler), varenicline HCl (Chantix), and bupropion&#xD;
      HCl (Zyban), with the current standard of care in most treatment settings being to choose&#xD;
      specific medications based primarily on availability, ease of use, and patient preference.&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed research is to improve the delivery of smoking cessation treatment&#xD;
      by determining if pre-treatment nicotine receptor density in cigarette smokers is associated&#xD;
      with smoking cessation outcome with the standard nicotine patch taper. The study's main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that cigarette smokers with less pre-treatment upregulation of nicotine&#xD;
      receptors will have a greater likelihood of quitting smoking from a standard course of&#xD;
      nicotine patch treatment than smokers with more up-regulation of these receptors. Positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) will be used to test this hypothesis.&#xD;

        Tobacco dependent cigarette smokers will be recruited through newspaper and internet&#xD;
        advertisements from populations living in the counties surrounding the West Los Angeles&#xD;
        Veterans Affairs Medical Center.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy adult who is a tobacco dependent smoker (smokes 10-30 cigarettes per day)&#xD;
             meeting criteria for Nicotine Dependence as defined by DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has the desire to quit smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to read, write, and give voluntary informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An exhaled CO greater than or equal to 8 ppm during the study screening visit to&#xD;
             verify smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of an Axis I psychiatric diagnosis other than Nicotine Dependence&#xD;
             (including other substance abuse/dependence and mood, anxiety, and psychotic&#xD;
             disorders)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any current medication or any history of a medical condition that might affect the&#xD;
             central nervous system at the time of scanning (e.g., current treatment with a&#xD;
             psychotropic medication, or history of severe head trauma or epilepsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable cardiovascular disease, liver disease, or renal insufficiency. Routine&#xD;
             history and physical examination will be performed at the initial screening visit to&#xD;
             insure that participants meet study criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (urine pregnancy tests will be obtained on all women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential) due to the theoretical risk of radiation exposure to the fetus.&#xD;
             Pre-menopausal women will only be scanned during the early follicular phase (by&#xD;
             participant report) of the menstrual cycle because hormonal levels have been shown to&#xD;
             affect nicotine metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caffeine dependence, as evidenced by withdrawal symptoms temporally associated with&#xD;
             caffeine ingestion.&#xD;
