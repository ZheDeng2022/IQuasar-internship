    <textblock>
      When anesthesiologists perform a regional nerve block, they will often put a catheter - a&#xD;
      flexible plastic tube - in the patient to allow for continuous delivery of local anesthetic.&#xD;
      This allows the nerve(s) to be 'frozen' so that the patient is more comfortable during and&#xD;
      after surgery. The most common method of placing the catheter close to a nerve involves&#xD;
      threading the catheter through a needle which has been inserted under the skin. Because the&#xD;
      catheter is very thin and flexible, it does not thread well through tissue and will buckle&#xD;
      and kink when enough force is applied to it. Another problem is that the puncture hole left&#xD;
      by the needle is larger than the diameter of the catheter, meaning that when the needle is&#xD;
      withdrawn, the catheter is not secure, which increases the chance that it will dislodge and&#xD;
      cause leakage of local anesthetic. One solution to these problems is to use a catheter&#xD;
      placement method similar to how intravenous catheters are installed. In this method, the&#xD;
      catheter fits around ('over') the needle, which results in more support for the catheter&#xD;
      while it is being pushed under the skin. We wish to examine if a catheter-over-needle method&#xD;
      would be useful for placing a catheter to deliver local anesthetic during peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blockade. We will compare the catheter-over-needle method to the currently used&#xD;
      catheter-through-needle method on patients who require continuous anesthetic delivery for&#xD;
      their surgery; half the patients will receive anesthetic through one method, and the other&#xD;
      half will receive anesthetic through the other method. We believe that using the&#xD;
      catheter-over-needle method will result in more secure placement of the catheter and more&#xD;
      efficient delivery of local anesthetic.&#xD;

      Background: Current needle-catheter assemblies are designed so that a flexible catheter is&#xD;
      threaded through a larger diameter needle towards a target nerve. These&#xD;
      catheter-through-needle (CTN) assemblies suffer from several fundamental problems, including&#xD;
      leakage at the insertion site and dislodgement of the catheter. The underlying problem of&#xD;
      this design is that the needle puncture hole is wider in diameter than the catheter diameter.&#xD;
      An alternative catheter-over-needle (CON) design, in which the catheter diameter is larger&#xD;
      than that of the needle puncture hole, may be a potential solution to the problems of leakage&#xD;
      and dislodgement. We wish to evaluate the ease of use and effectiveness of the CON method in&#xD;
      the clinical setting by having anesthesiologists perform and rate the two techniques during&#xD;
      and after administration of local anesthesia at various block sites on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: To compare the ease of use and effectiveness of the CON technique to the CTN&#xD;
      method in delivering continuous local anesthesia during regional nerve blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Insertion of a CON assembly catheter will result in more secure and accurate&#xD;
      catheter placement and more efficient delivery of local anesthetic compared to a catheter&#xD;
      placed using the CTN method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time taken to place catheter near target nerve after initial skin puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confidence in accurate catheter placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of catheter stability at insertion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of anesthetic/fluid leakage at catheter insertion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: This study will involve recruiting patients who are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      surgery that requires a regional nerve block via local anesthetic delivery through a&#xD;
      perineural catheter. We wish to compare the CON and CTN catheterization methods for&#xD;
      delivering local anesthetic during common regional blocks. One hundred patients will be&#xD;
      recruited to assess the usefulness of the CON method in delivering local anesthetic. Patients&#xD;
      in the study group will receive a continuous infusion of local anesthetic through a CON&#xD;
      catheter. Patients in the control group will receive continuous local anesthetic through a&#xD;
      CTN catheter. To make data collection easier, we will perform assessments at several&#xD;
      locations in the Edmonton zone; anesthesiologists at each location will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in performing the blocks and record their assessment of the two catheterization&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, patients will be taken to the regional block area, where they will be&#xD;
      positioned appropriately for the block they are to receive. Under ultrasound guidance, the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist will install either the CON or CTN catheter. Each CTN catheter&#xD;
      will be inserted as per standard procedures; CON catheters will be inserted in a similar&#xD;
      fashion to that used for intravenous catheters. The anesthesiologist will be given Part 1 of&#xD;
      a survey to evaluate the catheterization technique. On this survey, they will record the&#xD;
      duration of time from initial skin puncture to placement of the end of the catheter near the&#xD;
      target nerve and provide a subjective evaluation of how confident they are in the accuracy of&#xD;
      the catheter's placement. Following connection of a continuous infusion of local anesthetic,&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist will record an assessment of catheter stability and incidence of&#xD;
      anesthetic leakage around the catheter insertion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the postoperative period, the anesthesiologist will complete Part 2 of the assessment&#xD;
      survey, which will record their personal opinion on the CON method's ease of use and its&#xD;
      value in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Adult; scheduled for surgery that requires peripheral nerve blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Failure to provide informed consent; allergy to local anesthetic;&#xD;
      neurological pathology and/or deficit in the block region.&#xD;
