      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Chile has the highest diagnosis and death rates of gallbladder cancer in the world.&#xD;
      Gallbladder cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in Chilean women. High rates of&#xD;
      gallstones and obesity, as well as genetic concerns, may explain these high rates.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study gallbladder cancer in more depth in Chile. A small study must be&#xD;
      done to see if a full-scale study is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the methods and procedures of a small-scale study of gallbladder cancer in Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have gallbladder cancer or gallstones, or are&#xD;
           healthy control volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited from four clinical centers in Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Because&#xD;
           gallbladder cancer has a high fatality rate, family members may be asked to provide&#xD;
           additional medical history information if study participants die or become too ill to&#xD;
           provide this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood, urine, stool, hair, fingernail, and saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gallstones, bile, and tissue samples will be collected from those who have gallbladder&#xD;
           removal surgery. Normal and tumor tissue samples will be collected as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol. This is a data collection study&#xD;
           only.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gallbladder cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among women in Chile, which has among&#xD;
      the highest reported gallbladder cancer incidence and mortality rates in the world.&#xD;
      Gallbladder cancer provides a particularly good model for understanding the role of&#xD;
      inflammation in carcinogenesis since the major risk factor, gallstones, causes substantial&#xD;
      inflammation in the gallbladder. Chile also has a high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, which are increasingly understood as inflammatory disorders, but the&#xD;
      extent to which their carcinogenic effects are mediated through inflammatory pathways is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the vast majority of gallbladder cancer cases have gallstones, only a small fraction of&#xD;
&#xD;
      gallstone patients ever develop gallbladder cancer. Since there is no way to identify this&#xD;
      small&#xD;
&#xD;
      proportion at risk, gallstone cases are cholecystectomized, which, given large absolute&#xD;
      numbers of individuals with gallstones, results in overtreatment of some and under-treatment&#xD;
      of others in a high-risk area like Chile. While cholecystectomy is standard treatment for&#xD;
      symptomatic relief, there are more people who need surgery than there are surgeons to perform&#xD;
      them, and individuals aged 34-49 are prioritized for treatment, regardless of symptoms. This&#xD;
      practice may lead to overtreatment among 34-49-year-olds and under treatment of individuals&#xD;
      aged 50 and above since they have to wait longer for surgery. At the same time, about 30% of&#xD;
      patients with a biliary colic attack will never have another attack, and cholecystectomy does&#xD;
      not always lead to the cessation of symptoms. In addition, cholecystectomy has been&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of other digestive diseases. Thus, cholecystectomy may not&#xD;
      be needed in all gallstone patients and may in fact increase the risk of cancer in some.&#xD;
      Better predictors of risk are clearly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with other cancers, dysplasia is an important epidemiologic endpoint as the immediate&#xD;
      precursor to cancer since the vast majority of gallbladder cancers develop through a&#xD;
      histologic continuum of chronic cholecystitis, pseudopyloric metaplasia, incomplete&#xD;
      intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer. Thus, our aim is to identify risk factors for&#xD;
      gallbladder dysplasia and cancer (GDC) and potential non-invasive risk stratification&#xD;
      methods, such as ultrasound characteristics alone or in combination with inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and patient characteristics, to better understand the etiology and natural history of GDC and&#xD;
      to help inform strategies for GDC prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with collaborators at Pontifica Universidad Catolica (PUC), we successfully&#xD;
      completed a pilot study in Chile that was previously reviewed and approved by SAG and&#xD;
      provided baseline data for the proposed study. Our pilot demonstrated high recruitment rates&#xD;
      in the target enrollment area (80%) and high rates of questionnaire completion (100%), blood&#xD;
      collection (78% population-based controls), and participant retention (93% of eligible&#xD;
      completed a follow-up visit). Information from the pilot was used to optimize procedures for&#xD;
      the longitudinal study. We also found that both gallstones and gallbladder cancer were&#xD;
      associated with systemic immune alterations, which as we previously demonstrated, reflect&#xD;
      inflammatory changes in the gallbladder detectable in bile. The next step is to demonstrate&#xD;
      that these markers precedeGDC by longitudinally measuring their levels among gallstone&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to prospectively assess risk factors and early detection markers for GDC by&#xD;
      conducting the Chile Biliary Longitudinal Study (BiLS), a cohort study of 6250 individuals&#xD;
      with gallstones from the high- risk southern-central region of Chile. Because women are twice&#xD;
      as likely to have gallstones and twice as likely to have gallbladder cancer as men, we plan&#xD;
      to maximize our screening efficiency and number of outcomes by screening and enrolling women&#xD;
      only. Since Chile is conducting a general population cohort in a small town in the high-risk&#xD;
      area, will we benefit from the infrastructure that is already in place and be able to compare&#xD;
      the women in our study to a set of men with gallstones enrolled by the Chilean study. We plan&#xD;
      to enroll women with gallstones over 2 years and follow them for 6 years, conducting visits&#xD;
      every other year to collect data on the primary exposures of interest, inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and ultrasound characteristics, as well as additional exposures of interest, such as&#xD;
      infections, genetics, and environmental exposures (e.g., aflatoxin, pesticides). The cohort&#xD;
      will be complemented by an incident case-control study of 300 women with gallbladder cancer&#xD;
      and 600 controls with and without gallstones obtained from the cohort participants.&#xD;
