      The purpose of this trial is to correlate fetal thyroid hormones from fetal cord blood with&#xD;
      clinical (maternal antithyroid drug dose and antithyroid antibodies) and ultrasound (US)&#xD;
      parameters of fetal thyroid function from pregnant mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease&#xD;
      (AITD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is complicated with hypertension, preeclampsia, heart&#xD;
      failure, thyroid storm, preterm labor and stillbirth, while the fetus suffers from&#xD;
      intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), goiter; neonatal prematurity and low birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal hypothyroidism is seen in 2 % of pregnancies. Risks are higher for preeclampsia,&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage, miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and lower IQ score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies, antithyroid drugs and iodine pass to&#xD;
      the fetus. So the fetus may also become a patient. Monitoring fetal growth, fetal heart rate&#xD;
      (tachycardia is a late sign of fetal hyperthyroidism), bone maturation and the size of the&#xD;
      fetal thyroid by ultrasound are important parameters for the assessment of transfer of&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism from mother to the fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion into the study, thyroid function tests (fT4, TSH), and auto-antibodies&#xD;
      assessment (anti TPO, TRAK) were performed once every two months in mothers with AITD, and&#xD;
      from the 24th week of gestation monthly. Treatment was adjusted accordingly. Ultrasound for&#xD;
      fetal size, morphology and fetal heart rate (FHR) was performed once in two months, and from&#xD;
      the 24th week of gestation, monthly. The fetal biophysical profile score was determined&#xD;
      weekly from the 30th week of gestation. The single centre design was chosen: all fetal&#xD;
      sonograms were performed by the same gynecologist. Cardiotocography was performed once weekly&#xD;
      from the 30th week of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal and maternal free thyroxin (fT4) and TSH, thyroid antibodies in mothers and fetal&#xD;
      ultrasound (fetal size, morphology and fetal heart rate) were determined at the same time,&#xD;
      once, from 22nd to 33rd weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Cordocentesis (Cordocentesis is a highly specialized prenatal test in which a&#xD;
      fetal blood sample is removed from the umbilical cord and tested for genetic problems,&#xD;
      hormones or infections. Cordocentesis can be done at 18 weeks of pregnancy or later). Fetal&#xD;
      fT4 and TSH were measured from cord blood samples. Healthy pregnant subjects were directed&#xD;
      for cordocentesis for karyotype analysis due to age (missed previous procedures for&#xD;
      karyotyping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of fetal hypo or hyperthyroidism was established taking into account fT4&#xD;
      concentrations according to the nomograms Thorpee-Beeston et al., 1996, 1991.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When fetal hyperthyroidism is diagnosed, antithyroid drugs given to the mother are&#xD;
      administered or adjusted. When fetal hypothyroidism is diagnosed, then the possibility of&#xD;
      intraamniotic thyroxin application is discussed with the mother.&#xD;
