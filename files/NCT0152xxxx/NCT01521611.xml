  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether a radiolabelled antibody that targets the bone marrow (the 'anti-CD66')&#xD;
      can be administered safely to patients as part of the preparative treatment prior to&#xD;
      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ('a bone marrow transplant'). Can the radiolabelled&#xD;
      antibody be shown to effectively target the bone marrow in these patients. If it can, could&#xD;
      this result in better outcomes after transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical research study is to establish whether a radiolabelled antibody can&#xD;
      be used to safely deliver radiotherapy to the bone marrow prior to stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      for haematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With current chemotherapy regimens 60-90% of adult patients with acute leukaemia (AML and&#xD;
      ALL) achieve a complete remission. However in a significant proportion of these patients the&#xD;
      disease will recur. Although allogeneic and autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood&#xD;
      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are established as effective treatment&#xD;
      options for haematological malignancies, resulting in long term disease free survival in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients, the results of transplantation for patients with poor&#xD;
      risk disease are disappointing. Further intensification of the treatment used prior to&#xD;
      transplantation has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse, but the toxicity of the drugs&#xD;
      or external beam radiotherapy causes an increase in transplant related deaths. The&#xD;
      introduction of reduced intensity conditioning protocols allows the use of HSCT for older&#xD;
      patients or those with significant additional medical problems but retrospective analysis&#xD;
      indicates an increased rate of relapse. This is the 'Transplantation dilemma' - how to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of disease relapse by intensifying therapy, but without an increase in toxicity to&#xD;
      other organs causing an increase in transplant related deaths in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal haematopoietic tissue and the malignant cells arising from it are very radiosensitive.&#xD;
      Theoretically intensification of the conditioning therapy, particularly total body&#xD;
      irradiation (TBI), prior to transplantation could increase tumour reduction leading to&#xD;
      improved disease free survival rates for patients with poor risk disease. Targeted&#xD;
      radiotherapy could allow treatment intensification without the toxicity to non-haematological&#xD;
      tissues. In addition, the continuous, low dose rate delivered by the natural decay of a&#xD;
      targeted radionuclide may have a greater destructive effect upon tumour cells than single&#xD;
      dose or fractionated external beam radiation.&#xD;
