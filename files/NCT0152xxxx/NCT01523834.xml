      Treatment of adult patients with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory to previous CHOP-R (or CHOP-R like regimen) front line therapy, relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory to second or subsequent salvage therapies which included high dose therapy with&#xD;
      autologous stem cell support (ASCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of adult patients with DLBCL relapsed or refractory to front line therapy with&#xD;
      CHOP-R (or CHOP-R like regimen) or subsequent treatments, who are not consider eligible for&#xD;
      ASCT consolidation because of age, co-morbidities, impossibility to perform ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is conducted according to the optimal two-stage design of Simon with alpha 0.05 and&#xD;
      beta 0.10, considering the following two hypotheses: first a response rate (RR) less than 10%&#xD;
      is of no further interest; and second, an RR 30% is clinically meaningful. In the initial&#xD;
      stage, 18 patients have to enter onto the study. If less than 3 responses (&lt;/=2 in 18) will&#xD;
      be observed, the trial would be terminated. Otherwise, accrual will continue to a total of a&#xD;
      maximum of 35 patients. At the end of the trial, if 6 or fewer responses will occur among the&#xD;
      35 patients (&lt;/= 6 in 35), it will be concluded that the regimen is not worthy of further&#xD;
      investigations for that group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is divided in three phases: induction phase (course 1 to 6), consolidation&#xD;
      phase (courses 7 to 12), maintenance phase (from course 13 until the end of therapy for any&#xD;
      reason).&#xD;

      Overview Of Study Design This is a prospective, multicenter phase II trial designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and activity of the panobinostat in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Study design The trial is conducted according to the&#xD;
      optimal two-stage design of Simon with alpha 0.05 and beta 0.10, considering the following&#xD;
      two hypotheses: first a response rate (RR) less than 10% is of no further interest; and&#xD;
      second, an RR 30% is clinically meaningful. In the initial stage, 18 patients have to enter&#xD;
      onto the study. If less than 3 responses (£ 2 in 18) will be observed, the trial would be&#xD;
      terminated. Otherwise, accrual will continue to a total of a maximum of 35 patients. At the&#xD;
      end of the trial, if 6 or fewer responses will occur among the 35 patients (£ 6 in 35), it&#xD;
      will be concluded that the regimen is not worthy of further investigations for that group of&#xD;
      patients. The treatment is divided in three phases: induction phase (course 1 to 6),&#xD;
      consolidation phase (courses 7 to 12), maintenance phase (from course 13 until the end of&#xD;
      therapy for any reason). Study duration This study is expected to start in February 2011. The&#xD;
      last patient is expected to be enrolled at the end of January 2013. Considering a possible&#xD;
      treatment duration of 24 months, this trial is due to be completed by January 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective 1. To explore the antitumor activity of panobinostat in term of overall&#xD;
      response (OR) at the end of the induction phase (i.e. month 6 from the beginning of&#xD;
      panobinostat) Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the antitumor activity of panobinostat in terms of Complete Response (CR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the time to response (TTR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate Progression Free Survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the safety and tolerability of panobinostat&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the Overall Survival (OS) Exploratory objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To study the impact of pharmacogenetics in predicting the response to panobinostat 2. To&#xD;
      study the impact of immunohistochemical patterns and patient's specific gene expression and&#xD;
      response to panobinostat 3. To assess the correlation between &quot;telomeric asset&quot; and response&#xD;
      to panobinostat&#xD;

    <description>The treatment is divided in three phases: induction phase (course 1 to 6), consolidation phase (courses 7 to 12), maintenance phase (from course 13 until the end of therapy for any reason). The duration of a treatment course will be 28 days. The first dose of panobinostat in course 1 defines day 1 of the treatment cycle, and each cycle thereafter will begin 28 days later.&#xD;
Treatment:&#xD;
Panobinostat should be taken p.o. at the dose of 40 mg/day three-times every week (QW) (e.g., on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday), as part of a 4 week (28 days) treatment cycle.</description>

    <description>Induction Phase: Patients will receive panobinostat for 6 courses (1 course = 28 days). Consolidation phase (courses 7-12). Maintenance phase (course 13-end of therapy).&#xD;
Panobinostat should be taken p.o. at the dose of 40 mg/day 3-times every week (QW) as part of a 4 week treatment cycle. The dose of panobinostat may be modified: the 1st dose adjustment consists in the modification of drug administration from 3 times every week (QW) to 3 times every other week (QOW). Levels lower than 30 mg 3 times QOW is not permitted.</description>

Panobinostat: Induction Phase: Patients will receive panobinostat for 6 courses (1 course = 28 days). Consolidation phase (courses 7-12). Maintenance phase (course 13-end of therapy).&#xD;
Panobinostat should be taken p.o. at the dose of 40 mg/day 3-times every week (QW) as part of a 4 week treatment cycle. The dose of panobinostat may be modified: the 1st dose adjustment consists in the modification of drug administration from 3 times every week (QW) to 3 times every other week (QOW). Levels lower than 30 mg 3 times QOW is not permitted.</description>
