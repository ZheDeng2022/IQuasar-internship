  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic control during craniotomies can be a bit hectic specially during periods of&#xD;
      intense noxious stimulation. For long anesthesiologists used high doses of opioids such as&#xD;
      fentanyl and remifentanyl to provide analgesia with a good hemodynamic control during&#xD;
      intraoperative period in patients undergoing craniotomies. However, the use of opioids was&#xD;
      not devoid of side effects. Exploring other anesthetic plans using multiple opioid free&#xD;
      anesthetic adjuvants that have analgesic effects given together in small doses appear to be&#xD;
      appealing plan. This idea is the basis of our proposed study in which we compare the&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects of using opioid free anesthesia versus opioid anesthesia in cranial&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia for craniotomies can be very challenging because of the presence of periods of&#xD;
      noxious stimuli that interposes with periods of little stimulation which makes hemodynamic&#xD;
      control a little bit more complicated. Intraoperative episodes of hypertension during periods&#xD;
      of intense stimulations and early postoperative hypertension may lead to serious&#xD;
      complications as post craniotomy intracranial hemorrhage and vasogenic brain edema.&#xD;
      Anesthetic techniques based on usage of high doses of potent opioid analgesics such as&#xD;
      fentanyl and remifentanil have been widely popular among anesthesiologists. However, the&#xD;
      intra operative use of large bolus doses or continuous infusions of potent opioids may be&#xD;
      associated with postoperative hyperalgesia and increased analgesic consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, concerns have arisen about impaired healing,immunosuppression,and worsening of&#xD;
      oncologic outcomes with systemic opioids. Another technique that started gaining its&#xD;
      popularity is opioid free anesthesia (OFA) technique whose corner stone is depending on&#xD;
      multiple anesthetic adjuvants that have analgesic effects, , therefore when given together in&#xD;
      small doses they result in good anesthesia with less side effects and faster recovery&#xD;
      compared with opioids. This technique has been successfully used in anesthesia for bariatric&#xD;
      surgeries combining multiple drugs as dexmedetomidine, lidocaine, ketamine, ketorolac and&#xD;
      magnesium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, anxiolytic and&#xD;
      analgesic properties that has minimal effects on respiratory drive. Although preoperative&#xD;
      intravenous dexmedetomidine administration is associated with a reduction in postoperative&#xD;
      pain intensity, analgesic consumption and nausea, the analgesic property of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      is less effective compared with opioids. Intravenous lidocaine has been described as having&#xD;
      analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Intravenous lidocaine&#xD;
      infusion in the perioperative period is safe and has clear advantages, such as decreased&#xD;
      intra operative anesthetic requirements, lower pain scores, reduced postoperative analgesic&#xD;
      requirements, as well as faster recovery. In addition to ketamine magnesium is also reported&#xD;
      to enhance analgesia by blocking NMDA receptor, also magnesium has the properties of a&#xD;
      sympatholytic and has been introduced as a safe component of balanced anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This comparative study between Opioid free anesthesia (OFA) and Opioid anesthesia (OA) aims&#xD;
      to compare the effect of both techniques on intra operative hemodynamics, intracranial&#xD;
      tension and recovery in cranial surgeries for supratentorial tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining an informed written consent from the patients or their responsible relative,&#xD;
      patients will be divided into 2 groups randomly using computer software (research&#xD;
      randomizer.org); Opioid free Anesthesia group (OFA) and Opioid Anesthesia group (OA). To&#xD;
      assure blindness, numbers will be concealed by closed envelope, analgesic infusions will&#xD;
      prepared by a clinical pharmacist not included in data collection and the attending&#xD;
      anesthetist will be blinded to the type of analgesic solution injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 10 minutes prior to induction of analgesia patients in the OFA group will receive small&#xD;
      doses of demedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine and magnesium along with ketorlac and&#xD;
      acetaminophen. an infusion afterwards will be administered through the operation containing&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, ketamine and lidocaine. In the OA group, over 10 minutes, patients will&#xD;
      receive a loading dose of fentanyl followed by fentanyl infusion through the operation.&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced using the same drugs and the same parameters in both&#xD;
      groups after the completion of the initial analgesic infusions The primary outcome parameter&#xD;
      will be the percentage of patients experiencing hemodynamic instability at Burr Hole (defined&#xD;
      as recording an increase or decrease of the mean arterial blood pressure by 25 % of the&#xD;
      baseline reading) Assuming the rate of hemodynamic instability (defined as increase or&#xD;
      decrease of the mean blood pressure by 25 % of the baseline reading) would be 40 % in the&#xD;
      control arm, a clinically meaningful reduction of the rate of hemodynamic instability to 10 %&#xD;
      in the investigational arm with a statistical power of 80 % and an alpha error of less than&#xD;
      0.05 would require recruiting 29 patients in each group (a total of 58 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data will be presented as mean + (SD). Categorical variables will be represented&#xD;
      as frequencies and percentages. According to the type of data Comparison between the two&#xD;
      groups will be performed using either Chi square test or Fisher's exact test. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      variables will be compared to baseline using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      with post hoc scheffe's test for positive data. P values less than 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
