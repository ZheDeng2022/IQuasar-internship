  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Managing type 1 diabetes is stressful. Stress physiology influences glucose metabolism.&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitors allow us to track glucose variability in the real-world&#xD;
      environment. Managing stress and cultivating resiliency should improve diabetes management&#xD;
      and reduce glucose variability. The study was designed as a randomized prospective cohort&#xD;
      pre-post study with wait time control. Participants were adult type 1 diabetes patients who&#xD;
      used a continuous glucose monitor and recruited from an academic endocrinology practice. The&#xD;
      intervention was the Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) program conducted over&#xD;
      8 sessions over web-based video conference software. The primary outcome measures were:&#xD;
      Glucose variability, the Diabetes Self-Management questionnaire (DSMQ) and the&#xD;
      Connor-Davidson Resiliency (CD-RISC) instrument.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that the course on videoconferencing platform would deliver&#xD;
      similar effects on quality of life as has been seen in the past from on-site courses, and&#xD;
      that the intervention would reduce glucose variability and improve resiliency Design: This&#xD;
      pilot was designed as a prospective cohort pre-post intervention study with subjects&#xD;
      randomized to an immediate start or wait time control The study was approved by the Committee&#xD;
      for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Dartmouth&#xD;
      College. All participants provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) program&#xD;
      (bensonhenryinstitute.org) is well validated comprehensive stress management program. It is&#xD;
      designed to cultivate both the early recognition of stress in the mind and body, develop&#xD;
      skills to mitigate stress and evoke the relaxation response and cultivate resiliency. It is&#xD;
      an 8 session program, typically run in a live group setting. In this study's case it was&#xD;
      delivered via a videoconferencing platform. This was done both as a means of testing&#xD;
      delivering this service in a rural setting where patient might be geographically distant or&#xD;
      isolated and to accommodate the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Recruitment occurred through the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC)&#xD;
      endocrinology clinic and the endocrinologists working there. Candidates were included if they&#xD;
      had type 1 diabetes and used a continuous glucose monitor. Candidates were excluded if they&#xD;
      were &lt; 21 years old and could not give informed consent. To allow for controlled analysis, on&#xD;
      presentation at each site, participants were randomly assigned to one of two cohorts: 1)&#xD;
      immediate start (A) and 2) delayed start (B). The immediate arm began at the next available&#xD;
      class. The delayed start group began 4 weeks later. During their wait, this group was offered&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
