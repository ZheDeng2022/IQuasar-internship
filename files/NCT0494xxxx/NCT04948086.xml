  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 12% of the world's population have a have a common C677T polymorphism in the&#xD;
      gene encoding the folate metabolising enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).&#xD;
      Homozygosity for the polymorphism (TT genotype) appears to result in an increased requirement&#xD;
      for the B-vitamins folic acid and riboflavin and more importantly results in an increased&#xD;
      risk of developing high blood pressure (BP). Previous work from our Centre has demonstrated&#xD;
      significantly higher BP in those with the TT genotype. This work has been conducted in&#xD;
      cohorts with premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension without overt CVD, but&#xD;
      the effect in younger, healthier individuals is unexplored. To date our studies have also&#xD;
      focused on BP as the primary outcome, but newer markers of vascular health including central&#xD;
      pressure and hemodynamics have emerged as superior prognostic indicators of CVD. The effect&#xD;
      of the TT genotype on these measures is thus an important area for investigation and may help&#xD;
      us understand the mechanism linking the genotype with BP, which is currently unknown. As&#xD;
      adults with the TT genotype appear to have increased requirements for riboflavin and folic&#xD;
      acid, and BP in TT adults appears to be riboflavin dependent, the influence of these vitamins&#xD;
      on central measures is an area for consideration. Study Design This is an observational study&#xD;
      investigating the blood pressure profiles of healthy adults aged 18-65 years, stratified by&#xD;
      MTHFR genotype. Apparently healthy adults will be recruited from workplaces and the general&#xD;
      community across Northern Ireland and screened for the polymorphism via buccal swab. Those&#xD;
      with the TT genotype and a similar number of non-TT (i.e. CC/CT) genotype individuals will be&#xD;
      contacted and asked to come to attend a one-off appointment. Brachial BP will be assessed by&#xD;
      an electronic BP monitor, central BP and central haemodynamics (augmentation index,&#xD;
      augmentation pressure and pulse wave velocity) will be assessed by SphygmoCor XCEL. In&#xD;
      addition, anthropometric measurements, health and lifestyle information and a blood sample&#xD;
      will be obtained. Data will be statistically analysed using SPSS software to if determine&#xD;
      differences between gentoype groups exist.&#xD;
