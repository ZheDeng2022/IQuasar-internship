  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-COV-2 has created an unprecedented health crisis, resulting in unprecedented&#xD;
      mobilization of all hospital professionals. The massive influx of patients overwhelmed the&#xD;
      human, therapeutic and material resources available, and teams were confronted with an&#xD;
      unusually heavy workload in a highly stressful emergency context. These professionals were&#xD;
      thus exposed to a risk of over-investment in a context of acute and repetitive stress over an&#xD;
      indefinite period of time, combining a heavy workload, emotional challenges and specific&#xD;
      ethical issues. These factors simultaneously affected the professional sphere but also the&#xD;
      personal and family spheres (lockdown, risk of contamination). In this context, the mental&#xD;
      health of hospital staff is considered to be more important than ever, as emphasized on&#xD;
      numerous occasions by the Director General of Health and the French Minister for Health and&#xD;
      Solidarity. Mental health involves the way in which individuals respond specifically to&#xD;
      work-related suffering by developing individual and collective defensive strategies. Thus,&#xD;
      the question of the mental health of hospital professionals cannot be considered without&#xD;
      taking into account the strategies implmented to combat stress, and the factors that&#xD;
      contribute or not to the construction and stabilization of the work environment&#xD;
      (collaboration, support).&#xD;
