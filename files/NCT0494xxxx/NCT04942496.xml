  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an evaluation of the irritation potential of 9 test products and 2 control&#xD;
      materials applied to the backs of at least 44 volunteer human subjects over the course of a&#xD;
      96-hour period to determine and compare irritation scores. Subjects will be required to&#xD;
      complete a 7-day pre-test conditioning period prior to the test period. Finn Chambers® on&#xD;
      Scanpor® will be used to apply each test material to a designated site on the skin of the&#xD;
      parascapular region of the upper back every 24 hours for 96 hours. The sites will be&#xD;
      evaluated visually prior to the first patch application and immediately following each patch&#xD;
      removal. Instrument measurements of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) will also be performed&#xD;
      prior to the first patch application and will start between 15 to 30 minutes, following&#xD;
      removal of each patch.&#xD;

             the 48 hours prior to testing through completion of the study.&#xD;

          -  Be receiving any antibiotic medications during the 7-day pre-test period through&#xD;
             completion of the study.&#xD;
