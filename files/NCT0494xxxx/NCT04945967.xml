  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indonesia is the fifth country with the highest number of premature infants in the world.&#xD;
      Research has shown that as many as 40% to 70% of premature infants exhibit both immature and&#xD;
      atypical feeding skills and those requiring respiratory support and those experiencing delays&#xD;
      in beginning oral feeding are most often affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of premature infants have poorly developed suck and swallow mechanisms. The neurological&#xD;
      immaturity, abnormal muscle tone, depressed oral reflexes, and difficulty in regulating&#xD;
      state, can decrease the quality of infant's oral motor skills and the quantity of intake. For&#xD;
      these reasons many high-risk infants are unable to tolerate oral feeding from birth and have&#xD;
      difficulty making the transition from tube feedings to functional oral feeding. This&#xD;
      transition to full oral feeding is an important competency for the infant to attain prior to&#xD;
      discharge home. Delays in discharge are often secondary to feeding difficulties, leading to&#xD;
      increased medical costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently a number of treatment strategies exist to facilitate oral feeding in premature&#xD;
      infants. These include environmental/physical modifications such as eliminating external&#xD;
      stimuli during feedings, using therapeutic nipples to manipulate flow rate, positioning and&#xD;
      swaddling to support the motor system and improve flexion, and oral motor intervention&#xD;
      including Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) stimulation and oral/perioral stimulation. There are&#xD;
      known various methods of oral and perioral stimulations, and one of them is Fucile Oral&#xD;
      Stimulation Program (2002). Recent study claimed that oral stimulations combined with&#xD;
      non-nutritive sucking stimulation in premature infants for at least 10 days period could&#xD;
      facilitate oral feeding ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy of new method that will be studied in this research using a combination of&#xD;
      physiological flexion in therapeutic positioning with specific swaddling techniques, oral&#xD;
      stimulation, stimulation of synergistic movements, and stimulation of non-nutritive sucking&#xD;
      using a special designed pacifier according to the size of premature infant's oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to know the time span required for premature infant to achieve&#xD;
      safe and efficient oral feeding after new method intervention. Therefore, this new method&#xD;
      expectedly can be used as a formula to improve oral feeding ability in premature infant.&#xD;

      This study was designed as a double-blinded and randomized controlled trial, will be held&#xD;
      from August 2021 until August 2022 in several hospitals in Jakarta area: dr. Cipto&#xD;
      Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital, Harapan Kita Women &amp; Children's Hospital,&#xD;
      Bunda Women &amp; Children's Hospital, Pasar Rebo Regional General Hospital, Cengkareng Regional&#xD;
      General Hospital, Eka Hospital BSD, Pondok Indah Hospital, Brawijaya Hospital Antasari, and&#xD;
      Budi Kemuliaan General Hospital. Premature infants who has achieved oral feeding readiness&#xD;
      will be recruited as participants and will be evaluated for oral feeding ability. Participant&#xD;
      will be in semi-upright position, using peristaltic plus for low-birth-weight pacifier in SS&#xD;
      size. The volume of fluids feed will be decided based on neonatologist's assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant is stated to achieve safe and efficient oral feeding if participant is able to&#xD;
      swallow more than 30% of the volume set by the neonatologist for the first 5 minutes at a&#xD;
      rate of more than or equal to 1.5 ml / minute and without signs of aspiration. If the results&#xD;
      of the evaluation show that the participant has not been able to achieve safe and efficient&#xD;
      oral feeding, the participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups for intervention: New&#xD;
      method and Fucile method. The number of sample size calculated for each group is 93 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both interventions will be given once a day (in up to 10 days). After each intervention is&#xD;
      done, participant will be evaluated for safe and efficient oral feeding. If the participant&#xD;
      has already fulfilled the criteria in safe and efficient oral feeding, intervention will end.&#xD;
      If participant has not fulfilled the criteria, intervention will be continued. However, if&#xD;
      the participant became unstable after given each intervention, then intervention will be&#xD;
      halted and will be repeated again in the next feeding schedule. After 3 consecutive trials&#xD;
      and the participant is still unstable while given intervention, then the participant will be&#xD;
      put in drop out category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS ver. 20.0. The level of significance was&#xD;
      set at &lt;0.05. Interim analysis will be conducted in this research and will be done in three&#xD;
      steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basic data analysis for comparing distribution between two intervention groups with&#xD;
           descriptive analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bivariate analysis using chi-square.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression if there are incomparable basic data&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;
