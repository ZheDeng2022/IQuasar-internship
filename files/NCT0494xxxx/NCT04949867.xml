      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy and safety of an insulin-glucagon dual-hormone (DH) closed-loop system&#xD;
      compared with an insulin-only single-hormone (SH) closed-loop system in adolescent with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 26-h, randomized, crossover, inpatient study, 20 children and adolescents with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes used two modes of the DiaCon Artificial Pancreas system: DH and SH closed-loop&#xD;
      control. During each study period, participants will have one overnight stay, received three&#xD;
      meals and performed exercise for 45 min (bicycle with estimated 50% V02max).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is sensor-derived percentage of time in hypoglycemia (&lt;3.9 mmol/L).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon arrival at the research facility at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, the participant's&#xD;
      own pump and CGM are disconnected, and the two study pumps are attached. For dual-hormone&#xD;
      control, the study pumps will be filled with FiAsp® and GlucaGen®. For single-hormone&#xD;
      control, the study pumps have been filled with FiAsp® and isotonic saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants are provided with a blinded wearable activity and sleep monitoring&#xD;
      device (ActiGraph GT9X Link, Pensacola, FL) for activity level estimation and sleep&#xD;
      assessment during study participation. The Actigraph is connected to a Bluetooth® Polar heart&#xD;
      rate monitors during the exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female participants deliver a urine sample for pregnancy testing. A sampling cannula is&#xD;
      placed in an antecubital vein. The CGM will be calibrated with fingerpick glucose meter&#xD;
      (Contour next®, Ascensia Diabetes Care) before initiating the closed-loop control. Even&#xD;
      though it is not needed to calibrate the sensor, the accuracy of the sensor is better after&#xD;
      one calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 1 17:00 the study is initiated, and the closed-loop system takes over glucose control.&#xD;
      Except from the control approach (single- vs. dual-hormone), the study days are identical.&#xD;
      During the study visit, participants can move around freely, but they can only perform actual&#xD;
      exercise during the stationary bike exercise session at day 2 16:30. At nighttime, the&#xD;
      participants are encouraged to be in bed and, if possible, sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At predefined timepoints, the investigators measure blood pressure and pulse, and the&#xD;
      investigators ask the participants to rate their nausea level on a visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      from 1 to 100 to assess possible side effects of glucagon (vomiting rates as 100). In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators ask them to self-rate blood glucose levels before bedtime&#xD;
      (23:00), upon wake-up (07:00-08:00), before each meal, before exercise, and every 10 minutes&#xD;
      during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-hormone and dual-hormone closed-loop control study sessions end 26 hours after study&#xD;
      start. The study pumps and the CGMs are disconnected and the participants reconnect their own&#xD;
      pumps and CGMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study sessions are separated by at least 36 hours.&#xD;

    <masking_description>. For dual-hormone control, the study pumps will be filled with FiAsp® and GlucaGen®. For single-hormone control, the study pumps have been filled with FiAsp® and isotonic saline. Pump filling is conducted before the participant arrives at the research facility. The glucagon/saline pump and the insulin pump are clearly marked and cannot be confused. The participants are blinded to the treatment, as isotonic saline by its looks is indistinguishable from GlucaGen®. The placebo pump ('dummy' pump) will not infuse the saline and cannot be detected by the participant.</masking_description>
