  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether administration of a prebiotic, inulin, can&#xD;
      improve the symptom complex associated with traumatic brain injury and whether inulin&#xD;
      administration can alter the bacteria that live in the gut.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study subjects (aged 18-70 years) with a history of moderate/severe&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (n=10) and healthy controls (aged 18-70 years) (n=10). All subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a 3-month intervention of oral inulin treatment. The traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      subjects will be administered oral inulin twice daily for 3 months. Testing including&#xD;
      cognitive function assessment (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological&#xD;
      Status (RBANS), and questionnaires of fatigue, mood and quality of life and sleep will occur&#xD;
      at month 0, 3 and 6. Blood sampling for measurement of amino acid levels, hormones, short&#xD;
      chain fatty acids and markers of neuroinflammation will be drawn before and 90 minutes (+/-&#xD;
      10 minutes) after a standardized meal will occur at month 0 and month 3. In addition, fecal&#xD;
      samples for analysis of the GI microbiome will be collected at month -1, month 0, month 1,&#xD;
      month 2, month 3, and month 6 along with an assessment of gastrointestinal health. Traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury subjects will be selected from residents at a long term residential&#xD;
      rehabilitation center. Healthy control subjects will be administered oral inulin twice daily&#xD;
      with meals for 3 months. Quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires at months 0, 3&#xD;
      and 6. Blood sampling for measurement of amino acid levels, hormones, short chain fatty acids&#xD;
      and markers of neuroinflammation will be drawn before and 90 minutes (+/- 10 minutes) after a&#xD;
      standardized meal will occur at month 0 and month 3. Fecal samples will be collected at month&#xD;
      -1, month 0, month 3 and month 6 for analysis of the GI microbiome along with an assessment&#xD;
      of gastrointestinal health. A member of the study team will check monthly for adverse events&#xD;
      and overall well-being and ensure compliance and ongoing consent.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Repeatable Battery Assessment for Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a cognitive battery that has been utilized among Traumatic Brain Injury patients. It is comprised of 12 tests that assess five cognitive domains including immediate and delayed memory, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and attention. Immediate memory is assessed by two tests (list learning and story learning), visuospatial/constructional abilities is assessed by two tests (figure copy and line orientation), language is assessed by two tests (picture naming and semantic fluency), attention is two tests (digit span and coding), and delayed memory is assessed by four tests (list recall, list recognition, story recall and figure recall). RBANS raw subtests scores are converted to index standard scores. The RBANS has a mean score of 100 with a Standard Deviation of 15. Scores range from 40 to 160. Only the Traumatic Brain Injury group will undergo cognitive assessment.</description>
