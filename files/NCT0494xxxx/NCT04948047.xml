  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary nodules diagnosis using breath test of volatile organic compound (VOC) is in its&#xD;
      infancy. The accuracy of VOC analysis in diagnosing malignant pulmonary nodules varies cross&#xD;
      the published studies. The diagnosis accuracy of VOC alone is generally poor. We speculate&#xD;
      that the accuracy of diagnosing malignant pulmonary nodules will be improved by combining&#xD;
      breath test with chest computed tomography (CT). This study aims to establish a predictive&#xD;
      model of malignant pulmonary nodule using bio-markers from exhaled breath and image-markers&#xD;
      from chest CT with retrospective data from multi centers. The sensitivity, specificity and&#xD;
      accuracy of the model will be validated prospectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be derived from many different metabolic&#xD;
      pathways. VOCs can be transported to the alveoli through the blood circulation and expelled&#xD;
      by exhalation. Changes in VOCs production, clearance, and alterations in lung air-blood&#xD;
      exchange functions can lead to aberrant VOCs profiles in the exhaled breath. Testing exhaled&#xD;
      breath has the advantages of being completely non-invasive and easy to collect, and has been&#xD;
      considered as a perfect approach for disease diagnoses and therapeutic monitoring. Many&#xD;
      clinical studies have found that VOCs in exhaled breath are closely related to disease&#xD;
      status. Specific VOCs alterations have been identified in many tumors, especially lung&#xD;
      cancer. Pulmonary nodules diagnosis using breath test of volatile organic compound (VOC) is&#xD;
      in its infancy. The accuracy of VOC analysis in diagnosing malignant pulmonary nodules varies&#xD;
      cross the published studies. The diagnosis accuracy of VOC alone is generally poor. We&#xD;
      speculate that the accuracy of diagnosing malignant pulmonary nodules will be improved by&#xD;
      combining VOC analysis with chest computed tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we use a highly sensitive mass spectrometry to detect exhaled VOCs of patients&#xD;
      with pulmonary nodules. The chest CT will be used for detecting the imaging characteristics&#xD;
      of pulmonary nodules. The pathological diagnosis of pulmonary nodules after surgical&#xD;
      resections is selected as golden standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to establish a predictive model of malignant pulmonary nodule using&#xD;
      bio-markers from breath test and image-markers from chest CT with retrospective data from&#xD;
      multi centers. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the model will be varied&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;

        To establish pulmonary nodule diagnosis model of breath test combined with computed&#xD;
        tomography, we reviewed the prospective database established during the study of&#xD;
        NCT04419207 for participant recruitment. 200 participants with malignant pulmonary nodules&#xD;
        and 200 patients with benign pulmonary nodules will be included for establishing the&#xD;
        diagnosis model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To validate the efficacy of the established model in distinguishing malignant pulmonary&#xD;
        nodules from benign nodules, we will prospectively recruit 500 patients with pulmonary&#xD;
        nodules in multi centers: Peking University People's Hospital (200 participants), The First&#xD;
        Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (200 participants), and Beijing Haidian&#xD;
        Hospital (100 participants).&#xD;
