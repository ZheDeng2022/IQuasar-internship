  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a long-term follow-up survey of Japanese people after their second vaccination&#xD;
      with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how the participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to check for long-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
      This will be from 28 days to 12 months after the second vaccination of the COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of visits to the clinic will depend on the clinic's standard practice.&#xD;
