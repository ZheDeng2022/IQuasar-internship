  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the world. Half of patients with such cancer are&#xD;
      treated with radiation therapy. Some patients will develop cutaneous or subcutaneous&#xD;
      fibrosis, more or less bothersome. Several studies have shown a correlation between an&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction and a protein, called TREM-1. But to date, no link has been proven&#xD;
      between TREM-1 and inflammation / fibrosis in the phenomena of fibrosis induced by&#xD;
      radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Our study aims to understand the involvement of&#xD;
      this TREM-1 protein in the development of fibrosis or radio-epidermis in patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
