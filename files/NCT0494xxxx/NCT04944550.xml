  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinomas are rare, aggressive tumors, accounting for 5 to&#xD;
      10% of all urothelial tumors. These include tumors which develop in the renal cavities (renal&#xD;
      pelvis, calices) and ureteral tumors. Nephro-ureterectomy is the standard treatment but 80%&#xD;
      of patients will have a relapse within 2 years. Only one trial has (Birtle et al. 2020), has&#xD;
      shown the interest of postoperative chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant systemic treatment seems&#xD;
      particularly interesting for a population which is going to undergo a nephronic loss and&#xD;
      therefore reduction in kidney function which is likely to make patients ineligible for&#xD;
      cisplatin. In favor of additional immunotherapy, it has been described that upper excretory&#xD;
      tract tumors have a high immunogenic potential with a high rate of microsatellite&#xD;
      instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From surgical samples of patient tumors obtained after nephroureterectomy or biopsy material&#xD;
      collected before treatment, we are going to generate patient-derived cell lines and xenograft&#xD;
      models in the mouse. A recent publication has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach&#xD;
      by specifying that the capture rate of tumor cells is 50% for patient-derived xenografts and&#xD;
      25% for patient-derived cells (Coleman et al. 2020). As tumors harvested from biopsies do not&#xD;
      grow in patient-derived xenografts,we plan to graft the biopsies onto chorioallantoic chicken&#xD;
      embryo membranes, a model which has never been used for this indication and which is one of&#xD;
      the original features of our approach. These three concomitant approaches will allow us to&#xD;
      increase our chances of obtaining stable upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma lines to be&#xD;
      used for the screening and identification of new treatments or new combinations of molecules&#xD;
      that would benefit patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas, knowing that very&#xD;
      few studies dedicated to this type of cancer have been conducted or published due to the&#xD;
      rarity of the disease and the lack of existing models published on the subject of these&#xD;
      particular tumors.&#xD;

      Tumor samples removed by nephroureterctomy will be evaluated at Nîmes University Hospital's&#xD;
      Pathological Anatomy and Cytology Department. Part of the tumors are dissected into 2-3 mm3&#xD;
      fragments and quickly transported in cold Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium or a&#xD;
      phosphate-buffered saline environment to the animal lab for subcutaneous grafting on mice or&#xD;
      to the &quot;Resistance to innovative treatments and therapies&quot; team for soft cell dissociation.&#xD;
      Cell suspensions will then be transported on ice to our collaborators at Inovotion&#xD;
