  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are evaluating longitudinal changes in multiple health, economic, and&#xD;
      environmental outcomes over a 3-year COVID recovery period and in the context of a new light&#xD;
      rail transit (LRT) line, called the Mid-Coast Trolley, among 465 UC San Diego (UCSD) staff.&#xD;
      The primary aim is to evaluate change in objectively measured total and moderate to vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity (MVPA), travel mode, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT).&#xD;

        income (&lt;80% Area Median Income), 50% female, and 50% living within 1 mile of a transit&#xD;
        stop that connects to the Mid-Coast Trolley.&#xD;
