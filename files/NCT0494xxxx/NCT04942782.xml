  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purpose of this trial is to investigate and compare between lumbopelvic stabilization and&#xD;
      pilates exercises on gait cycle phases and maximum peak pressure on the foot in chronic&#xD;
      nonspecific low back pain?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LBP is the leading cause of activity limitation, results in significant losses in&#xD;
      productivity at work, and incurs billions of dollars in medical expenditure annually So, the&#xD;
      aim of physical therapy treatment in the patient with chronic nonspecific low back pain is&#xD;
      more effective in improving gait cycle phases and maximum peak pressure on the foot and help&#xD;
      LBP patients to walk normally as much as possible, also this will improve our body of&#xD;
      knowledge about the best modalities for treating LBP. The finding of this study may help LBP&#xD;
      patients avoid exposure to complications due to altered gait cycle phases and maximum peak&#xD;
      pressure on the foot. Also, it will help physiotherapists to know which treatment will be&#xD;
      effective in improving gait cycle phases and maximum peak pressure on the foot. one hundred&#xD;
      patients with mechanical low back pain will be allocated randomly to three groups; group A&#xD;
      will receive pilates, group B will receive lumbopelvic stabilization exercise and group C&#xD;
      will receive strengthening exercises for the abdominals, back, and hip muscles&#xD;
