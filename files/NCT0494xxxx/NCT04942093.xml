  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem and is constantly on the rise. Therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches based on dietary advice, physical activity and the management of psychological&#xD;
      difficulties are not always sufficient to achieve a lasting weight reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery (or obesity surgery), accompanied by therapeutic education and adequate&#xD;
      medical and dietary monitoring, can lead to significant and lasting weight loss. It is&#xD;
      indicated as a second-line treatment for patients who have failed medical treatment, whose&#xD;
      BMI is greater than or equal to 40 or whose BMI is greater than or equal to 35 with&#xD;
      comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea&#xD;
      syndrome, severe joint disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon may be very bothered by the intra-abdominal fat mass and especially by steatotic&#xD;
      hepatomegaly (increase in the size of the liver and its fat load).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with this problem, various preoperative strategies such as the placement of an intra&#xD;
      gastric balloon have been tried to decrease the size of the liver but a systematic review&#xD;
      from 2016 indicates that a low calorie diet is preferable. Preoperative weight loss can&#xD;
      reduce fat load and liver volume very rapidly. This meta-analysis shows that all low-calorie,&#xD;
      high-protein diets are effective and that the optimal duration (4 weeks), compliance and&#xD;
      tolerance are important factors for success.&#xD;

      Obesity is a major public health problem and is constantly on the rise. Therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches based on dietary advice, physical activity and the management of psychological&#xD;
      difficulties are not always sufficient to achieve a lasting weight reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery (or obesity surgery), accompanied by therapeutic education and adequate&#xD;
      medical and dietary monitoring, can lead to significant and lasting weight loss. It is&#xD;
      indicated as a second-line treatment for patients who have failed medical treatment, whose&#xD;
      BMI is greater than or equal to 40 or whose BMI is greater than or equal to 35 with&#xD;
      comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea&#xD;
      syndrome, severe joint disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon may be very bothered by the intra-abdominal fat mass and especially by steatotic&#xD;
      hepatomegaly (increase in the size of the liver and its fat load).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with this problem, various preoperative strategies such as the placement of an intra&#xD;
      gastric balloon have been tried to decrease the size of the liver but a systematic review&#xD;
      from 2016 indicates that a low calorie diet is preferable. Preoperative weight loss can&#xD;
      reduce fat load and liver volume very rapidly. This meta-analysis shows that all low-calorie,&#xD;
      high-protein diets are effective and that the optimal duration (4 weeks), compliance and&#xD;
      tolerance are important factors for success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no consensus on the benefit/risk balance of a preoperative diet and there&#xD;
      is considerable variability in approach at national and international level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical study involves a triad of dietician, surgeon, physician&#xD;
      (endocrinologist/nutritionist or internist) to secure this diet. It could provide a database&#xD;
      to help estimate the risk of undernutrition in the obese subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This diet, designed to facilitate the surgical procedure and potentially reduce&#xD;
      intraoperative complications, is inexpensive, easily accessible and reproducible by other&#xD;
      teams. This innovative management could standardise the preoperative management of patients&#xD;
      undergoing bariatric surgery at national level. It would also improve the results of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery both in the short term by reducing complications and in the long term by&#xD;
      increasing weight reduction as reported in the Livhits meta-analysis. The risk of&#xD;
      undernutrition should be reduced by this hypocaloric hyperprotein diet and consequently&#xD;
      cancel out the increased risk of mortality, infections, delayed healing, longer hospital stay&#xD;
      and the costs that this would entail.&#xD;
