  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmic disease that increases especially in the elderly,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of ischemic stroke by 5 times and is a major cause of dementia and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive dysfunction accompanying AF occurs regardless of the presence or absence of stroke,&#xD;
      and AF itself is known to affect cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since cognitive dysfunction is also affected by various accompanying chronic&#xD;
      diseases, whether the cognitive dysfunction accompanying AF is due to subclinical ischemic&#xD;
      stroke, cerebral hypoperfusion due to reduced cardiac output, inflammatory reaction or&#xD;
      platelet dysfunction are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, this research team reported an improvement in cognitive function with active sinus&#xD;
      rhythm therapy such as AF catheter ablation. Nevertheless, it has not yet been proven whether&#xD;
      such active and invasive AF treatment affects the improvement of cognitive function or&#xD;
      depression by a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective randomized clinical comparative study, the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      AF catheter ablation group and drug therapy group in terms of cognitive function tests and&#xD;
      depression psychological tests at baseline and a year after treatment. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      AF catheter ablation is superior to drug therapy to improve cognitive function and depressive&#xD;
      mood.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective randomization (catheter ablation group vs. drug treatment group) (Python&#xD;
           program is used, the random number module is imported using the import random syntax,&#xD;
           and the random number table of the two groups is prepared and used)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Target number of targets 320 (160 for each group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cardiac rhythm follow-up: 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (baseline, 3 months, every 6&#xD;
           months after Holter, Electrocardiogram when symptoms are present)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anticoagulant therapy follows 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation of MOCA score (cognitive function), CES-D score (depression), and GAD-7 score&#xD;
           (anxiety) at baseline and a year after treatment, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluation of all adverse events occurring in each group, hospitalization rate, major&#xD;
           cardiovascular attack, and mortality rate comparison&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress and rhythm/ ECG follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implemented in accordance with 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline MOCA, CES-D, and GAD-7 score evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outpatient follow-up observation 1 to 2 weeks after the start of the procedure or&#xD;
           medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up observation at intervals of 2 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months after&#xD;
           starting the procedure or medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If the patient complains of arrhythmia symptoms, conduct an electrocardiogram at any&#xD;
           time, and follow the rhythm with a Holter or event recorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow-up MOCA, CES-D, and GAD-7 score evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up observation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients are scheduled to visit the outpatient clinic every 6 months after 1~2&#xD;
           weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and even if they have symptoms in the middle, they will be&#xD;
           treated as an outpatient at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECG is administered at every outpatient visit. A 24-hour Holter or event recorder was&#xD;
           administered for 1 year at intervals of 2, 6, and 6 months after the procedure (2012&#xD;
           Heart Rhythm Society/EHRA/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society Expert Consensus Statement&#xD;
           guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia lasting more than 30 seconds is observed on&#xD;
           a standard electrocardiogram, event electrocardiogram, or Holter, it is evaluated as&#xD;
           recurrence. Recurrence within 3 months after the procedure is classified as early&#xD;
           recurrence, and recurrence after 3 months is classified as clinical recurrence.&#xD;
