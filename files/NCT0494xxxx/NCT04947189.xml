      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers&#xD;
      and is defined by the absence of immunostaining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone&#xD;
      receptor (PR), and non-amplified HER2 expression. Patients with metastatic TNBC exhibit a&#xD;
      particularly poor clinical outcome, generally with rapid progression and a median overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) rate of approximately 16 months. The current standard of care in the treatment&#xD;
      of TNBC is cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunotherapy and the development of well-tolerated,&#xD;
      effective, and targeted regimens that delay the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy and its side&#xD;
      effects is an unmet need. Understanding breast cancer heterogeneity has enabled investigators&#xD;
      to identify novel targets for the development of new therapeutic interventions. The androgen&#xD;
      receptor (AR) is one such target. AR is expressed in 70-90% of all invasive breast cancers.&#xD;
      Emerging data suggest that the AR-signalling pathway may play a critical role in breast&#xD;
      cancer pathogenesis. Seviteronel is an orally bioavailable, selective cytochrome P450c17a&#xD;
      (CYP17) lyase (lyase) and AR inhibitor. It is approximately 10-fold more selective for CYP17&#xD;
      lyase versus CYP17 17-α hydroxylase (hydroxylase) inhibition. Seviteronel inhibits the AR&#xD;
      through competitive antagonism of both wild-type and mutated forms of the receptor. Through&#xD;
      this unique, dual mechanism of action, it inhibits androgen production, thus reducing&#xD;
      downstream estrogen aromatization from androgens, while also inhibiting AR binding and&#xD;
      activation. In our own unpublished work, the investigators have shown that AR expression is&#xD;
      often present in the cytoplasm of TNBC cells. When scoring patient samples for cytoplasmic&#xD;
      AR, the investigators observed that ~cytoplasmic AR was present in 20% of TNBC patient&#xD;
      tumours. This suggests that AR-targeted therapies may be beneficial for a far greater number&#xD;
      of TNBC patients than is represented by the traditionally defined triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer AR subtype alone. Seviteronel has been shown to inhibit the growth in multiple breast&#xD;
      cancer models, both in vitro and in vivo. Three early-phase prospective clinical studies&#xD;
      investigating anti-androgen therapy have demonstrated clinical benefit of single-agent&#xD;
      AR-targeted agents in women with metastatic AR positive TNBC. In our preliminary laboratory&#xD;
      data (unpublished) demonstrates an increase in survival and suppression of metastatic TNBC&#xD;
      when seviteronel is used in combination with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of seviteronel and dexamethasone (SEVI-D)&#xD;
      in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. This study is&#xD;
      conducted in two parts: part 1: dose exploration, and part 2: dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEVI-D and chemotherapy (docetaxel) in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic breast cancer and determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for&#xD;
      SEVI-D/docetaxel combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SEVI-D and chemotherapy&#xD;
      (docetaxel) in metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Androgen receptor-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SEVI-D and chemotherapy&#xD;
           (docetaxel).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the clinical activity SEVI-D and chemotherapy (docetaxel) in participants&#xD;
           with cytoplasmic androgen receptor-positive metastatic triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Dose exploration - 6- 18 patients based on a rolling 6 design Part 2: Dose expansion&#xD;
      - 35-45 patients in a single arm two-stage investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Patients with metastatic breast cancer. Part 2: Patients with cytoplasmic AR-positive&#xD;
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer confirmed by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Seviteronel will be administered orally beginning with 450 mg (3 x 150 mg tablets)&#xD;
      once daily along with 0.5 mg dexamethasone, continuously in 28-day cycles with docetaxel&#xD;
      75mg/m2 administered intravenously 3 weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: The recommended phase 2 dose for seviteronel (established in Part 1) once daily along&#xD;
      with 0.5 mg dexamethasone, continuously in 21-day cycles with docetaxel 75mg/m2 administered&#xD;
      intravenously 3 weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for participation includes review of patient history, current health status,&#xD;
      availability of a biospecimen for AR screening and patient willingness to be in a trial if&#xD;
      eligible. Clinical and safety assessments are scheduled prior to registration and every 8&#xD;
      weeks until death. Imaging and other response assessments are required at baseline and every&#xD;
      2 cycles from cycle 1 day 1 until progression. Blood collection for translational studies&#xD;
      will occur at: baseline (collected within 21 days prior to registration) or within 28 days of&#xD;
      C1D1 treatment, every 2nd cycle and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
