      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other well-known&#xD;
      hospitals in China. Aims at evaluating effectiveness and safety of avatrombopag in the&#xD;
      treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia.&#xD;

      The investigators are undertakingSingle-arm, multi-Centre, Observational study of 400&#xD;
      Patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University&#xD;
      and other well-known hospitals in China. ITP patients will be given one tablet (20 mg) of&#xD;
      avatrombopag daily.If the platelet count is higher than 150×10^9/L, the dose should be&#xD;
      reduced. Prolonged dosing intervals or a combination of reduced daily dose are preferred.If&#xD;
      the drug was taken for ≥1 week and the platelet count was still less than 30×10^9/L, the&#xD;
      dosage should be increased. The maximum dose is 40 mg daily. Aplatelet count,AE, laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, ECG, vital signs and other symptoms will be evaluated before and after treatment.&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
