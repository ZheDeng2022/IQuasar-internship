    <textblock>
      Analysis of the efficacy, maintenance of efficacy, long-term safety, and investigation of the&#xD;
      potential for dependence and abuse and the effect of abrupt drug withdrawal of VER-01 in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with chronic non-specific low back pain when drug treatment is&#xD;
      indicated and previous optimised treatments with non-opioid analgesics have not led to&#xD;
      sufficient pain relief or were unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into four phases: Phase A, B, C and D. All patients who have completed&#xD;
      Phase A and for whom the investigator considers further participation to be safe shall begin&#xD;
      Phase B. Phases C and D run in parallel, so that patients who have completed Phase B and for&#xD;
      whom the investigator considers further participation to be safe can be assigned to one of&#xD;
      the two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases A and D follow a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, while Phase B and C have an&#xD;
      open-label design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of Phase A is to demonstrate the efficacy of VER-01 compared to placebo. In&#xD;
      Phase B and C the main goal is the investigation of long-term safety of VER-01. In Phase D&#xD;
      the primary objective is to demonstrate the maintenance of efficacy of VER-01 on a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for dependence and abuse will be analyzed in all Phases (A,B,C,D), while the&#xD;
      effect of abrupt drug withdrawal of VER-01 will be analyzed in Phase C and D.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase D: Maintenance of efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks (from date of randomization R2 until the first day of treatment failure)</time_frame>
    <description>Time until treatment failure defined as the time in days from randomization to phase D (R2) until the first day of treatment failure. Treatment failure is assessed by the daily calculated seven-day mean value of the pain score (11 point Numerical Rating Scale, NRS, where 0=no pain to 10=worst pain imaginable) in the morning during the treatment period, which must have deteriorated by at least 20% and at least one point compared to baseline (mean value of study week 43). The first day of treatment failure is then the earliest day within this seven-day time window to which this criterion applies as a single day. Furthermore, treatment failure is defined as a premature discontinuation of treatment for selected reasons.</description>
