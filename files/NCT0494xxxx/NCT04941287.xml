  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of combining two immune therapies, atezolizumab&#xD;
      and CDX-1127 (varlilumab), with or without cobimetinib, in treating patients with biliary&#xD;
      tract cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Varlilumab is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody specific for a molecule called CD27 and may lead to growth inhibition of&#xD;
      CD27-expressing tumor cells upon administration. Cobimetinib is in a class of medications&#xD;
      called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals&#xD;
      cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Giving&#xD;
      atezolizumab in combination with varlilumab and cobimetinib may work better than atezolizumab&#xD;
      and varlilumab alone in treating patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the response rate (ORR) of patients with unresectable, pre-treated biliary&#xD;
      cancers treated with the combination of atezolizumab and CDX-1127 (varlilumab) with or&#xD;
      without cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with unresectable, pre-treated&#xD;
      biliary cancers treated with the combination of atezolizumab and CDX-1127 (varlilumab) with&#xD;
      or without cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of combination of atezolizumab and CDX-1127&#xD;
      (varlilumab) with or without cobimetinib in patients with unresectable, pre-treated biliary&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall survival (OS) of patients with unresectable, pre-treated biliary&#xD;
      cancers treated with the combination of atezolizumab and CDX-1127 (varlilumab) with or&#xD;
      without cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effect of combination atezolizumab and CDX-1127 (varlilumab)&#xD;
      +/-cobimetinib on T cell subpopulations systemically and intratumorally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the effect of atezolizumab and CDX-1127 (varlilumab) +/- cobimetinib on local&#xD;
      and systemic immune activation pathways, immune suppressive pathways, and cytokine/chemokine&#xD;
      signaling in peripheral blood and within the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether atezolizumab and CDX-1127 (varlilumab) clearance at baseline and over&#xD;
      time correlate with clinical outcomes (ORR, PFS and OS) and the presence of cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess immunogenicity by monitoring for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to&#xD;
      both atezolizumab and CDX-1127 (varlilumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, atezolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15, and varlilumab IV over 90 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and varlilumab IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until death,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or study closure.&#xD;

Exploratory analysis of the molecular markers, including visualizations and statistical summaries such as hierarchical cluster analysis, heat maps, multidimensional scaling, and principle component analysis will offer important views of the structural characteristics of the expression data.</description>

             composition to atezolizumab, cobimetinib, or CDX-1127 (varlilumab)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are considered moderate to&#xD;
             strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A and are not able to switch to an alternative&#xD;
             that minimizes interaction potential will ineligible. Coadministration of cobimetinib&#xD;
             with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor can increase cobimetinib systemic exposure&#xD;
             significantly (e.g. itraconazole increased serum systemic cobimetinib exposure by 6.7&#xD;
             fold). On the other end, coadministration of cobimetinib with a strong CYP3A inducer&#xD;
             may decrease cobimetinib systemic exposure by more than 80% thus reducing its&#xD;
             efficacy. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important&#xD;
             to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical reference texts such as the&#xD;
             Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
