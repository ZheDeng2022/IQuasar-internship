  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Employment is a key protective factor against recidivism; however, the lack of job&#xD;
      opportunities keeps justice-involved mentally ill individuals, especially young adults of&#xD;
      color, unemployed and at risk for future justice involvement. To address these issues and&#xD;
      grow the evidence for evidence-based practices for justice-involved adults with mental&#xD;
      illnesses, the investigators will study the implementation and outcomes of individual&#xD;
      placement support-supported employment (IPS-SE) combined with specialty mental health&#xD;
      probation (SMHP) for probationers with mental illnesses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The large and growing number of individuals with mental illnesses who are on probation have a&#xD;
      difficult time accessing housing, employment, and health and mental health care, which is&#xD;
      especially concerning for young adults aged 19-25 who make up just 10% of the population but&#xD;
      26% of those on probation. Employment is a key protective factor against recidivism; however,&#xD;
      the lack of job opportunities keeps justice-involved mentally ill individuals, especially&#xD;
      young adults of color, unemployed and at risk for future justice involvement. Without access&#xD;
      to evidence-based supported employment interventions, economic inequality and poverty among&#xD;
      justice-involved young adults with mental illnesses will remain unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, an experienced multidisciplinary team will study the implementation and outcomes&#xD;
      of individual placement support-supported employment (IPS-SE) combined with specialty mental&#xD;
      health probation (SMHP) for probationers with mental illnesses. The investigators' long-term&#xD;
      goal is to develop the evidence for interventions designed to improve employment outcomes&#xD;
      among justice-involved individuals who have mental illnesses and conduct translational&#xD;
      research with broad application to justice-involved individuals living with mental illnesses.&#xD;
      The investigators will pursue the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the barriers and facilitators to implementing IPS-SE in a probation setting.&#xD;
      The investigators will use qualitative methods and semi-structured interviews with key&#xD;
      stakeholders involved in the implementation of SMHP+IPS-SE to understand how IPS-SE can be&#xD;
      embedded successfully in a probation setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct a randomized trial to examine the impact of the SMHP+IPS-SE on employment and&#xD;
      annual income for probationers with mental illnesses. The investigators will randomly assign&#xD;
      120 individuals to receive SMHP + treatment as usual (TAU) or SMHP+IPS-SE. The research team&#xD;
      will test the following hypothesis - H1: SMHP+IPS-SE recipients will be more likely to obtain&#xD;
      and sustain employment compared to SMHP+TAU recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcomes include: (1) an understanding of the implementation barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators associated with providing IPS-SE in a probation setting; (2) an understanding of&#xD;
      how IPS-SE needs to be adapted for probationers with mental illnesses; and (3) evidence that&#xD;
      SMHP+IPS-SE can improve employment outcomes among justice-involved probationers with mental&#xD;
      illnesses. This research has the potential to promote the adoption and dissemination of best&#xD;
      practices at the interface of the mental health and criminal justice systems and promises to&#xD;
      grow the evidence for interventions that improve employment and reduce economic inequalities&#xD;
      among a vulnerable population.&#xD;

Researchers with a convincing scientific interest in the data will be eligible to receive the data. The data-sharing agreement will provide for the use of the data only for research and no other purpose, require a plan for the security of the data, forbid the further dissemination of the data without entering into an agreement, and provide a deadline for the completion of analyses and destruction of the data. Data will be made available under the auspices of the PIs by secure file transfer protocols or other secure, industry-approved means.</ipd_description>
