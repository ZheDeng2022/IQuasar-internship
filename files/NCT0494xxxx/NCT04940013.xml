  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Missed Period Pill Study is a prospective observational study among people who decide to&#xD;
      use misoprostol alone for menstrual regulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the number of state laws restricting access to abortion increases across the country, more&#xD;
      creative methods are needed to support individuals in achieving their reproductive goals.&#xD;
      Misoprostol alone for people who suspect, but have not confirmed pregnancy, has the potential&#xD;
      to fulfill this growing need. The goal of this research study is to test a traditional but&#xD;
      underutilized framework of menstrual regulation for pregnancy loss, to &quot;bring back&quot; a period&#xD;
      when it is missed. This study will aim to recruit 100 patients who have a missed period to&#xD;
      address research questions that focus on the feasibility and acceptability of using&#xD;
      misoprostol alone for menstrual regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require 1 study visit and 1 telehealth visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First study visit: A urine sample will be collected which will later undergo pregnancy&#xD;
      testing. Participants will be given misoprostol along with instructions and information on&#xD;
      what to expect. The participant will be required to return to the clinic 4 weeks later to&#xD;
      provide another urine sample. The participant will not know the results of the first visit's&#xD;
      pregnancy test at any point. The clinic staff member administering the participant's care&#xD;
      will not know of the pregnancy test result while the participant is at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telehealth visit: The second visit will be by phone or video. The participant will conduct a&#xD;
      pregnancy test and inform the research staff of the result. The participant will then be&#xD;
      asked to answer questions on an online survey about their experience using misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of clinical and social science measures will be collected to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of this traditional concept of menstrual regulation utilizing uterine&#xD;
      evacuation with medications.&#xD;
