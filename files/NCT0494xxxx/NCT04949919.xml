      The end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leading two causes of death are cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      and sepsis. Exercise improves low physical fitness, available research concerning its effect&#xD;
      on the pro-/anti-inflammatory immune response is scarce. In the current proposal, physical&#xD;
      fitness is classified into cardiopulmonary fitness and muscle fitness. Muscle fitness is&#xD;
      further divided into three domains: strength, mass, and oxidative capacity. The 3-year&#xD;
      proposal plan to recruit 90 patients with ESRD who receive regular HD for more than 6 months.&#xD;
      Every participant will go through 3 phases：control phase、training phase and the maintenance&#xD;
      phase (within-subject design). The hypothesis of the proposal is as follows. (I) When&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness/muscle fitness drops to a certain level, the inflammatory immune&#xD;
      response will rise. The proposal aims to find the best biomarkers and their cut-off points&#xD;
      among the various indicators of cardiopulmonary and muscle fitness that reflect immune&#xD;
      dysregulation. (II) Other than physical fitness, cyclic aerobic and resistance training&#xD;
      improves pro-/anti-inflammatory immune dysregulation. Additionally, three months after&#xD;
      cessation of training, a thorough assessment will be performed to examine whether a healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behavior modification has been achieved and whether the beneficial effect of&#xD;
      physical fitness and immune regulation induced by the training program is maintained. The&#xD;
      goal of each year is as follows. FIRST year: To explore the relationship between&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness and pro-/anti-inflammatory immune response in ESRD patients under HD;&#xD;
      SECOND year: To explore the relationship between muscle fitness and pro-/anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      immune response; THIRD year: To evaluate the effects of cyclic aerobic and resistance&#xD;
      training on physical fitness and pro-/anti-inflammatory immunomodulation in ESRD patients&#xD;
      under HD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, there are more than 90 thousand patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      receiving hemodialysis (HD) island-wide. The leading two causes of death are cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases and sepsis. Though evidence is clear that exercise training in this population is&#xD;
      beneficial to fitness、quality of life、morbidity, it is seriously underuse. Poor physical&#xD;
      fitness is known to associate with high-leveled systemic inflammation and immune&#xD;
      dysregulation but the detailed relationship remains unclear in the ESRD population. Moreover,&#xD;
      though exercise improves low physical fitness, available research concerning its effect on&#xD;
      the pro-/anti-inflammatory immune response is scarce. In the current proposal, physical&#xD;
      fitness is classified into cardiopulmonary fitness and muscle fitness. Muscle fitness is&#xD;
      further divided into three domains: strength, mass, and oxidative capacity. The 3-year&#xD;
      proposal plan to recruit 90 patients with ESRD who receive regular HD for more than 6 months.&#xD;
      Every participant will go through 3 phases：control phase、training phase and the maintenance&#xD;
      phase (within-subject design). In the control phase, no exercise education or training will&#xD;
      be given to the participants. In the training phase, the participants will receive&#xD;
      in-hospital supervised exercise training prior to HD. The training program will last 6 months&#xD;
      and about 60 training sessions in total. The training protocol contains cyclic aerobic&#xD;
      training in moderate-intensity and high-intensity interval training plus isokinetic&#xD;
      resistance training. In the following maintenance phase, home-based exercise training will be&#xD;
      educated. The control and maintenance phases are 1-2 and 3 months respectively in duration.&#xD;
      Before and after each phase and in the middle of the training phase (5-time points totally),&#xD;
      every participant will receive a thorough evaluation as follows: CPET with noninvasive&#xD;
      cardiac output monitor, isokinetic strength testing, handgrip strength, muscle oxidative&#xD;
      capacity, body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, Chinese Kidney Disease and&#xD;
      Quality of Life questionnaire and international physical activity questionnaire and blood&#xD;
      sampling for pro-/anti-inflammatory markers, including chemokine, cytokine, immune cells, and&#xD;
      immuno-regulatory microRNAs, etc. The hypothesis of the proposal is as follows. (I) When&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness/muscle fitness drops to a certain level, the inflammatory immune&#xD;
      response will rise. The proposal aims to find the best biomarkers and their cut-off points&#xD;
      among the various indicators of cardiopulmonary and muscle fitness that reflect immune&#xD;
      dysregulation. (II) Other than physical fitness, cyclic aerobic and resistance training&#xD;
      improves pro-/anti-inflammatory immune dysregulation. Additionally, three months after&#xD;
      cessation of training, a thorough assessment will be performed to examine whether a healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behavior modification has been achieved and whether the beneficial effect of&#xD;
      physical fitness and immune regulation induced by the training program is maintained. The&#xD;
      goal of each year is as follows. FIRST year: To explore the relationship between&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness and pro-/anti-inflammatory immune response in ESRD patients under HD;&#xD;
      SECOND year: To explore the relationship between muscle fitness and pro-/anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      immune response; THIRD year: To evaluate the effects of cyclic aerobic and resistance&#xD;
      training on physical fitness and pro-/anti-inflammatory immunomodulation in ESRD patients&#xD;
      under HD.&#xD;
