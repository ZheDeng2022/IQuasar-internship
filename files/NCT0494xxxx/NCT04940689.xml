  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of morphine derivatives is widespread for performing general anesthesia. However,&#xD;
      opioids have their own side effects: respiratory depression, digestive ileus, cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, postoperative hyperalgesia, nausea-vomiting or even negative effects on&#xD;
      inflammation or adrenal function. The advent of new molecules, with analgesic properties that&#xD;
      do not pass through opioid receptors, has allowed the emergence of the concept of anesthesia&#xD;
      without morphine (opioid free anesthesia OFA). These molecules are essentially:&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine. Thus, the use of ketamine is currently recommended in&#xD;
      the event of major surgery in order to limit postoperative pain and hyperalgesia. Likewise,&#xD;
      the use of dexmedetomidine in place of an opioid during bariatric surgeries has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce postoperative pain and intraoperative hemodynamic manifestations. In addition, it&#xD;
      would also reduce the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis even suggested a decrease in length of stay, mechanical ventilation, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and mortality with the use of dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period. The&#xD;
      combined use of various non-morphine analgesic molecules therefore opens the way to&#xD;
      anesthesia without morphine, and a French multicenter study on this strategy in general&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery is currently underway. Cardiac surgery is characterized by significant&#xD;
      postoperative pain, a high incidence of cognitive dysfunction, and frequent and sometimes&#xD;
      significant respiratory complications. An OFA strategy could therefore be beneficial to these&#xD;
      patients, but no study has yet addressed the subject.&#xD;

      The objective of our work is therefore to assess the beneficial effects of OFA versus&#xD;
      strategy with intraoperative opioids on postoperative complications related to opioids.&#xD;

    <description>General anesthesia strategy with morphine:&#xD;
Within 10 minutes before the induction of general anesthesia: administration of a placebo of 50 mL of 0.9% NaCl by slow IV&#xD;
The anesthetic induction will be carried out by an intravenous hypnotic (propofol or etomidate) combined with IV curare and remifentanil (morphine derivative) IV for a concentration target of 3-6 ng / mL.&#xD;
Maintenance of anesthesia will be carried out with propofol or a halogenated gas (sevoflurane or desflurane) in continuous administration (qs bispectral index 40-60) and remifentanil (target concentration 1-10 ng / mL). The administration of curare will be carried out as needed. In order to anticipate the sudden end of the analgesia, an administration of morphine 0.15 mg / kg IV will be carried out 30 minutes before the end of the intervention as recommended</description>
