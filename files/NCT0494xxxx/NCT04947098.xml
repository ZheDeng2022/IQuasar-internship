  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevent Cancer-Greenville was created to provide individuals with the opportunity to have&#xD;
      their risk of developing cancer studied. Some individuals may be at a higher risk due to&#xD;
      their personal lifestyle, family history and/or exposures. If subjects are found to be at&#xD;
      high risk for developing a disease, they will be sent to a healthcare provider for further&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Participants' personal history, lifestyle behaviors and blood, urine, and cheek swab&#xD;
      specimens will be used to detect changes or trends that might put them at risk for developing&#xD;
      cancer. Some individuals may be at an above average risk of cancer due to lifestyle, family&#xD;
      background, personal genetic makeup, or environmental exposures. This will be determined by a&#xD;
      process called risk stratification. Risk stratification involves looking at all&#xD;
      health-related aspects of a person, determining their individualized risk through screening,&#xD;
      and educating them on measures to reduce potential for disease. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      yearly health assessment which includes measurements for nutrition, activity, individual risk&#xD;
      factors and body composition, including weight height and a special scale which measures&#xD;
      fluid and fat.&#xD;
