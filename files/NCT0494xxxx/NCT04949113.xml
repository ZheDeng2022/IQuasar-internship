  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international (Australia, Europe, and USA) open-label two-arm randomized phase 3&#xD;
      trial including 420 stage III (â‰¤3 resectable in-transit metastases allowed) cutaneous or&#xD;
      unknown primary melanoma patients. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 2 cycles&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant ipilimumab 80 mg + nivolumab 240 mg every 3 weeks followed by a total lymph&#xD;
      node dissection (TLND) and, if applicable, resection of in-transit metastases (arm A) versus&#xD;
      standard upfront TLND +/- resection of in-transit metastases followed by 12 cycles adjuvant&#xD;
      nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks (arm B). Patients not achieving a pathologic response in arm A&#xD;
      will also receive adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for 46 weeks (11 cycles). In case&#xD;
      of BRAF V600E/K mutation-positivity, patients from arm A not achieving a pathologic response&#xD;
      (&gt;50% viable tumor) will be treated with adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib for 46 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated in the study in both arms until melanoma progression to irresectable&#xD;
      stage III or stage IV disease, disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent or until end of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be performed after 60 events have occurred. The data safety monitory&#xD;
      board (DSMB) will be ad hoc consulted when unexpected toxicities are reported. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed by 12 weekly CT scans until end of year 3 and then until year 5 according to the&#xD;
      institute's standards.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Analysis will be performed after 132 events, though not later than after 2 years follow-up of all patients.</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as time from randomization to melanoma progression (irresectable stage III or stage IV disease), melanoma recurrence, treatment-related death, or melanoma-related death, whichever occurs first. Occurrence of a new primary melanoma during treatment/follow-up is also regarded as an event. Presurgical resectable progression to stage III disease in arm A is not defined as an event, even as death to another reason than melanoma or the study treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life as measured by EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-core 30 (QLQ C30). The QLQ-C30 is scored on 4 point Likert-scales: &quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;A little&quot;, &quot;Quite a bit&quot;, and &quot;Very much.&quot; and is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
