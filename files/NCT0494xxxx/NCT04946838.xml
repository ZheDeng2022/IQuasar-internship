  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive electro-physical&#xD;
      modality used for several pain conditions including labor pain control. Despite several years&#xD;
      of research, there is still no agreement within the literature regarding the selection of&#xD;
      TENS parameters. It is aimed to investigate TENS1 alternating between 4 to 100 Hz compared to&#xD;
      sham-TENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to evaluate TENS in combination with cardiotocography (CTG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of TENS with CTG in a feedback-loop has not been reported in any studies&#xD;
      before.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Midwives and the study investigator will ask parturients, who are admitted to the labor ward&#xD;
      at Region Hospital Herning satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, whether they are&#xD;
      interested in attending the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as soon as the subject is admitted at the labor ward. The study&#xD;
      will only be conducted during early and active labor and not during the birth of the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject in this study includes the package of a parturient and her neonate (after birth)&#xD;
      as we also obtain data about the neonate. Hereby, two consent forms will be obtained. As this&#xD;
      study is a non-invasive study, it is decided to have at least the consent of one parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will fill out a screening questionnaire about the laboring parturient in&#xD;
      cooperation with the subject and the midwife, including screening questions related to&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria before the experimental session starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last approximately one hour and will be conducted during laboring&#xD;
      circumstances. KT (Kenoja Thuvarakan) will carry out the experiment, and she will be present&#xD;
      in the delivery room during the whole session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes several outcomes, including subjective and semi-objective pain measures.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is VAS (0-10 cm scale), while secondary outcomes include PPT and&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire (only at the end of the study). The subjects will be asked before,&#xD;
      and immediately after the experimental exposure about the outcomes (VAS and PPT). The&#xD;
      subjects will be exposed to one of the two combinations of TENS stimulation (low-to-high and&#xD;
      high alternating frequency), which will be compared to sham-TENS.&#xD;
