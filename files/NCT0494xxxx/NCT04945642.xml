    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of high dose-rate brachytherapy and stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiotherapy in treating patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. Brachytherapy, also&#xD;
      known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a&#xD;
      tumor to kill tumor cells. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to&#xD;
      position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill&#xD;
      tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) at the 5-year time point&#xD;
      after combination therapy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and high dose rate&#xD;
      (HDR)-brachytherapy (BT) boost stratified by patients with intermediate and high-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the rate of acute &gt;= grade 3 patient-reported genitourinary (GU) and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms determined within 90 days after treatment completion,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate patient-reported GU symptoms at the end of radiotherapy and within 6, 12, 24,&#xD;
      and 60 months from radiotherapy completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate patient reported GI symptoms at the end of radiotherapy and within 6, 12, 24,&#xD;
      and 60 months from radiotherapy completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the cumulative incidence of acute grade &gt;= 2 GU physician-scored toxicity,&#xD;
      as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the cumulative incidence of acute grade &gt;= 2 GI physician-scored toxicity, as&#xD;
      assessed by the CTCAE version 5.0 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the cumulative incidence of late &gt;= 2 GU physician-scored toxicity, as&#xD;
      assessed by the CTCAE version 5.0 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the cumulative incidence of late &gt;= 2 GI physician-scored toxicity, as&#xD;
      assessed by the CTCAE version 5.0 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine the prostate specific antigen (PSA) complete response rate (PSA nadir =&lt;&#xD;
      0.3ng/mL) at 3 months following treatment of combination SBRT and HDR-BT boost regardless of&#xD;
      testosterone recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine clinical progression-free survival at 5-years. IX. To determine distant&#xD;
      metastasis-free survival at 5-years. X. To determine overall survival at 5-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo HDR-BT for up to 24 hours and undergo SBRT every other day or consecutive&#xD;
      days for up to 14 consecutive chronologic days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 90 days, every 3 months&#xD;
      for 24 months, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>Will be based on Phoenix criteria (either a rise of 2 ng/mL or more above nadir prostate specific antigen [PSA], or patients not meeting this criterion but underwent salvage therapies).

Kaplan-Meier method will be used.</description>
