      undergo inverventions with SaExten IVCF System or Denali IVCF, and be followed-up to 12&#xD;
      months if the implantation is permanent, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SaExten IVCF&#xD;

    <description>Manufacturer: ShenZhen KYD BioTech Co., Ltd. SaExten IVCF system is a retrievable IVCF system consists of two parts: the vena cava filter and the transporting system.The vena cava filter is a mesh filtering device that prevents the formation of pulmonary embolism by filtering the thrombus. SaExten IVCF system can be inserted through jugular or femoral veins, and can be retrieved through femoral veins within 90 days or indwelled permanently.</description>
