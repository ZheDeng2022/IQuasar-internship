  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of a clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact and process of deploying school-supervised asthma therapy in a real-world setting for&#xD;
      children with poorly controlled asthma (aged 6-12 years).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed 4-site pilot cluster randomized controlled trial will assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a clinical trial of Asthma Link, a real-world school-supervised asthma therapy&#xD;
      program. We will compare the impact of Asthma Link deployed in 2 pediatric practice sites&#xD;
      versus Enhanced usual care deployed in 2 comparator sites, with 18 parent-child dyads&#xD;
      enrolled per site (N=72 dyads).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary trial outcomes will be participant recruitment, retention, and intervention fidelity.&#xD;
      Secondary trial outcomes will be differences in the frequency of asthma symptoms, emergency&#xD;
      department visits, hospital admissions, courses of oral corticosteroids, spirometry values,&#xD;
      medication adherence and school absences between intervention and enhanced usual care sites&#xD;
      at 3, 6 and 12 month follow up. Additionally we will assess process outcomes (acceptability,&#xD;
      adoption, costs, sustainability).&#xD;
