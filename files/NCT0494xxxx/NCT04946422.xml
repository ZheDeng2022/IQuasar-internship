      This project is planned to be based on the medical insurance database collected by the China&#xD;
      Health Insurance Research Association (CHIRA). As a national academic research institution,&#xD;
      CHIRA collects medical insurance patient data, covering more than 20 provinces across the&#xD;
      country. The data of more than 60 municipalities, provincial capitals, and prefecture-level&#xD;
      cities are unique and authoritative in my country. Based on the CHIRA database, big data&#xD;
      analysis for Chinese sports medicine patients, starting from the names of medical&#xD;
      institutions, admission/discharge diagnosis and classification of medical items, etc., to&#xD;
      investigate the development trend of arthroscopic surgery in China and understand my&#xD;
      country's arthroscopic diseases The distribution characteristics and changing trends of the&#xD;

      Sports medicine is a multidisciplinary comprehensive discipline, and is positioned as a&#xD;
      secondary discipline in the country. It is a clinical application-based discipline that&#xD;
      combines medicine and sports to solve sports-related diseases from a medical perspective. The&#xD;
      treatment range is centered on the joints. The main treatment method is arthroscopic&#xD;
      technology to solve sports-related injuries. Together with postoperative rehabilitation, the&#xD;
      goal is to achieve the greatest recovery of motor function. This project is planned to be&#xD;
      based on the medical insurance database collected by the China Health Insurance Research&#xD;
      Association (CHIRA). As a national academic research institution, CHIRA collects medical&#xD;
      insurance patient data, covering more than 20 provinces across the country. The data of more&#xD;
      than 60 municipalities, provincial capitals, and prefecture-level cities are unique and&#xD;
      authoritative in my country. Based on the CHIRA database, big data analysis for Chinese&#xD;
      sports medicine patients, starting from the names of medical institutions,&#xD;
      admission/discharge diagnosis and classification of medical items, etc., to investigate the&#xD;
