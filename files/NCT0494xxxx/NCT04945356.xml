      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although rehabilitation is effective in restoring function, many elderly individuals,&#xD;
      especially those who have survived a stroke, are no longer receiving adequate rehabilitation&#xD;
      services during the COVID19 pandemic due to containment measures. To overcome this problem,&#xD;
      telerehabilitation is a promising avenue to deliver customized and personalized at-home&#xD;
      therapy sessions while adhering to physical distancing guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using customized and&#xD;
      personalized at-home therapy sessions using the Physiotec application for individuals with a&#xD;
      stroke. A second objective is to measure the potential efficacy of the telerehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention at improving function and quality of life based on standardized clinical&#xD;
      measures and measures of improvement implemented in the Physiotec application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a non-randomized, single-group trial. Twenty-five individuals will be recruited on&#xD;
      a voluntary basis. To be included, participants must 1) be ≥18 years old; 2) have a single&#xD;
      unilateral stroke (≥ 6 months); 3) have minimal return of function in the affected upper&#xD;
      limb; and 4) no longer be receiving rehabilitation treatments. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      tablet containing the Physiotec application training program and TERA+, a telerehabilitation&#xD;
      platform. The training program of the affected upper limb will last 6 weeks (90 minutes/week)&#xD;
      and will be updated 3 times (weeks 1-3-5) by the therapist, using the TERA+ platform, based&#xD;
      on the participant's functional capacity and progress, as measured by the app. Feasibility&#xD;
      will be assessed by means of retention rate, adverse events, adherence to the&#xD;
      telerehabilitation intervention, satisfaction with its use and with the exercise program.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by several questionnaires on life habits, motor recovery and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEVANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will inform as to the optimal delivery of adapted rehabilitation services for&#xD;
      stroke survivors that are currently not receiving optimal rehabilitation services because of&#xD;
      the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. The results will serve to support in-home rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercises aimed at promoting recovery, independent living and improving quality of life for&#xD;
      stroke survivors.&#xD;

    <description>The 6-week exercise program will consist of evidence-based exercises covering the breadth and depth of rehabilitation interventions. The therapist will choose the appropriate exercises for each participant's level of function from more than 15,000 exercises implemented within the Physiotec app and developed by rehabilitation experts. Personalized upper limb exercises will be based on the therapist initial assessment of participants, using the TERA+ telerehabilitation platform, and their goals. After each training session, participants will have to rate their perceived level of effort on a Borg scale (/10). The Borg scores will be monitored by the therapist as a precautionary measure to ensure safety and appropriateness of intensity of exercises. Participants will be instructed to train at a target score of around 7/10 (somewhat hard) on the Borg scale.</description>
