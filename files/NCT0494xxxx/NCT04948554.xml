  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b/2 study is designed to assess the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of ACE-1334 plus&#xD;
      SOC in participants with diffuse Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) with or without ILD (Phase 1b) and&#xD;
      SSc-ILD (Phase 2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1b study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ACE-1334 plus standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC) administered in 3 multiple-ascending dose (MAD) cohorts by subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration in participants with diffuse SSc with or without ILD. In each cohort, ACE-1334&#xD;
      will be explored at 2- and 4-week dosing intervals over 12 weeks, with the potential to&#xD;
      extend treatment by up to 40-weeks (per investigator's assessment) and 16 weeks of follow-up,&#xD;
      for up to a maximum of 72 weeks (screening, treatment and follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which dosing,&#xD;
      and frequency of administration will be determined based on the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from the Phase 1b study. This study will&#xD;
      enroll participants with SSc-ILD who will receive 1 of 2 doses of ACE-1334 or placebo plus&#xD;
      SOC. Participation will consist of a 28-day screening period, a 52-week double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period, and a 16-week follow-up period. Dose levels and frequency of administration&#xD;
      in Phase 2 will be determined based on the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data from the&#xD;
      Phase 1b study. The frequency of administration in Phase 2 will be informed by the Phase 1b&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
