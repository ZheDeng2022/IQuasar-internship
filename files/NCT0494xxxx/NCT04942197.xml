      -  Pregnant women can intuitively check the shape and development of the fetus through the&#xD;
           3D avatar that reflects the characteristics of the fetus. Through a survey on VR fetal&#xD;
           experience content and 3D fetal avatar service, the satisfaction of pregnant&#xD;
           women/guardians, the bond between the fetus and the mother, and Assess the degree of&#xD;
           maternal anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate whether it can be helpful in prenatal monitoring of pregnant women through the&#xD;
           use of maternity health management applications, and improve understanding of fetal&#xD;
           growth and development.&#xD;

      -  This study is an extension of the prospective pilot study conducted in 2020 under the&#xD;
           title of &quot;Development of 3D fetal avatar generation technology and fetal experience&#xD;
           service technology reflecting the characteristics of pregnant women&quot;. In a previous&#xD;
           study, about 80% of the mothers who responded to the questionnaire about the similarity&#xD;
           of the avatar's fetal face gave a positive answer. Therefore, the developed 3D avatar&#xD;
           fetal feeling technology is expected to have a positive effect on the intimacy between&#xD;
           the mother and the fetus. want to analyze Pre-developed VR technology is provided&#xD;
           through randomization to mothers who have agreed to participate in the study. In&#xD;
           addition, objective comparison of prenatal care indicators is provided to mothers who&#xD;
           wish to participate in this study by providing a prenatal management application that&#xD;
           can comprehensively manage blood pressure, blood sugar, diet, exercise, maternal weight,&#xD;
           medications, and expected fetal weight. We intend to evaluate the evaluation and&#xD;
           maternal satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If technology and services for simulating a fetus with a 3D fetal avatar are provided,&#xD;
           mothers can obtain information such as the face and developmental status of the fetus&#xD;
           specialized for their fetus through the 3D fetal avatar. In addition, providing a fetal&#xD;
           heart rate simulation linked to the fetal heart sound improves the bond between the&#xD;
           mother and the fetus, which can have a positive effect on health, as well as reducing&#xD;
           depression during pregnancy and postpartum.&#xD;
