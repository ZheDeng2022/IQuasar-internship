  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is to evaluate the effects of acalabrutinib in combination with&#xD;
      venetoclax in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma that does not respond to treatment (refractory) or that has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Given acalabrutinib and venetoclax may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice a day (BID) and venetoclax PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-28. Patients receive acalabrutinib alone for the first three 28 day cycles.&#xD;
      Venetoclax is added beginning with Cycle 4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed-up every 12 weeks and annually for&#xD;
      10 years.&#xD;
