  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the side effects of tocilizumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab&#xD;
      in treating patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or urothelial carcinoma that&#xD;
      has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Tocilizumab is&#xD;
      a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the immune system to decrease immune-related&#xD;
      toxicities. Giving tocilizumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of systemic tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, in combination with Ipilimumab and nivolumab as front-line treatment for patients&#xD;
      with advanced cutaneous melanoma, urothelial carcinoma and in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the grade 3 or higher toxicity rate of Tocilizumab in combination with&#xD;
      Ipilimumab and nivolumab for patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and durable response rate (DRR), defined as&#xD;
      the proportion of patients with objective responses of &gt; 6 months duration, as determined by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) and immune related RECIST&#xD;
      (irRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the start of&#xD;
      treatment to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate overall survival (OS) defined as the time from the start of treatment to&#xD;
      death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess pre- and post-treatment blood/tumor biopsies for immunologic assessment and to&#xD;
      explore any potential association between biomarker measurements and antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts: 1=melanoma, 2=Urothelial, 3=NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: Patients with melanoma will receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes&#xD;
      and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for 4 doses, then treatment with nivolumab repeats every 4 weeks for 2 years in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Starting on week 1, patients&#xD;
      also receive tocilizumab subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks for up to 12 weeks (6 doses) in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2: Patients with urothelial cancer will receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab repeats every&#xD;
      3 weeks for 4 doses, then treatment with nivolumab repeats every 4 weeks for 2 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Starting on week 1, patients also&#xD;
      receive tocilizumab SC every 2 weeks for up to 12 weeks (6 doses) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 3: Patients with NSCLC receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6 weeks and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. Patients also receive&#xD;
      tocilizumab SC every 2 weeks for up to 12 weeks (6 doses). Treatment continues in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.&#xD;
