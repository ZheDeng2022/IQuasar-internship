    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, phase II study. The purpose is to evaluate&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of HAIC (Hepatic arterial infusion&#xD;
      chemotherapy) with HLX10 (PD-1 antibody) and HLX04 (VEGF antibody) compared with HAIC and&#xD;
      placebo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with major portal vein tumor thrombosis.&#xD;

    <description>For the HAIC procedure, a 5F catheter was introduced using the Seldinger technique through the femoral artery or the radial artery. Then, angiographic surveys of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery were performed. According to tumor size, location, and arterial supply, the catheter or a 2.7F microcatheter was advanced into the hepatic artery at the level of selective segmental, lobar, or whole liver. The catheter or microcatheter was connected to an external infusion pump. The following regimen of modified FOLFOX was administered: oxaliplatin, 85mg/m2 for 2 hours; leucovorin, 400mg/m2; and 5-fluorouracil, 2400mg/m2 for 44-46 hours. After HAIC treatment, the catheter or microcatheter, and the sheath were removed.</description>
