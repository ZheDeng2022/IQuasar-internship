    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to compare two ways to conduct bronchoscopic biopsy of&#xD;
      lymph nodes and other structures in the chest (i.e. the presence or absence of an on-site&#xD;
      cytotechnologist performing a limited microscopic evaluation to provide non-binding feedback&#xD;
      on specimen adequacy in real time during the procedure).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a highly safe and effective bronchoscopic procedure that&#xD;
      can achieve diagnostic yields of over 90% for lung cancer - similar to those with the&#xD;
      more-invasive surgical mediastinoscopy - with EBUS enjoying the advantage of a near 0%&#xD;
      complication rate in several large studies. This has led to EBUS becoming the procedure of&#xD;
      choice for mediastinal staging of lung cancer. Increasingly, bronchoscopists are being asked&#xD;
      to perform EBUS not only for lung cancer staging but also for tissue acquisition for&#xD;
      molecular markers to assess for mutations that can be treated with biologic therapy. However,&#xD;
      a frequently encountered clinical scenario is that while an EBUS is diagnostic for lung&#xD;
      cancer, it is non-diagnostic for molecular testing because of an insufficient amount of&#xD;
      tissue material being collected. According to multiple studies, the &quot;molecular yield&quot; for&#xD;
      EBUS in lung cancer can range from 74-82%. These studies have not specifically looked at&#xD;
      adequacy of biomarkers, which could be distinctly different considering that evaluation of&#xD;
      biomarkers requires more tissue for next generation sequencing (NGS). Currently, Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Hospital uses NGS as standard of care for identifying mutations associated with&#xD;
      malignant cells. NGS analysis, which is usually reported as a percentage of cells that&#xD;
      express one of many biomarkers currently being tested as standard of care, is performed via&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), necessitating the presence of a sufficiently cellular material&#xD;
      with &gt;100 tumor cells for reliable quantitative characterization. To the investigator's&#xD;
      knowledge, the rates of NGS biomarker sufficiency have not been prospectively analyzed to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) is an optional step during EBUS bronchoscopy in which an&#xD;
      on-site cytotechnologist performs a limited microscopic evaluation to provide non-binding&#xD;
      feedback on specimen adequacy in real time during the procedure. The cytotechnologist can&#xD;
      also aid specimen processing e.g. through creation of a &quot;tissue clot&quot; in addition to use of&#xD;
      the more standard liquid-based medium. At Johns Hopkins, EBUS procedures are routinely&#xD;
      performed both with and without ROSE since the presence or absence of ROSE during EBUS has&#xD;
      not been shown to impact diagnostic yield or procedural safety. However, its impact on NGS&#xD;
      biomarker sufficiency has not been tested to the investigator's knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate whether ROSE can impact NGS biomarker sufficiency by assisting&#xD;
      the bronchoscopist in obtaining adequate tissue from the appropriate site. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that ROSE will decrease the rate of insufficient tumor tissue to permit NGS biomarker&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
