  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type II-diabetic neuropathy is the most common and correlated problem with diabetes that&#xD;
      deteriorates with the passage of time. Balance disorders are also resulting of movement&#xD;
      strategy damage, biomechanical and mechanical disorientation. The balance disorder has been&#xD;
      reported to be related to abnormal somatosensory feedback, which is utilized in the&#xD;
      development of an interior depiction of body motion and position (inner model) in the central&#xD;
      nervous system. The Biodex stability system offers a system that can deliver particular hip&#xD;
      and ankle postural training strategy with external biofeedback as a monitor to enhance the&#xD;
      reduced subclinical limitations of patients with diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common critical illnesses with a higher prevalence all&#xD;
      over the world. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common and correlated problem with diabetes&#xD;
      that deteriorates with the passage of time. Diabetic neuropathy is a progressive and complex&#xD;
      disease, characterized by regular distal deterioration of peripheral nerves which lead to&#xD;
      symptoms of sensory loss and pain. During normal situations, somatosensory inputs from the&#xD;
      feet and legs participate in the stability of posture. Posture reflex and balance alignment&#xD;
      are common findings in diabetic neuropathy because of reduced proprioception and rising time&#xD;
      of reflex reactions. Balance disorders are also results of movement strategy damage,&#xD;
      biomechanical and mechanical disorientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 20-30% of patients with diabetic neuropathy suffer from neuropathic pains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropathic complications are prevalent among 39.6% of the diabetic population. Diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy lowers significantly the quality of life and considerably increases health&#xD;
      expenses related to diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy patients exhibit stability disorders and&#xD;
      are vulnerable to falls even with open eyes. The instability sources in patients with type-II&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy comprise the incapability of the central nervous system (CNS) to&#xD;
      integrate properly available information of postural control and a shift of balance strategy&#xD;
      from ankle-based to hip-based. Furthermore, a rise in the reliance on visual information and&#xD;
      the use of vestibular information change the format of postural control in patients with&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability can be referred to as the warmth of a dynamic system to different worries, and&#xD;
      local constancy is the sensitivity of the structure to internal distresses, for example,&#xD;
      natural fluxes like variation in muscle activity respond to gravity which occurs during&#xD;
      stability. The impacts of such natural variations were inspected for assessing diverse&#xD;
      measures of postural influence. Multiple studies on diabetic patients by neuropathic postural&#xD;
      instability recommend relative shortfalls in their capability to sustain posture and specify&#xD;
      higher instability as compared to non-diabetics and positive relations between falling and&#xD;
      postural instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, studies of posture instability in diabetic patients with diabetic neuropathy have&#xD;
      shown greater scores for postural stability indexes, area of sway, speed, greater ranges of&#xD;
      the centre of pressure; increased values of the centre of mass variables and increase of sway&#xD;
      power in less stable postures. Awareness and appropriately performing balance and stability&#xD;
      training in patients involve comprehensive knowledge of the causes of postural complications.&#xD;
      Postural control involves a composite organization that controls the equilibrium and&#xD;
      orientation of the body during upright stand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, posture control involves multiple underlying physiological organizations and&#xD;
      dependent upon six contexts: (a) cognitive processing, (b) sensory approaches, (c) movement&#xD;
      approaches, (d) dynamics control (e), space orientation and (f) biomechanical task&#xD;
      limitations. The sensory afferents sources which seem to participate in postural control&#xD;
      comprise proprioception, visual systems, and vestibular. Subclinical and pathological&#xD;
      constrictions in patients with diabetic neuropathy are because of context-specific and&#xD;
      distinct instabilities like sensory and movement approaches. Reactive movement approaches are&#xD;
      helpful for patients in developing multi-joint coordinated movement, and sensory approaches&#xD;
      for selecting proper sensory information to control posture. The hip and ankle reactive&#xD;
      movement approach reported being helpful to return the equilibrium of the body and keeping&#xD;
      the feet in position. When people stand on a rigid surface, the ankle approach maintains&#xD;
      balance with little movements in the form of an inverted pendulum. Rehabilitation and&#xD;
      reactive movement strategies comprise the patient's exposure to external perturbations which&#xD;
      differ in direction, amplitude, and speed. However, few studies have reported the correlation&#xD;
      between balance training and external response. These trainings are useful to progress the&#xD;
      sensory integration and dynamic balance capabilities of aged adults with a falling history&#xD;
      and support for frail aged women in domestic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It also has been ideal to balance training at home. In addition, static-standing stability&#xD;
      can be trained efficiently through weight-bearing exercise, and a visual guided&#xD;
      weight-shifting drill can develop a standing balance mechanism of static balance in diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy patients. Like so, the BIODEX stability system offers a system that can deliver&#xD;
      particular hip and ankle postural training strategy with external biofeedback as a monitor to&#xD;
      enhance the reduced subclinical limitations of patients with diabetic neuropathy. As these&#xD;
      patients are often of old age and have symptoms of instability identical to those of elder&#xD;
      people, it is supposed that a balance-training platform with a BIODEX balance system may also&#xD;
      improve balance in patients with diabetic neuropathy&#xD;
