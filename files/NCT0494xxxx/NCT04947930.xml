  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many previous studies had revealed that gastrointestinal microbiome is changed&#xD;
      compositionally and ecologically in patients with colorectal cancer comparing with healthy&#xD;
      population. These finding provide us with a new sight to take advantage of gut microbiota.&#xD;
      The current study aims to explore new potential biomarkers for early screening and prognostic&#xD;
      prediction of colorectal cancer and colorectal polyps by analyzing metagenomics and&#xD;
      metabolomics of gut microbiota.&#xD;

      Patients who come to the Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University for medical&#xD;
      purposes will be invited to participate in the study. Participants will be asked to collect&#xD;
      two stool samples. One stool sample will be used for metagenomic sequencing and the other&#xD;
      will be used to extract metabolomics data. Meanwhile, participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire about lifestyle and diet habits with the assistance of a well-trained nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will delineate the community and metabolites differences in the gut microbiota between&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients and healthy populations by comparing cases with controls.&#xD;
      Considering the different gut microbiota profiles among different populations caused by&#xD;
      varied diet habits and lifestyles, the current study will try to describe the microbiota&#xD;
      profiles in the Chinese population. Besides, we will explore new potential biomarkers for&#xD;
      early screening and prognostic prediction which is suitable to Chinese populations. Moreover,&#xD;
      we will attempt to find out the interactions between diet and microbiota through a&#xD;
      comprehensive analysis of the questionnaire and the collected results.&#xD;
