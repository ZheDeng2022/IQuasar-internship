      This study is a randomized, prospective, comparative study of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      prophylactic entecavir treatment for HBV reactivation in past HBV infected patients (HBsAg-,&#xD;
      HBcIgG+) with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients are randomized into treatment group or delayed treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Stratified randomization (Block randomization within strata) according to the presence of&#xD;
      HBsAb at baseline was used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental: Treatment group (n=82) The intervention group take entecavir 0.5mg&#xD;
           everyday by oral administration for 3 years after hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation. The intervention group visit clinic every month and examined liver&#xD;
           function test, HBsAg/Ab. HBV DNA level is examined at every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           * oral administration of entecavir is planned to start within 7 days after hematopoietic&#xD;
           stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No Intervention: delayed treatment group (n=82) The delayed treatment group visit clinic&#xD;
           every month and examined liver function test, HBsAg/Ab. HBV DNA level is examined at&#xD;
           every 3 months. If the patient in the delayed treatment group shows HBV reactivation&#xD;
           (positive HBsAg or HBV DNA ≥10 IU/mL), entecavir treatment is started.&#xD;
