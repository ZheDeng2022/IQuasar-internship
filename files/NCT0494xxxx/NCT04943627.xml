      This Phase 3 trial is an open-label, randomized study with single-agent Balstilimab (BAL) or&#xD;
      Investigator Choice (IC) chemotherapy (single-agent gemcitabine, irinotecan, pemetrexed,&#xD;
      vinorelbine, or topotecan) in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical&#xD;
      cancer who have progressed after receiving platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Phase 3 trial is to demonstrate prolongation of OS in patients treated&#xD;
      with BAL as compared to IC chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 3 trial is an open-label, randomized study with single-agent BAL or IC&#xD;
      chemotherapy (single-agent gemcitabine, irinotecan, pemetrexed, vinorelbine, or topotecan) in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer who have progressed after&#xD;
      receiving platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic cervical cancer who have progressed&#xD;
      after receiving at least 1 prior line of platinum-containing chemotherapy with or without&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, &gt; 50% of patients will have received prior treatment with bevacizumab, which&#xD;
      will be determined prior to enrollment.&#xD;
