  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single oral administration of study drugs (i.e. Anplag® &amp; Brilinta®) in Two periods after at&#xD;
      least 10 hours fasting. The periods will be separated by a washout period of 7 days. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability of Anplag® 90mg (Ticagrelor) Tablet&#xD;
      with Brilinta® 90 mg (Ticagrelor) Tablet under fasting conditions in healthy Pakistani male&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be randomly assigned in period 1 to T or R sequence and will be&#xD;
      administered the study drugs T (Anplag® 90 mg) or R (Brilinta® 90 mg) with 240 mL ambient&#xD;
      temperature water following at least 10 hours fasting. Blood samples will be withdrawn at&#xD;
      pre-determined time points for estimation of plasma drug concentration upto 48 hours post&#xD;
      dose. the subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 separated by a washout period of 7 days&#xD;
      and administered RT sequence in period 2. Similar procedure of blood sampling will be applied&#xD;
      for estimation of plasma drug concentration upto 48 hours post dose.&#xD;
