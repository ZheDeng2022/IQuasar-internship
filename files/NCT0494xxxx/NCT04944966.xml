      Antimalarial Herbal medicine known as Maytenus senegalensis will be evaluated for its safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy among Tanzanian male adults aged 18 to 45 years. The first primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of malaria herbal remedy of Maytenus&#xD;
      senegalensis among healthy male adults aged 18 to 45 years in Tanzania. And the second&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the safety, tolerability as well as efficacy of malaria herbal&#xD;
      remedy Maytenus senegalensis (MALHERBAL) for the treatment of Tanzanian adults aged 18 to 45&#xD;
      years with uncomplicated malaria compared to Artemether-lumefantrine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The herbal medicine (Maytenus senegalensis) has been scientifically investigated for acute&#xD;
      toxicity in vitro and antiplasmodial activity both in vitro and in vivo where it showed&#xD;
      strong antimalarial activity. However, to our knowledge, no antimalarial studies have been&#xD;
      performed on this herbal medicine in standardized clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will contain two treatment groups. Group 1 will have 12 healthy male adults aged 18&#xD;
      to 45 years who will be given the malaria herbal remedy (Maytenus senegalensis) and followed&#xD;
      up for safety for 56 days. The subgroup 1a will be the first group to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study and given Malaria herbal remedy. The safety assessment of this group will be done in 7&#xD;
      days after the first treatment. If there will be no major safety concern per-protocol among&#xD;
      participants of group 1a, the subgroup 1b participants will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      given Malaria herbal remedy. The safety assessment of this subgroup 1b will be done 7 days&#xD;
      after the first treatment. If there will be no major safety concern per-protocol among&#xD;
      participants of group 1b, the subgroup 1c participants will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      given Malaria herbal remedy. The safety assessment of this subgroup 1c will be done 7 days&#xD;
      after the first treatment. If there will be no major safety concern per-protocol among&#xD;
      participants of group 1c, the subgroup 1d participants will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      given Malaria herbal remedy. The decision to proceed from G1 to the enrolment of G 2&#xD;
      participants will be determined by pre-specified &quot;go or no go&quot; criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group 2 will comprise two subgroups of male Adults aged 18 to 45 years with&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria. The first is study group 2a of 52 uncomplicated malaria patients who&#xD;
      will be treated with the malaria herbal remedy (Maytenus senegalensis) while G2b of 52&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria patients will be treated with Artemether-lumefantrine. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for 56 days. In the presence of failure for either the herbal remedy and&#xD;
      Artemether-lumefantrine and Early Treatment Failure criteria met, the rescue treatment will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of utilizing Group 1 participants is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Maytenus senegalensis and proof of the concept that the herbal product is safe for the human&#xD;
      subject. Therefore, the decision to proceed to Group 2 intervention for patients with&#xD;
      naturally acquired malaria will be subjected to pre-specified &quot;go or no go&quot; criteria. These&#xD;
      criteria will be based on safety data obtained from the sentinel group of 12 participants on&#xD;
      day 28 after the first treatment and will be reviewed by an independent safety monitoring&#xD;
      committee (SMC) appointed for this study. If one of the following criteria will be met, the&#xD;
      study will not enroll the remaining G2 participants: (i)Any SAE related to the antimalarial&#xD;
      herbal remedy (ii) â‰¥50% of the participants experienced a Grade 3 AR persisting at Grade 3&#xD;
      for &gt; 48 hours during the 14 follow-up days.&#xD;
