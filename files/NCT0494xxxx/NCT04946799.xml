  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) combined with resistance or aerobic exercise has been&#xD;
      shown to improve the glucose uptake in humans. In addition, BFRT represents a low-load,&#xD;
      alternative exercise program for type 2 diabetes patients who often have reduced physical&#xD;
      fitness. However, it is not clear to what extent could BFRT improve glycemic control among&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes. This pilot randomized-controlled trial aims to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of a 12-week, low-intensity BFRT on glycemic control among patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, compared to medium-high intensity aerobic exercise or low-intensity exercise&#xD;
      without BFRT.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot randomized study aims to explore the effects of blood flow restriction combined&#xD;
      with aerobic training (BFRT) on the glucose and lipid metabolism indexes and vascular&#xD;
      endothelial factors of type 2 diabetes, by comparing it with traditional low-intensity and&#xD;
      high-intensity aerobic training. It aims to evaluate the effectiveness of BFRT in glycemic&#xD;
      control of type 2 diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients with type 2 diabetes who are 50-65 years old at the Maigaoqiao&#xD;
      Community Health Service Center, Qixia District, Nanjing, China, with a course of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes of 2-10 years will be included as the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be stratified by baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and age, they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into three groups with a block size of six. The study groups are: 1)&#xD;
      low-intensity training combined with blood flow restriction group (LI-BFR group, 40% heart&#xD;
      rate reserve combined with 50% arterial occlusion pressure, n=20) 2)high-intensity aerobic&#xD;
      exercise group (HI group, 70% heart rate reserve, n=20) 3) Low-intensity group (LI group, 40%&#xD;
      heart rate reserve, n=20).&#xD;

Each exercise session contains 6 sections, each section lasts for 5 minutes, followed with a 1-minute rest period. The compression belt is deflated during the rest period. At least two trained research assistants supervise the exercise in each session. Instant heart rate during exercise is measured with heart rate monitor for each participant.</description>
