  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical trial.This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in&#xD;
      combination with Fruquintinib and Tislelizumab, and to examine the impact of the combination&#xD;
      therapy on tumor control, long-term survival and quality of life in patients with Metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 68 metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have failed the first-line standard&#xD;
      treatment, will be recruited and receive multisite SABR(8-12 Gy, 4-5 times) followed by&#xD;
      fruquintinib(5mg, qd) and tislelizumab(200mg, q3w) within two weeks from completion.The&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate(DCR), progression-free survival(PFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival(OS) will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>A total of 68 metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have failed the first-line standard treatment will receive multisite SABR followed by Fruquintinib and Tislelizumab within two weeks from completion.&#xD;

    <description>We plan to irradiate as many metastatic lesions as possible, in the precondition that normal tissues can tolerate.&#xD;
Target dose will be adjusted depending on site of the lesion and organs at risk (BED &gt; 100Gy).&#xD;
Treatment schedule is once per day and five days per week. Sequence of irradiation for multiple metastases is at the discretion of the investigators based on their experience.</description>
