  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BewegtVersorgt project involved co-producing a physical activity referral scheme (PARS)&#xD;
      for inactive persons with underlying non-communicable diseases. Various relevant actors of&#xD;
      the German healthcare system (e.g., representatives of physicians, health insurance&#xD;
      providers, sports organizations, exercise representatives of exercise professions,&#xD;
      representatives of patients) participated in the co-production process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of co-produced PARS in the&#xD;
      Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth region. Local general practitioners and exercise professionals will&#xD;
      carry out the implementation of the PARS in standard care. The cluster-randomized study&#xD;
      includes two intervention arms; one group will receive specific support from physical&#xD;
      activity experts to increase physical activity (PARS). The control group will receive only&#xD;
      the physician's advice and then continue to engage in physical activity on their own (PAA).&#xD;
      The participants will be followed up at 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity (min/week): BSA 3.0 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 12 weeks (T1), and 24 weeks (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity, Exercise, and Sport Questionnaire (Bewegungs- und Sportaktivität Fragebogen; BSA-F) is a German questionnaire that assesses the amount of physical activity during the last four weeks. It differentiates between leisure-time/transportation activities (physical activity score) and sport-/exercise-related activities (sports score). Participants are required to report the frequency and duration of activities executed during the last four weeks. Minutes of leisure-time physical activity per week and sport-/exercise-related activity per week are calculated to get the physical activity and the sports score. Both scores can be combined to receive the overall volume of physical activity completed during leisure-time/transportation and sport-/exercise-related activities.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical activity-related health competence: BGK Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 12 weeks (T1), and 24 weeks (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the German version of the Physical Activity-Related Health Competence questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 44 total items that measure three sub-competencies necessary for a health-promoting physical activity behavior: movement competence (20 items; min = 0, max = 17.6), control competence (10 items; min = 0, max = 10.8), physical activity-related self-regulation competence (14 items; min = 0, max = 14.8). Higher scores indicate higher competencies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life: EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 12 weeks (T1), and 24 weeks (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-administered quality of life scale that consists of a descriptive system and a visual analog scale. The descriptive system contains five well-being dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to/extreme problems), each coded with numbers from one to five. The result obtained is a 5-digit code that represents the health state profile of the participant. The visual analog scale assesses the overall current health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in self-efficacy towards physical activity: Selbstwirksamkeit zur sportlichen Aktivität-Skala (SSA-Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 12 weeks (T1), and 24 weeks (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by a German instrument (Selbstwirksamkeit zur sportlichen Aktivität; SSA-Scale), including 12 items that assess the confidence someone has to perform a planned physical activity in the face of various conditions that may act as barriers. Each item is scored on a seven-point Likert scale representing the level of confidence from '1' meaning not sure at all and '7' meaning the participant is very confident of performing the physical activity as planned even in the face of a particular challenge. The total scores range from 12 to 84, where the higher the score, the greater the self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in participants' perceived autonomy support: Health Care Climate Questionnaire-Deutschland (HCCQ-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 24 weeks (T1; only intervention group)</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the German version of the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ-D) to measure the participant's perception of autonomy support from the general practitioner. It incorporates 15 statements with seven-point response options that indicate the level of agreement ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Higher scores indicate higher perceived autonomy support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in stages of change: transtheoretical model (TTM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 12 weeks (T1), and 24 weeks (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>We will use one German question that is based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change. The five response options represent five stages of change: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in sport- and movement-related self-concordance: Sport- und bewegungsbezogenen Selbstkonkordanz Skala (SSK-Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 12 weeks (T1), and 24 weeks (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be evaluated with the self-administered German scale (Sport- und bewegungsbezogenen Selbstkonkordanz-Skala; SSK-Scale) that measures the self-concordance. The SSK-Scale contains 12 items grouped into four subscales: intrinsic, identified, introjected, and extrinsic motivation. The subscales' scores for introjected and extrinsic motivation will be subtracted from the sum of the identified and intrinsic motivation subscales to receive the overall score. Thus, the overall score ranges from minus ten (-10) to ten, where a higher score suggests a higher level of sports- and movement-related self-concordance.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Experience of participating actors (general practitioners, exercise professionals): (semi-) structured interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The (semi-) structured interview is based on RE-AIM and asks specifically about adoption, implementation, and maintenance.</description>
