  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and delirium (incidence up to 42 %) after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are common postoperative complications that impair&#xD;
      the patient's quality of life and increase the risk of death. Our previous studies confirm&#xD;
      that postoperative POCD are associated with impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA) and&#xD;
      momentary increased intracranial pressure (ICP) during surgery. The upper and lower limits of&#xD;
      CA are individual and variable. In the elderly, CA is already partially impaired due to&#xD;
      decreased cerebral vascular elasticity. What should be the optimal mean arterial pressure for&#xD;
      each of these patients individually is not known. In order to individualize the boundaries of&#xD;
      CA and prevent postoperative neurological complications, it would be ideal to objectify the&#xD;
      condition of cerebral blood vessels. Direct studies of cerebrovascular and vascular status&#xD;
      (CT angiography) are invasive and complex, and are therefore not routinely performed prior to&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. However, cerebral blood flow and vascular condition can be assessed by&#xD;
      retinal blood vessels, which can be considered as a direct biomarker of cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disorders and can be visualized by ophthalmoscopy and objectively assessed by optical&#xD;
      coherent tomography with angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this biomedical study, individual patient CA will be monitored in a non-invasive manner&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery with CPB. These data would allow real-time adjustments to&#xD;
      physiological parameters while keeping them within normal limits. This is expected to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of CA impairment and reduce the incidence of neurological complications following&#xD;
      such surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the world. As the&#xD;
      population ages, the number of people with glaucoma increases as the prevalence of glaucoma&#xD;
      increases with age. Recently, the influence of ICP on glaucoma optic neuropathy has been&#xD;
      highlighted. It is thought that the pressure difference in the optic nerve area may be&#xD;
      related to damage to the axons of the ganglion cells passing through the porous plate.&#xD;
      Noninvasive ICP measurement is useful in explaining the pathophysiology of glaucoma,&#xD;
      assessing translaminar pressure differentials, and seeking new guidelines for the treatment&#xD;
      and prevention of glaucoma. Retinal blood flow, like cerebral blood flow, is autoregulated,&#xD;
      autoregulation is maintained only within certain limits of perfusion pressure. Decreased&#xD;
      ocular perfusion pressure impairs retinal autoregulation and may lead to the development or&#xD;
      progression of glaucoma neuropathy. And the activity of neurons in the brain and retina&#xD;
      causes local changes in blood circulation. Disruption of this neurovascular interaction&#xD;
      during glaucoma neuropathy has not been adequately studied.The introduction of modern&#xD;
      technologies into clinical practice enables the qualitative and quantitative assessment of&#xD;
      autoregulatory disorders and the selection of optimal treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be monitored for cerebral autoregulation using a Vittamed 505 monitor to identify the dynamics of the autoregulation index VRx (t). Intracranial pressure (ICP) will also be measured by non-invasive ultrasound using a robotic TCD device, Dolphin4D (Israel), which simultaneously records MCA blood flow in both hemispheres of the brain. APAs will be assessed using mathematical models.</description>
