  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify the optimal maintenance therapy for granulomatosis with&#xD;
      polyangiitis (GPA) by comparing the MTX (standard regimen) with Tofacitinib in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy, i.e. in preventing relapses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a systemic small-vessel vasculitis, could involve&#xD;
      multiple tissues and organs. Remission of GPA can be obtained in approximately 80% of the&#xD;
      patients with a combination of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. However, relapses are&#xD;
      frequent and remain a challenge. The optimal drug for maintenance treatment is not&#xD;
      determined. Tofacitinib is a Jak inhibitor which has been proved to be effective in multiple&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. But the efficiency and safety of&#xD;
      tofacitinib in treating GPA remains unclear yet. In the present randomized trial, the&#xD;
      comparison of MTX (standard regimen) with Tofacitinib in terms of efficacy, i.e. in&#xD;
      preventing relapses will be conducted.&#xD;

All other relapses should be classified as minor.)</description>
