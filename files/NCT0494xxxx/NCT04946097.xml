  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the Effect of gross Myofascial Release on pain and function in cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy patients. BACKGROUND: cervical radiculopathy is considered serious problems&#xD;
      causing neck pain &amp; radiating pain which affect physical inactivity and function of a&#xD;
      patient, thus gross Myofascial Release is a form of manual therapy technique that has a&#xD;
      profound effect upon the musculoskeletal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      gross Myofascial Release on pain and function in cervical radiculopathy patients RESEARCH&#xD;
      QUESTION: Is there an effect of gross Myofascial Release on pain and function in cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy patients?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients with cervical radiculopathy will participate in this study. The patients will&#xD;
      randomly be divided into two equal groups; the control group which received the conventional&#xD;
      selected exercise program and the study group received the same exercise training program in&#xD;
      addition to gross Myofascial Release, three times per week for four weeks. The evaluation&#xD;
      methods are visual analogue scale (VAS), Electro-goniometer, Quick DASH scale, and Neck&#xD;
      disability index&#xD;

    <measure>Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Handscale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale only contains 11 items, It is a questionnaire that measures an individual's ability to complete tasks, absorb forces, and severity of symptoms. The Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand tool uses a 5-point Likert scale from which the patient can select an appropriate number corresponding to his/her severity/function level, as the higher scores indicate a greater level of disability and severity, whereas, lower scores indicate a lower level of disability, and The score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index is designed to measure neck-specific disability. The questionnaire has 10 items concerning pain and activities of daily living including personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work status, driving, sleeping and recreation. The measure is designed to be given to the patient to complete, and can provide useful information for management and prognosis of those with neck pain.The test maximum score of 50, or as a percentage. as 0 points or 0% means : no activity limitations , and 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation.&#xD;
A higher score indicates more patient-rated disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>for the assessment of the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain. The most simple visual analogue scale is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the degree of pain to be measured, as the higher scores (100mm) indicate a greater intensity of pain.</description>
