    <textblock>
      Background: Dengue continues to be a high priority disease for public health in tropical and&#xD;
      subtropical countries, where vector control measures have not had the expected impact on&#xD;
      transmission. The development of new vaccines opens the possibility of having an additional&#xD;
      measure capable of preventing the development of the disease and avoiding its complications.&#xD;
      Currently, in two of the Dengue virus (DENV) vaccines a differential behaviour of the immune&#xD;
      response has been observed between seropositive and seronegative individuals, which makes the&#xD;
      generation of evidence from prevalence studies in places of high and low endemicity more&#xD;
      relevant. Objective: To determine the predominant type of humoral immune response in high&#xD;
      areas and to estimate the serotype-specific prevalence for DENV in people groups aged 5 to 35&#xD;
      years living in Mexican cities with low and high dengue endemicity. Methodology: Descriptive&#xD;
      cross-sectional study with subgroup analysis (by endemic and non-endemic areas, by age groups&#xD;
      and by sex). Expected results: In areas of low dengue endemicity the humoral immune response&#xD;
      against dengue is predominantly monotypic (against one serotype) while in areas of high&#xD;
      dengue endemicity it is predominantly multitype (against two or more serotypes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue is a disease of epidemiological importance in tropical and subtropical countries. The&#xD;
      region of the Americas is one of the most affected worldwide, where nearly 500 million people&#xD;
      are at risk of acquiring the disease from one of the four Dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1,&#xD;
      DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) transmitted mainly by the bite of the mosquito Aedes aegypty. It&#xD;
      is a disease subject to epidemiological surveillance based on the operational definition of a&#xD;
      probable case of non-severe dengue, a probable case of dengue with warning signs, and a&#xD;
      probable case of severe dengue. The clinical diagnosis is made during the febrile phase up to&#xD;
      five days of evolution, through RT-qPCR and in the convalescence phase, six to fourteen days&#xD;
      after the date of onset of symptoms, with an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgM or&#xD;
      IgG. Although epidemiological surveillance systems are essential tools for disease&#xD;
      description and decision-making, it has been considered that they could provide&#xD;
      underestimated information on the burden of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 75% of DENV infections are mild or asymptomatic, and the most common clinical&#xD;
      manifestations are fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea.&#xD;
      Primary infection can produce a lifelong serotype-specific immune response and a&#xD;
      cross-response against the different DENV serotypes for a period of between six months and&#xD;
      one year (short-lived heterologous immunity), but after this time the resulting protective&#xD;
      profile is known as a monotypic response, then, the neutralizing activity is only against one&#xD;
      serotype. The second infection, usually caused by a different serotype, might be associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of developing serious manifestations; those that resolve the infection&#xD;
      develop an antibody profile similar to that generated in the first infection (antigenic&#xD;
      original sin), but unlike the first infection, the resulting heterologous crossed humoral&#xD;
      immune response lasts longer; Later infections, normally asymptomatic, if carried out,&#xD;
      intensify this profile of antibodies as a multitype response or against two or more&#xD;
      serotypes. Although protective immunity against the Dengue virus is still being studied, it&#xD;
      is considered that the multitype profile, developed by exposure to multiple serotypes of the&#xD;
      virus, is the one that is related to protection against the disease and therefore it is&#xD;
      desirable to develop by a vaccine candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another relevant aspect of dengue transmission is that the localities that develop a&#xD;
      hyperendemic state are those where multitypic profiles should be found more frequently since&#xD;
      these can only be generated by the circulation of more of a serotype. On the other hand,&#xD;
      communities with the circulation of one serotype or where the circulation of more than one&#xD;
      serotype is widely separated in time would have monotypic profiles that distinguish&#xD;
      non-endemic communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive measures mainly include those related to health promotion and vector control. One&#xD;
      vaccine has been registered (CYD-TDV, yellow fever chimera 17D-DENV) and another five are&#xD;
      under study. The World Health Organization has called for serological surveys to be carried&#xD;
      out as key instruments to inform public policy about the prevalence of the disease and guide&#xD;
      decision-making. This is more relevant since the CYD-TDV vaccine and TAK-003 vaccine&#xD;
      (DENV-DENV chimera) showed a differentiated behaviour between seronegative and seropositive&#xD;
      subjects and the CYD-TDV vaccine has been registered for exclusive use for endemic regions&#xD;
      and localities. Additionally, an association has been reported between the vaccination&#xD;
      history and the severity of the disease in the population under 9 years of age. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is important to know the humoral immune response in this age group. Serological surveys have&#xD;
      facilitated the documentation of the role of clinical, social and environmental factors in&#xD;
      the prevalence of the disease and its heterogeneity worldwide. The prevalence of dengue in&#xD;
      endemic areas has been reported to be around 80% while in non-endemic areas it is less than&#xD;
      30%. Age has also has been described as a factor associated with the prevalence of dengue in&#xD;
      Mexico, it has been reported a prevalence of 35.7% in the group of 5-9 years, followed by&#xD;
      52.2% in the group of 10 to 14 years, 58.9% in the 15 to 19-year-old group, 74.1% in the 20&#xD;
      to 24-year-old group, 80% in the 25 to 29-year-old group and over 90% in the 30-year-old&#xD;
      group. Infrastructure and social factors have also been documented as determinants of dengue&#xD;
      endemicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dengue seroprevalence studies carried out in Mexico have been observational studies in&#xD;
      endemic populations; There is only one national cluster-randomized study that provides a&#xD;
      global description of seroprevalence in endemic and non-endemic regions, and the&#xD;
      serotype-specific neutralizing humoral response was not evaluated by Amaya-Larios et al,&#xD;
      2014; therefore, there is a lack of knowledge of the type of humoral immune response that&#xD;
      occurs in endemic and non-endemic localities. Knowledge of the general characteristics of&#xD;
      cities with monotypic or multitypic profiles will allow us to offer crucial information at&#xD;
      various levels. For pharmaceutical companies, knowing the immune status of the country's&#xD;
      cities will allow establishing the best places where clinical studies can be carried out to&#xD;
      establish the efficacy and safety of vaccine candidates; For the institutions in charge of&#xD;
      elaborating the possible public vaccination policies, knowing the general characteristics of&#xD;
      the localities where the immune response profile and the incidence of the disease are known,&#xD;
      will allow extrapolating this information in localities where only the incidence is known;&#xD;
      For the international scientific community, the results of the proposed project will&#xD;
      contribute to the knowledge of the population characteristics of the endemic transmission of&#xD;
      dengue and its relationship with the endemic-epidemic cycles that are distinctive of the&#xD;
      behaviour of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: What is the distribution and characterization of the humoral immune&#xD;
      response by DENV serotype in areas of low and high dengue endemicity in Mexico? Hypothesis:&#xD;
      In areas with low dengue endemicity, the humoral response against dengue is predominantly&#xD;
      monotypic, whereas in areas of high endemicity for dengue it is predominantly multitypic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives GENERAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● Characterize the predominant type of humoral immune response in people 5 to 35 years of age&#xD;
      who live in Mexican cities with low and high dengue endemicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the general prevalence of antibodies (IgG) against DENV in the study&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the neutralizing antibody titer against DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 in&#xD;
           the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of the type of monotypic and multitypic humoral response in&#xD;
           cities based on their endemicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study design: Descriptive cross-sectional observational study with prospective&#xD;
      data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: Resident population of endemic and non-endemic urban areas for dengue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Subjects aged 5 to 35 years resident of selected localities with high and&#xD;
      low endemicity for dengue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: described below as eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation: it was carried out in the OpenEpi program, Version 3 considering the&#xD;
      prevalences reported by previous studies and extrapolating the information available from&#xD;
      some cities on the degree of dengue endemicity for those localities in which there was no&#xD;
      available information ( 16, 20-21) The formula for the sample size calculation was:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = [DEFF * Np (1-p)] / [(d2 / Z21-α / 2 * (N-1) + p * (1-p)] In total, 2,421 people will&#xD;
      need to be sampled. The selection of participants will be carried out by a two-stage sampling&#xD;
      (by clusters of two stages) for each of the study locations. In the first stage, blocks (n =&#xD;
      50) will be randomly selected in each locality and later, in the second stage, a home will be&#xD;
      selected within each block, starting with the first house on the northeast corner of the&#xD;
      block, if this house does not accept, the community worker will continue to the right until&#xD;
      at least one person from a household, who meets the selection criteria, agrees to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect IgG ELISA to estimate seroprevalence: The seropositivity will be evaluated with&#xD;
      Indirect IgG ELISA following the instructions of the Panbio E-DEN 01 G manufacturer, which&#xD;
      has a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutralizing antibody titers serotype-specific: To establish the type of humoral immunity&#xD;
      that the selected city presents, the measurement of the neutralizing antibody titers will be&#xD;
      carried out through the neutralization test by reducing the number of lytic plaques to 50%&#xD;
      (PRNT50%), using Vero cells and the following reference strains for each serotype: DENV-1&#xD;
      (HAWAI), DENV-2 (NEW GUINEA), DENV-3 (H-887) and DENV-4 (H-24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of humoral immunity will be classified into monotypic immune response if only&#xD;
      antibodies against a single DENV serotype are detected, and multitypic immune response, if&#xD;
      antibodies are detected against more than one single DENV serotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information collection and management: The information will be collected in a standard&#xD;
      format. The survey will be filled out by the interviewer (project staff) based on the filling&#xD;
      instructions. The information will be captured on printed surveys and managed by trained data&#xD;
      loggers in the electronic database designed for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the laboratory tests will be managed only with the folio assigned to each&#xD;
      participant and the results will be entered in a database made in Excel® by the laboratory&#xD;
      staff. The database will include folio, result date and the result. The nominal information&#xD;
      of the survey will be kept separate from the rest of the information, identifying individuals&#xD;
      only by their folio number and protecting their identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative variables will be described with absolute and relative frequencies, and the&#xD;
      quantitative variables will be described with measures of central tendency and dispersion&#xD;
      considering the distribution of each variable. The prevalence of IgG against DENV will be&#xD;
      determined with the respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the total study&#xD;
      population, as well as for each locality, by age group and by sex. Similarly, the prevalence&#xD;
      of neutralizing antibodies for specific serotypes, and the frequency of monotypic and&#xD;
      multipic responses in these same subgroups will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: This study is an investigation with minimal risk, in which only&#xD;
      subjects who agree to participate voluntarily will be considered. For subjects of legal age,&#xD;
      they will be asked to sign the informed consent, in which their voluntary participation is&#xD;
      accredited; In the case of minors, the signature of the informed consent of the parent or&#xD;
      guardian will be requested and if the minor is between 7 years and 17 years old, the&#xD;
      signature of the informed assent will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data security process will consist of separating the nominal information of the survey&#xD;
      from the rest of the information, this will be stored in two tables that will be identified&#xD;
      with a common identification key, to protect the identity of the people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biosafety considerations: The management of infectious biological hazardous waste is&#xD;
      specified in this document. In general, materials in contact with viruses or blood or their&#xD;
      derivatives will be chlorinated for 30 minutes with a 5% sodium hypochlorite solution and&#xD;
      later they will be discarded in a red bag. The needles will be stored in a sharps container&#xD;
      that complies with local guidelines NOM-087.&#xD;
