  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Physical Activity Post-Cancer for Adolescents and Young Adults (PAPAYA) trial aims to&#xD;
      carry out a pilot randomized controlled trial among 10-17 year-old adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults, at least 1 year and up to 5 years post-cancer treatment. The trial will evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of a 12 week physical activity intervention to improve patient reported outcomes and&#xD;
      physical function, in comparison to a delayed-intervention control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 40 adolescents and young adults at least 1 year, and up to 5&#xD;
      years post-cancer treatment, and randomize them (20 randomized to each condition) to either a&#xD;
      12-week physical activity intervention to improve patient-reported outcomes and physical&#xD;
      function, or delayed-intervention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the intervention group: The physical activity intervention will be&#xD;
      structured to increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity, to achieve&#xD;
      the 60 minute goal, five days per week. The intervention will also include weekly support&#xD;
      calls from research staff. The physical activity intervention will be individualized by&#xD;
      research staff according to the adolescents and young adults' health status, results from the&#xD;
      physical fitness assessment, and most recent week's achieved minutes. The physical activity&#xD;
      intervention will be modified during weekly support calls with a study team member, including&#xD;
      frequency, intensity, time, and type, to maximize adherence and compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the delayed-intervention control group: They will not receive the&#xD;
      physical activity intervention, and they will not receive weekly support calls. Physical&#xD;
      activity advice according to the Children's Oncology Group Guidelines for Diet and Physical&#xD;
      Activity recommendations will be offered to participants randomized to the&#xD;
      delayed-intervention control group following completion of 12-week follow-up.&#xD;

Data output from accelerometers will include estimated average metabolic equivalents expended daily, and in hours/week, as well as time in sleep, sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity, using common thresholds for intensity from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A valid day will be defined as 10 or more hours of monitor wear time, and a valid respondent will be defined as 4 or more valid days. Wear time will be determined by subtracting non-wear time from 24 hours and non-wear time will be determined as at least 60 consecutive minutes of 0 counts, with allowance for 1 to 2 minutes of counts between 0 and 100. Data will be aggregated to arrive at one reported value: moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.</description>

    <description>The main structure of the physical activity program will focus on increasing physical activity. Physical activity will initially start at a duration of 15-30 minute bouts, and at rate of perceived exertion levels of ≥12 (somewhat hard). Over the course of the intervention, goals will be set to progress to 60 minutes of continuous physical activity, at a rate of perceived exertion level of 12-14 (somewhat hard). Participants will be instructed on the use of the ratings of the perceived exertion scale (Borg's RPE 6-20 scale). Participants will be instructed to walk, or engage in other forms of leisure-time physical activity to achieve these goals (cycling, running, swimming, etc). As the adolescent and young adults' health and fitness status improve, frequency, intensity, and session duration will be modified accordingly during weekly support calls. Moreover, goals will be responsive to the most recent week's achieved minutes and rate of perceived exertion.</description>
