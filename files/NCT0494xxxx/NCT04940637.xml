      This is a single arm, prospective, interventional, multicenter phase 2 study of the&#xD;
      combination of niraparib and dostarlimab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) and/or malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), and positive for PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥&#xD;
      1%) and germline or somatic mutations in the DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 70 eligible patients with previously treated advanced disease, not amenable for&#xD;
      curative treatment will be included in this study and will be grouped as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Homologous recombination deficiency (HRd)-positive and PD-L1-positive advanced NSCLC&#xD;
           referred to as Cohort A (n= 35)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRd-positive and PD-L1-positive advanced MPM referred to as Cohort B (n= 35)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRd-positive and PD-L1-positive are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRd-positive: Tumors that harbor known or suspected deleterious germline or somatic&#xD;
           mutations in the HRR genes, based on the HRd Assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-L1-positive: Tumors with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumor cells based on&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.&#xD;
