      This Post Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF) study to evaluate the performance and safety of&#xD;
      the cemented TrendHip® stem in a prospective follow-up study with patients who underwent a&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty with the investigational product (representative of usual clinical&#xD;
      practice), at two follow-up examinations&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of functional outcome over five year follow-up period (Harris Hip Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative (as available) and at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) is one of the most used scores in total hip arthroplasty, mainly combining range of motion questions with questions regarding daily life activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), at rest and when walking on flat ground. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a 10 cm line with anchor statements on the left (no pain) and on the right (extreme pain). The patients are asked to mark their current pain level on the line.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with surgery result</measure>
    <time_frame>at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient is asked for satisfaction with surgery result with a 4-point scale: very satisfied, satisfied, unsatisfied, very unsatisfied</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival rate (Kaplan-Meier)</measure>
    <time_frame>at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>The survival of the TrendHip® Total Hip Prothesis will be analyzed using the &quot;Kaplan-Meier&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological Outcome: Migration of the stem in mm</measure>
    <time_frame>at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>Migration of the stem is assessed in [mm] relative to postoperative x-rays</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological Outcome: Evaluation of bony osseointegration or conspicuous features of the stem</measure>
    <time_frame>at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>Bony Osseointegration or conspicuous features of the stem are assessed on anterior-posterior and lateral x-rays of the stem and will be analysed according to the zones defined by Gruen. &quot;Charnley&quot; and &quot;Gruen&quot; zones of the hip are distinct zones used in assessment of aseptic loosening in total hip joint replacements</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological Outcome: Heterotopic Ossification</measure>
    <time_frame>at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>Brooker classification divides heterotopic ossifications that form following total hip replacement to four classes. Class I: islands of bone within soft tissues around hip; Class II: bone spurs in pelvis or proximal end of femur leaving ≥1 cm between the opposing bone surfaces; Class III: bone spurs that extend from pelvis or the proximal end of femur, which reduce the space between the opposing bone surfaces to &lt;1cm; Class IV: ankylosis of the hip on x-ray</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Adverse and Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>at two examinations during Follow-Up (1 year postop, 5 years postop)</time_frame>
    <description>All Adverse Events (AE) / Serious Adverse Events (SAE) observed during the follow-up examination or reported by the patient will be documented. Only those AE and SAE that could be related to the investigational product or the TrendHip® Total Hip Arthroplasty procedure are of interest.</description>
