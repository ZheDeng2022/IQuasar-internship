  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful menstrual bleeding, also known as dysmenorrhea, is one of the common gynecological&#xD;
      ailments that have health, social, and economic implications. Dysmenorrhea has psychological&#xD;
      effects as well as its physiological effects on women. While it negatively affects the&#xD;
      quality of daily life and performance of women, it also causes loss in work and school life.&#xD;
      Acupressure application has a soothing, psychological and analgesic effect. Acupressure&#xD;
      application is also effective in reducing labor pain, low back pain, dysmenorrhea, head, neck&#xD;
      and shoulder pain. It is thought that acupressin used in combination with pharmacological&#xD;
      methods may be effective in relieving pain or decreasing its severity, the rate of analgesic&#xD;
      use may be reduced, therefore analgesic side effects may be less and the patient's quality of&#xD;
      life will increase. positively affected. It is an important part of midwifery care in terms&#xD;
      of its application areas and benefits. As it is an effective method, it is recommended to be&#xD;
      used in the midwifery field in the literature, it is taught and applicable, does not require&#xD;
      medical equipment, equipment and cost. There are no studies in the literature in which&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods of acupressure and massage are used in primary dysmenorrhea. It&#xD;
      is among the duties, powers and responsibilities of midwives to comfort their patients with&#xD;
      non-invasive interventional practice. Based on these, it is thought that the use of&#xD;
      acupressure and massage in primary dysmenorrhea is necessary to examine the level of pain,&#xD;
      menstrual symptoms and their effects on quality of life. The type of the study was planned as&#xD;
      a randomized controlled pre-test-post-test study. The population of the study will be&#xD;
      students who study at Kırşehir Ahi Evran University Faculty of Education, have dysmenorrhea&#xD;
      and meet the study criteria. In the power analysis used to determine the sample size, 5%&#xD;
      error level and 90% power were determined as a minimum of 89 people for each group. The data&#xD;
      of the study will be collected between December and May 2020 with the Personal Information&#xD;
      Form in which socio-demographic characteristics are questioned, the Visual Analogue Scale for&#xD;
      the assessment of dysmenorrhea pain, the Daily Menstrual Symptom Assessment Scale, and the&#xD;
      Short Form of the Quality of Life Scale. (SF-12). Students who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be randomly selected for the experimental and control groups.&#xD;

      Purpose of the Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of acupressure and massage on pain severity,&#xD;
      menstrual symptoms and quality of life in students with primary dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Students who have been treated with acupressure and massage in dysmenorrhea have lower&#xD;
      pain levels than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Pain levels of students who have been treated with acupressure and massage in&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea are lower than those who have only been massaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: The menstrual symptom intensity of students undergoing acupressure and massage in&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea is lower than in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: In menstrual symptom intensity of students who have been treated with acupressure and&#xD;
      massage in dysmenorrhea is lower than those who have been massaged only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: The quality of life of students undergoing acupressure and massage in dysmenorrhea is&#xD;
      higher than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H6: The quality of life of students who have been treated with acupressure and massage in&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea is higher than those who have been massaged only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materıal Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the Study The research was planned as a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place and Time of the Study The research will be carried out between September 2020 and June&#xD;
      2021 in the Faculty of Education randomly selected among the faculties located on the campus&#xD;
      of Kırşehir Ahi Evran University. There are 7 departments in the Faculty of Education:&#xD;
      computer and instructional technology education, educational sciences, mathematics and&#xD;
      science education, turkish and social sciences education, basic education, special education,&#xD;
      foreign language education. As of 2019-2020 academic year, the total number of female&#xD;
      students in the faculty is 1574. There is no course in the curriculum of the departments of&#xD;
      the faculty that includes dismenor, including health information lessons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Universe and the Sample of the Research The universe of the research will be female&#xD;
      students studying at the Education Faculty of Kırşehir Ahi Evran University (N = 1574). The&#xD;
      sample of the research will be students who study at Kırşehir Ahi Evran University Faculty of&#xD;
      Education, experience dysmenorrhea and have criteria for recruitment. For the power analysis&#xD;
      of the study, based on the fact that Uçar et al. (2018) had a mean score of 7.44 (Standard&#xD;
      deviation 2.0) in university students experiencing primary dysmenorrhea, assuming that the&#xD;
      intensity of pain would be 6.6 points in 95% confidence interval, with 80% strength. the size&#xD;
      was determined to be at least 89 for each group. (89 acupressure + massage group, 89 massage&#xD;
      group, 89 control groups). The number of students to be taken from the departments in the&#xD;
      faculty will be determined by proportioning the weights of the departments in the universe.&#xD;
      For this, the number of students in each department will be requested from the faculty. Then,&#xD;
      the Random Integer Generator method will be used to separate the experimental and control&#xD;
      groups. For this, 267 students will be listed, and students from 3 columns in random.org will&#xD;
      be divided into groups according to their numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, dysmenorrhea was defined as the pain during menstrual bleeding. The criteria&#xD;
      included in the scope of pain in dysmenorrhea are pain in the waist, groin or abdomen that&#xD;
      started in the first 6-12 hours and lasted for 8-72 hours in the last 12 months (Ambresin et&#xD;
      al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Personal Information Form (Appendix-1) in collecting data, Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) (Appendix-2), Daily Menstrual Symptom Evaluation Scale (Appendix-3),&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale Short Form SF-12 (Appendix-4) in the evaluation of dysmenorrhea pain It&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Information Form (Annex-1) The questions in the form were prepared by the researcher&#xD;
      in line with the literature information. In this form, students; The questions questioning&#xD;
      the characteristics (age, department, number of class), and the features associated with the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle (age of menarche, bleeding time, pain duration, etc.) were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (Annex-2) VAS is used to measure perceived pain. Painlessness on&#xD;
      one end and 10 cm on the other for the most severe pain. On a (100 mm.) Ruler, the patient&#xD;
      expresses his pain by drawing a line, marking or pointing. The length of the distance from&#xD;
      where there is no pain to the point marked by the patient is measured in centimeters, and the&#xD;
      numerical value found indicates the pain intensity of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Menstrual Symptom Evaluation Scale (GMSSS) (Annex-3) GMSSS was developed by Jenni W.&#xD;
      Taylor (1979) to evaluate the symptoms and intensity of symptoms that occurred during&#xD;
      menstruation. The Turkish validity and reliability of the scale was performed by Oskay et al.&#xD;
      The intensity of each symptom is scored between 0 and 5 on a scale of 17 symptoms. Increased&#xD;
      score indicates that the intensity of symptoms increases. In the study of Oskay et al.&#xD;
      (2008), Cronbach's alpha value of the scale was found to be 0.88.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale Short Form SF-12 (Annex-4) A shorter form SF-12 Short Health Scale was&#xD;
      created by taking 12 different items from 8 different subtitles of SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-12 has a physical (SF12-PCS) and mental (SF12-MCS) status assessment scale with regression&#xD;
      analysis applied in the general population. SF-12 was developed and version 2.0 (SF-12v2) was&#xD;
      created. Words are shortened and simplified, questions and answers are made easier to read to&#xD;
      prevent missing answers, 6-step answer categories are reduced to 5 by reducing complexity,&#xD;
      and answers are simplified by printing in a horizontal (left to right) form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-12 is an easy-to-apply survey, obtained by shortening and simplifying SF-36, with proven&#xD;
      reliability and validity. It is used in the evaluation of physical and mental health, which&#xD;
      are two main components of general health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T-score used when calculating scoring in SF-36 is not used in SF-12. Instead, it is not&#xD;
      possible to calculate if there is missing data in SF-12, which has a different scoring rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Variables Independent Variables: Acupressure and massage treatments applied to&#xD;
      students experiencing dysmenorrhoea Dependent Variables: Pain severity, menstrual symptoms,&#xD;
      quality of life levels of students experiencing dysmenorrhea&#xD;
