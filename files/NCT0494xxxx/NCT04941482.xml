    <textblock>
      This is a multi-intervention randomized controlled trial that aimed to develop a management&#xD;
      pattern for stroke survivors. The program consists of monitoring the recovery process, early&#xD;
      detecting the physical and mental disorders, suitably intervening for each patient to improve&#xD;
      their quality of life. New intervention techniques will be firstly applied for post-stroke&#xD;
      patients in Vietnam such as using the portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)&#xD;
      device to explore cortex frontal hemodynamic and motivational interviewing for psychological&#xD;
      adjustment. A total of registered 92 stroke patients in Vietnam National Geriatrics Hospital&#xD;
      will be included in the study for 6 months. Included patients will be randomized to an&#xD;
      intervention group and received the long-term follow-up program or to a control group&#xD;
      receiving standard care. The mental health and physical functioning of participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. This work was funded by Vingroup Joint Stock&#xD;
      Company and supported by the Domestic Master/Ph.D. Scholarship Programme of Vingroup&#xD;
      Innovation Foundation (VINIF), Vingroup Big Data Institute (VINBIGDATA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a medical condition that occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and&#xD;
      nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (or ruptures). This is a major&#xD;
      cause of death and disability worldwide. Post-stroke patients will experience sudden and&#xD;
      intense changes in their physical and mental health during the first year. Currently, there&#xD;
      is no official management model for improving the physical and mental health of patients&#xD;
      after stroke in Vietnam. Furthermore, traditional neuroimaging techniques such as Functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Positron emission tomography (PET), Electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG) are not suitable for routine monitoring due to limited flexibility dynamics and costs.&#xD;
      Hence, this study aimed to develop a management pattern that includes monitoring the recovery&#xD;
      process, early detecting the physical and mental disorders, suitably intervening for each&#xD;
      patient to improve their quality of life. New intervention techniques will be firstly applied&#xD;
      for post-stroke patients in Vietnam such as using the portable fNIRS device to explore cortex&#xD;
      frontal hemodynamic and motivational interviewing for psychological adjustment. This&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial study will include 92 post-stroke patients with dividing two&#xD;
      groups (46 control &amp; 46 intervention subjects), who experience emergency by stroke within one&#xD;
      week. A multi-intervention program will design for stroke patients including [1] periodic&#xD;
      health examination for assessment of physical and mental health, recurrence risks, and&#xD;
      harmful behaviors; [2] guiding the appropriate rehabilitation exercises for improving the&#xD;
      physical status and monitoring through daily online report; [3] using the motivational&#xD;
      interviewing methods to improve and prevent mental disorder; [4] applicating the technique of&#xD;
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for measurement of oxy-hemoglobin on cortex&#xD;
      prefrontal to early detect mental disorder and stroke recurrence risks. Outcome data will be&#xD;
      collected via study questionnaires and fNIRS measuring results which are administered by&#xD;
      researchers in the study site at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Simultaneously,&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing will carry out on post-stroke patients in the first three months&#xD;
      (one time per week in the first month and one time per the second and third month). This&#xD;
      intervention method aims to discover and resolve patient's conflicts by a standardized&#xD;
      communication skill to improve their mental health and change negative behaviors. The scores&#xD;
      of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), physical and mental assessment scales and fNIRS data in&#xD;
      both the groups will be used to calculate the effect estimates of intervention methods with a&#xD;
      measure of precision (95% CI) and assessed the results of the trial.&#xD;

    <description>The fatigue severity scale (FSS) is a 9-item questionnaire with questions to measure fatigue for stroke patients. The items are scored on a 7 point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The minimum score = 9 and the maximum score possible =63. Higher the score is respectively greater fatigue severity.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was designed as a self-rated questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time. It includes seven subscores, each of which can range from 0 to 3. The subscores are tallied, yielding a total score that can range from 0 to 21. A total score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality; the higher the score, the worse the quality.</description>

There are 3 questions and are scored on a scale of 0-12. Each question has 5 answer choices valued from 0 points to 4 points. In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive, optimal for identifying hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders. In women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive.</description>

    <description>An ordinal measure of nicotine dependence related to cigarette smoking. In scoring the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, yes/no items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple-choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10. The higher the total Fagerström score, the more intense is the patient's physical dependence on nicotine.</description>
