      This study aims at measuring the impact of a night of sleep deprivation over the vocal&#xD;
      characteristics of healthy subjects.To do so, the subjects takes a Multiple Sleep Latency&#xD;
      Test (MSLT) the day after a night of total sleep deprivation (or a supervised normal night&#xD;
      for the control subjects). Before each iteration of the MSLT, the subjects are recorded&#xD;
      during the reading of a text and fill three medical questionnaires : Karolinska Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scale (KSS), Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F) and Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety&#xD;
      (VAS-A), allowing to link variations of vocal markers to the variations of these measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) is a frequent symptom that concerns between 5% and 8% of&#xD;
      the population. The individual consequence of EDS is a diminution of the life quality.&#xD;
      Furthermore, EDS is a cause of high socio-medical costs though the accidental risks that it&#xD;
      induces at work and on the road (Ohayon, Reynolds et al. 2013). Indeed, it is a severe&#xD;
      symptom due to the consequences that it is the cause of. Furthermore, EDS is associated to 5&#xD;
      to 20% of road accidents depending on the type of road network. As a consequence, to&#xD;
      elaborate a sleepiness detection through voice in real time system is a major challenge for&#xD;
      public health-care and medicine. Moreover, it offers benefits from a socio-medical aspect, as&#xD;
      detecting sleepiness through voice doesn't require neither consumables furniture nor&#xD;
      specialized staff to be set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To highlight the effect of sleepiness over voice, investigators designed this experiment&#xD;
      around a night of total sleep deprivation. To measure objective sleepiness of subjects, they&#xD;
      takes a MSLT test the day after a night of total sleep deprivation (or a supervised night for&#xD;
      control). The complementary measures (KSS, VAS-A, VAS-F and Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT))&#xD;
      will allow to study the exact origin of the variations of the vocal markers induced by the&#xD;
      sleep deprivation.&#xD;
