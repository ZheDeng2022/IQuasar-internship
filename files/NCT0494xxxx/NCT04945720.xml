  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1ligand&#xD;
      (PD-L1) immunotherapy have shown promising outcomes in patients with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC), respectively. However, the combination of the two treatments has not been&#xD;
      reported. In this study, we will evaluate the the overall survival (OS)、efficacy and safety&#xD;
      in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Ad-HCC) with portal vein embolism who are&#xD;
      undergoing hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFOX)&#xD;
      treatment combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy (Durvalumab) by designing an open,&#xD;
      single-arm phase II clinical study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoral artery puncture and catheterization were performed in every cycle of treatment,a&#xD;
      micro-catheter was inserted and located in feeding hepatic artery. The therapeutic scheme was&#xD;
      modified FOLFOX6 regimens including oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 infusion for 3 hours on day 1),&#xD;
      leucovorin (200 mg/m2 from hour 3 to 5 on day 1) and Fluorouracil (400 mg/m2 in bolus, and&#xD;
      then 2,400 mg/m2 continuous infusion 46 hours). All chemo-drugs were given by HAI.Patients&#xD;
      received anti-PD-L1 agents will begin no earlier than 7 days following the first HAIC&#xD;
      procedure. Anti-PD-1 agents were used intravenously at the standard dose : Durvalumab was&#xD;
      given every 3 weeks during HAIC treatment (Q3W) and every 4 weeks after HAIC treatment&#xD;
      (Q4W).Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks and continued until intrahepatic lesions&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.Enhanced CT or MRI was performed every 6 weeks after&#xD;
      treatment begins. Routine follow-up intervals were 2-4 months.&#xD;
