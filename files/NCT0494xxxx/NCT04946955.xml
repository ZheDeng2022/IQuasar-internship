  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;France's suicide rate is among the highest in Europe, with the young among the more at risk.&#xD;
      Several European projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of using e-tools in suicide&#xD;
      prevention particularly for hard-to-reach populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lessons from StopBlues, an e-health tool (application/website) for suicide prevention in the&#xD;
      general population developed in 2018 which was promoted by municipalities and general&#xD;
      practitioners, show the necessity to adapt its content for young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to develop an e-health tool for suicide prevention targeting adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults with psychological pain by adapting StopBlues and its promotional plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed content of the e-health tool and its promotional plan will be determined via a&#xD;
      literature review followed by individual and group interviews with experts and youth, with&#xD;
      StopBlues as a starting part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This adaptation of StopBlues will allow to reach a larger audience by offering a more&#xD;
      suitable solution for this vulnerable population. A web-portal will serve as an entry point&#xD;
      for both StopBlues and the new e-tool where users will be redirected to one of the&#xD;
      tools/modules according to their profile and respective needs. &quot;&#xD;

      &quot;Context: France's suicide rate is among the highest in Europe, with the young among the more&#xD;
      at risk. Several European projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of using e-tools in&#xD;
      suicide prevention particularly for hard-to-reach populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lessons from StopBlues, an e-health tool (application/website) for suicide prevention in the&#xD;
      general population developed in 2018 which was promoted by municipalities and general&#xD;
      practitioners, show the necessity to adapt its content for young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Development of the e-health tool The objective of this part is to set up a&#xD;
      consultation to co-construct, on the one hand, an e-mental health tool including a smartphone&#xD;
      application and its website with and for young people adapted to their age group and, on the&#xD;
      other hand, the promotionnal plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The detailed content of the e-health tool and the promotional tools will be&#xD;
      determinated with a literature review and consultations of youth and experts. Then, the&#xD;
      investigators will rely on different networks to invite young people to an online&#xD;
      consultation according to their age group to participate from the start to this intervention.&#xD;
      Several means will be mobilised to involve them. the investigators will discuss with them:&#xD;
      their feelings about the existing StopBlues adult tool (www.stopblues.fr), their perception&#xD;
      of the specific topics that need to be addressed regarding the causes of psychological&#xD;
      suffering, the possible solutions, the identification of speakers who act out situations that&#xD;
      young people can identify with, their opinion on the graphic charter and design, and finally&#xD;
      the means of dissemination that we could use to promote this tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the data saturation method to stop recruiting. The data collection&#xD;
      necessary for the co-construction will be realised on digital platforms through surveys&#xD;
      including questionnaires with either open questions or multiple-choice questions. The data&#xD;
      will then be analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also use the digital platforms mobilised for this consultation to&#xD;
      present the results and validate with participating youth the final version of the content,&#xD;
      structure and ergonomics of the tool to be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: This consultation will allow the project team to co-construct with young&#xD;
      people an e-health intervention involving a mobile application, a website and their&#xD;
      promotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also expect it to provide more precise information on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  youth feelings about the adult version of the tool (StopBlues): its content, its&#xD;
           ergonomics and the means of communication used (videos of professionals and&#xD;
           testimonies);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  youth perception of the specific topics that need to be addressed regarding the causes&#xD;
           of psychological suffering and possible solutions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  youth opinions concerning the graphic charter, the name and logo of the tool; - and&#xD;
           identification of some witnesses or witnesses' relatives to interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Implementation of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the effectiveness in reducing suicidal acts of a suicide&#xD;
      prevention program for young adults in the general population, combining an e-health tool and&#xD;
      its promotion by local authorities. The secondary objectives are to assess the effect of the&#xD;
      programme on youth in terms of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  efficiency of the programme and its total and sectoral budgetary impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mental health status (anxiety and depressive symptoms, addictions, eating disorders,&#xD;
           suicide risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of formal and informal help&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  depression detected by a relative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  user satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effectiveness of the promotion on the intensity of use of the e-health tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  completion of the safety plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  school or employment integration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effectiveness of the tool according to the social status of users&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  spillover effect of the programme on the youth suicide prevention policy: measures put&#xD;
           in place secondarily by the communities involved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the process of implementation of the promotion by the communities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  barriers and levers for studying transferability. Methodology: The trial will last 18&#xD;
           months from the moment the e-tool will be online. Data will be collected both from&#xD;
           health data bases and at the individual user level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The intervention, which includes the development of an e-health tool for&#xD;
      young people and its implementation with a promotion, will make it possible to confirm the&#xD;
      applicability of the intervention model used for adults for suicide prevention in the general&#xD;
      population (StopBlues), on a more restricted population (the E-psyjeunes tool), that of 11-25&#xD;
      year olds. This project will make it possible to address the question, mentioned many times&#xD;
      when StopBlues was set up, of psychological suffering of young people. The malaise of&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults is unique and requires specific development. Through this&#xD;
      project, a response can be provided to the many actors (young people, associations, health&#xD;
      professionals, local authorities, etc.) looking for help and solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this intervention will lead to a reduction in suicidal acts&#xD;
      (suicides and attempted suicides) of young people. With the use of these tool, users should&#xD;
      develop a better knowledge of mental health and suicide in general, but also of their own&#xD;
      mental health status. They should also become more aware of the formal and informal ways of&#xD;
      seeking help and their use of help should increase, as well as their actions increasing&#xD;
      well-being/coping strategies implementation. A decrease in the stigma of mental disorders is&#xD;
      also expected among young people.&quot;&#xD;
