      This study consists of two parts. Phase Ia is a dose escalation study to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MRG002. Phase Ib is a&#xD;
      dose expansion study to further assess the efficacy and safety of MRG002 at confirmed RP2D.&#xD;
