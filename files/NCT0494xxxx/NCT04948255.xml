  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study was designed to assess WRS amongst clinical and non-clinical&#xD;
      staff in a primary healthcare setting using a validated tool with a view to developing an&#xD;
      evidence base to form a historical and comparative record during the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work-related stress (WRS) is the second most common cause of occupational ill health in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom. Studies suggest that during the Covid-19 pandemic, an increased prevalence of&#xD;
      stress-related disorders was reported amongst healthcare workers. WRS can be assessed using&#xD;
      the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) Management Standards Indicator Tool (MSIT) and is&#xD;
      used to compare changes to WRS across six domains over time. Lower scores in domains indicate&#xD;
      higher WRS experienced by workers. Increases in the score in subsequent assessments indicate&#xD;
      improvements to WRS. The MSIT was distributed to 23 primary care clinical and non-clinical&#xD;
      staff in a medical centre in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom in March, 2019. 18 responses&#xD;
      were received from 23 staff (78% response rate), establishing a baseline. In May, 2020, the&#xD;
      authors decided to reanalyse the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on WRS upon the same&#xD;
      population. The MSIT was redistributed in March 2021, with 14 responses from 20 staff (70%&#xD;
      response rate). Microsoft Excel's data analysis was applied to the results. WRS across the&#xD;
      practice increased by 7% in demands, 4% in control and 2% in role domains and improved by 3%&#xD;
      in support, 3% in relationships and 2% in change domains. The results are in keeping with the&#xD;
      global picture of evolving WRS amongst healthcare staff during the pandemic. Monitoring and&#xD;
      addressing WRS regularly helps maintain system-wide resilience when faced with unexpected or&#xD;
      unprecedented change. Comparing these results with WRS in other healthcare systems would be a&#xD;
      useful next step.&#xD;
