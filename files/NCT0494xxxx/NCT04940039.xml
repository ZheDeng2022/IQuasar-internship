    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 66</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SS will be used to provide a clinical measure of the severity of schizophrenia. It is a single-item Likert scale with a 7-point range (1 indicates none to 7 indicates extreme symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>

    <description>An adverse event (AEs) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are AEs with onset during the treatment phase or that are a consequence of a pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline.</description>

    <description>Participants in Observation Phase will receive their treatment prescribed by treating physicians as part of their usual clinical practice and the standard of care (SoC) treatment for Rwanda mental healthcare settings. Participants who have not received risperidone or paliperidone or paliperidone palmitate earlier in Observation Phase will receive oral risperidone 3 milligram (mg) tablets once daily for 3 days in Run-in Phase to determine tolerability. Participants will receive flexible dose range from 50 to 150 mg equivalent (eq.) long acting formulation of paliperidone palmitate once monthly (PP1M) as an intramuscular (IM) injection in Lead-in Treatment Phase for at least 17 weeks (maximum 25 weeks) and if stable dose is achieved for PP1M, participants will enter Maintenance Treatment Phase and continue to receive flexible dose range from 175 to 525 mg eq. long acting formulation of paliperidone palmitate every 3 months (PP3M) as an IM injection for up to 24 weeks.</description>
