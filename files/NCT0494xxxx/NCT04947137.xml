  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish a normative database of Tilmanocept Uptake Values (TUVjoint) in&#xD;
      healthy controls age-matched to the RA population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-dose study designed to develop a&#xD;
      normative database of TUVjoint in HCs and to assess the feasibility of qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative SPECT/CT assessments in HCs and subjects with active RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is stratified into 2 arms. Arm 1 is comprised of HCs and Arm 2 is comprised of HCs&#xD;
      and clinically diagnosed RA subjects on stable treatment.&#xD;

        diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The subject has moderate to severe RA as determined by the 2010 American College of&#xD;

             administration that would deem the subject inappropriate for study participation or&#xD;
             compromise the safety of the subject or the quality of the data.&#xD;
