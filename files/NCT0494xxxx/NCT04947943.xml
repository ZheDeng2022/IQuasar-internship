  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current COVID-19 pandemic implies regular treatment adaptation by physician, according to&#xD;
      scientific publication evolution. Older adults are particularly affected by COVID-19, with&#xD;
      the higher severe form prevalence and the higher mortality rate. Furthermore older peoples&#xD;
      are at high risk of complications cascade, due to the SARS-Voc-2 infection but also because&#xD;
      of chronic diseases decompensation. If risk factors in this population have been identified,&#xD;
      specific treatments to reduce complications or to be curative are less known. However&#xD;
      geriatric care, thanks to its holistic approach, could reduce these complications and improve&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to determine if geriatric care provided in geriatric COVID-19 hospitalisation&#xD;
      units improves survival of older people (aged 65 years and over) at one month in comparison&#xD;
      with conventional COVID-19 hospitalisation unit during the first wave in the Montpellier&#xD;
      University Hospital. Secondary objectives are to determine if clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      older patients are different between conventional and geriatric COVID-19 hospitalisation&#xD;
      units, to assess influence of clinical characteristics of older patients on their survival,&#xD;
      and to determine wich treatment have been delivered for older people during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic first wave in our hospital in view of bibliographic data available at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVAGERT is a monocentric, descriptive, observational and retrospective study, including all&#xD;
      older adults aged 65 years and over hospitalised in the geriatric COVID-19 and the&#xD;
      conventional COVID-19 units of the Montpellier University Hospital during the first wave of&#xD;
      the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic (between March 1th 2020 and September 1th 2020). Principal outcome is&#xD;
      the survival one months after the RT-PCR positive test. Some data about treatments, medical&#xD;
      history, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected from the medical&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using univariate and multivariate regressions&#xD;
      according to the study's objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be useful to determine the bring of geriatric care during the current pandemic,&#xD;
      but also to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary assessment in this complex disease&#xD;
      and for further emergency medical challenges.&#xD;
