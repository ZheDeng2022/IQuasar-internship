      The effectiveness study for Culturally-Adapted Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (CA-CBI)&#xD;
      will be conducted with individuals infected with and recovered from Coronavirus disease&#xD;
      (COVID-19) to measure if this intervention is effective in decreasing the COVID-19 survivors'&#xD;
      psychological distress. Potential participants will be given an informed consent and then,&#xD;
      they will be included in a screening procedure to assess their eligibility. 86 participants&#xD;
      (43 in experimental and 43 in control group-randomly assigned) who pass the screening&#xD;
      procedure will be invited to the effectiveness study. The experimental group will receive an&#xD;
      8-session intervention while the control group will receive a brief psychoeducation about&#xD;
      problems during COVID-19 pandemic and information about the freely available psychological&#xD;
      support options. The measurements will be conducted three times; one week before, one week&#xD;
      after and five weeks after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has an enormous psychological impact worldwide. Individuals with&#xD;
      suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have been defined as one of the most vulnerable groups&#xD;
      suffering from psychological distress during the pandemic. Individuals who were infected with&#xD;
      and recovered from COVID-19 had a significantly increased risk for developing psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions such as anxiety and mood disorders, substance use disorders, and insomnia, even&#xD;
      when comparing with individuals who had other respiratory tract infections. In addition,&#xD;
      these psychiatric conditions remained elevated at the 6-month period for COVID-19 survivors.&#xD;
      Therefore, COVID-19 survivors should be considered to be in need of an urgent intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics of other infectious diseases, more&#xD;
      evidence-based psychosocial interventions should be implemented via online services.&#xD;
      Group-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the interventions identified as&#xD;
      effective in decreasing adverse psychological outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as of&#xD;
      Ebola and Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). One of the forms of CBT is culturally&#xD;
      adapted CBT (CA-CBT) developed by Hinton. CA-CBT is a trans-diagnostic method targeting&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral changes while emphasizing emotion regulation and psychological&#xD;
      flexibility with some techniques such as mindfulness exercises, meditation, and applied&#xD;
      stretching. In Turkey, CA-CBT was tested on adolescents and found to be effective in&#xD;
      decreasing the adolescents' anxiety and depression symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial in order to implement&#xD;
      culturally adapted cognitive behavioral intervention (CA-CBI) to COVID-19 survivors and&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the psychological distress for&#xD;
      this particular group. After the screening phase and baseline assessment, the investigators&#xD;
      will randomly assign the eligible participants into two arms (CA-CBI and Enhanced Treatment&#xD;
      as Usual) and deliver CA-CBI in an online group format to the experimental arm. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess whether the psychological distress levels and common mental health&#xD;
      problems of the COVID-19 survivors in the experimental arm are decreased compared to the&#xD;
      control arm. The investigators will examine the study outcomes of the both arms at three&#xD;
      times: Pre-assessment (1 week before the intervention), post-assessment (1 week after the&#xD;
      intervention) and follow-up assessment (1 month after the post-assessment). A process&#xD;
      evaluation according to the World Health Organization (WHO) will be completed with 5 study&#xD;
      completers, 5 drop-outs and 2 facilitators to evaluate the feasibility of delivering CA-CBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the knowledge, CA-CBI has not been conducted with survivors of an infectious disease&#xD;
      before. Also, there are scarce publications on mental health interventions implemented to&#xD;
      COVID-19 survivors. There is a need for more evidence-based psychological interventions that&#xD;
      can be applied to the times of COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics of infectious diseases,&#xD;
      especially for vulnerable groups. Therefore, the investigators will contribute to the&#xD;
      literature by applying online-delivered group-based CA-CBI to COVID-19 survivors with&#xD;
      increased levels of psychological distress.&#xD;
