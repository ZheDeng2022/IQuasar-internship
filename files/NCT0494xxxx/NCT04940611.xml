  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with complex fistulizing conditions will be treated with surgical&#xD;
      interventions according to their clinic's standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to generate real-world evidence on standard of care for surgical&#xD;
      interventions and related outcomes when treating complex fistulizing conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective study of participants with complex fistulizing&#xD;
      conditions (CPF-CD, CD develops CD-RVF and CCF) who are currently undergoing surgical&#xD;
      intervention in the real world clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 750 participants. The data will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively at the study sites and will be recorded into electronic data capture forms&#xD;
      (EDCs). Participants will be enrolled to the following observational cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants With CPF-CD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants With CD-RVF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants With CCF&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center study will be conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Israel.&#xD;
      Participants undergoing surgical interventions to treat fistulas will be enrolled from&#xD;
      surgical and gastrointestinal (GI) specialty sites. The overall duration of the study will be&#xD;
      24 months. Data will be collected at baseline with follow-up information collected&#xD;
      approximately every 3 to 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical remission for Complex perianal fistula in Crohn's Disease (CPF-CD) and Complex Cryptoglandular Fistula (CCF) is defined as closure of all index treated external fistula openings that were draining at baseline as assessed clinically despite gentle finger compression. Clinical remission for Rectovaginal fistula with Crohn's Disease (CD-RVF) is defined as epithelization of the index external fistula opening (vaginal opening) compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>Post-surgical complications for CPF-CD and CCF is defined as post-index surgery perianal pain, bleeding, infection, urinary retention, delayed or poor wound healing, anal stenosis, and fecal incontinence related to index surgery. Post-surgical complications for CD-RVF is defined as post-index surgery vaginal bleeding, infection, urinary retention, urinary tract infections (UTIs), discharge, delayed or poor wound healing, anal stenosis, fecal incontinence, and pain with intercourse or others related to index surgery.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Combined Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-index surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Combined remission for CPF-CD and CCF is defined as closure of all index external fistula openings treated with surgery that were draining at baseline as assessed clinically despite gentle finger compression, and absence of fluid collections greater than (&gt;) 2 centimeter (cm) in at least 2 dimensions, as confirmed by pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging procedure. Combined remission for CD-RVF is defined as 100 percent (%) cessation of drainage on both clinical exam with deep palpation (deeper bimanual exam/palpation with speculum and/or anoscope) and epithelization of the index external fistula opening (vaginal opening) compared to baseline; and absence of fluid collection as assessed by MRI or other imaging procedure.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Cessation of Drainage in Treated Fistula</measure>

    <description>Cessation of drainage for CPF-CD and CCF is defined as 100% cessation of drainage from index treated fistula, as assessed clinically. Cessation of drainage for CD-RVF is defined as 100% cessation of drainage on clinical exam with deep palpation (deeper bimanual exam/palpation with speculum and/or anoscope) from the index treated fistula.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Relapse of Fistula in Clinical Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-index surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse for CPF-CD and CCF is defined as reopening of any surgically treated index fistulae as clinically assessed; or the development of a perianal fluid collection &gt;2 cm in at least 2 dimensions of the perianal fistula(s) treated, confirmed by MRI assessment or other imaging procedure; or drainage. Relapse for CD-RVF is defined as reopening of any surgically treated index fistulae as clinically assessed; or appearance of fluid collection as assessed by MRI or other imaging procedure; or drainage.</description>
