  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-121 is being developed for use in the treatment of autistic disorder (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over&#xD;
      single-site Phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of SB-121&#xD;
      in subjects ages 15 to 45 years with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, multiple measures of AD, as well as mechanistic biomarkers, will be assessed in&#xD;
      order to inform later stage trials.&#xD;

    <description>The ABC is an informant-based questionnaire consisting of 58 items subdivided amongst 5 scales: irritability, lethargy and social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/non-compliance, and inappropriate speech (Aman 1985). A score for each item ranges from 0 indicating &quot;no problem&quot; to 3 indicating &quot;severe problem&quot;. Scale scores are calculated by summing the items within that scale. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

    <description>The Spatial Relations and Auditory Attention subtests of the WJ-III will be administered. The Spatial Relations subtest will assess the visual spatial thinking domain with a task that requires the identification of parts needed to form a complete shape. Responses can be oral or motoric (pointing). The Auditory Attention subtest will assess auditory processing (speech/sound discrimination) requiring the identification of orally presented words amid increasingly intense background noise. Examinees point to a picture of the word presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Period 1: Days 1 (pre-dose) and 28; Period 2: Days 1 (pre-dose) and 28 (period = 28 days and 14 days wash-out)</time_frame>
    <description>The KiTap is an automated computer based assessment of attentional performance developed and normed for the pediatric population. Despite its development in pediatrics, the KiTap is well suited for use in developmental disabilities across all age ranges and has been normed specifically in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) in adults and youth (Knox 2012). The task presents an enchanted castle animation and investigates performance in a number of areas including Alertness, Vigilance, Visual Scanning, Distractibility, Attention, Flexibility, and Sustained Attention.</description>
