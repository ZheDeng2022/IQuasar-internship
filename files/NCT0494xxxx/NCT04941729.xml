  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare OR3O™ Dual Mobility System to a conventional,&#xD;
      single-bearing design Total Hip System in subjects who undergo Primary THA. Data collected in&#xD;
      this study will be used to support National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) regulatory&#xD;
      approval of OR3O™ Dual Mobility System in China as well as to support and maintain product&#xD;
      registration in global markets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Assess safety and efficacy of the OR3O™ Dual Mobility System in Primary&#xD;
      THA at 1 year postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s): Assess safety and efficacy of the OR3O™ Dual Mobility System and&#xD;
      compatible components in Primary THA up to 2 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Objective(s): Assess the hip dislocation and hospital readmission up to 2 years after&#xD;
      device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 study sites in China.&#xD;

    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of excellent (≥ 90) or good (80-89) HHS scores at 12 month postoperative.&#xD;
The Harris Hip Score is a joint specific score that consists of 10 items covering domains of pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), functional activities, absence of deformity (1 item, 0 or 4 points), and hip range of motion (2 items, 0-5 points). Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score is a joint specific score that consists of 10 items covering domains of pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), functional activities, absence of deformity (1 item, 0 or 4 points), and hip range of motion (2 items, 0-5 points). Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).&#xD;
HHS scores for each subject will further be categorized as follows: Excellent (90-100); Good (80-89); Fair (70-79); Poor (60-69) and; Very poor (&lt;60). Shift tables from the preoperative visit to all postoperative visits using these classifications will be generated.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol (European Quality of Life) Five-dimensional Five-level (EQ-5D-5L) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is composed of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses are coded as single-digit numbers expressing the severity level selected in each dimension. For instance, 'slight problems' (e.g. 'I have slight problems in walking about') is always coded as '2'. The digits for the five dimensions are combined in a 5-digit code. The EQ- 5D-5L index value is derived by using the vendor supplied calculator to convert each 5-digit EQ-5D-5L profile. The EQ VAS corresponds to a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale ranging from 'the best health you can imagine' to 'the worst health you can imagine'. A higher number is a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (HOOS JR.)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS JR. is a short-form survey based on the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) that specifically focuses on the outcome after THA. HOOS JR. consists of 2 areas: pain (2 items) and function, daily living (4 items). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes - no, mild, moderate, severe, extreme) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. An interval score from 0-100 (0 indicating total hip disability and 100 indicating perfect hip health) is calculated (15).</description>
