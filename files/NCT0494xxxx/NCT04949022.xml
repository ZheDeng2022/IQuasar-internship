  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced hybrid-closed loop&#xD;
      system, Minimed 780G to glycemic control and safety in children aged 2-6 years with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study evaluates the perceived burden of the diabetes treatment to families&#xD;
      during the advanced hybrid-closed loop system treatment (diabetes distress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study, where primary endpoint is the change&#xD;
      in TIR after hybrid-closed loop system initiation. Secondary endpoints are safety (number of&#xD;
      severe hypoglycaemias and diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA), HbA1c, time below range (TBR), mean&#xD;
      sensor glucose (SG), standard deviation of SG, and coefficient of variation (CV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are 1) TDD (total insulin daily dose) ≥ 8 units, 2) HbA1c &lt; 10%, 3)&#xD;
      capability to use pump and the CGM, and 4) time from diabetes diagnosis more than 6 months.&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder, a condition, which in&#xD;
      the opinion of the investigator would put the participant at risk during the trial.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of small children's type 1 diabetes (T1D) is challenging. There is often great&#xD;
      day-to-day and within-day variability in glucose levels and HbA1c targets are hard to&#xD;
      achieve. The results on hybrid closed loop systems (HCL) in children have been encouraging,&#xD;
      suggesting that an algorithm, which automatically doses basal insulin based on sensor glucose&#xD;
      (SG) levels, improves time in range (TIR) (3.9-10 mmol/l / 71-180 mg/dl) and reduces the time&#xD;
      spent below range (TBR). Despite of these improvements, the target level of TIR (70%) has not&#xD;
      been reached in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pivotal studies, Minimed 780G advanced HCL system has helped children over 7 years old to&#xD;
      reach higher TIR and improve mealtime glycaemia without increasing TBR, severe hypoglycaemias&#xD;
      or ketoacidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the effectiveness to glycemic control and safety of advanced&#xD;
      hybrid-closed loop system, Minimed 780G, in children aged between 2.0-6.99 years, with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is explained to the participants (2.0-6.99 year-old children) orally.&#xD;
      Informed consent from participants' caregivers and those participants who can write will be&#xD;
      taken by investigators, clinicians or diabetes nurses. The investigator will explain the&#xD;
      nature of the study to the subject, and answer all questions regarding this study. Prior to&#xD;
      any study-related screening procedures being performed on the participant, the informed&#xD;
      consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by participant's caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a two week run-in-phase in open loop Manual mode, which equals for&#xD;
      standard sensor augmented pump (SAP) treatment (this feature is also in the same device),&#xD;
      which is followed by a three month study phase with advanced hybrid closed loop Auto mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be given an advanced HCL pump (MiniMed 780G™ system with SmartGuard&#xD;
      Medtronic, Northridge, CA). Minimed 780g™ is an insulin pump, which doses insulin&#xD;
      automatically to patients subcutaneous tissue every 5 minutes based on SG values. The maximal&#xD;
      dosing is based on participants TDD. The SmartGuard feature uses meal information, up to date&#xD;
      SG reading, and SG target values to control basal insulin delivery. Additionally, it can&#xD;
      automatically deliver a correction bolus to correct a high SG reading. The MiniMed 780G&#xD;
      insulin pump requires a minimum of eight units and a maximum of 250 units per day to operate&#xD;
      using the SmartGuard feature (Medtronic Minimed 780g™ system user guide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device has CE mark and is indicated to children aged over 7 years who require insulin&#xD;
      over 8 units/day. In manufacturers safety studies, no adverse effects (diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;
      (DKA) or severe hypoglycaemias) has been reported in children over 7 years old who had TDD&#xD;
      over 8 units/day (MDT personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion set of insulin pump is changed every 2-3 days by patients' caregivers. The&#xD;
      material connected to subcutaneous tissue is Teflon. The SG values are measured by continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor (CGM). The used CGM is Guardian3 sensor, which is integrated to Minimed 780g™&#xD;
      system. It measures the glucose level in the subcutaneous tissue. The CGM sensor connects to&#xD;
      a transmitter that sends the glucose data to insulin pump. The sensor is worn for 7 days and&#xD;
      then replaced with a new one by the participants' caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traceability is achieved by each device's serial number (insulin pump, CGM transmitter).&#xD;
      The glucose sensors, infusion sets, reservoirs and glucose sensors have lot numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The families are trained to use the device by Medtronic's local representatives (technical&#xD;
      issues), diabetes nurses, and clinicians (dosing and other medical issues). If the family has&#xD;
      been on a sensor augmented pump (SAP) treatment previously, training includes one 3 hour&#xD;
      session, a normal procedure in our clinic, at the outpatient clinic. If family has no&#xD;
      previous experience on pump treatment or CGM, they will first try CGM out for 2 weeks and&#xD;
      then 3-days visit on day hospital is arranged to first learn the basics on insulin pump&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, it was estimated that a significant difference in increased TIR&#xD;
      between the advanced HCL treatment and the Manual mode would be 10% and the standard&#xD;
      deviation is expected to be 13%. Taken these into account, the power of 90% to detect a&#xD;
      difference between the modes with type 1 error rate of 0.05, 35 participants should complete&#xD;
      the protocol. The dropout rate is estimated to be less than 3%, thus 38 HCL systems have been&#xD;
      reserved for 38 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ISSUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki. This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP), as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and in&#xD;
      accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and&#xD;
      2005/28/EC (or Regulation (EU) No 536/2014). The ethics committee of Helsinki University&#xD;
      Hospital and The Finnish Medicines Agency has approved the study protocol.&#xD;
