  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized controlled study. This study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      acceptability and efficacy of a newly developed mobile application in the dietary management&#xD;
      of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of CKD has reached 10.8% in China. Increasing in prevalence of other&#xD;
      non-communicable disease such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity is contributing to this&#xD;
      rise in CKD and end-stage renal disease prevalence. Diet is a strong modifiable factor in&#xD;
      these diseases. Dietary control is also an integral part in CKD disease self management.&#xD;
      However, the complexity in the dietary management of CKD makes it hard for patients to&#xD;
      adequately self manage. With the development of smart phone, many mobile applications have&#xD;
      been developed to suit the need of patients with chronic diseases. But there has been a&#xD;
      scarce of randomized trial to support the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of these&#xD;
      mobile applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to employ a newly developed dietary logging and monitoring application in the&#xD;
      primary care setting of CKD patients to test its acceptability and efficacy in disease&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application is developed by a multidisciplinary team in a tertiary care center. The main&#xD;
      features include searching and logging foods, receiving realtime feedback on key nutrient&#xD;
      intake levels and facilitating patient-care giving communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 14 tertiary hospitals and 42 secondary hospitals in 7 geographical regions&#xD;
      in China aiming to reach participants in resource poor areas. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      with 1 to 1 ratio to either receiving mobile application dietary intervention or usual&#xD;
      dietary consultation. The planned intervention period is 3 months. We will monitor&#xD;
      biochemical parameters relating to dietary control and evaluate patient-centered outcomes&#xD;
      concerning CKD self management and control.&#xD;
