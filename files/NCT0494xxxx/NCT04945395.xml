  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of functional electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (FES) for recovery of dorsiflexion after stroke. It will be led from the University&#xD;
      Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at Danderyd Hospital (RMDS) in collaboration with the&#xD;
      MoveAbility Lab at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Patients referred to RMDS for inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation early after hemiparetic stroke will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to explore how 4 weeks of training incorporating the FES-system (L300 Go&#xD;
      System ® Bioness, Ottobock) effect function of the lower extremity, gait function and&#xD;
      mobility when compared to conventional training only, in the subacute stage after stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be included and allocated to either experimental group with training&#xD;
      incorporating the FES-system and conventional training or to control group with conventional&#xD;
      training only. Data will be collected before and after the intervention at RMDS and at the&#xD;
      MoveAbility Lab. Physical tests and self-scored questionnaires of self-perceived aspects of&#xD;
      functioning and disability will be performed at RMDS and gait analysis with 3D cameras and&#xD;
      assessment of muscle function with EMG will be performed at the MoveAbilityLab. In addition,&#xD;
      a short assessment of body function and activity will be performed weekly at RMDS by the&#xD;
      therapist responsible for the rehabilitation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will wear the FES-system L300 Go at all times when the patient is&#xD;
      taking part in rehabilitation interventions involving the lower extremity led or instructed&#xD;
      by a physiotherapist. The settings will be adjusted by the employee from the technical&#xD;
      company and/or the physiotherapist continuously during the intervention if needed. The system&#xD;
      will register the distance and time accomplished during each session. Due to risk of skin&#xD;
      irritation, if the system is overused in the beginning the experimental group will have&#xD;
      access to an ankle-foot-orthosis too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will wear an ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) and receive conventional training.&#xD;
      The control group will wear a FES-system too, to record the distance and time accomplished&#xD;
      during each session, but the system will not be active for stimulation.&#xD;
