  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ACO/ARO/AIO-21 investigator-driven, open-labeled, phase I drug re-purposing trial will&#xD;
      assess whether the IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra can be safely combined with&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with rectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectal excision&#xD;
      (TME) surgery 6-10 weeks thereafter, followed by optional adjuvant chemotherapy, has been the&#xD;
      standard multimodal treatment for patients with UICC stage II and III rectal cancer during&#xD;
      the last two decades. With this, pathological complete response rates (pCR) are in the range&#xD;
      of 10%, 3 year-local failure rates in the range of 5%, distant recurrences occur in 25-30% of&#xD;
      patients, and 3 years disease-free survival (DFS) amounts to 70%. More recently, total&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) with either 5x5 Gy or fluoropyrimidine-CRT, followed by&#xD;
      consolidation chemotherapy with fluorouracil (or capecitabine) and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (FOLFOX/CAPOX), and TME, has significantly improved pCR and DFS compared to standard&#xD;
      preoperative FU-CRT (+/- adjuvant chemotherapy) in recent phase 3 trials for patients with&#xD;
      high-risk rectal cancer and has recently been accepted as standard treatment for this patient&#xD;
      subgroup. In contrast, it remains unclear whether patients with intermediate risk rectal&#xD;
      cancer benefit from TNT (currently under investigation in trials), whereas elderly and frail&#xD;
      patients are not eligible for TNT and are rather be treated with 5x5 Gy or capecitabine-CRT&#xD;
      alone. IL-1 is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in tumor formation, progression&#xD;
      and therapy resistance. Extensive studies of our group have showed that IL-1 mediates CRT&#xD;
      resistance and disease progression in rectal cancer. Thus, blockade of IL-1 signaling using&#xD;
      Anakinra constitutes an attractive option to significantly improve prognosis. The&#xD;
      ACO/ARO/AIO-21 phase I drug re-purposing trial will assess whether the IL-1RA Anakinra can be&#xD;
      safely combined with CRT in patients with rectal cancer.&#xD;
