      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of aromatherapy application on cognitive&#xD;
      functions, anxiety and sleep quality in elderly people with diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to its physiological complications, diabetes is a disease that has negative&#xD;
      effects on cognitive functions and is accompanied by anxiety and sleep problems. These&#xD;
      problems negatively affect diabetes management and glycemic control. Ensuring glycemic&#xD;
      control is the most important goal of diabetes treatment. The chronic and progressive nature&#xD;
      of diabetes, the continuous increase in the number of individuals with diabetes and the&#xD;
      accompanying problems lead the individual to seek alternative treatment methods in addition&#xD;
      to clinical medical treatment. When the literature is examined, it is seen that aromatherapy&#xD;
      is used in many clinical applications. Studies have shown the positive effects of lavender&#xD;
      and rosemary and aromatherapy on cognitive functions, anxiety and sleep problems. However, no&#xD;
      comprehensive studies on its effects in the elderly with diabetes were found. This study was&#xD;
      planned to determine the effect of aromatherapy application on cognitive functions, anxiety&#xD;
      and sleep quality in elderly people with diabetes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration Test (BOMCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 6 items. It is a test that evaluates the cognitive functions of orientation, memory and concentration. To reach a total score of 28 (worst score) in the scale, the number of errors in the scale in each item is multiplied by the weighted coefficients determined. In the scale evaluation, a point is given to each error in the answers given by the individual, and the total score is obtained by multiplying the scores given differently by the weight points determined differently for each question. An increase in the score indicates a decline in cognitive functions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Scale (PUKI)</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale includes a total of 24 questions and 19 questions are self-report questions and are answered by the individual. Five questions are answered by the spouse or roommate and are not included in the scoring. The 18 items participating in the scoring were grouped into seven components. Each component is evaluated between 0-3 points (0: good, 3: bad). The total score ranges from 0 to 21 and consists of the sum of all components. A high total scale score indicates poor sleep quality. If the total score is 5 or more, it is classified as poor sleep quality, if the total score is between 0-4, the sleep quality is good, and between 5-21, the sleep quality is poor.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of two parts:&#xD;
State Anxiety Scale: It is a 4-point Likert-type scale consisting of 20 questions aiming to measure how individuals feel themselves at the moment. The scores obtained from the scale range from 20 to 80, with high scores indicating high anxiety and low scores indicating low anxiety levels. 0-19 points from the scale indicate that there is no anxiety, 20-39 points indicate mild, 40-59 points moderate, 60-79 points indicate the level of severe anxiety, and a score above 60 indicates the need for professional help.&#xD;
Trait Anxiety Scale: It indicates how the person feels during the process, regardless of the situation and conditions. The scores obtained from the scale vary between 20 and 80, and a high score indicates a high level of anxiety, and a low score indicates a low level of anxiety. 0-30 indicates low anxiety, 31-49 indicates moderate anxiety, and 50 and higher indicates high anxiety.</description>
