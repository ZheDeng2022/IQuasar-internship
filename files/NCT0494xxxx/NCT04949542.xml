  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research project aims to develop and test a mobile health intervention designed&#xD;
      to improve caregivers' illness knowledge and caregiving skills through interactive&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral modules, and through these improvements, reduce distress, improve&#xD;
      coping, improve family communication, increase caregiver treatment facilitation and reduce&#xD;
      duration of untreated psychosis. This clinical trial will involve a remote pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing this new intervention to existing online caregiving support&#xD;
      resources. Analyses will determine whether this approach is acceptable and feasible, as well&#xD;
      as explore its effectiveness and impact on key components of the cognitive model of&#xD;
      caregiving.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Family communication</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Family communication will be assessed with the Family Questionnaire (FQ). The FQ is a 20-item self-report assessment of criticism and emotional expression in interactions with family members toward patients with mental illness. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (1 = never/very rarely; 4 = very often). The FQ is scored by summing individual items with higher scores indicating greater levels of expressed emotion. As a primary outcome, we will examine the combined total of emotional overinvolvement and critical comments; scores range from 20 to 80 with higher scores indicating greater expressed emotion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment facilitation (general)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment facilitation / duration of untreated psychosis will be assessed according to participants' report of appointments attended by their relative in the past during the treatment period in a variety of categories (i.e. psychiatry, counseling/psychotherapy, vocational support, primary care, other). This will allow the study team to quantify the number of days until any treatment was initiated by the affected relative during the study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment facilitation (specialty)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment facilitation / duration of untreated psychosis will be assessed according to participants' report of appointments attended by their relative in the past during the treatment period in a variety of categories (i.e. psychiatry, counseling/psychotherapy, vocational support, primary care, other). This will allow the study team to quantify the number of days until coordinated specialty care (CSC) treatment was initiated by the affected relative during the study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Illness knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed with the Knowledge About Schizophrenia (KAST), an 18-item multiple-choice assessment examining individuals' knowledge of the etiology, symptoms, and prognosis of schizophrenia. Total scores indicate the number of correct responses, and thus range from 0 to 18.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Illness appraisals, consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Illness appraisals will be assessed with the Illness Perception Questionnaire for Schizophrenia Relatives (IPQ), a self-report scale of caregivers' beliefs about the severity, prognosis, and responsiveness to treatment of mental illnesses. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly agree; 5 = strongly disagree). The IPQ is scored by summing individual items with higher scores indicating strong negative feelings and thoughts. For the consequences total, we are totaling the 20 items related to consequences affecting the caregiver and the affected person. Scores range from 20 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater perceptions of negative consequences.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Illness appraisals, control</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Illness appraisals will be assessed with the Illness Perception Questionnaire for Schizophrenia Relatives (IPQ), a self-report scale of caregivers' beliefs about the severity, prognosis, and responsiveness to treatment of mental illnesses. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly agree; 5 = strongly disagree). The IPQ is scored by summing individual items with higher scores indicating strong negative feelings and thoughts. For the control total, we are totaling the 13 items related to caregiver, affected person, and treatment control over illness course. Scores range from 13 to 65 with higher scores indicating greater perceptions of possibilities for actions that affect the course of illness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiving experiences, negative</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiving skill will be assessed with the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI). The ECI is a 66-item assessment of the impact of caregiving on the individual's life, both in negative (e.g. stigma, problems with service, dependency and loss) and positive ways (e.g. rewarding personal experiences and good aspects of the relationship). The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (never to nearly always). The negative score is derived from summing the 52 negative scale items (ECI-neg), ranges from 0 to 208 with higher scores indicating greater frequency of negative caregiving experiences.</description>

    <measure>Caregiving experiences, positive</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiving skill will be assessed with the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI). The ECI is a 66-item assessment of the impact of caregiving on the individual's life, both in negative (e.g. stigma, problems with service, dependency and loss) and positive ways (e.g. rewarding personal experiences and good aspects of the relationship). The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (never to nearly always). The positive score is derived from summing the 14 positive scale items (ECI-pos), ranges from 0 to 56 with higher scores indicating greater frequency of positive caregiving experiences.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver coping</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver coping will be assessed with the Brief COPE Inventory, a 28-item self-report scale of coping skills in response to stressors, based on the full COPE inventory; items generate a range of subscale scores related to specific coping areas. The instrument consists of 28 items which will be scored on a 0 to 3 Likert scale, with higher values representing a greater frequency of engaging in each coping strategy. For this outcome, we will examine total frequency scores of 16-items assessing coping skills proposed a priori as positive (Szmukler et al., 1996). Total scores range from 0 to 48 with higher scores indicating more adaptive coping.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver distress (secondary mediator) will be assessed with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a 12-item questionnaire assessing general psychological morbidity. Respondents indicate agreement on a four-point scale (0 = Not at all; 3 = More than usual) and total scores ranging from 0 to 36 with higher scores indicating more severe psychological morbidity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention feasibility will be assessed with usage statistics, including time spent in the application and number of days in the study period that the app was engaged.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention acceptability / usability</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Usability/acceptability will be assessed with a modified version of the System Usability Scale derived from our group's previous work developing mHealth interventions. This measure, which comprises 26 items based on four measures - the System Usability Scale, Post Study System Usability Scale,Technology Assessment Model Measurement Scales, and Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease Questionnaire - assesses participants' experiences with the intervention during the study period. Each item is scored on a 3-point scale (1 = disagree; 3 = agree).</description>
