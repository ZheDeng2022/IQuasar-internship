    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective Phase 1a open-label single- center trial. It will assess the&#xD;
      safety of intrathecal administration of DUOC-01 cells to adults with Primary Progressive&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS). DUOC-01 is a population of cells expanded from donated human&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood cells and is intended for treatment of neurodegenerative and&#xD;
      demyelinating diseases. There will be approximately 20 participants enrolled. Exploratory&#xD;
      objectives include changes in MS assessment scores, changes in brain MRI findings, and&#xD;
      changes in blood biomarkers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective phase 1a open-label, single center trial. It is designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety of administration of escalating doses of DUOC-01 intrathecally to adults&#xD;
      with PPMS. DUOC-01 is a population of cells expanded from donated human umbilical cord blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells. Immunodepletion and selection studies demonstrated that DUOC-01 cells are&#xD;
      derived from CB CD14+ monocytes. Based on pre-clinical rodent models, this cell product is&#xD;
      considered a candidate for the treatment of injury-induced Central Nervous System (CNS)&#xD;
      demyelination and modulation of neuroinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 participants will be enrolled. DUOC-01 will be infused into the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal infusion). The first 3 subjects will receive a single dose&#xD;
      of 10 million cells (cohort 1). The next 3 subjects will receive a single intrathecal dose of&#xD;
      &gt;10 to 25 million cells (cohort 2), if manufacturing of this yield is reliable. The final 14&#xD;
      patients will receive a single intrathecal dose of &gt;25 to 50 million cells (cohort 3), if&#xD;
      manufacturing of this yield is reliable. Subjects will be followed for 12 months post&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified and screened for eligibility for the study. HLA typing will&#xD;
      be performed on the participant, and once results become available, several &gt;4/6 matched cord&#xD;
      blood units (CBUs) will be selected from the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank (CCBB), an FDA&#xD;
      licensed public cord blood bank at Duke University in Durham, NC. Cord blood units will have&#xD;
      complete donor screening and testing per banking regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frozen CBU will be transferred to the GMP manufacturing facility at Duke University&#xD;
      Medical Center per standard practice. Production, testing and release of DUOC-01 will take&#xD;
      19-21 days. Within 14 days prior to planned administration, subjects will receive a baseline&#xD;
      brain MRI and be re-screened on MS assessments. Subjects will not be infused with DUOC-01&#xD;
      cells if they no longer meet inclusion criteria or if no qualifying DUOC-01 cells are&#xD;
      available. If there is a failure of DUOC-01 manufacturing, a second cord blood unit, if&#xD;
      available, will be utilized for repeat manufacturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DUOC-01 administration will occur by a trained clinician. A lumbar puncture (insertion of a&#xD;
      needle into the lower back, into the cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF)) will be performed and&#xD;
      baseline CSF samples will be obtained. The DUOC-01 product will be injected into the CSF&#xD;
      (intrathecally) and appropriate monitoring will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post administration, all subjects will remain in the hospital for 24-hour observation. At 2&#xD;
      weeks post administration subjects will participate in a virtual visit to evaluate for&#xD;
      adverse events. Subjects will receive follow up visits with functional evaluation, biomarker&#xD;
      sampling and brain MRI at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
