  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DS-1062a in participants with&#xD;
      metastatic, unresectable NSCLC having progressed on one, but not more than three previous&#xD;
      standard therapies. Moreover, the immune effects, the predictors of resistance and response&#xD;
      to treatment, the effect of the chemotherapy on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication will&#xD;
      be assessed and will help identify the subgroups that will mostly benefit from the treatment.&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of the product and the anti-drug antibody (ADA) will be also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 participants are planned to be included in the study. Participants will&#xD;
      receive, every three weeks, a dose of DS-1062a equivalent to 6 mg/kg of body weight until&#xD;
      progression or until unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor evaluation will be performed every six weeks by the mean of a computed tomography for&#xD;
      the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (TAP CT-scan) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain&#xD;
      and/or bone CT scans will be also performed throughout the study for participants with brain&#xD;
      and/or bone metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the product will be assessed at each cycle, through complete clinical exams,&#xD;
      biological tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), cardiac echographies (ECHOs) and through the&#xD;
      collection of ongoing toxicities or adverse events.&#xD;
