  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      immunogenicity data for multiple CSJ117 doses inhaled once daily compared with placebo, in&#xD;
      adult asthma participants treated with medium or high dose ICS plus LABA alone or with&#xD;
      additional asthma controllers (additional controllers allowed: LTRA, LAMA, Theophylline and&#xD;
      its derivatives), who have completed the prior phase llb study CCSJ117A12201C (NCT04410523).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a 12/24-week Phase llb, multicenter, multi-national, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-arm, placebo-controlled extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of 5 dose levels of CSJ117 in adult asthma participants&#xD;
      treated with medium or high dose ICS plus LABA alone or with additional asthma controllers&#xD;
      (allowed: LTRA, LAMA, theophylline or its derivatives), who have completed the prior core&#xD;
      phase llb study CCSJ117A12201C (NCT04410523). The study will include the following three&#xD;
      parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Screening period of up to 3 days to assess eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Treatment period of 12 or 24 weeks. There are two scenarios on when a participant can&#xD;
      enroll into the extension study depending on when the study site is activated for the&#xD;
      extension study CCSJ117A12201E1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 24 week treatment period: Participants on each of the five treatment arms (CSJ117 0.5&#xD;
           to 8 mg) or placebo of the core study CCSJ117A12201C, who will enter the extension study&#xD;
           after the last Treatment period visit (week 12) of the core study, will be randomized in&#xD;
           a 1:1 ratio to continue on their previously assigned CSJ117 dose or placebo from&#xD;
           CCSJ117A12201C for 24 weeks, or to first go through a 12-week &quot;washout period&quot; receiving&#xD;
           placebo (for the blinding purpose) and then restart on their previously assigned CSJ117&#xD;
           dose or placebo from CCSJ117A12201C for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 12 week treatment period: Participants on each of the five treatment arms (CSJ117 0.5&#xD;
           to 8 mg) or placebo of the core study CCSJ117A12201C, who will enter the extension study&#xD;
           after the last Follow-up visit (week 24) of the core study, will restart on their&#xD;
           previously assigned CSJ117 dose or placebo from CCSJ117A12201C for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Follow-up period of 12 weeks, study drug free, following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
