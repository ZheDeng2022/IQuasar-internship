      This study seeks to examine the feasibility and safety of the administration of autologous T&#xD;
      cells that have been modified through the introduction of a chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      targeting the B cell surface antigen CD19 following administration of chemotherapy&#xD;
      lymphodepletion regimen in children and adults with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this study is to validate the safety profile of administration CD19 CAR T&#xD;
      cells and describe the toxicities in children and adults with relapsed/ refractory B cell&#xD;
      malignancies. The dose is escalated in standard 3 +3 design with a starting dose of&#xD;
&#xD;
      1x106 cell/kilogram and maximum treatment dose of 5 x 106 cell/kilogram. The minimum number&#xD;
      of 9 subjects would occur if no dose-limiting toxicities are observed in the 3 dose&#xD;
      escalation cohorts. The maximum sample size of 18 subjects would be enrolled in 3 dose&#xD;
      escalation cohorts (six in each cohort) for meeting dose-limiting toxicities request. In&#xD;
      addition, we hypothesize that we will be able to successfully manufacture CAR T cells to meet&#xD;
      the established release criteria at a minimum target dose of 1 X 106 +-30% cells/kilogram in&#xD;
      this patient population using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy® closed transduction system.&#xD;

The overall goal of this study is to validate the safety profile of administration CD19 CAR T cells and describe the toxicities in children and adults with relapsed/ refractory B cell malignancies. Each patient implements leukapheresis 2 weeks after enrollment and infuse CD19 CAR-T cell around 2 weeks after leukapheresis, and administrated chemotherapy lymphodepletion regimen 1 week before infusion. Furthermore, the treated subject would be following up around 2 years.</description>

          7. Patients who are able to obtain market approved CD19 CAR T-cell therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active central nervous system or meningeal involvement by tumor. Subjects with&#xD;
             untreated brain metastases/CNS disease will be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             Patients with a history of CNS or meningeal involvement must be in a documented&#xD;
             remission by CSF evaluation and contrast-enhanced MRI imaging for at least 90 days&#xD;
             prior to Enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Active HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because CAR-T cell&#xD;
             therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with CAR-T cells, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
             Subjects of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to practice&#xD;
             birth control from the time of enrollment on this study to the follow-up period of the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Evidence of myelodysplasia or cytogenetic abnormality indicative of myelodysplasia on&#xD;
             any bone marrow biopsy prior to initiation of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative viral load prior to enrollment. (viral load&#xD;
             positive patients will be excluded.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Severe concomitant disease or organic dysfunction that is expected to reduce life&#xD;
             expectancy less than 3 months.&#xD;
