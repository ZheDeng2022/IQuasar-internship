  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single intravitreal&#xD;
      injection of virally-carried Multi-Characteristic Opsin (vMCO-010).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, dose-ranging study will&#xD;
      evaluate 2 dose levels of vMCO-010 in up to 18 subjects with retinitis pigmentosa (9 per&#xD;
      dose). Nine subjects will receive sham injection. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      Advanced Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) based on clinical examination, dilated fundus examination,&#xD;
      and genetic testing will be considered for participation in this study. All subjects will&#xD;
      continue to be assessed for 52 weeks following treatment with vMCO-010.&#xD;
