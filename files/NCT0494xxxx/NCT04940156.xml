  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common abnormal heart rhythm disturbance, affecting 1-2&#xD;
      million people in the UK. The irregular heartbeat caused by AF can make the heart pump blood&#xD;
      less efficiently. As a result, AF significantly increases the risk of having a stroke, heart&#xD;
      failure and dementia. However, a significantly proportion of people have no symptoms, and&#xD;
      they may be only found to be in AF after having a stroke. Therefore, diagnosis largely relies&#xD;
      on accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AF episodes can be unpredictable and easily missed unless continuous ECG monitoring is&#xD;
      undertaken. Pacemakers can continuously record the heart's electrical activity and detect AF&#xD;
      with a high degree of confidence. However, they are invasive and rely on electrical wires&#xD;
      implanted inside the heart, and hence less suited to be used as primary monitoring devices.&#xD;
      To overcome these difficulties, implantable cardiac monitors (ICM) have been designed to be&#xD;
      placed under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new generation of ICMs can now be injected under the skin. Moreover, they connect with&#xD;
      the patient's smartphone and transmit recordings. Despite these significant improvements,&#xD;
      their ability to reliably capture AF has never been tested against pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to study the performance of the two commonly used ICMs in&#xD;
      detecting AF episodes and explore how the new connectivity can empower patients and improve&#xD;
      patient care. The investigators plan to inject an ICM in 30 patients with AF and pre-existing&#xD;
      pacemaker. After a period of 6 months, the investigators will compare how many episodes were&#xD;
      detected in each device. With the information collected the investigators will try to&#xD;
      understand the pitfalls in the current technology and develop strategies to improve it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate, minimally invasive long-term ECG monitor can have far reaching benefits for&#xD;
      patients, both in routine clinical practice and research.&#xD;
