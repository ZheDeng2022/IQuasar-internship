  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that at 3 months, there will be a higher proportion&#xD;
      of intervention participants vs. control participants who report greater risk of harm from&#xD;
      misuse of prescription opioids AND heroin/fentanyl.&#xD;

      This study's specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a randomized controlled trial with 532 high-risk adolescents in 10 School Based&#xD;
      Health Centers (SBHCs), to compare PlaySmart to attention/time control games, with&#xD;
      assessments post- gameplay (6 weeks), and at 3, 6, and 12 months following enrollment to&#xD;
      determine if PlaySmart: 1) increases proportion of participants who report a perception of&#xD;
      great risk of harm from misuse of opioids at 3 months; and 2) decreases intentions to misuse&#xD;
      opioids; 3) increases self-efficacy for refusing opioids; 4) prevents initiation of opioid&#xD;
      misuse, at all time-points.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perception of Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived risk was measured by the question, &quot;How much do you think people risk harming themselves (physically or in other ways), if they...&quot; try or use a drug. For example, &quot;...try marijuana once or twice.&quot; The answer categories are &quot;no risk,&quot; &quot;slight risk,&quot; &quot;moderate risk,&quot; &quot;great risk,&quot; and &quot;can't say, drug unfamiliar.&quot; Parallel questions refer to using the same drug &quot;occasionally&quot; and &quot;regularly.&quot; It is an 8 item, 4-point Likert scale. This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 6 weeks of gameplay, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Intentions to Misuse Opioids</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcomes will be assessed by determining if there was a change in intentions to misuse opioids from baseline after 6 weeks of gameplay, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline. The self-reported data questions were derived from the Monitoring the Future Study. Each item uses a 5-point scale to assess various facets of opioid misuse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self Efficacy for Refusing Opioids</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcomes will be assessed by determining if there was a change in self-efficacy to refuse offers of opioids from baseline after 6 weeks of gameplay and at 3,6, and 12 months after baseline. This will be collected by self-reported data using questions from a study on preventing drug abuse among adolescents. It is a four-item scale for self-efficacy and relates to adolescent's perceived ability to resist pressure to use substances.</description>

    <measure>Change in Prevention of Initiation of Opioid Misuse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcomes will be assessed by determining if a change in substance use behaviors (including prescription and illicit drugs, tobacco, and alcohol) occurred from baseline after 6 weeks of gameplay, and 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline. Self- reported data will be collected using questions from the Monitoring the Future Study.</description>
