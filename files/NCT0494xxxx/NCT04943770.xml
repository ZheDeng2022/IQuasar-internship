  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is prospective, post-market, exploratory, single-centre, rate randomised,&#xD;
      double-blinded (subject, evaluator blinded; programmer un-blinded). The study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the wash-in and wash-out time of FAST (Fast Acting Sub-perception Therapy) at 90 Hz&#xD;
      and various frequencies above and below 90 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study design will eliminate the bias associated with case selection in a&#xD;
      retrospective review and will ensure that identical procedures are followed for data capture&#xD;
      and review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of rates will be used to minimise the sequence effects and the impact of&#xD;
      carryover effects, as well as addressing issues that may be related to order effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic diary will be used to log the subjects' pain intensity and medication usage.&#xD;
      Additionally, the numerical rating scale for measuring pain intensity is a validated measure&#xD;
      and has been used in other randomized controlled trials to measure the outcomes of spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation (SCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic real-time NRS (Numerical rating score) recording will be used to log the&#xD;
      subjects' pain intensity and time during wash-in evaluation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate pain relief and wash-in/wash-out frequency sensitivity using FAST&#xD;
      at different stimulation rates. The different randomization period included in the study&#xD;
      design allows for comparing these treatments using one of the stimulation rates as an active&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      Chronic Pain Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic intractable pain is a significant worldwide health issue, which consumes considerable&#xD;
      healthcare resources and heavily impacts the quality of life for many patients. It is often&#xD;
      defined as pain persisting for at least 6 months and not responding to conservative&#xD;
      treatment(s). Chronic pain may be induced by current or past nerve injury and causes&#xD;
      significant disability. People affected by such condition often experience reduced&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, reduced ability to engage in activities of daily living,&#xD;
      depression, sleep disturbances and weight gain due to the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical entry into the pain management continuum includes over-the-counter medications,&#xD;
      followed by physical therapy and complementary medicine. Interventional Pain management,&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary pain management and surgery are attempted next and are often followed by&#xD;
      long-term oral opioids intake. Active implantable options, including Spinal Cord Stimulation&#xD;
      (SCS), lie within the continuum of chronic pain therapies and can be recommended as an&#xD;
      alternative to long-term opioids intake (as recommended by National Institute of Clinical&#xD;
      Excellence- NICE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCS refers to the application of small amounts of electrical energy, often via wires (a.k.a.&#xD;
      &quot;leads&quot;) to stimulate nerves in the spinal cord and reduce chronic pain symptoms. SCS is a&#xD;
      less invasive treatment option for chronic pain that has generally been reserved for patients&#xD;
      who have failed multiple, and sometimes all, conservative chronic pain therapies. With SCS,&#xD;
      an implanted pulse generator (IPG) delivers electrical current to leads implanted in the&#xD;
      epidural space at specific spinal level. Electrical currents stimulates nerves and can be&#xD;
      shaped to optimise stimulation of fibres innervating the painful locations, thereby reducing&#xD;
      pain sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades, paresthesia-based SCS has been used to treat chronic pain. The classic approach&#xD;
      typically uses frequencies between 40-100 Hz and enables a relatively straightforward&#xD;
      identification and energy-efficient stimulation of the so-called therapeutic &quot;sweet-spot&quot;.&#xD;
      However, a potential drawback of this method of treatment is that patients using&#xD;
      paresthesia-based SCS must endure paresthesias (&quot;tingling&quot;) which, although may not always be&#xD;
      bothersome and even pleasant to some, is an aspect that some may prefer to avoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, within the last 10 years, SCS device technologies have expanded considerably. One&#xD;
      example is the introduction of higher stimulation frequency (i.e., 10 kHz) and amplitudes&#xD;
      below perception threshold, enabling patients to obtain pain relief without experiencing&#xD;
      paresthesia. This approach is known as sub-perception SC. However, this method is very&#xD;
      energy-intensive, requires patients to recharge every 1-2 days and exhibits a slow &quot;wash-in&quot;&#xD;
      time (i.e., the time between therapy activation and relief from pain). Conventional&#xD;
      sub-perception methodologies have the desirable property of not requiring the patient to feel&#xD;
      paresthesia but have some notable drawbacks. In particular, (1) patients leave the clinic&#xD;
      still awaiting relief and hoping that one of the programs provided will be effective, (2) the&#xD;
      sweet-spot is assessed via a &quot;blind&quot; search, an approach that limits the number of program&#xD;
      settings testable on each patient and calling into question whether or not the final settings&#xD;
      are optimal, (3) and in many cases the programs require much more energy than a&#xD;
      paresthesia-based program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of an effort to improve patients' experience and outcomes associated with the&#xD;
      utilization of sub-perception SCS, the investigators hypothesised that there might be a&#xD;
      putative relationship between the following: a) the specific location in which a&#xD;
      sub-perception stimulation field is most effective and b) the paresthesia that overlaps the&#xD;
      physical area(s) of pain as reported by each patient. Evaluation of this hypothesis led the&#xD;
      investigators to develop a novel approach for implementation of sub-perception SCS, which is&#xD;
      termed &quot;Fast Acting Sub-perception Therapy&quot; (FAST). This new methodology offers all the&#xD;
      advantages provided by both paresthesia- and sub-perception-based SCS while simultaneously&#xD;
      mitigating the potential downsides typically associated with each of these modalities when&#xD;
      they are applied independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives and Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the wash-in/wash-out times of Fast-Acting&#xD;
      Sub-perception Therapy (FAST) and best clinical outcomes as measured by mean reported pain on&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale at 90 Hz and with frequencies above and below 90 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to investigate the effect on functionality, quality of life,&#xD;
      therapy longevity (3 and 6-month) and adverse events in the study population.&#xD;

    <description>PSQ is an eight-item questionnaire developed to assess the impact of pain on quality of sleep. Seven of the eight items are scored using 100 mm VAS, while the remaining item asks individuals to indicate the average number of hours of sleep they get each night. Typically, the first five items on the scale are summed and used as an overall measure of the impact of pain on quality of sleep</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomised 4:4 to a specific stimulating rates order (A, B, C, D) for approx. 3-6 weeks per rate (12-24 weeks in total). Each period is followed by a wash-out phase.&#xD;
At each frequency systematic assessment of the sweet-spot(s) will be performed. Various pulse width and amplitude values may be used to optimize therapy (up to 1KHz). These programmes will be saved in the subject's remote control based on the pre-generated rate randomization sequence.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo spinal cord implant procedures as per standard of care and be implanted with the WaveWriter™ Alpha Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) system.&#xD;
Implant Procedures will be followed by a healing period (4-6 weeks) during which patients will be offered therapy (up to one 1Khz). Patients will then be randomised to receive therapy at four different rates (A, B, C, D) in no particular order for 3-6 weeks each. Patients will then be followed up at 3 and 6 months after the last randomization visit.</description>
