  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand people's alcohol use in public places and&#xD;
      their risks for harm. The overall goal of this study is to test the effects of subsidized&#xD;
      ridesharing as an intervention to reduce self-reported alcohol-impaired driving, along with&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and changes to mobility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people aged 13-25 years in the US,&#xD;
      and approximately 31% of all fatal crashes involved some alcohol use. Several peer-reviewed&#xD;
      studies have found that ridesharing was associated with fewer alcohol-involved crashes and&#xD;
      DUI arrests. Theories of behavioral economics provide a clear theoretical mechanism by which&#xD;
      ridesharing will reduce alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes compared to other private&#xD;
      transportation. However, while ridesharing may be an effective intervention to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol-involved crashes, it may simultaneously increase alcohol consumption. This study will&#xD;
      assess the impacts of subsidized ridesharing on impaired driving, alcohol consumption, and&#xD;
      mobility. Participants will be randomized to either receive a rideshare voucher or an online&#xD;
      shopping voucher, and effects on alcohol impaired driving and alcohol consumption will be&#xD;
      measured. A GPS sub-group will use a custom smartphone application for GPS tracking to&#xD;
      measure mobility.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the alcohol impaired driving incidents</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week follow-up, 2 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide two self-reported measures of impaired driving by indicating whether they &quot;drove after drinking any alcohol&quot; (driving after drinking) and &quot;drove after drinking too much alcohol to drive safely&quot; (driving while intoxicated) for each day during the previous 7 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of days in alcohol consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week follow-up, 2 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to state the number of drinks consumed on each day for the 7 previous days, and their responses will be used to calculate the frequency (defined as the number of drinking days) and the continued volume (defined as total number of drinks consumed after 1 drink on a drinking day) of drinking.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 3 to Day 17 of study</time_frame>
    <description>Participants enrolled in the GPS sub-sample will be tracked and GPS records will be used measure exposure to alcohol outlets and mobility.</description>

    <measure>Change in The Drinker Inventory of Consequences Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week follow-up, 2 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Drinker Inventory of Consequences is a 45-item measure of alcohol-related consequences on which higher scores reflect greater alcohol consequences. It measures harms related to alcohol consumption within 5 sub-scales: physical consequences, intrapersonal consequences, social responsibility consequences, interpersonal consequences, and impulse control consequences.</description>
