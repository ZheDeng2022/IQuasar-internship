      The study is designed to assess the treatment outcomes following treatment with letrozole&#xD;
      plus metronomic capecitabine in patients with hormone receptor-positive, Her2-negative&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer who have not received prior systemic anti-cancer therapies for their&#xD;
      recurrent /metastatic disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is recognized as the commonest cancer in females, and the second commonest&#xD;
      malignant tumor, after lung cancer, in overall figures worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2021, an estimated 281,550 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be&#xD;
      diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 49,290 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 43,600 women in the U.S. are expected to die in 2021 from breast cancer. Death rates&#xD;
      have been steady in women under 50 since 2007, but have continued to drop in women over 50.&#xD;
      The overall death rate from breast cancer decreased by 1% per year from 2013 to 2018. These&#xD;
      decreases are thought to be the result of treatment advances and earlier detection through&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer became the most common cancer&#xD;
      globally as of 2021, accounting for 12% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease exhibiting substantial&#xD;
      differences concerning biological behavior and requiring distinct therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
      There has been a continuous decline in mortality over recent years due to improvements in&#xD;
      early diagnosis and the increased availability of more effective treatments. However, despite&#xD;
      these improvements, The treatment of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC)&#xD;
      who developed disease progression on first-line hormonal treatment that included aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (AI) represents a challenge as those patients ultimately develop resistant disease&#xD;
      unresponsive to standard lines of estrogen receptors (ER) blockade. Capecitabine is an oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy that mimics continuous infusion of 5-FU with known activity in MBC. It might be&#xD;
      preferred because of its tolerability and relatively lower toxicity than other&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents. Metronomic chemotherapy is defined as the frequent (daily, many&#xD;
      times a week, or weekly) or continuous administration of low dose chemotherapeutic agents,&#xD;
      without prolonged drug-free intervals. This way of administration improves the antiangiogenic&#xD;
      activity of chemotherapy. Another important advantage of this approach is the significant&#xD;
      reduction in toxicity. Capecitabine's pharmacokinetics and high safety profile make it a&#xD;
      suitable drug for metronomic administration. Many studies reported that the overall response&#xD;
      rate can be improved by (15.8-21.7%) when metronomic chemotherapy is combined with aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors. This combination can also decrease the level of both the Ki-67 index and VEGF-A&#xD;
      significantly in the tumor tissue. It was reported that the patients who received letrozole&#xD;
      plus metronomic chemotherapy achieved a higher overall response rate (ORR) than those who&#xD;
      received letrozole alone (87.7% vs 71.9% respectively.&#xD;
