  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The magnitude of seasonal RSV epidemics brings each year new logistical challenges for the&#xD;
      hospitalization of young infants with bronchiolitis that overwhelm hospital capacities and&#xD;
      lead to specific winter plans with deprogramming and mobilization of human and logistical&#xD;
      resources. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way winter epidemics are presented. For&#xD;
      example, the seasonal RSV epidemic was shifted by several months in Lyon, with an impression&#xD;
      of a lower incidence of hospitalized cases, with a population of older children and with&#xD;
      fewer signs of clinical severity. This is largely attributable to the widespread use of&#xD;
      barrier gestures and social distancing measures, known as &quot;non-pharmacological interventions&quot;&#xD;
      or NPI. Given the magnitude of the reduction of the RSV epidemic, it is legitimate to analyze&#xD;
      the benefits of NPIs to draw lessons for maintaining preventive measures around&#xD;
      RSV-vulnerable populations; moreover, new preventive pharmacological interventions are soon&#xD;
      to be marketed, whether they are particularly refined and long half-life anti-RSV monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, RSV vaccines for mothers or for newborns and infants. In this perspective, it is&#xD;
      crucial to properly define the populations at risk of severe disease to establish a&#xD;
      legitimate hierarchy in the implementation of different preventive strategies. The study of&#xD;
      the RSV epidemic is a high potential model because of the convergence of epidemiological,&#xD;
      virological, and pharmacological knowledge. However, the study of the impact of the pandemic&#xD;
      on the epidemiology of rhinovirus also seems promising because, for reasons unknown to date,&#xD;
      it seems that the pandemic did not have the same reducing impact on the rhinovirus epidemic;&#xD;
      in the latter case, the interest is to confirm the resistance of this virus and to look for&#xD;
      more fundamental explanations, for example, on viral interactions.&#xD;
