  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will explore Atipamezole &amp; caffeine's ability to facilitate&#xD;
      the emergence from anesthesia. Each subject will visit UChicago 4 times. The first time for&#xD;
      informed consent. The second time for a complete physical exam to ensure that the subjects&#xD;
      are healthy. Then there are 2 sedation sessions. Subjects get an honorarium for each sedation&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will attend 3 sessions to complete the study. In the first session, an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will take a medical history and perform a physical examination on the&#xD;
      subject. A baseline EKG and urine drug screen test will be obtained. If the subject meets the&#xD;
      criteria for the study, healthy and drug-free, the risks involved in the study will be&#xD;
      covered in detail. If the subject is willing, then that subject will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      and a detailed informed consent form will covered in detail. Prior to signing the consent&#xD;
      form the subject will be required to describe the risks involved in the study in their own&#xD;
      words, showing that each subject understand. For each session, subjects will be asked not to&#xD;
      eat and drink 8 hours prior to the study in order to minimize the potential risk for&#xD;
      aspiration during anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject is checked in, a peripheral intravenous catheter (IV) will be inserted on&#xD;
      one of the arms. A second IV will be inserted to the other arm. After the IV insertion,&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) standard monitoring, including EKG, blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and temperature, will be used to assess the&#xD;
      subject. An EEG monitor probe will be applied to the forehead skin as well. The subject will&#xD;
      then be asked to breathe 100% reof Precedex (2 g/kg), via pump, across 10 minutes. There will&#xD;
      be a 5 minute interval to allow the drug to equilibrate. Then p or saline (control). The face&#xD;
      mask will stay in place throughout the procedure. For the experiment described, Ati: Dex&#xD;
      ratio is 1:1. The investigators will be blind to the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the time when the drug injections are complete to the&#xD;
      awakening of the subject. The investigators will record the time until the subject's eyes&#xD;
      open, and the time until the subject can respond to the command to grip the hand of the&#xD;
      attending physician. When the subject is awake and alert (oriented to time, place and name),&#xD;
      the subject will perform psychomotor tests to measure his cognitive function. The subject&#xD;
      will be required to complete a simple set of cognitive tests to determine if they are still&#xD;
      impaired by the sedative. Both &quot;control&quot; and test subjects will be required to complete the&#xD;
      same tests. Tests include one for hand-eye coordination by tracking a randomly moving circle&#xD;
      on a computer screen with a cross controlled by a mouse. Reaction time is measured by asking&#xD;
      the subject to press a button when the subject hears a sound. The tests will be repeated&#xD;
      every 15 minutes for 90 minutes after waking. This will allow the investigators to get a&#xD;
      recovery time course.&#xD;
