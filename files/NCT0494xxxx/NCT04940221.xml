  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer screening rates are very low despite the fact that lung cancer screening could&#xD;
      save many lives. People need to understand the risks and benefits to screening as well as&#xD;
      their own beliefs about screening. This study builds an intervention in real world primary&#xD;
      care that will help people make the right decision for them as well as help people to quit&#xD;
      smoking. Interventions like this are needed to improve the screening rate and reduce death&#xD;
      from lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer screening rates in the United States are very low- just 3.3% in 2010 and 3.9% in&#xD;
      2015. There is a critical need to develop and implement effective strategies to engage&#xD;
      high-risk patients in a coordinated program of lung cancer screening, which includes&#xD;
      shared-decision making. The investigators proposed to modify and expand a shared decision-&#xD;
      counseling intervention previously developed in one primary care practice. The investigators&#xD;
      measured lung cancer screening in our intervention group compared to a propensity-matched&#xD;
      usual care cohort. The investigators compared patients recruited to patients who are not in&#xD;
      order to identify potential sources of disparity in future work and the investigators&#xD;
      developed a more intense smoking cessation component. Model interventions for shared-decision&#xD;
      making in clinical practice are needed across a wide range of diseases and decisions.&#xD;
