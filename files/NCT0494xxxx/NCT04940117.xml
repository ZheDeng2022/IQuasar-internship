  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic renal failure is a chronic and progressive disease with a poor prognosis. In recent&#xD;
      years, it can be found in many literature reports that traditional Chinese medicine therapy&#xD;
      has obvious effects on early and mid-term chronic renal failure. It can not only improve&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, but also block or delay the process of renal failure. It is relatively&#xD;
      rare that compounds such as compounds. The side effects of drugs may be used in combination&#xD;
      with compound drugs to improve clinical side effects and help patients improve their quality&#xD;
      of life to complete the treatment course. It can provide clinicians with another choice in&#xD;
      treatment. A previous study confirmed that the use of Eefooton oral solution of Chinese&#xD;
      herbal medicine concentrate has a significant protective effect on the kidneys that have not&#xD;
      undergone hemodialysis. Eefooton is extracted from Rhodiola, Huang Qi, American Ginseng, Dang&#xD;
      Ginseng, and Ligustrum lucidum by biotechnology. It has immunomodulatory effects,&#xD;
      anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effects, and regulates calcium metabolism. The purpose&#xD;
      of this clinical observation and research is to evaluate the eGFR changes in the renal&#xD;
      function of patients with chronic kidney disease with the combination of Eefooton oral&#xD;
      solution and commonly used chemical drugs.&#xD;

      The Blood test items consisted Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Serum creatinine (SCr), estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum Uric acid, plasma Albumin (ALB), Hemoglobin (Hb),&#xD;
      Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Serum Glutamic-Oxalocetic Transaminase (SGOT), Serum glutamic&#xD;

      Phosphorus (Blood). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Triglyceride (TG), Total cholesterol (Chol),&#xD;
      High-density lipoprotein (HDL), Low-density lipoprotein (LDL). During the entire research&#xD;
      process did not change diet, lifestyle, habits and the use of drugs.&#xD;
