  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The detection of and control of gestational diabetes carries benefits for both mother and&#xD;
      baby related to immediate pregnancy outcomes. The glycemic disorders in diabetes are not&#xD;
      solely limited to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia, but can be extended to the glycemic&#xD;
      variability that includes both upward (postprandial glucose increments) and downward&#xD;
      (interprandial glucose decrements) changes. Glycemic variability, as a component of the&#xD;
      glycemic disorders, has more deleterious effects than sustained chronic hyperglycemia in the&#xD;
      development of diabetic complications. Glycemic variability is associated with increased&#xD;
      risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM. Hyperglycemic excursion has been shown to be the&#xD;
      strongest predictor of macrosomia, the most common complication of pregnancy with diabetes.&#xD;
      When compared with routine standard antenatal care, continuous glucose monitoring system&#xD;
      (CGMS) guided treatments should signiﬁcantly improve glycemic control, lower infant birth&#xD;
      weight, and reduce risk of macrosomia in gestational women with diabetes. We will investigate&#xD;
      the following questions (1) Whether CGMS can detect greater glycemic variability in women&#xD;
      with an early GDM diagnosis; (2) Whether CGMS can subsequently moderate treatment strategies&#xD;
      of GDM especially patient behavior and glucose levels; (3) Whether CGMS can eventually&#xD;
      improve maternal (i.e., reduce gestational weight gain and lower glycemic levels during&#xD;
      pregnancy) and fetal outcomes (reduce LGA babies and C-section rate) compared with&#xD;
      traditional self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with&#xD;
      onset during pregnancy. It is associated with increased feto-maternal morbidity as well as&#xD;
      with long-term complications in the mother and offspring . GDM is associated with significant&#xD;
      complications during pregnancy, including an increased need for Cesarean sections; higher&#xD;
      risks of ketonemia, preeclampsia, and urinary tract infection in both mothers and infants;&#xD;
      increased perinatal morbidity (e.g., macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal&#xD;
      jaundice); and possibly mortality. The risk of complications in women with GDM increases&#xD;
      proportionally with the worsening of glycemic tolerance. Comprehensive glucose monitoring and&#xD;
      therapy are indispensable to prevent these complications because even small increases in&#xD;
      maternal glucose are related to poorer clinical outcomes. Treatment of GDM during pregnancy,&#xD;
      centers on dietary modulation, promotion of healthy physical activity and pharmacologic&#xD;
      management, primarily with insulin as well as oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), if glycemic&#xD;
      control cannot be achieved with lifestyle measures alone. The details of the therapeutic&#xD;
      approach, in particular regarding various dietary approaches and the potential use of OHAs&#xD;
      such as metformin and glyburide (glibenclamide) differ widely between and within countries.&#xD;
      Two landmark prospective randomized controlled trials have confirmed that detection of and&#xD;
      control of GDM carries benefits for both mother and baby in terms of immediate pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes. Women in the intervention arm of the Australian (Crowther) study showed lower rates&#xD;
      of fetal macrosomia, reduced frequency of large-for-gestational age (LGA) babies and reduced&#xD;
      preeclampsia. In the US (Landon) study, women who received treatment for GDM demonstrated&#xD;
      lower gestational weight gain (GWG) and lower rates of pre-eclampsia. Reduced frequency of&#xD;
      LGA and macrosomia were noted in infants of treated mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose monitoring targets in pregnancy need to be tight, with low thresholds for commencing&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy or increasing the insulin dosage. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy&#xD;
      Outcomes (HAPO) study showed that a fasting glucose of 5.1 mmol/L in the oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation was already associated with a 75% increased risk&#xD;
      of adverse outcomes . Self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a frequently used method to&#xD;
      monitor blood glucose during pregnancy. However, this method is not sufficient to detect all&#xD;
      glycemic fluctuations. Since the initiation of insulin/metformin/glyburide therapy and the&#xD;
      related dosage adjustments depend solely on the SMBG results, inaccurate results may lead to&#xD;
      a greater chance of hypo- or hyperglycemia and may even fail to detect hypoglycemic episodes.&#xD;
      Therefore, accurate SMBG results are crucial for management of hyperglycemia during&#xD;
      pregnancy. The capabilities of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) during pregnancy&#xD;
      have advanced with the technical aspects of glucose meters, and therefore considering these&#xD;
      aspects is important during pregnancy. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides unique&#xD;
      insights into daily glycemic control and permits a better understanding of how glucose&#xD;
      variability may influence acute and long-term complications of diabetes. Real-time CGM by&#xD;
      providing glucose measurements as often as every 5 minutes, low and high glucose alerts, and&#xD;
      glucose trend information, has the potential to better inform diabetes management decisions&#xD;
      compared with episodic self-monitoring with a SMBG. CGM offers a potential source of data&#xD;
      required to improve the detection and management of glucose levels in diabetic pregnancy. CGM&#xD;
      provides far more frequent glucose measurements than SMBG and far more information on&#xD;
      short-to-medium-term trends in glucose levels than either SMBG or even HbA1c. The slow&#xD;
      kinetics of glycosylated hemoglobin accumulation and physiological changes in erythrocyte&#xD;
      formation during pregnancy mean that A1C is only a limited predictor of acute blood glucose&#xD;
      changes providing an explanation for the poor pregnancy outcomes, even in women with&#xD;
      apparently &quot;good&quot; glycemic control . Recent attention has therefore focused on evaluating the&#xD;
      role of CGMS in pregnancy with studies providing normative data in diabetic and nondiabetic&#xD;
      pregnancies. CGMS is also capable of recording glucose levels throughout both day and night&#xD;
      without disrupting the normal activities of daily living (particularly periods of activity,&#xD;
      rest, and sleep). A real time-CGMS provides the patient with continuous information about the&#xD;
      alterations in the blood glucose levels throughout the day, which is immediately revealed to&#xD;
      the patient, and helps the patient to understand how food, exercise, and insulin affect blood&#xD;
      glucose. This visibility may empower the patient to modify his/her lifestyle and engage in&#xD;
      therapeutic management. CGMS data allows us to better understand where, when, and how we&#xD;
      might better invest our efforts to optimize glucose control in diabetic pregnancy to reduce&#xD;
      LGA and improve pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGMS use has been successful, safe, and accurate in detecting glucose levels in pregnancies&#xD;
      with diabetes. RT-CGMS studies in non-pregnant type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients reported&#xD;
      its efficacy in improving glycemic control. The effectiveness of CGMS in improving pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes complicated by GDM is still understudied. In a study by Wei and colleagues, a total&#xD;
      of 106 women with GDM in gestational weeks 24-28 were randomly allocated to the antenatal&#xD;
      care plus CGMS group or the self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) group. The CGMS group was&#xD;
      subdivided into early and late subgroups. There were no significant differences in prenatal&#xD;
      or obstetric outcomes, e.g., caesarean delivery rate, Apgar score at 5 min, macrosomia or&#xD;
      neonatal hypoglycemia, between the CGMS and SMBG groups. The CGMS group had lower glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels than the SMBG group; however, the difference was not statistically&#xD;
      significant. The proportion of GDM women with excessive gestational weight gain was lower in&#xD;
      the CGMS group than in the SMBG group (33.3% vs. 56.4%, P = 0.039), and women who initiated&#xD;
      CGMS earlier gained less weight (P = 0.017). The mode of blood glucose monitoring (adjusted&#xD;
      OR 2.40; 95% CI 1.030-5.588; P = 0.042) and pre-pregnancy BMI (adjusted OR 0.578; 95% CI&#xD;
      0.419-0.798; P = 0.001) were independent factors for weight gain. The investigators concluded&#xD;
      that early CGMS for GDM mothers reduced gestational weight gain. Voormolen et al. randomized&#xD;
      109 women with GDM to CGMS vs. standard treatment (SMBG 4-8 times daily and HbA1c levels&#xD;
      every 4 weeks). Compared with SMBG users, CGMS users had a significantly lower incidence of&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia [Relative Risk (RR) 0.3; 95%Cl: 0.12-0.8]. In another study, Yu et al.&#xD;
      recruited 340 women with GDM and assigned 190 to routine care (SMBG 7 times daily) and the&#xD;
      other 150 to 72 h CGMS. Compared with SMBG, CGMS users tended to have lower incidence of&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia [5out of 150 (3.3%) vs. 19 out of 190 (10%), P = 0.019], primary cesarean&#xD;
      section [51 out of 150 (34.0%) vs. 88 out of 190 (46.3%), P =0.028], and premature delivery&#xD;
      [7 out of 150 (4.7%) vs. 22 out of 190 (11.6%), P = 0.024]. In addition, intermittent use of&#xD;
      retrospective CGM in pregnant women with pre-gestational diabetes or GDM was associated with&#xD;
      improvement in blood glucose and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which will assess CGMS vs. SMBG by allowing all&#xD;
      participants to use both methods but the SMBG group will be blinded to CGMS. A total of 100&#xD;
      women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosed in gestational weeks 8-25 (6+0 to&#xD;
      25+6weeks) (by 8 weeks we can detect heartbeat and consider it a viable pregnancy) will be&#xD;
      recruited. We will investigate the following questions (1) Whether CGMS can detect greater&#xD;
      glycemic variability in women with an early GDM diagnosis; (2) Whether CGMS can subsequently&#xD;
      moderate treatment strategies of GDM especially patient behavior and glucose levels; (3)&#xD;
      Whether CGMS can eventually improve maternal (i.e., reduce gestational weight gain and lower&#xD;
      glycemic levels during pregnancy) and fetal outcomes (reduce LGA babies and C-section rate)&#xD;
      compared with traditional SMBG use.&#xD;
