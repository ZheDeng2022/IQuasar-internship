  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be allocated to one of four cohorts based on tumour type and presence&#xD;
      of specific biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive open-label Dacomitinib as tablets for oral administration on a&#xD;
      continuous daily basis at a dose of 30 mg for one cycle. After one cycle, a toxicity&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted. Subjects with &gt;=G2 toxicity attributable to dacomitinib, will&#xD;
      continue dacomitinib at 30 mg orally once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In subjects with &lt;=G1 toxicity, investigator and subjects will make a shared decision for&#xD;
      dose escalation of dacomitinib to 45 mg orally once daily or continuation of dacomitinib at&#xD;
      30 mg orally once daily. Subjects will then continue on therapy until disease progression,&#xD;
      new systemic anticancer therapy instituted, intolerable toxicities, withdrawal of consent,&#xD;
      death, or investigator decision dictated by protocol compliance, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible subjects will be allocated to one of four cohorts based on tumour type and presence of specific biomarker. All subjects in cohorts 1 to 3 will have tumours that demonstrate low EGFR-AS1 lncRNA expression as determined through a companion diagnostic biomarker suite (consisting of three components - EGFR Q787Q AA genotype, low AS1 lncRNA levels and increased EGFR isoform D/A ratio).&#xD;
Cohort 1 will consist of squamous NSCLC patients with the presence of at least 1 out of 3 in the biomarker suite.&#xD;
Cohort 2 will consist of HNSCC patients with the presence of at least 1 out of 3 in the biomarker suite.&#xD;
Cohort 3 will consist of any other solid tumour with the presence of at least 1 out of 3 in the biomarker suite.&#xD;
Cohort 4 will have tumours that demonstrate the presence of a novel emerging biomarker including but not limited to NRG1 fusions and specific MET SNPs.</intervention_model_description>
