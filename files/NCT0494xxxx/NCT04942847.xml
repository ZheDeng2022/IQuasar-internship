    <textblock>
      The incidence of dysphagia in stroke patients is as high as 30% ~ 65%. Dysphagia caused by&#xD;
      stroke is the primary cause of dysphagia and an independent risk factor for the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients. The rehabilitation of cognitive function is the key to the assessment of swallowing&#xD;
      and the recovery of rehabilitation function after stroke, and complete consciousness,&#xD;
      sensorimotor consciousness and motivation are the prerequisites for the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      swallowing function. Traditional rehabilitation programs focus more on the single task&#xD;
      training of patients' function and ignore the training of cognitive function. Cognitive&#xD;
      deglutition dual task training is a kind of cognitive rehabilitation training at the same&#xD;
      time of deglutition rehabilitation treatment. In this study, the &quot;dual task&quot; training mode of&#xD;
      cognitive combined sucking training was applied to the rehabilitation of patients with&#xD;
      swallowing dysfunction after stroke, to evaluate the rehabilitation of patients with&#xD;
      swallowing function and cognitive function, and to further guide the clinical development and&#xD;
      implementation of early rehabilitation treatment and nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this topic research, on the basis of traditional swallowing training to develop a set&#xD;
      of scientific and advanced type of swallowing disorder in patients with stroke rehabilitation&#xD;
      training of the new strategy, combined with cognitive training and sucking training for&#xD;
      swallowing disorder in patients with cerebral apoplexy and to provide professional,&#xD;
      systematic and comprehensive rehabilitation guidance, promote patients early recovery and&#xD;
      return to society.&#xD;
