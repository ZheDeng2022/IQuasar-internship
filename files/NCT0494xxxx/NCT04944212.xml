    <textblock>
      In Jordan, there are few data about the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in pregnant women and&#xD;
      their newborns and factors that affect their levels. Hence, in this study, investigators will&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine vitamin D levels among newborns born in north Jordan&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine vitamin D levels among pregnant women in north Jordan&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study the association between maternal and infants levels of vitamin D&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore the association between maternal and fetal characteristics and maternal and/or&#xD;
           fetal vitamin D level&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study the effect of low fetal vitamin D on newborn anthropometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study the effect of maternal vitamin D supplement use during pregnancy in raising cord&#xD;
           serum vitamin D levels&#xD;

      This is a cross-sectional study that will be carried out at King Abdullah University Hospital&#xD;
      (KAUH). After being approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of KAUH, written&#xD;
      informed consents will be obtained from the newborns' mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 ml of venous blood will be obtained from pregnant women at the time of admission and 3 ml&#xD;
      of venous blood will be obtained from the umbilical cord veins of the newborns immediately&#xD;
      after their delivery. The quantitative measurement of 25OHD in serum will be performed using&#xD;
      ELIZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will determine the means, medians and standard deviations of 25OHD levels among&#xD;
      pregnant women and infants in Jordan. In addition, investigators will study the association&#xD;
      between maternal and infants levels of 25OHD. Moreover, investigators will investigate the&#xD;
      association between maternal level of vitamin D and elective maternal variables including&#xD;
      vitamin D supplements during and before pregnancy, sun exposure, age, weight, parity, BMI, &amp;&#xD;
      maternal medical problems. In addition, investigators will study the effect of low fetal&#xD;
      vitamin D on newborn anthropometry. Finally, investigators will study the effect of maternal&#xD;
      vitamin D supplements use during pregnancy in raising cord serum vitamin D levels&#xD;
