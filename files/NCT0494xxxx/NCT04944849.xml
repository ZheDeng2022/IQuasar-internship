  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing use of computers in recent years, the effects of games have started to be&#xD;
      discussed. Young people who play computers are exposed to many stimuli during the game and&#xD;
      they react to these stimuli with reactions at various rates. In our study, we wanted to find&#xD;
      out whether there is a significant difference in reaction time between young people who play&#xD;
      computers more than 14 hours a week and those who do not.&#xD;

      While doing our research, the reaction time test in the Human Benchmark application, where&#xD;
      the reaction time to many different stimuli on the computer can be evaluated, the Aim Trainer&#xD;
      test and the auditory reaction time tests at https://playback.fm/audio-reaction-time will be&#xD;
      applied. The way the tests are applied; the first test will be separated as a trial and will&#xD;
      not be included in the average. The next three tests will be averaged. Height, weight,&#xD;
      smoking, use of antidepressants or stimulants, any ear or hearing problems, any eye disease,&#xD;
      how many days a week and how much sports they do, the dominant side, whether they play&#xD;
      digital and video games, for how long, what type of device (computer, tablet, phone), which&#xD;
      games (League of legends, Player unknown's battlegrounds, World of Warcraft, Valorant, FIFA,&#xD;
      PES, Call of duty, NBA, Counter strike:Global offensive CS:GO, other), how many hours a day&#xD;
      and how many hours a week they play digital video games will be questioned whether they&#xD;
      participate in the tournament with at least one of these games.&#xD;
