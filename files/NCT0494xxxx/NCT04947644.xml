  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different case studies about the use of erector spinae block (ESPB ) in&#xD;
      nephrectomy, but there are no enough randomized controlled studies about it until now so it&#xD;
      will be one of the earliest studies that investigate the effect of ESPB to relief acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain in patients undergoing open nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ESPB and thoracic epidural analgesia blocks successfully reduced postoperative&#xD;
      opioid consumption in previous studies, no study has ever compared their efficacy in&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia of adult patients undergoing open nephrectomy under general&#xD;
      anesthesia thus in this randomized comparative study we are aiming to fill this gap in the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided continuous&#xD;
      erector spinae plane block versus thoracic epidural analgesia in open nephrectomy for renal&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;

      The erector spinae muscle (ESM) is a complex formed by the spinalis, longissimus thoracis,&#xD;
      and iliocostalis muscles that run vertically in the back. The ESP block is performed by&#xD;
      depositing the local anesthetic (LA) in the fascial plane, deeper than the ESM at the tip of&#xD;
      the transverse process of the vertebra. Hence, LA is distributed in the cranio-caudal fascial&#xD;
      plane. Additionally, it diffuses anteriorly to the paravertebral and epidural spaces, and&#xD;
      laterally to the intercostal space at several levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cadaveric studies was done on ESPB using MRI to evaluate the spread of local anesthetic mixed&#xD;
      with gadolinium dye. Showed the spread of injected volume of 30 ml at level of T10 spread&#xD;
      between the level of T5 and T12 . Other cadaveric study showed the spread of the dye to&#xD;
      thoracic paravertebral space which may explain the visceral analgesic effect of the block.&#xD;
