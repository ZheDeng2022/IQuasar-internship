  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of androgen ablation therapy with or without niraparib&#xD;
      after standard of care radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has&#xD;
      not spread to other parts of the body (localized) or that has spread to nearby tissue or&#xD;
      lymph nodes (locally advanced). Androgen ablation therapy (also known as hormone therapy)&#xD;
      lowers the levels of male hormones called androgens in the body. Androgens stimulate prostate&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow. There are 2 types of androgen ablation therapy given in this study: AAP&#xD;
      + ADT and Apa + ADT. AAP + ADT is the treatment combination of the drugs abiraterone acetate&#xD;
      and prednisone (AAP) given with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT, also known as androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy or androgen suppression medication, which is used as standard of care to&#xD;
      lower testosterone levels in men with high risk localized or metastatic prostate cancer). Apa&#xD;
      + ADT is the treatment combination of the drug apalutamide (Apa) given with ADT. Androgen&#xD;
      ablation therapy with or without niraparib after radiation therapy may help to control the&#xD;
      disease in patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the efficacy of addition of adjuvant niraparib to maximal androgen signaling&#xD;
      ablation (AAP + ADT) versus maximal androgen signaling ablation alone (Apa + ADT) following&#xD;
      definitive radiation therapy (XRT) for biomarker-selected men with poor histopathologic&#xD;
      response to neoadjuvant androgen signaling ablative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of adjuvant niraparib with androgen ablation versus&#xD;
      androgen ablation alone following definitive XRT in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the impact of the addition of adjuvant niraparib to maximal androgen signaling&#xD;
      ablation (AAP + ADT) versus maximal androgen signaling ablation alone (Apa + ADT) following&#xD;
      definitive XRT for biomarker-selected men with good and poor histopathologic response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant androgen signaling ablative therapy on overall survival III. Determine the impact&#xD;
      of the niraparib + AAP + ADT and Apa+ADT treatment on eugonadal (non-castrate levels of&#xD;
      testosterone) progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the impact of favorable versus unfavorable histologic response on&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) in men who received maximal androgen signaling ablation prior&#xD;
      to definitive radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collect and archive solid and liquid tumor samples, as well as normal blood samples for&#xD;
      germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), immune, and metabolic profiles from all study patients&#xD;
      for later hypothesis generating associations. Assess the relationship of histopathologic&#xD;
      score with circulating markers and clinical outcomes of progression free survival for&#xD;
      biomarker discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1 NEOADJUVANT PHASE (CYCLES 1-3): Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-28, and physician's choice ADT. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2 RADIATION PHASE (CYCLES 4-6): Within 30 days of completing Part 1, patients undergo&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Patients also receive apalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 and physician's&#xD;
      choice ADT. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 3 ADJUVANT PHASE (CYCLES 7 AND BEYOND): Patients with favorable response after Part 2&#xD;
      continue Apa + ADT. Patients with unfavorable response after Part 2 are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Patients receive apalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 and physician's choice ADT.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Patients receive abiraterone acetate PO QD, prednisone PO twice daily (BID),&#xD;
      physician's choice ADT, and niraparib PO QD. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 14 days, at 30-90 days,&#xD;
      and then every 3 months for 3 years.&#xD;

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of adverse events. Examples include, but are not limited to superior&#xD;
             vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed&#xD;
             tomography (HRCT) scan, uncontrolled seizures, history of allogeneic organ transplant,&#xD;
             history of primary immunodeficiency or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits&#xD;
             obtaining informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to niraparib, apalutamide, and/or abiraterone&#xD;
             acetate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
             physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (e.g. prior stroke within&#xD;
             1year to randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation, Schwannoma, meningioma, or&#xD;
             other benign central nervous system [CNS] or meningeal disease which may require&#xD;
             treatment with surgery or radiation therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction (within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment), symptomatic congestive heart failure, arterial or venous thromboembolic&#xD;
             events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient&#xD;
             ischemic attacks), uncontrolled hypertension, or clinically significant ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmias within 6 months prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence of any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active uncontrolled infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral&#xD;
                  hepatitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any chronic medical condition requiring a higher dose of corticosteroid than 10&#xD;
                  mg prednisone/prednisolone once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone acetate treatment. If&#xD;
                  a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate&#xD;
                  dosing frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with CYP2D6 substrates that have a&#xD;
                  narrow therapeutic index. If an alternative treatment cannot be used, exercise&#xD;
                  caution and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Baseline moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B &amp; C)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude&#xD;
                  participation in this study&#xD;
