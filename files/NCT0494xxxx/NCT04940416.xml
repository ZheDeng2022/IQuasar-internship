      This study involves utilizing a noninvasive computer application (Neurofit) that performs&#xD;
      oculometric assessment of dynamic visual processing in patients with liver cirrhosis to see&#xD;
      if the presence of advance liver disease influences eye movement metrics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is an increasingly prevalent medical condition in the United States that impacts&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, healthcare resource utilization and survival. Patients with&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis occasionally suffer from hepatic encephalopathy which is a serious&#xD;
      complication that results from portosystemic shunting of blood leading to a spectrum of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric changes and alteration in consciousness levels when it becomes overt (overt&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy, OHE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic encephalopathy affects 30-45% of patients with cirrhosis and its occurrence and&#xD;
      progression is associated with higher mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is an independent predictor of hospital&#xD;
      readmissions in patients with cirrhosis. Encephalopathy could be overt with obvious&#xD;
      deterioration in the level of consciousness leading to hospitalizations, but could also be&#xD;
      covert and less obvious to the patient and healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is often unrecognized by healthcare providers leading to&#xD;
      falls, motor vehicular accidents, and potential progression to overt confusion. Progression&#xD;
      of CHE to OHE makes recognition of this condition important as early identification and&#xD;
      treatment can potentially improve quality of life, reduce hospital readmissions and&#xD;
      healthcare costs. Existing diagnostic tools are not only tedious and time consuming, but also&#xD;
      impacted by factors such as level of education, reducing their utility in clinical practice.&#xD;
      The ideal test would be easy to use, quantifiable, quick, cheap, reliable, and able to&#xD;
      predict outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory study will utilize a noninvasive computer application (Neurofit) that&#xD;
      performs oculometric assessment of dynamic visual processing. Eye movements are short&#xD;
      latency, voluntary motor behaviors that consist of various aspects including visual motion,&#xD;
      pursuit initiation, steady-state tracking, direction tuning, and speed tuning. The computer&#xD;
      application is based on an eye movement methodology that can quantify many aspects of human&#xD;
      dynamic visual processing using a noninvasive video-based eye tracking technology with&#xD;
      validated oculometric analysis techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have demonstrated sensorimotor dysfunction in patients with diffuse brain&#xD;
      injury which leads to derangement in information processing throughout the brain. This&#xD;
      computer application has been utilized in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Liston&#xD;
      et al, in a study of 34 TBI patients, demonstrated that TBI patients had several individual&#xD;
      oculometrics that were significantly deranged including pursuit latency, initial pursuit&#xD;
      acceleration, pursuit gain, catch-up saccade amplitude, proportion smooth tracking, and speed&#xD;
      responsiveness as compared to a separate control group. The application was able to&#xD;
      discriminate TBI subjects from controls with an 81% probability that increased with&#xD;
      self-reported TBI severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Hepatic encephalopathy is believed to occur as a consequence of portosystemic&#xD;
      shunting leading to toxins, octapamines, free fatty acids amongst others accumulating in the&#xD;
      brain, causing impairment in neurocognitive functioning. The extent of brain dysfunction&#xD;
      associated with hepatic encephalopathy has not been fully characterized. Hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy could potentially impair global brain function leading to oculomotor&#xD;
      discoordination that can be detected with this computer software. By comparing individual and&#xD;
      composite oculometric data between patients with cirrhosis and those without cirrhosis this&#xD;
      study may identify any significant differences or distinct patterns that may exist as a&#xD;
      result of hepatic encephalopathy. For this study, covert hepatic encephalopathy will be&#xD;
      determined by paper-based psychometric testing. Any data obtained from this&#xD;
      feasibility/exploratory study, will serve as preliminary data for larger studies and future&#xD;
      validation.&#xD;

    <description>These will include patients with cirrhosis. They will perform the paper-based standard psychometric tests (number connection test A, number connection test B, line tracing test, and digital subtraction test, and serial dotting test, which take about 20 minutes). After completion of paper-based standard psychometric tests, participants will then perform the computer application test which takes about 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>The Neurofit test involves sitting on a chair with a head and chin rest to maintain stability. Patients will then follow a moving object on the computer screen with their eyes which allows estimation of individual oculometrics along with a composite score. No physical contact or placement of invasive devices will be performed. The total time for completion of all the tests is estimated at 30 minutes.</description>
