  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the AKTIBIPO VALIDATION study is to evaluate the effect of the Mindpax monitoring&#xD;
      and microeducation system in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Up to 130 participants (BD&#xD;
      patients) who participated previously in the observational AKTIBIPO study will be enrolled&#xD;
      for a follow-up period of 12 months. All participants will wear the wrist actigraphy device&#xD;
      and use the Mindpax mobile application on their mobile phone. Through the application, the&#xD;
      patients will fill in the weekly mood self assessment questionnaire (ASERT) and receive&#xD;
      evidence-based health microeducations aimed at understanding the bipolar disorder and&#xD;
      associated risk factors. Apart from general psychoeducation, the participants will receive&#xD;
      additional individualized targeted health microeducation when the system detects deviation&#xD;
      from individual patterns of mood, activity and sleep. The outcomes will evaluate the&#xD;
      subjective and objective impact of system usage on self-reported and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      Study procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 130 participants (BD patients) who participated previously in the observational&#xD;
      AKTIBIPO study will be enrolled for a follow-up period of 12 months. All participants will&#xD;
      wear the wrist actigraphy device (Mindpax) at all times and use the Mindpax mobile&#xD;
      application. At enrollment and study completion, the participants will sign the informed&#xD;
      consent and undergo evaluation using the MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale)&#xD;
      and YMRS (Young mania rating scale) scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (M0) and every three months (M3,M6,M9,M12), the participants will fill in a&#xD;
      series of self-assessment questionnaires: the Q-les-Q (the Quality of life Enjoyment and&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire), HLS-CZ-12 (Health literacy survey), WHODAS 2.0 CZ (the WHO&#xD;
      disability assessment schedule), BMQ-CZ (Beliefs about medicines questionnaire) and MARS-CZ&#xD;
      (the Medication adherence report scale). The patients will also be evaluated using the CGI-S&#xD;
      (Clinical global impression, M0-M12). The psychosocial and clinical events (hospitalizations,&#xD;
      relapses), current medication and illness history will be collected throughout the study&#xD;
      (M0-M12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the change in Q-les-Q score at M12, compared to M0. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include: i) higher health status (lower number of hospitalization days, compared to&#xD;
      the same amount of time in the preceding AKTIBIPO study), ii) lower subjectively rated&#xD;
      symptom level (compared to the same amount of time in the preceding AKTIBIPO study), iii)&#xD;
      higher rate of health literacy at M12, compared to M0, and iv) Higher treatment adherence and&#xD;
      better understanding to medication at M12, compared to M0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microeducation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, microeducation messages will be delivered to patients via Mindpax&#xD;
           smartphone app on a regular basis (at least once a week, maximum two messages per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This approach will aim at well-being, coping with stress, increasing the regularity and&#xD;
           stabilization of social rhythms, daily routines and therapy adherence. The main focus is&#xD;
           to enhance role functioning in the society and workspace, and decrease the likelihood of&#xD;
           another mood episodes among patients in a symptomatic illness stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generic microeducational messages will address a wide array of stress-coping and&#xD;
           interpersonal problem areas such as grief for &quot;losing&quot; the healthy self and&#xD;
           disagreements with others, promoting the importance of therapy adherence, addressing&#xD;
           transitions that can affect the patient's normal routine, supplying information on&#xD;
           managing the bipolar illness, and providing tools for relapse prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two types of alert scores will be calculated for duration of sleep and overall activity.&#xD;
           Based on this alerting system, target microeducative messages will be consequently&#xD;
           generated and delivered on the participant's smartphone to help patients change their&#xD;
           maladaptive behavior by reducing current sleep/wake and daily activity irregularity and&#xD;
           avoid behaviors that may adversely affect social rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a meantime, digital diary smartphone feedback will provide continuously upgraded&#xD;
           infographics on variability of daily activities such as wake time, bed time, sleep&#xD;
           onset, sleep regularity and inter-daily variability in those parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This circadian feedback feature will inform patients to what extent the past&#xD;
           microeducative messages influenced their daily routines. This way, a feedback&#xD;
           information will encourage participants to change their behavior by showing the impact&#xD;
           that corrective behavior had on their mood. App feedback and microeducative content&#xD;
           could help prevent recurrences by helping the subject to recognize and modify their&#xD;
           future behaviors&#xD;
