      the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and long term outcomes of laser hemorroidoplasty&#xD;
      versus conventional milligan morgan hemorrhoidectomy in II-III degree hemorroidal disease.&#xD;

      Background Hemorrhoidal disease (HD) is a widespread condition and several surgical&#xD;
      techniques have been proposed to date without achieving a definitive consensus. Laser&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidoplasty (LHP) is a minimal invasive procedure for HD treatment determining the&#xD;
      shrinkage of the hemorrhoidal piles by diode laser limiting the postoperative discomfort and&#xD;
      pain. The aim of the current prospective randomized trial is to evaluate the postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes of HD patients undergoing LHP vs conventional Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Operative time, postoperative pain and complications, resolution of symptoms,&#xD;
      patients 'quality of life, patients' evaluation of treatment and length of return to daily&#xD;
      activity of II-III grade symptomatic HD patients undergoing LHP vs MM were prospectively&#xD;
      evaluated. The patients were followed-up for 24 months looking for recurrence of prolapsed&#xD;
      hemorrhoid or symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>Patients were considered to have recurrent hemorrhoidal symptoms when any of the following were recorded: bleeding, itching, pain or discomfort affecting patient's perception of quality of life, which could either be associated or not to prolapse recurrence. The Rovrik' score was adopted to assess this issue.</description>

    <description>A skin microincision of 3 mm was made about 1 to 1.5 cm of distance from the anal verge at the base of each hemorrhoidal node. The probe (1.85 mm of diameter) was driven through the incision in the submucosal tissue until reaching the area underneath the distal rectal mucosa. Then, ten to twelve effective pulses (adjusted to respective node dimensions), 8 watt per 3 seconds each, of approximately 24 Joule using a 1470-nm diode laser generator (LEONARDO® DUAL 45 Biolitec® Jena, Germany) were fired. Half of them were fired in the submucosal tissue, the others in the intra-nodal compartment determining the shrinkage of the hemorrhoidal piles. The anal wounds were left open. At the end of the procedure an anal tampon was positioned.</description>

    <description>The hemorrhoidectomy was performed by radiofrequency (LigaSure TM Small Jaw® Covidien®, Colorado, USA) or ultrasound (Focus® Ultracision® harmonic scalpel; Ethicon Endo-Surgery®, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio). The anodermal wedge was incised, eventually removing external fibrosis and/or skin tags when present. Upward dissection started at this level with en-bloc excision of mucosal and submucosal layers from the underlying internal anal sphincter up to the anorectal ring. A compressive haemostatic sponge was left in place for 12-24 hours.</description>
