  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will determine how best to manage the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in Pakistan by&#xD;
      measuring effectiveness of Pakistan-government sponsored current therapies, emergence of&#xD;
      viral resistance, consequences of infection (chiefly liver cancer) and through developing&#xD;
      models, based on incidence data, determine the proportion of people who need curative&#xD;
      treatment to eliminate HCV, and assess whether targeting can optimise this.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes liver damage and, in many, liver&#xD;
      cancer. We have effective drugs allowing us to cure most infected people and this stops the&#xD;
      liver becoming damaged. Hepatitis C is common in Pakistan and the government is planning a&#xD;
      massive national program to find and treat everyone who is infected. The government funded&#xD;
      treatment program will fund therapy and assumes that the drugs will cure the vast majority of&#xD;
      infected people and hence, in line with international recommendations they are not planning&#xD;
      to evaluate treatment outcomes. The efficacy of the drugs used in Pakistan (sofosbuvir plus&#xD;
      daclatasvir) have not been widely assessed in the Pakistani population and their efficacy is&#xD;
      not yet proven. We therefore do not yet know how effective the drugs that will be used in&#xD;
      Pakistan will be and we will study this by testing people after treatment to determine&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness. This approach has been welcomed by the Pakistani government who&#xD;
      recognise the importance of the data that we will generate from this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will additionally look at the impact of hepatitis C on an individual's quality of life and&#xD;
      how much they spend on healthcare by using questionnaires administered by the trial team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will look at viral factors influencing treatment failure by studying viral resistance by&#xD;
      sequencing the virus from people who do and do not respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether or not re-infection is a significant problem in Pakistan we will look at&#xD;
      people who have been cured of hepatitis C and retest them one year later. We will also retest&#xD;
      people who initially tested negative to determine the annual infection rates in previously&#xD;
      uninfected people. To determine risk factors for infection reinfected people and some of the&#xD;
      non-reinfected cohort will be asked to complete a questionnaire on risk factors for&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major effects of hepatitis C is induction of liver cancer. We will look at people&#xD;
      who did and did not develop liver cancer following hepatitis C infection and we will compare&#xD;
      viral sequences to see if there are viral variants that predispose to liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will help make treatments more effective in Pakistan and we will work out, by&#xD;
      modelling, how many people need to be cured to stop the spread of infection. We will look at&#xD;
      which viruses cause cancer to help find better ways to screen and treat hepatitis C induced&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this work, we will join colleagues in Pakistan to run a separate clinical&#xD;
      trial of different treatments in people who did not respond to antiviral therapy. It is noted&#xD;
      here to ensure that the comprehensive nature of this research study is recognised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedure will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To screen, informed written consent will be obtained from participants who fulfil the&#xD;
           inclusion eligibility criteria. This will consist of any person in the community over 18&#xD;
           years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected on paper CRFs which will be securely stored prior to the data&#xD;
           being transferred to a secure on-line database. Paper records will be retained as&#xD;
           primary source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening log will be completed which will record the age group, gender and brief&#xD;
           details of eligibility or ineligibility as well as administration errors and reasons why&#xD;
           the patient may not have been willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After obtaining written informed consent, a study specific participant identification&#xD;
           number (ID) will be assigned to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial HCV screening of individuals will be with a rapid HCV antibody test (SD Rapid&#xD;
           Test 02FK10, Standard Diagnostics, Inc., Republic of Korea) which is a WHO pre-qualified&#xD;
           test and has been validated previously at AKU. The output on the RDT cassette is read&#xD;
           independently by two observers (who are trained and certified) and recorded accordingly.&#xD;
           Discrepant RDT results will be resolved with HCV RNA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In people who are HCV antibody positive 10ml blood will be collected for HCV RNA&#xD;
           testing, CBC, AST, ALT, serum creatinine and HBsAg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients who are HCV RNA positive and who enter the study before commencing&#xD;
           treatment, prior to therapy (Day 1) the patient will be asked to complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and risk factor questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QOL EQ5D-3L questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Productivity questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthcare usage questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be completed by all patients until 200 HCV positive and 1000 HCV patients as&#xD;
           well as 50 cirrhotic patients are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of cirrhosis will be determined using a non-invasive test for fibrosis such&#xD;
           as the APRI using cut-offs of &lt; 1.5, as well as Fibroscan where available. Patients who&#xD;
           have liver cirrhosis demonstrated by high APRI or a fibro scan or ultrasound or a liver&#xD;
           biopsy if available will be treated for 24 weeks (6 months). Patients who do not&#xD;
           demonstrate liver cirrhosis will be treated with a course of 12 weeks (three months) as&#xD;
           per the standard regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on their first clinic visit will have a thorough medical history taken with a&#xD;
           general and a systemic physical examination, HCV status will be relayed to the patient&#xD;
           and counselling regarding the disease and treatment will be untaken where needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo government/NGO or self-funded sofosbuvir + daclatasvir first-line&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will be taken 12 weeks (range 10-18 weeks) after the completion of&#xD;
           treatment regimen for SVR testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV negative individual will be recalled for repeat HCV antibody testing after 12 months&#xD;
           (range 11-14 months). They will be asked to complete risk factor questions if they are&#xD;
           newly HCV antibody positive. Additionally, 4 times as many matched HCV negative&#xD;
           individuals will also complete the risk factor questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who were HCV positive at screening and have successful first-line treatment will&#xD;
           be invited 12 months after the completion of the treatment regimen for repeat HCV&#xD;
           testing by HCV core antigen. All re-infected patients will also undertake:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk factor questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QOL EQ5D-3L questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Productivity questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample for viral sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four times as many HCV negative matched individuals will also complete the three&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost effectiveness of the treatment regimen will be measured from the Pakistan health&#xD;
           service perspective. Costings for the drugs, clinic, laboratory testing, staff and&#xD;
           facility costs associated with each treatment regimen per patient will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be monitored monthly, and treatment will be discontinued if they develop&#xD;
           cirrhosis/decompensated liver disease. If the patient becomes pregnant or starts nursing&#xD;
           an infant. Patients will also stop treatment if they develop major side effects or major&#xD;
           weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may withdraw from a research study for any reason, without penalty. For&#xD;
           evaluation and reporting purposes, researchers may ask participants for their reasons&#xD;
           for early withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests during the trial will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood tests taken to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HCV RNA testing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HCV core antigen testing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hepatitis B serum antigen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum asparate aminotransferase (AST)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AST/ALT ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Platelet count&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  APRI [(AST/AST upper limit))/platelet count] x100&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alpha-fetopotein (AFP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sodium&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prothrombin time (PT)/ International normalized ratio (INR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Model for end of stage liver disease (MELD) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fibroscan or liver biopsy to assess cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood sample to measure sustained virological response (SVR - defined as HCV RNA&#xD;
           undetectable using a molecular diagnostic assay with a sensitivity of &lt;100 IU/ml) 12&#xD;
           weeks after the completion of the second-line antiviral therapy. Once all participants&#xD;
           have their SVR assess this will be the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV whole genome sequencing to detect viral polymorphisms associated with treatment outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all treatment failure patients, the stored baseline plasma samples will be used for&#xD;
           nucleic acid extraction. NGS library preparation will be performed and HCV whole genome&#xD;
           sequences will be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline plasma samples from the same number of patients who have achieved SVR and are&#xD;
           matched according to age, sex, cirrhosis and HCV infection risk factors will also be&#xD;
           used to generate HCV whole genome sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will use logistic regression to test for association between all polymorphic sites in&#xD;
           the virus polyprotein and treatment outcome accounting for confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV whole genome sequencing to detect viral polymorphisms associated with HCC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all the patients enrolled in the HCC study (patients with HCV associated HCC),&#xD;
           stored baseline plasma samples will be used for nucleic acid extraction. NGS library&#xD;
           preparation will be performed and HCV whole genome sequences will be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline plasma samples from the same number of patients with HCV associated cirrhosis&#xD;
           which are matched according to age, sex and HCV infection risk factors will also be used&#xD;
           to generate HCV whole genome sequences. These patients will be chosen from the ~5000&#xD;
           enrolled in the treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will use logistic regression to test for association between all polymorphic sites in&#xD;
           the virus polyprotein and HCC accounting for confounding factors. Additionally, we will&#xD;
           run a focused analysis on NS5B A150V polymorphism and other viral polymorphism&#xD;
           associated with HCC&#xD;
