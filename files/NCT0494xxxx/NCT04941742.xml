  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between fractionated exhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide, peripheral eosinophils, and plasma citrulline and ß-alanine in patients with&#xD;
      eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) compared to those without EoE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a combination of elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide, increased&#xD;
      peripheral eosinophils, and elevated plasma citrulline and ß-alanine is associated with&#xD;
      active EoE.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric patient, ages 5-18 years old, who will undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy&#xD;
             with biopsies at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, as part of the standard of care&#xD;
             in the evaluation of EoE&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent by a parent or legal guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed assent form by the child/adolescent subjects 7-18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past medical history of active asthma, active allergic rhinitis, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease (IBD), parasitic infection, hay fever and any exposure to smoking (including&#xD;
             secondhand smoke) because these disorders are known to affect the FeNO levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active respiratory tract infections at the time of FeNO evaluation because this can&#xD;
             affect the result of the FeNO as well&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma questionnaire and/or Spirometry test consistent with asthma&#xD;
