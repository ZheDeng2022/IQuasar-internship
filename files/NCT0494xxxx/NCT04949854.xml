  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to demonstrate that the control ultralong intravenous catheter without the&#xD;
      guide wire is equivalent to the experimental catheter with the guide wire. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that the 6.35 cm 20G ultralong Ultrasound Guided Peripheral Intravenous (USPIV)&#xD;
      will have no difference in survival compared to the 5.71 cm ultralong with wire USPIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) insertion is a standard hospital procedure that&#xD;
      enables providers to rapidly administer fluids, medications, or blood products directly into&#xD;
      a patients vein. This allows patients who have difficulty with tolerating oral intake or&#xD;
      patients who are being prepared for surgery to still receive the proper treatments.&#xD;
      Furthermore, because many medications are not designed to be administered orally, a PIVC is&#xD;
      often used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite being a common procedure, PIVC insertion routinely fails with failure rates of&#xD;
      traditional blind intravenous (IV) catheter placement ranging from 19%-29.9%. Common causes&#xD;
      of failure include infiltration,occlusion, dislodgement, phlebitis, and infection. In&#xD;
      addition to increasing costs, multiple placements of an IV catheter during a hospital stay&#xD;
      places a considerable time burden on hospital staff.One effort to alleviate this burden has&#xD;
      been the introduction of ultrasound, which is shown to help mitigate failure rates of PIVC&#xD;
      placement in patients with difficult vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter length in vein is the single most relevant variable in determining catheter&#xD;
      survival in USPIV insertions. IV Catheter survival depends on the length of the catheter&#xD;
      inside the veins. Vein depth and angle of insertion play a significant role in choosing the&#xD;
      right catheter length to achieve the ideal quantity of catheter in vein. When a shallow angle&#xD;
      is used, the catheter distance to the vein also increases and longer catheters are needed to&#xD;
      achieve the optimal 2.75 cm in vein. Unfortunately, the longest most commonly stocked&#xD;
      peripheral IV catheter at most institutions is 4.78 cm. This length is inadequate for&#xD;
      insertions with a vein depth of greater than approximately 0.75 cm. As this is a commonly&#xD;
      encountered vein depth, longer peripheral IV catheters are needed to ensure improved catheter&#xD;
      survival.Few peripheral intravenous catheter options exist with the Ultra Long profile. The&#xD;
      6.35 cm B. Braun deep access device and the BD 5.71 cm Accucath device are two commercially&#xD;
      available options for this category of ultra long peripheral IVs. Both catheters are&#xD;
      available and being used in Beaumont Hospital.The 6.35 cm option is similar to other&#xD;
      peripheral IV catheters and is inserted using the same technique applied for all ultrasound&#xD;
      guided IV insertions. The 5.71 cm option is similar to other peripheral IVs with the&#xD;
      additional feature of a built-in wire within the device to help guide the catheter in the&#xD;
      vein once the needle has penetrated the vein. The cost of the 5.71 cm option is approximately&#xD;
      ten times the cost of the 6.35 cm device.&#xD;
