    <textblock>
      A randomized, prospective study conducted on the basis of a social network (Instagram&#xD;
      platform), two-stage. At the first stage, the online school &quot;Save Your Heart&quot; was announced&#xD;
      and 945 applicants were enrolled in the training. The online school curriculum consisted of&#xD;
      the following blocks: &quot;Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)&quot;, &quot;Healthy Nutrition&#xD;
      for the Heart&quot;, &quot;Cholesterol. What is important for the patient to know? &quot;,&quot; Physical&#xD;
      activity for the prevention of CVD &quot;,&quot; Overweight and obesity &quot;,&quot; Smoking as a risk factor&#xD;
      for CVD &quot;,&quot; AH: diagnosis &quot;,&quot; AH: treatment &quot;,&quot; Myocardial infarction: diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment&quot;. At the 2nd stage, 125 participants were selected by random randomization, then&#xD;
      distributed into 4 training groups to provide training materials: group 1 (n = 31) - then&#xD;
      text publications up to 4 thousand characters, group 2 (n = 31) - short video clips up to 5&#xD;
      minutes, group 3 (n = 33) - first text publications, then video clips, group 4 (n = 30) -&#xD;
      video clips, then text publications. Before and after school, respondents from all four&#xD;
      groups completed the HDKQ questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the potential of the Instagram social network in increasing the medical literacy of&#xD;
      people with essential hypertension and to develop methodological approaches to informing the&#xD;
      population about the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases through social networks,&#xD;
      including hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the level of knowledge about risk factors and cardiovascular diseases among&#xD;
           users of social networks with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a comparative assessment of the impact of the type of information materials for&#xD;
           patients in social networks (Group I - text, Group II - video, Group III - video + text,&#xD;
           Group IV - text + video) on the level of its understanding and assimilation by persons&#xD;
           with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the possibilities of perceiving information on the primary prevention of&#xD;
           cardiovascular diseases, depending on the gender, age and social status of users of&#xD;
           social networks suffering from hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research site is the social network Instagram, 4 new accounts will be created to complete&#xD;
      the assigned tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adapted HDKQ (Heart Disease Knowledge Questionnaire) with additional gender, age and&#xD;
      social status questions will be sent to those eligible for inclusion before the start of the&#xD;
      educational program. Respondents to the questions of the questionnaire should be sent in text&#xD;
      format to the private messages of the project account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The format of interaction with the audience includes 8 text publications up to 4 thousand&#xD;
      characters and 8 video publications up to 5 minutes long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text and video publications will be identical in terms of text content, and they will also&#xD;
      reflect the answers to each question of the HDKQ questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Healthy food for the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. What is important to know?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical activity. How much movement does it take to keep your heart healthy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Overweight and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Smoking as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Hypertension: diagnosis, treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Myocardial infarction is one of the most formidable cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be divided into 4 groups (4 separate accounts), similar in gender, age&#xD;
      and social status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      in group I, project participants will only be presented with video publications on each of&#xD;
      the declared topics (8 in total), in group II - only text publications (total 8), in group&#xD;
      III - first text publications, and then video publications (16 in total), in group IV - first&#xD;
      video publications, and then text publications (16 in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the educational program, participants will again be asked to answer the&#xD;
      questions of the adapted HDKQ (Heart Disease Knowledge Questionnaire) questionnaire.&#xD;
