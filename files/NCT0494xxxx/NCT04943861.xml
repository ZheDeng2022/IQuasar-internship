  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to better understand how FI (food insecurities) contributes&#xD;
      to the development of cardiometabolic comorbidities among PWH (People with HIV) and to test a&#xD;
      novel bilingual FI intervention designed to reduce these comorbidities among food insecure&#xD;
      PWH. The PI and staff will conduct this study in partnership with the Wake Forest Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Specialty Clinic, one of the largest Ryan White-funded clinics in North Carolina,&#xD;
      which serves more than 2,000 PWH annually from a predominantly rural catchment area that&#xD;
      includes South Central Appalachia. This area has high rates of both FI and HIV.&#xD;

      The proposed study the team has created a conceptually integrated, mixed methods study that&#xD;
      includes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal data collection to explore the difference in the prevalence and incidence&#xD;
           of cardiometabolic comorbidities between food secure and insecure PWH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation and evaluation of the weCare/Secure intervention designed to improve&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity among food insecure PWH with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes (T2DM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semi-structured individual in-depth interviews to understand the effect of the&#xD;
           intervention on FI and insulin sensitivity among participants in an randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial (RCT) trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Broad dissemination of study findings to inform both research and clinical practice&#xD;
