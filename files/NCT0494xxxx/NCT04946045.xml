      To examine the effects of sensorimotor interventions applied to in preterm infants on&#xD;
      readiness for feeding and oral feeding success.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The preterm neonate population cannot potentially be fed orally for a long time in the&#xD;
      postnatal period. However, the inability of preterm infants to be fed orally as soon as they&#xD;
      are born is not a disease, their adaptation to the external environment of the uterus is more&#xD;
      complicated because their physiological functions are not yet mature. This also means long&#xD;
      hospital stays for premature babies. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has&#xD;
      determined that oral feeding is one of the main criteria for the discharge of the preterm&#xD;
      infant from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been conducted on preterm infants on optimizing oral feeding performance.&#xD;
      Studies improve oral feeding skills of preterm infants by applying various sensorimotor&#xD;
      interventions and cue-based feeding protocols to improve oral feeding performance. These&#xD;
      sensorimotor interventions; non-nutritive sucking (pacifier), sucking-swallowing exercises,&#xD;
      oral support, oral stimulation, tactile stimulation, kinesthetic stimulation, sound, smell,&#xD;
      audio-visual stimulations, etc. methods were used alone or in combination with these methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in studies that sensorimotor interventions increase the success of oral&#xD;
      feeding in preterms, increase the daily feeding volume, increase weight gain, reduce the cost&#xD;
      by shortening the hospital stay, shorten the transition time from gastric feeding to&#xD;
      oral/breastfeeding and help mother-infant bonding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This thesis study was conducted using evidence-based interventions that can facilitate the&#xD;
      development of oral feeding skills in preterm infants, the feeding problems they encounter,&#xD;
      and their transition from gastric feeding to oral feeding.&#xD;
