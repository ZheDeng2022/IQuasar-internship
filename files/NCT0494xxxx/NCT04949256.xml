  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      lenvatinib plus chemotherapy compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line&#xD;
      intervention in participants with metastatic esophageal carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib plus chemotherapy is superior&#xD;
      to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with respect to overall survival (OS) and progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by&#xD;
      blinded independent central review (BICR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 2 parts to the study: the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (FP) Safety&#xD;
      Run-in (Part 1) and the Main Study (Part 2). In Part 1 (FP Safety Run-in), participants will&#xD;
      be treated with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib plus FP. Dose-limiting toxicities, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 (Main Study), participants (not including those participating in Part 1) will be&#xD;
      treated with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib plus chemotherapy or pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability will be assessed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and ~24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall HRQoL. Participant responses to the question &quot; How would you rate your overall quality of life (QoL) during the past week?&quot; are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). A higher score indicates a better overall QoL. Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100.

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire to assess measurements specific to esophageal cancer. It contains 18 items and is based on four subscales-dysphagia, eating, reflux and pain. All items are scored using a four-point scale that offers these response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. A higher score indicates worse level of symptoms. Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The change from baseline in HRQoL QLQ-OES18 score in participants in Part 2 will be presented.</description>
