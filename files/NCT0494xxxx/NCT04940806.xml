  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By comparing the differences of orexin-A, HLA gene, PSG, MSLT and other parameters in the&#xD;
      evaluation of narcolepsy patients, investigators could find out the relatively high value&#xD;
      indicators in the diagnosis of narcolepsy, which is helpful to guide the clinical discovery,&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Narcolepsy is a lifelong sleep disorder disease, mainly occurs in the 15~30 year old youth.&#xD;
      The incidence rate in different country population is different, which is 0.04% in China.&#xD;
      Because of its low incidence rate, and the lack of clinicians' knowledge, it is easy to cause&#xD;
      missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. The decrease of cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A level,&#xD;
      positive HLA-DQB1 * 0602 and MSLT all have directive significance for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      narcolepsy, but patients with other diseases and healthy people can also show positive&#xD;
      indicators. These false positives may lead to wrong judgments. By comparing the differences&#xD;
      of orexin-A, HLA gene, PSG, MSLT and other parameters in the evaluation of narcolepsy&#xD;
      patients, investigators could find out the relatively high value indicators in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of narcolepsy, which is helpful to guide the clinical discovery, diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      narcolepsy.&#xD;

It can be used to evaluate the depressive symptoms of depression, manic depression, neurosis and other diseases. The higher the score, the more anxiety.&#xD;
It can be used to evaluate the depressive symptoms of depression, manic depression, neurosis and other diseases. The higher the score, the more anxiety.&#xD;
It can be used to evaluate the depressive symptoms of depression, manic depression, neurosis and other diseases. The higher the score, the more anxiety.&#xD;
It can be used to evaluate the depressive symptoms of depression, manic depression, neurosis and other diseases. The higher the score, the more anxiety.&#xD;

The samples that could not be detected immediately were stored at - 80 ℃ for detection (about half a year for detection). The level of orexin-A in cerebrospinal fluid was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
