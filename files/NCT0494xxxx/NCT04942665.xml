  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging after an intravenous injection of indocyanine green&#xD;
      (ICG) allows for the intraoperative identification of liver anatomy. The investigators have&#xD;
      new data that a much lower dose improves this visualization. Confirmation of this hypothesis&#xD;
      would mean that ICG can be administered on the same day of surgery in order to augment&#xD;
      real-time intraoperative visualization, thereby providing a safe, feasible, and&#xD;
      cost-effective strategy for the surgical treatment of liver disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have a series of surgical cases in which the investigators have been able&#xD;
      to achieve excellent intraoperative biliary visualization with a greatly decreased (50-200&#xD;
      fold lower) dose of ICG than the previously published dose. Furthermore, this decreased dose&#xD;
      was visible in about 15-20 minutes from the time of injection with low liver background&#xD;
      fluorescence, a significant improvement that would make its utilization in the operating room&#xD;
      more practical. The investigators hypothesize that a lower dose will: 1) allow adequate&#xD;
      visualization of the extrahepatic biliary tree, including the cystic, common hepatic, and&#xD;
      common bile ducts and 2) result in adequate retention of ICG in both primary and metastatic&#xD;
      tumors of the liver, facilitating tumor visualization. Confirmation of either of these&#xD;
      hypotheses would mean that ICG can be administered on the same day of surgery in order to&#xD;
      augment real-time intraoperative localization of the extrahepatic biliary tree and hepatic&#xD;
      tumors, thereby providing a safe, feasible, and cost-effective strategy for the surgical&#xD;
      treatment of liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to test our hypothesis with the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the efficacy and utility of a low dose ICG (0.05 mg) protocol with a&#xD;
      previously published dose (2.5 mg) in imaging the extrahepatic biliary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the efficacy and utility of a same day, low dose ICG (0.05 mg) protocol&#xD;
      with a previously published dose (2.5 mg) of ICG administered 1-7 days prior to surgery in&#xD;
      imaging hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver masses.&#xD;

Patients with a history of adverse reactions or known allergy to ICG, iodine, or iodine dyes will be excluded.</intervention_model_description>
