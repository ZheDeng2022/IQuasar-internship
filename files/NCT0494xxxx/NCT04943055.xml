      To compare the clinical effects of low temperature plasma ablation combined with lacrimal&#xD;
      duct catheterization and YAG lacrimal duct laser combined with lacrimal duct catheterization&#xD;
      in the treatment of lacrimal duct obstruction&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Low-temperature plasma technology has developed rapidly in recent decades and is now widely&#xD;
      used in ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, urology and other fields .The&#xD;
      low-temperature plasma surgery system relies on a 100kHz radio frequency electric field to&#xD;
      excite normal saline (0.9% NaCl) to generate plasma energy, and relies on a 50-100 μm plasma&#xD;
      layer generated at the front of the plasma knife to perform precise cutting, ablation and&#xD;
      hemostaxy. But the application of this technique in the field of lacrimal duct still needs&#xD;
      the accumulation of clinical experience.This study was aimed to compare the clinical effects&#xD;
      of low temperature plasma ablation combined with lacrimal duct catheterization and YAG&#xD;
      lacrimal duct laser combined with lacrimal duct catheterization in the treatment of lacrimal&#xD;
      duct obstruction&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Low temperature plasma lacrimal duct obstruction ablation combined with lacrimal duct catheterization</intervention_name>
    <description>The operation used a tear point dilator to expand the patient's upper and lower tear points, YAG laser/low-temperature plasma knife was used to clear the obstructed site of the patient, and normal saline was used to rinse to ensure the patency of the lacrimal passage. The silicone lacrimal duct drainage tube was selected to put the lacrimal duct drainage tube in the upper and lower lacrimal dots of the patient, and the metal probe was removed after using a crochet, and the drainage tube was moderately pulled upward from the center of the upper and lower lacrimal dots to facilitate the smooth passage of the drainage tube through the whole lacrimal duct and achieve the purpose of dredging the blocked site again. Adjust the length of the drainage tube in the nasal vestibule and leave it in the nasal cavity.</description>
