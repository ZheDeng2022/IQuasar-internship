      As vasoconstrictors adversely affect pulpal hemodynamics, this study compared the pulpal&#xD;
      oxygen saturation levels after employing inferior alveolar nerve block with 2% mepivacaine&#xD;
      with 1:100,000 epinephrine (2% Scandonest Special) and 3% mepivacaine (3% Scandonest&#xD;
      Plain).Two groups were made with 30 patients in each group. 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000&#xD;
      epinephrine (2% Scandonest Special) was administered to the patients in Group A whereas 3%&#xD;
      mepivacaine (3% Scandonest Plain) was administered to the patients in Group B. Rubber dam&#xD;
      application, cavity preparation and composite filling was then done on the selected carious&#xD;
      mandibular premolar. Pulpal oxygen saturation levels were recorded after administration of&#xD;
      local anesthesia with Nellcor-550 pulse oximeter and Nellcor D-YS Multisite reusable sensor.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND ' Local anesthesia is the foremost requirement of an efficient operative dental&#xD;
      procedure to be executed in a pain free and calm environment. Local anesthesia is available&#xD;
      in two forms: with vasoconstrictor and without vasoconstrictor. As vasoconstrictors adversely&#xD;
      affect pulpal hemodynamics, this study aims to compare the pulpal oxygen saturation levels&#xD;
      after employing inferior alveolar nerve block with 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine&#xD;
      (2% Scandonest Special) and 3% mepivacaine (3% Scandonest Plain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NULL HYPOTHESIS There is no difference between the pulpal oxygen saturation levels after&#xD;
      administering 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and 3% mepivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS There is a difference between the pulpal oxygen saturation levels after&#xD;
      administering 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and 3% mepivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD Two groups were made with 30 patients in each group. 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000&#xD;
      epinephrine (2% Scandonest Special) was administered to the patients in Group A whereas 3%&#xD;
      mepivacaine (3% Scandonest Plain) was administered to the patients in Group B. Rubber dam&#xD;
      application, cavity preparation and composite filling was then done on the selected carious&#xD;
      mandibular premolar. Pulpal oxygen saturation levels were recorded after administration of&#xD;
      local anesthesia with the Nellcor- PM 10N pulse oximeter and Nellcor D-YS Multisite reusable&#xD;
      sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical package for social sciences version 21.0 is used for&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Mean and standard deviation of the pulpal oxygen saturation levels for&#xD;
      filled and unfilled teeth under the effect of 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and&#xD;
      3% mepivacaine were recorded. Mixed Way ANOVA will be applied to discern if there is any&#xD;
      difference in the pulpal oxygen saturation levels within and between the two groups. Post Hoc&#xD;
      Tuckey was applied to identify whether the paired difference is present within groups or&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
