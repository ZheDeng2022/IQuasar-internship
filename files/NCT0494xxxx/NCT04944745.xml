  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck-shoulder pain is among the most common health care problems, especially in office&#xD;
      workers and females. Forward shoulder posture (FSP) is a common postural deviation and known&#xD;
      risk factor for the development of neck-shoulder pain and pathology. Common approaches for&#xD;
      reducing FSP include stretching and performing manual techniques to increase the length and&#xD;
      extensibility of the scapular protractors, and strengthening the scapular retractors.&#xD;
      Myofascial release (MFR) is a group of manual techniques that elongate and soften restricted&#xD;
      fascia, however, the effects of myofascial release to the pectorals on FSP are currently&#xD;
      unknown. The objectives of this study are to determine the impact of 4-minutes of MFR on: 1)&#xD;
      FSP, 2) pectoral length, 3) muscle activity of the upper, middle, and lower trapezius and&#xD;
      pectoralis major, 4) scapular retractor to protractor ratio of activity, and 4) movement&#xD;
      performance compared to a soft-touch control. We hypothesize that MFR will: 1) decrease FSP,&#xD;
      2) increase pectoral length, 3) increase upper, middle, and lower trapezius activity and&#xD;
      decrease pectorals major activity, 4) increase the scapular retractor to protractor ratio of&#xD;
      activity, and 4) improve movement performance.&#xD;

    <description>The pectoral MFR will be completed by an experienced registered massage therapist (RMT). They will stand on the participant's right side slightly rotated to the left facing towards the participant's left hip and apply a cross-hand MFR technique to the superficial pectoral fascia on the right side. The therapist will begin by placing the distal region of the anterior palm of the anchoring hand (therapist's right hand) on the right edge of the anterior sternum at the level of the 3rd to the 6th ribs on the skin and the draping over the pectoral fascia. They will then apply a gentle posterior pressure to hold the fascia in place. The forearm of the mobilizing hand (RMT's left hand) will be directed to the right shoulder wit hate right forearm crossing over the left and the contact of are of the mobilizing hand will be the skin superficial to the pectoral fascia and insertion of pectorals major on the anterior aspect of the humerus. This will be held for four minutes.</description>

    <description>This control treatment will be set up the same way in regards to the RMT's hand placement, except no pressure will be applied. The RMT's hands will simply be resting over the contact points. This treatment will also be held for four minutes.</description>
