      Neck pain is a very common complaint. In the general population and musculoskeletal practice,&#xD;
      it occurs second to low back pain in its frequency. Neck pain has a point prevalence of&#xD;
      nearly 13% and lifetime prevalence of nearly 50%. Neck pain and disability are prevalent&#xD;
      throughout the industrialized society. It is a common reason for visits in accidents and&#xD;
      emergency departments. In Chiropractic treatment, Neck pain is the second most common&#xD;
      complaint. It Is the result of fast, mechanical, stressful life, lack of mobility and poor&#xD;
      posture. Some injury can also lead to neck pain. Sometimes neck pain lasts for a few days and&#xD;
      itself goes away, but when it persists for a long time it results in greater problems. Neck&#xD;
      pain is said to be more common in females than in males and in peaks at the middle age.&#xD;
      Sedentary lifestyles are contributing to the prevalence of neck pain. Neck pain is one of the&#xD;
      most debilitating musculoskeletal problems. Neck problems are a significant source of&#xD;
      disability to patients, but they have not been studied in detail as low back pain problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck pain can be categorized in many ways i.e. Duration(Acute, Sub acute, Chronic),&#xD;
      Intensity, Severity, Type(Mechanical, Neuropathic etc.). Among them duration proves to be the&#xD;
      best predictor of outcome. Short duration pain have better prognosis than long standing pain.&#xD;
      Mechanical Neck Pain is defined as widespread cervical and/or shoulder pain possessing&#xD;
      mechanical properties, such as symptoms aggravated by prolonged or abnormal neck posture,&#xD;
      neck mobility and/or by palpation of the neck musculature Mechanical pain originates from the&#xD;
      spine or by its supporting structures, such as muscles and ligaments. Pain arising from the&#xD;
      facet joints eg, arthritis, diskogenic pain, and myofascial pain can be named as Mechanical&#xD;
      pain. It is proposed to be associated with several anatomic structures, predominantly facet&#xD;
      joints and uncovertebral(Luschka's joints). The risk factors for mechanical neck pain include&#xD;
      abnormal posture, stress, substantial lifting and anxiety. Around 15% females and 10% males&#xD;
      suffer from Chronic mechanical neck pain at any one time in life. Clinicians find it&#xD;
      challenging to prevent a patient from entering into the chronic phase of their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most mobile part of the vertebral column is the upper cervical spine. And it is at the&#xD;
      expense of its mechanical stability. Neuromuscular control to the mobile cervical spine is&#xD;
      provided by the highly developed proprioceptive system. Neck pain can lead to disturbed&#xD;
      afferent input from the cervical region that may be a possible cause of symptoms such as&#xD;
      dizziness, unsteadiness, and visual disturbances. Signs of altered postural stability,&#xD;
      cervical proprioception, and head and eye movement control are also said to be the cause of&#xD;
      disturbed afferent input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By an abundance of mechanoreceptors, the proprioceptive system of the cervical spine is very&#xD;
      well developed especially from the muscle spindles in the deep segmental upper cervical&#xD;
      muscles. Muscle spindle afferent are more important because they are the first ones to&#xD;
      operate in proprioception. As compared to the lower cervical spine, the upper cervical spine&#xD;
      has an abundance of muscle spindle receptors and greater contributions to reflex activity and&#xD;
      connections to the visual and vestibular systems. It concludes that patients with the cause&#xD;
      of upper cervical complaints in neck pain have a greater chance for balance and visual&#xD;
      disturbances than those with complaints of lower cervical spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to maintain body orientation and posture in relation to the surrounding&#xD;
      environment is a key process required for normal functions such as coordinated movements.&#xD;
      Sensorimotor control of stable upright posture and head and eye movement depends on afferent&#xD;
      information from the vestibular, visual and proprioceptive systems, which all together merge&#xD;
      in several areas of the Central Nervous System. Proprioception is important for well-adapted&#xD;
      sensorimotor control. Proprioception fulfills roles in feedback sensorimotor control and&#xD;
      regulation of muscle stiffness, being specifically important for movement acuity, joint&#xD;
      stability, coordination, and balance. For head-eye co-ordination and movement control,&#xD;
      cervical proprioception is uniquely important. Musculoskeletal disorders due to pain,&#xD;
      effusion, trauma, and fatigue alter the normal proprioceptive mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck pain patients are said to have a poor awareness of their head and neck posture, and a&#xD;
      few patients are reported to complain about &quot;whopping head&quot; which might be the cause of&#xD;
      altered cervical position sense. The rehabilitation procedures in the field of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal diseases aim to improve muscular force, joint mobility, and proprioceptive&#xD;
      sensibility. Currently, only strength and mobility are evaluated in cervical spine&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs, although a wealth of cephalic and neck receptors suggests a major&#xD;
      emphasis on proprioceptive information in postural and dynamic functions of the head-neck&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by J Arami and colleagues (2014) on the &quot;Applicability of proprioceptive and&#xD;
      endurance measurement protocols to treat patient with chronic non-specific neck pain&quot; was&#xD;
      conducted. Chronic neck pain patients were divided into two groups, one of them received&#xD;
      endurance training and the other group received proprioceptive training. This study suggested&#xD;
      that endurance exercise was a more efficient method for improving endurance and&#xD;
      Proprioceptive training was better in resolving joint position error and Pain. Both protocol&#xD;
      appeared to be useful in treating patients with chronic non specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervicogenic headache is getting common in young adults along with proprioception deficit in&#xD;
      the cervical region. In this study, 30 participants of Cervicogenic headache were included.&#xD;
      The control group received stretching exercises. The experimental group in addition to&#xD;
      stretching received cervical stabilization exercises. Headache disability index and neck&#xD;
      proprioception were evaluated before and after the treatment programs. At the end of 4rth&#xD;
      week, Headache disability index scores and neck pain and proprioception error improved more&#xD;
      in the experimental group. Hence the study concluded that Cervical stabilization exercises&#xD;
      along with stretching are more effective in improving neck proprioception and Headache&#xD;
      disability index than stretching alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of strong coupling between gaze orientation and muscle neck activity has been&#xD;
      well documented in humans. This co-ordination between neck motor functions and eye strongly&#xD;
      suggest that eye head coupling based rehabilitation program are more appropriate to improve&#xD;
      neck proprioception and this afterwards aid in reducing pain. A comparison was done between&#xD;
      two groups of neck pain patients one of them receiving the traditional physiotherapy protocol&#xD;
      for chronic neck pain and the experimental group received an eye head coupling based&#xD;
      rehabilitation program modified from Revel et al., in addition to the traditional protocol&#xD;
      given to the other group. The results showed a significant reduction in scores of Neck Pain&#xD;
      and Disability scale in both groups with a greater decrease in the experimental subjects.&#xD;
