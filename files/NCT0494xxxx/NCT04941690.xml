  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Association for Sexual Health&#xD;
      (WAS), sexual health is directly related to everyone's mental health and quality of life.&#xD;
      Sexuality is innate to humans and is closely linked to their reproduction. Thus, a&#xD;
      correlation between unmet fertility desires and sexual disorders can be observed in infertile&#xD;
      couples. In fact, sexual intercourse itself will not be as natural in most cases and will&#xD;
      preferentially occur during the &quot;reproductive window&quot;. Thus, sexuality will be deprived of&#xD;
      recreational and erotic activities, and sexuality will be used only for reproduction. For&#xD;
      many men, sexual intercourse will become coercive, repetitive and mechanical, offering little&#xD;
      emotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interactions between infertility and wife recurrent miscarriage in sexuality are numerous&#xD;
      and complex. Many men will perceive their infertility as a loss of masculinity and virility&#xD;
      and may feel low self-esteem and depression, in addition, Decreased sperm quality may lead to&#xD;
      anxiety in men, which may eventually lead to temporary Sexual Dysfunction (SD).Therefore, the&#xD;
      need to identify SD and its severity is crucial for infertile men before receiving&#xD;
      individualized male treatment.&#xD;

      In this study, a cross-sectional and clinical survey was conducted using a questionnaire&#xD;
      method in the male department of the reproductive center of the First Hospital of Jilin&#xD;
      University, China. The questionnaire included general population information, International&#xD;
      Index of Sexual Function-5 (IIEF-5), Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), General&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorder-7 and CPSI. The inclusion criteria were: 1, men living with their wives and&#xD;
      planning to have children; 2, men seeking medical help for preconception tests, infertility,&#xD;
      and recurrent miscarriage of their wives; and 3, consenting to participate in the survey and&#xD;
      signing an informed consent form. Exclusion criteria were: 1, men with significant genital&#xD;
      malformations, severe cardiovascular disease, stroke and mental disorders; 2, men who could&#xD;
      not live with their female partners every day because they worked in different cities; 3,&#xD;
      medical history of female partners with reproductive system abnormalities by gynecological&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators also collect relevant test results (if any) from the included patients during&#xD;
      the visit. All patients routinely undergo a detailed male examination; for patients with&#xD;
      preconception testing, the examination may include sperm quality, blood group, infection&#xD;
      items (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, AIDS), TORCH, etc; For infertile patients, only a&#xD;
      sperm quality is performed in the first step; For patients whose wives have had recurrent&#xD;
      miscarriages and are preparing to conceive again, the examination may include a detailed male&#xD;
      examination, sperm quality, Chromosomes, blood group, infections (hepatitis B, C, syphilis,&#xD;
      AIDS), TORCH, etc. If no abnormality is found, there is no follow-up examination, and if&#xD;
      there is abnormality, further follow-up examination will be performed according to the&#xD;
      process of Chinese Male Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2016). All consultations&#xD;
      are in accordance with the process of Chinese Male Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines&#xD;
      (2016). This study will not increase the physical and financial burden of the subjects.&#xD;
