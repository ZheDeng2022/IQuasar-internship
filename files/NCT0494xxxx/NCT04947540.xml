  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia is derived from the Greek words, thals, which means sea, and emia, which means&#xD;
      blood, signifying that it is more common in the Mediterranean region . Globally, among&#xD;
      humans, thalassemia is the commonest single-gene disorder. It is defined as a group of&#xD;
      inherited disorders characterized by decreased or absent beta globin chain synthesis, leading&#xD;
      to a reduced level of hemoglobulin (Hb) in the red blood cells . Specifically in developing&#xD;
      countries, thalassemia is a huge health dilemma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Beta Thalassemia is the most common chronic hemolytic anemia in Egypt (85.1%) with an&#xD;
      estimated carrier rate of 9-10.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood transfusion is the primary way of treating thalassemia; it allows the normal growth of&#xD;
      the child as well as restrains abnormal erythropoiesis . Iron-chelating agents should be used&#xD;
      properly;otherwise, multiple blood transfusions can lead to iron overload. Yet, with no blood&#xD;
      transfusion, the increase rate of erythropoiesis intensifies dietary iron absorption from the&#xD;
      gut, leading to a severe form of iron overload .&#xD;
&#xD;
      iron overload can result in serious damage to various organs, for example, by depositing in&#xD;
      the liver, heart, and various other endocrine glands along with endocrine organ failure. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last years, liver disease has emerged as a major cause of mortality in patients&#xD;
      with B- thalassemia major (TM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver is the only site for ferritin and transferrin synthesis, as well as the primary&#xD;
      organ for iron storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver has the maximum capacity to store excess iron in the body, and various other&#xD;
      organs, as well as the liver, are very susceptible to damage as a result of iron toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between serum ferritin and hepatic iron concentration has been reported in&#xD;
      multiple blood-transfused thalassemia patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalassemia major patients who undergo routine transfusion have an increased risk of&#xD;
      acquiring transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI), including hepatitis B and C. These&#xD;
      diseases have serious implications and may affect the serum ferritin and aminotransferase&#xD;
      levels of thalassemia major patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the risk of post-transfusion hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection dropped significantly&#xD;
      after the national screening of blood in 1993, more than 20% of children who were&#xD;
      multitransfused after that date were HCV-RNA positive .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Egypt, prevalence rate of HCV antibodies seropositivity in thalassemic children at 2011was&#xD;
      51.7% while in the study of El-Faramawy (2012) , a prevalence of 48 % was reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload and hepatitis-C virus (HCV) infection, have been implicated in the evolution of&#xD;
      liver disease, in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia major (BTM). The&#xD;
      impact of these factors and liver with BTM, has not been extensively studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis virus C infection is the main risk factor for liver injury in transfusion-dependent&#xD;
      thalassemics . Dimitrios (2013) on the other hand suggested that in the late stages of liver&#xD;
      disease in BTM patients, iron overload may be the critical determinant, since fibrosis is&#xD;
      related to the minimal haemosiderosis, independently of HCV history. Injury to the liver,&#xD;
      whether acute or chronic, eventually results in an increase in serum concentrations of&#xD;
      Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate transaminase (AST)&#xD;
