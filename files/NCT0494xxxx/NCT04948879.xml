  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local invasion or abutment of a major vascular structure was once a major deterrent to&#xD;
      planned oncological resection. Improvements in radiological assessment and vascular surgical&#xD;
      techniques have enabled resection of major blood vessels where focally involved. However,&#xD;
      most of this has been conducted in the context of cancers of sarcomatous,&#xD;
      hepaticopancreaticobilary or otolaryngological origin, with little evidence detailing the&#xD;
      experience in the context of pelvic malignancy. The aim of this retrospective review is to&#xD;
      examine the indications for, techniques used and surgical outcomes of vascular reconstruction&#xD;
      in the setting of pelvic exenterative surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of pelvic exenteration in the management of locally advanced and recurrent pelvic&#xD;
      malignancies is ever evolving, with technical advancements enabling surgeons to perform more&#xD;
      radical resections, offering a potential cure to many patients who would have once been&#xD;
      deemed inoperable. As surgical oncology has shifted towards higher-volume, specialist centres&#xD;
      in a bid to improve outcomes, surgeons have used greater experience to re-evaluate what can&#xD;
      be considered as resectable disease. This is best exemplified by a trend towards en bloc&#xD;
      vascular excision and reconstruction where tumours abut or focally invade adjacent&#xD;
      vasculature. Whereas involvement of a major vascular structure remains a relative&#xD;
      contraindication to surgery in some units (1), certain specialist centres around the world&#xD;
      are increasingly reporting on the feasibility of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is accepted that achieving an R0 resection is the most significant prognostic factor for&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in exenterative surgery. Conversely, involvement of the lateral&#xD;
      compartment is a poor prognostic variable, in large part due to the difficulty obtaining a&#xD;
      negative resection margin without compromising neurovascular structures(2). Improvements in&#xD;
      pre-operative radiological assessment, particularly with respect to angiography, have&#xD;
      facilitated appropriate patient and treatment selection, while advancements in the field of&#xD;
      vascular surgery have made the procedure technically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no clear consensus on the role of vascular reconstruction in curative&#xD;
      treatment of advanced pelvic malignancy, owing to a paucity of published data. Initial&#xD;
      reports and series have shown promising results, but these are almost exclusively&#xD;
      single-surgeon experiences with small numbers and heterogenous populations. Therefore, there&#xD;
      is a need for collaborative data to assess the impact and success of such surgical&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective review is to examine the indications for, techniques used and&#xD;
      surgical outcomes of vascular reconstruction in the setting of pelvic exenterative surgery at&#xD;
      a multicentre level in order to inform future practice, with a particular focus on whether or&#xD;
      not it significantly increases the morbidity in the short-term.&#xD;
