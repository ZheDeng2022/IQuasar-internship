      This study is planned as a prospective multicenter NIS. This study is observational in nature&#xD;
      and does not impose a therapy protocol, diagnostic/therapeutic interventions or a visit&#xD;
      schedule. Patients with HR+/ HER2- advanced or metastatic BC that initiated treatment with&#xD;
      ribociclib, alpelisib, mono endocrine therapy or chemotherapy will be included into the study&#xD;
      across seven Russian districts.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will attend the sites in accordance with routine clinical practice. It is assumed&#xD;
      that visits will be conducted every 3-4 months. Patients will undergo standard procedures and&#xD;
      tests according to clinical guidelines and physician's judgement. Available data from routine&#xD;
      clinical management of the patients will be collected at patients' visits to the clinical&#xD;
      site. Patients enrolled in the study will be followed up until death or study close whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. The recruitment period is planned for 24 months, observation period for maximum&#xD;
      of 24 months, with total duration of study 4 years. Patients may discontinue from this NIS at&#xD;
      any time.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>

    <description>The changes from baseline to each visit where measured using QLQ-C30. EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Subject's responses to 28 questions about their physical functioning, disease symptoms, global health status and utilities are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much), a low score indicates a high / healthy level of functioning. And the responses to 2 questions about health-related QoL are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very poor to 7=Excellent), a high score indicates a high / healthy level of functioning.&#xD;
Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>
