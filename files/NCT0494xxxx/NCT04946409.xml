      Observational study comprising prospective follow up as well as retrospective chart review in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the longitudinal course of the disease in XLH patients with a specific&#xD;
      focus on functional impairment, physical performance and complications associated with the&#xD;
      disease or respective treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational / non-interventional study in order to assess the longitudinal&#xD;
      course of XLH including disease related burden of disease and functional impairment. This is&#xD;
      accomplished by both prospective follow up of affected patients as well as retrospective&#xD;
      chart review. Evaluation conducted as per clincal routine and specifically evaluated as part&#xD;
      of this study will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline documententation / demographic (as obtained from medical records)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general data on XLH-disease specific medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examination results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  technical assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life / questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laboratory evaluations&#xD;
