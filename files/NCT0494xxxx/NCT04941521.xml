  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about whether exenatide (Bydureon) may be&#xD;
      safe and helpful as a medication treatment for individuals who want to stop using cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although exenatide (Bydureon) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 diabetes, it has not been approved by the FDA to treat cocaine use;&#xD;
      therefore, it is called an investigational drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine use continues to be a significant public health problem with limited treatment&#xD;
      options and no approved pharmacotherapies. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptors are&#xD;
      located in brain areas important for reward and, as such, appear to play a significant role&#xD;
      in modulating addictive-like behaviors and drug use (Eren-Yazicioglu et al. 2020).&#xD;
      Extended-release exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved by the FDA for the treatment&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes. In preclinical studies, exenatide reduces cocaine-seeking and&#xD;
      cocaine-taking behavior (Brunchmann et al. 2019). The effect of extended-release exenatide on&#xD;
      cocaine use in patients with a cocaine use disorder (CUD) has not yet been investigated. A&#xD;
      series of four case studies are being proposed to collect preliminary data on the&#xD;
      feasibility, safety, and clinical effects of exenatide in treatment-seeking patients with&#xD;
      CUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. is facing a re-emergence of cocaine as an epidemic drug, indicated by increases in&#xD;
      availability, use, and overdose deaths following a previous period of decline (Maxwell 2020).&#xD;
      Although significant strides have been made in medication development for the treatment of&#xD;
      cocaine use disorder (CUD), no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies are currently available. NIDA's&#xD;
      current strategic plan prioritizes efforts to accelerate CUD medication development by&#xD;
      rigorously testing novel molecular targets based on a translational research approach.&#xD;
      Emerging evidence supports the potential clinical utility of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)&#xD;
      receptor stimulation for the treatment of substance use disorders, including CUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.&#xD;
      Current evidence shows that GLP-1 receptors are widely expressed in areas of the mesolimbic&#xD;
      dopaminergic pathway where they regulate the rewarding value of food and drugs of abuse,&#xD;
      including cocaine. Preclinical literature suggests that activation of GLP-1 receptors reduces&#xD;
      the rewarding effects of cocaine and cocaine self-administration (e.g., Hernandez et al.&#xD;
      2018; Hernandez et al. 2019). In the human laboratory, acute cocaine administration decreases&#xD;
      GLP-1 concentrations, with changes associated with subjective reinforcing responses to&#xD;
      cocaine (&quot;feeling high, anxious&quot;) (Bouhlal et al. 2017). Thus, there is compelling evidence&#xD;
      to hypothesize that exenatide treatment will decrease cocaine use in individuals with CUD. In&#xD;
      preparation for conducting a full-scale efficacy trial, the goal of the current proposal is&#xD;
      to collect preliminary feasibility, safety, and clinical data on the effects of exenatide in&#xD;
      series of four case studies.&#xD;
