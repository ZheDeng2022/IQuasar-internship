    <description>Patients will be given a smart water bottle and coached on its use. The device is a 24 oz non-bisphenol A acrylic water bottle with the ability to track water consumption from the bottle, alert its users via a smartphone-based notification system, as well as visually remind patients with a light-emitting diode in the device. Participants will be alerted to drink patient-specific volumes of room temperature water 45 minutes prior to daily standard of care radiotherapy.</description>
