  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/glutamate receptor complex&#xD;
      antagonist that decreases pain by diminishing central sensitization, hyperalgesia, and&#xD;
      &quot;wind-up&quot; phenomenon at the level of the spinal cord (dorsal ganglion) and central nervous&#xD;
      system (1). Ketamine administration in sub-dissociative doses (SDK) of 0.1-0.3 mg/kg in&#xD;
      pre-hospital settings and in the ED results in effective pain relief in patients with acute&#xD;
      traumatic and non-traumatic pain, chronic non-cancer and cancer pain, and in patients with&#xD;
      opioid-tolerant pain by virtue of providing anti-hyperalgesia, anti-allodynia, and&#xD;
      anti-tolerance (2-4). Two commonly utilized routes of SDK administration in the ED include an&#xD;
      intravenous route (intravenous push dose or short infusion) and intranasal route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the situation when intravenous access is not readily available or unobtainable, and&#xD;
      intranasal route is not feasible, another non-invasive route of ketamine administration such&#xD;
      as inhalation via Breath-Actuated Nebulizer (BAN) is coming into the play. The BAN allows a&#xD;
      controlled patient-initiated delivery of analgesics in titratable fashion. Nebulized&#xD;
      administration of ketamine has been studied in the areas of acute postoperative pain&#xD;
      management (post-intubational sore throat), in anesthesia (pre-medication for general&#xD;
      anesthesia,) and in managing cancer pain, and status asthmaticus therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, our research team has published a case series of 5 patients receiving nebulized&#xD;
      ketamine for a variety of acute painful conditions and has recently completed a randomized&#xD;
      double-blind trial of 120 adult patients that evaluated analgesic efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      nebulized ketamine at three different dosing regimens for acute pain in the ED. Currently, we&#xD;
      are conducting two additional studies evaluating the role of nebulized ketamine in pediatric&#xD;
      ED and pre-hospital arena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators hypothesize that intravenous sub-dissociative-dose ketamine&#xD;
      of 0.3 mg/kg will provide better analgesia at 30 min post-medication administration in&#xD;
      comparison to nebulized ketamine administered at 0.75 mg/kg. The primary outcome of this&#xD;
      trial is the comparative reduction in participant's pain scores at 30 minutes post medication&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double dummy trial comparing&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous SDK administered at 0.3 mg/kg over 15 minutes to&#xD;
      nebulized ketamine at 0.75mg/kg administered via BAN to patients presenting to the ED of&#xD;
      Maimonides Medical Center with acute and chronic painful conditions. Upon meeting the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized into two study groups: IV SDK and Nebulized&#xD;
      K-BAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients 18 years of age and older presenting to the ED with acute and chronic&#xD;
      painful conditions such as traumatic and non-traumatic abdominal, flank, back,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, headache, as well as exacerbation of chronic abdominal, musculoskeletal&#xD;
      and neuropathic pain with a score of 5 or more on a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric&#xD;
      rating scale and requiring parenteral analgesia as determined by the treating attending&#xD;
      physician. Patients' screening and enrollment will be performed by study investigators and&#xD;
      research assistants. All patients will be enrolled at various times of the day when study&#xD;
      investigators will be available for patient enrollment and an ED pharmacist will be available&#xD;
      for medication preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures: Each patient will be approached by a study investigator for&#xD;
      acquisition of written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability&#xD;
      Act authorization after being evaluated by the treating emergency physician and determined to&#xD;
      meet study eligibility criteria. When English will not be the participant's primary language,&#xD;
      a language- appropriate consent form will be used and non-investigator, hospital-employed,&#xD;
      trained interpreters or licensed telephone interpreter will assist in acquisition of informed&#xD;
      consent. Baseline pain score will be determined with an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 to&#xD;
      10), described to the patient as &quot;no pain&quot; being 0 and &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; being 10.&#xD;
      A study investigator will record the patient's body weight and baseline vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The on-duty ED pharmacist will prepare either a breath-actuated nebulizer with a dose of 0.75&#xD;
      mg/kg or an infusion dose of IV SDK at 0.3 mg/kg in 100 ml normal saline bag according to the&#xD;
      predetermined randomization list, which will be created in SPSS (version 24; IBM Corp,&#xD;
      Armonk, NY) with block randomization of every 10 participants. All participants will receive&#xD;
      a corresponding placebo in order to maintain double-dummy design: the subjects randomized to&#xD;
      receive IV SDK will also receive nebulized saline via BAN, and the subjects receiving K-BAN&#xD;
      will also receive an IV infusion of Normal Saline over 15 minutes. The medication will be&#xD;
      delivered to the treating nurse in a blinded fashion who will set up an infusion pump with a&#xD;
      run time of 15 minutes. The nebulization of active drug and placebo via BAN will have a&#xD;
      minimum time of 5 min and maximum time of 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 15, 30, 60,&#xD;
      90, and 120 minutes. If patients reported a pain numeric rating scale score of 5 or greater&#xD;
      and requested additional pain relief, intravenous morphine at 0.1 mg/kg will be administered&#xD;
      as a rescue analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparing ED pharmacist, research manager, and statistician will be the only ones with&#xD;
      knowledge of the study arm to which each participant would be randomized. Treating providers,&#xD;
      participants, and the data collecting research team will be blind to the medication route&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded on data collection sheets, including patients' sex, demographics,&#xD;
      medical history, and vital signs, and entered into SPSS (version 24.0; IBM Corp) by the&#xD;
      research manager. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent&#xD;
      acquisition for all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research&#xD;
      administrator and/or statistician who will work independently of any data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be closely monitored for any change in vital sings and for adverse effects&#xD;
      during the entire study period (up to 120 minutes) by study investigators. Common adverse&#xD;
      effects that are associated with sub-dissociative dose ketamine are felling of unreality,&#xD;
      dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and sedation.&#xD;
