      Hypothesis 1A: Oral Administration or Nasal Feeding of Huzhangxiefei Decoction will&#xD;
      significantly attenuate sepsis-induced systemic organ failure as measured by Sequential Organ&#xD;
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Hypothesis 1B: Oral Administration or Nasal Feeding of&#xD;
      Huzhangxiefei Decoction will attenuate sepsis-induced lung injury as assessed by the&#xD;
      oxygenation index and the VE40 Hypothesis 1C: Oral Administration or Nasal Feeding of&#xD;
      Huzhangxiefei Decoction will attenuate biomarkers of inflammation (C-Reactive Protein,&#xD;
      Procalcitonin), vascular injury (Thrombomodulin, Angiopoietin-2), alveolar epithelial injury&#xD;
      (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Products), while inducing the onset of a fibrinolytic state&#xD;
