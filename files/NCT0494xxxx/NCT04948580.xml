  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence has severe and long-lasting negative consequences for children's and adolescents'&#xD;
      well-being and psychosocial functioning, thereby also hampering communities' and societies'&#xD;
      economic growth. Studies show high prevalence of violence by teachers against children in&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa, both in countries where violence is lawful as disciplinary measure at&#xD;
      school and in countries where it has been officially banned. In addition to legal and&#xD;
      structural factors (e. g. stressful working conditions for teachers), attitudes favoring&#xD;
      violence against children as an effective and acceptable discipline method and the lack of&#xD;
      access to alternative non-violent strategies are likely to contribute to teachers' ongoing&#xD;
      use of violence against children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding, there are currently very few school-level interventions to reduce violence&#xD;
      by teachers that a) have been scientifically evaluated and b) that focus both on changing&#xD;
      attitudes towards violence and on equipping teachers with non-violent discipline strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the present study tests the effectiveness of the preventative intervention Interaction&#xD;
      Competencies with Children - for Teachers (ICC-T) in primary and secondary schools in&#xD;
      Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana. Previous studies have provided initial evidence on the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of ICC-T to reduce teacher violence in primary and secondary&#xD;
      schools in Tanzania and secondary schools in Uganda. This study aims to provide further&#xD;
      evidence for the effectiveness of ICC-T to reduce violence and to improve children's&#xD;
      functioning (i.e. mental health, well-being, academic performance) across educational&#xD;
      settings, societies and cultures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-site cluster randomized controlled trial with schools (clusters) as&#xD;
      level of randomization. Multi-stage random sampling will be applied to select three zones per&#xD;
      country (Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana) and one district in each zone. In each district, eight&#xD;
      public schools will be randomly selected, resulting in a total number of 72 schools (24 per&#xD;
      country). Schools will be stratified based on school type (primary or secondary school) and&#xD;
      location (rural or urban), leading to 36 sites or cluster pairs (3 countries x 3 zones x 2&#xD;
      school types x 2 locations). In each site, one school will be randomly allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention group (that will receive the ICC-T intervention) and one school to the control&#xD;
      group (that will receive no intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each school, 40 students (stratified by gender) in the third year of primary school or in&#xD;
      the first year of secondary/junior high school and all teachers (expected average number: 20)&#xD;
      will be recruited. Thus the final sample will comprise 2880 students and at least 1440&#xD;
      teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three data assessment points: baseline assessment prior to the&#xD;
      intervention, the first follow-up assessment six months after the intervention and the second&#xD;
      follow-up assessment 18 months after the intervention. In addition, feasibility data will be&#xD;
      assessed in the intervention group at the beginning and the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are student- and teacher-reported physical and emotional violence by&#xD;
      teachers in the past week. Secondary outcome measures include teachers' attitudes towards&#xD;
      violence against students, children's emotional and behavioral problems, quality of life, and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning.&#xD;
