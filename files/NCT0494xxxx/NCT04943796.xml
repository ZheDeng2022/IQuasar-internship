  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to find out how many adults with certain psychiatric conditions&#xD;
      who didn't respond to their current treatment are underdiagnosed as having ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study medicines will be provided to participants in this study. The study sponsor will not&#xD;
      be involved in how participants are treated but will provide instructions on how the clinics&#xD;
      will record what happens during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At their first clinic visit, the diagnosis of ADHD will be confirmed or not confirmed by the&#xD;
      study doctor. Participants without confirmed ADHD will leave the study after the first visit.&#xD;
      Participants with confirmed ADHD will visit their clinic 2 more times during this study&#xD;
      (three visits in total). During these visits, they will complete a questionnaire and have an&#xD;
      interview with the study doctor about their condition.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Diagnosis of ADHD Based on Adult ADHD Self-Reporting Scale (ASRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>ASRS is designed to evaluate for severity of symptoms as specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). ASRS is composed of 18 questions, and uses a scale that ranges from 0-4 based on the individuals mark in either the &quot;never, rarely, sometimes, often, very often&quot; column for a possible total score of 72. The minimum score to qualify for study inclusion is 8 (i.e. 4 or more &quot;symptom-positive&quot; answers), and the maximum possible score is 72. The higher the score, the more indicative of higher severity of ADHD symptoms. Each column is used to describe the severity of the individuals symptoms based on the questions asked. Each participant is asked to make a mark within one column for each question that best describes their answer. Percentage of participants with confirmed diagnosis of ADHD in participants with psychiatric disorder and inadequate response to current treatment based on adult ASRS will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Diagnosis of ADHD Based on Diagnostic Interview for Adult ADHD (DIVA 5.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DIVA 5.0 is a structured diagnostic interview for Adult ADHD, and is based on the criteria for ADHD in DSM-5. Whenever possible the DIVA should be completed with adults in the presence of a partner and/or family member, to enable retrospective and collateral information to be ascertained at the same time. The DIVA usually takes around one and a half hours to complete. The DIVA only asks about the core symptoms of ADHD required to make the DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD, and does not ask about other co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, syndromes or disorders. In this study, participant will be interviewed using DIVA only if scores in ASRS showed positive diagnosis of ADHD. Percentage of participants with confirmed diagnosis of ADHD in participants with psychiatric disorder and inadequate response to current treatment based on DIVA 5.0 will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Diagnosis of ADHD per Psychiatric Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Psychiatric disorder will include major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders (AD), bipolar disorders (BD) and Substance use disorders (SUD).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of follow-up (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>FAST is a brief instrument designed to assess the main functioning problems experienced by psychiatric participants, particularly bipolar participants. It comprises 24 items that assess impairment or disability in six specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time. The scale used to evaluate functionality is the FAST Scale, the minimum value being 0 and maximum value of 72, domain scores are scaled in a negative direction (i.e. lower scores denote higher functionality).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Resource Utilization (HRU)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 6 months prior inclusion to baseline up to end of follow-up (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>HRU before the diagnosis of ADHD in participants with ADHD diagnosis confirmed at baseline will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 7 days prior to Baseline up to end of follow-up (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>WPAI is a 6-item questionnaire scale used to measure lost work productivity and impairment in daily activities over the past seven days. It will be analyzed using the responses to the WPAI-GH questionnaire in participants actively working in the last 7 days. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism 2. Presenteesism 3. Work productivity loss 4. Activity Impairment, ranging from 0-100. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. The questionnaire will be implemented only one time per person in the study duration.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment Management Before and After the ADHD Diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>From 6 months prior to baseline up to end of follow-up (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with treatment management of participants with ADHD diagnosis confirmed at baseline visit before and after the ADHD diagnosis will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Categorized by Sociodemographic Variables</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sociodemographic data will be collected after randomization. Sociodemographic variables will include age (age of the participant at the time of the visit will be recorded), gender (man/woman), ethnicity (Caucasian/Hispanic/African/Asian/Other/Unknown), education (ongoing or completed level of education will be recorded), employment status (employed, self-employed, employed but on sick leave due to the study disease, permanent incapacity to work due to the study disease, permanent incapacity to work due to other reasons, student, unemployed, retired, domestic work, other), marital status (Married/with partner, divorced/separated, unmarried, widow/er).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impressions Scale- Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of follow-up (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention: Compared to the participant's condition at admission to the project [prior to medication initiation], this participant's condition ranges from 1 to 7 were: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of follow-up (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>BRIEF-A is a patient-reported scale to measure various aspects of adult executive functioning and self-regulation in the person's everyday environment. 75 items that participant's rate on a 3-point Likert scale (1 = behavior is never observed to 3 = behavior is often observed). Higher scores indicate greater impairment in executive functioning. Nine non-overlapping subscales. Four of them (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Self-Monitor) combine to yield the BRI. The remaining five (Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, Organization of Materials) combine to yield the MI. The two indices combine to yield the total score, called the GEC score.</description>
