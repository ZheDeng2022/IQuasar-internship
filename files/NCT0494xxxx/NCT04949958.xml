    <textblock>
      The prediabetes is a state in which fasting blood glucose level ranges between 100-126mg/dl&#xD;
      or HbA1C ranges between 5.7-6.4mmol. People with prediabetes have 74 percent chance of&#xD;
      progression to develop Type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, by lifestyle intervention, Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus may be effectively avoided or delayed. The improvement in lifestyle is&#xD;
      involving the physical activity of at least 150mins per week lowered the rate of T2DM in&#xD;
      people with prediabetes by 58 percent. There are several risk factors for the development of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, but obesity and lack of physical activity are major risk factors&#xD;
      that cause type 2 diabetes mellitus in prediabetic populations. Diet and exercise are the&#xD;
      first line treatment for sedentary prediabetics. Both independent and combined effect of diet&#xD;
      and exercise can reduce the incidence of T2DM, glycemic control and weight loss in adults&#xD;
      with prediabetics&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most alarming public health issues of the 21st century is epidemic of diabetes especially&#xD;
      in lower middle-income countries. There will be a 67 percent raise in prevalence of diabetes&#xD;
      from 2010 to 2030 .With up to half of deaths occurring in people under the age of 60 is due&#xD;
      to diabetes as T2DM is among the top ten causes of death.According to American Diabetic&#xD;
      Association, if Fasting blood glucose level falls between &lt;100mg/dl or HbA1C falls between&#xD;
      &lt;5.7% then person has normal blood sugar level if Fasting blood glucose level falls between&#xD;
      100-125mg/dl or HbA1C falls between 5.7%-6.4% then person is diagnosed as prediabetic and if&#xD;
      value of fasting blood glucose level falls between 126-200mg/dl and HbA1C more than 6.5% then&#xD;
      person is diagnose as Type 2 Diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediabetes is a state in which the body can maintain blood glucose level but impaired&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity is still present.Worldwide there is a 74 percent chance of progression of&#xD;
      prediabetes into Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Strategies for prevention of T2DM are highly&#xD;
      recommended for sedentary population.There are now estimated 38 million adults living with&#xD;
      diabetes around the world. The main cause of premature death in the world with ration of&#xD;
      every 6 into 10 due to the effects of diabetes and diabetes-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pakistan is now in the top 10 countries with increase in the incidence of diabetes. According&#xD;
      to WHO, around 19 million people are diagnosed with diabetes and 10 million people are&#xD;
      diagnosed as prediabetics. An estimated 463 million adults worldwide live with diabetes and&#xD;
      55 million live with prediabetes. However there are some risk factors for T2DM that can be&#xD;
      modifiable including obesity, metabolic syndrome characteristics (abdominal obesity, elevated&#xD;
      triglycerides, low density lipoprotein), high blood pressure and elevated plasma glucose,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, sedentary lifestyle Exercise intervention requires repetitive body&#xD;
      movements performed to enhance or sustain one or more physical fitness components such as&#xD;
      aerobic ability, muscle strength and endurance, flexibility. Sedentary lifestyle is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of death, cardiovascular disease and increase the incidence&#xD;
      of T2DM which is mostly recognized in young adult population.Physical exercise facilitates&#xD;
      improved functioning of the human body. Regular exercise enhances insulin sensitivity thus&#xD;
      helping to avoid diabetes.Exercise training is known to increase the absorption of&#xD;
      insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose and blood flow to limbs thus leading to reduction in&#xD;
      glycemic control in diabetic population.&#xD;
