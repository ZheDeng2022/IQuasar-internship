  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is investigating if acupuncture may improve pulmonary function, exercise&#xD;
      tolerance, stress and modulate the inflammatory effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD). The investigator would like to measure the effect of the combination of&#xD;
      acupuncture with standard pulmonary rehab in patients with COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation in this study may last 3 months. The experimental intervention is&#xD;
      electro-acupuncture. Electro-acupuncture is similar to Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve&#xD;
      Stimulation (TENS) where a very small current of electricity is applied, in this case to&#xD;
      specific acupuncture points. The intervention will be applied by a trained&#xD;
      physician-acupuncturist. The treatment itself would be applied for 20 minutes prior to&#xD;
      regularly scheduled pulmonary rehab session. All participants will receive&#xD;
      electro-acupuncture for the duration of the study. Because the investigators are interested&#xD;
      in the effect of dose, participants will be randomized to 4, 8 or 12 weeks of &quot;active&#xD;
      pulmonary&quot; acupuncture versus &quot;control&quot; acupuncture. One third of the participants will be&#xD;
      asked to undergo the intervention for 4 weeks, one third will be asked to undergo the&#xD;
      intervention for 8 weeks and one third will be asked to undergo the intervention for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Intervention acupuncture needles will be placed on what are thought to be active&#xD;
      points for helping lung function, control acupuncture needles will be placed in neutral&#xD;
      locations. Participants will not be told which weeks they are receiving the active&#xD;
      acupuncture versus the control. Information relating to pulmonary and physical function,&#xD;
      standard blood markers of inflammation, and survey responses at the beginning, during and&#xD;
      after the intervention will be collected. During the experimental period participants will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out surveys on quality of life, pulmonary function and physical function.&#xD;
