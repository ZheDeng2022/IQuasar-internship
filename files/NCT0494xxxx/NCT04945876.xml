      A randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of six months digital follow-up, after&#xD;
      a stay at a rehabilitation center, on functional and nutritional status in people with&#xD;
      Parkinson Disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is found that regular, structured exercise is especially important for people with&#xD;
      Pakinson disease (PD) and it is a key element in the treatment of PD at rehabilitation&#xD;
      centers in Norway. A substantial amount of research indicate that exercise can lead to&#xD;
      improvements in physical functioning, strength, balance, gait, and HRQOL among people with&#xD;
      PD. However, after a supervised exercise period, these measures tend to return toward&#xD;
      baseline values. This regression may to some extent reflect the progressive nature of PD, but&#xD;
      previous research suggests that maintaining the motivation to stay physically active is&#xD;
      difficult once formalized interventions end. Furthermore, research indicate that nutritional&#xD;
      status is an important predictor for health status among people with PD and that PD patients&#xD;
      have high rates of unintentional weight loss compared to age-matched controls. In other&#xD;
      words, research indicate that follow-up at home after rehabilitation is necessary to increase&#xD;
      optimal nutrition and continuing to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial meant to evaluate the effect of six months digital&#xD;
      follow-up, after a 3-5 week stay at a inpatient rehabilitation center, on functional and&#xD;
      nutritional status in people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be recruited from Unicare Fram Rehabilitation center by a physical&#xD;
      therapist and research assistant in collaboration with Unicare Fram employees and a Ph.D&#xD;
      student. Informed consent from the participants is obtained from persons with no previous&#xD;
      relationship to the patients, and who are not included in their daily treatment, mainly the&#xD;
      research assistant. After baseline testing the participants will be randomly allocated to an&#xD;
      intervention- or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in this study is designed to increase the level of adherence after&#xD;
      rehabilitation by implementing factors that previous studies have proven successful such as&#xD;
      education, goal setting, follow-up from health care personnel and use of mHealth Technology.&#xD;
      The intervention consist of 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: All participants will receive the rehabilitation program currently provided at&#xD;
      Unicare Fram rehabilitation center. This is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program with focus on self-management of the disease including exercise and&#xD;
      nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: The control group will receive no further follow-up. The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive digital follow up once a month focusing on goals and motivation, and an activity&#xD;
      tracker and instructions on how to use it both for motivation, daily activity tracking,&#xD;
      logging of specific exercise and intensity control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be retested after 12 weeks and 6 months at Unicare Fram rehabilitation&#xD;
      center by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be reported for variables of interest. The data will be analyzed&#xD;
      following the intention to treat principle. Prospective differences in primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes and baseline characteristics between the intervention group and the control group&#xD;
      will be assessed by t-tests for continuous and normal distributed variables and with&#xD;
      non-parametric tests for categorical variables. Multiple linear and logistic regression&#xD;
      modelling will be used to control for confounding of between-group differences. The latest&#xD;
      version of Statistical Package of the Social Sciences (SPSS) will be used.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The complex intervention makes masking of participants and care provider impossible. An independent therapist will conduct baseline testing before randomization. The same therapist will conduct the re-testing at 12 weeks and six month, the assessor will be blinded to group allocation and not be part off providing the intervention. The person conducting the data-analyzes will be blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
A computer-generated, permuted block randomization scheme will be used to allocate patients.</masking_description>
