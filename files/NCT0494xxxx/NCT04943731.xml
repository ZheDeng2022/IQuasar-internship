  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose and Aim: This research is about patients who have had a total laryngectomy, trialing&#xD;
      a new range of Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HMEs) - referred to as the &quot;Provox Life™ range&#xD;
      of HMEs&quot;. The main purpose of this study is to find out if participants experience any&#xD;
      differences in the amount of coughing and mucus problems when using the new range of Provox&#xD;
      Life™ HMEs (and attachment devices) following an optimal Day/Night regimen. The study is&#xD;
      sponsored by Atos Medical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Participants will use the new Provox Life™ HME range and their attachments&#xD;
      during two (2) observation phases (Phase 1, Phase 2). In Phase 1 (6 week study phase),&#xD;
      participants will use the new Provox Life™ HMEs in a similar way as they currently use their&#xD;
      existing HME devices. In the Phase 2 (6 week study phase), they will use the Provox Life™ HME&#xD;
      devices following an optimal Day/Night regimen - with the aim to achieve the best possible&#xD;
      humidification at all times. Prior to each study phase, participants will meet with their&#xD;
      speech pathologist to learn about the new devices and how to use them. Once comfortable using&#xD;
      them they will commence each observation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Experiences using their existing HMEs (prior to study) and then using the&#xD;
      new HMEs in Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be collected via a series of questionnaires. These will&#xD;
      be completed 5 times in total - at baseline before Phase 1 starts, and then at both week 2&#xD;
      and week 6 of Phase 1 and 2. Questionnaires relate to their use of the HMEs, coughing and&#xD;
      mucus problems, skin integrity, overall experiences of using the new devices and any impacts&#xD;
      on sleep and quality of life. Participants will complete some of the questionnaires at home&#xD;
      (approx. 30mins) and the others during an interview session with one of the study team&#xD;
      (approx. 30mins). The interview session can be conducted via telephone, videoconferencing or&#xD;
      in person - depending on the patients preferences and any COVID restrictions.&#xD;
