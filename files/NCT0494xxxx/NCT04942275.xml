  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study evaluating the feasibility of treatment planning integrating lung&#xD;
      perfusion PET/CT using Ga68-MAA to preserve functional lung areas during stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung perfusion PET / CT is a new imaging modality based on the use of the same cold molecules&#xD;
      as those used for a conventional perfusion lung scan. Similartly, perfusion images are&#xD;
      obtained after intravenous administration of human albumin macroaggregates, which are&#xD;
      embolized in pulmonary capillaries according to pulmonary blood flow. However, these cold&#xD;
      molecules are radiolabeled, not with Technetium99m, but with Gallium68, a ÃŸ + isotope,&#xD;
      allowing image acquisition with PET technology. The same physiological processes are&#xD;
      therefore observed with conventional scintigraphy PET imaging, but PET is an intrinsically&#xD;
      superior technique for image acquisition, with greater sensitivity, better spatial and&#xD;
      temporal resolutions and the possibility to perform respiratory-gated acquisition, allowing a&#xD;
      better definition of the pulmonary functional volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to evaluate the feasability of functional lung avoidance planification using lung&#xD;
      perfusion PET/CT imaging during SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will benefit from a pre-treatment functional assessment including PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment planning will be carried out in 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First, an anatomical planning will be carried out, blinded to the PET results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, a functional planning, respecting the standard constraints applied during&#xD;
           anatomical planning, but also incorporating a new &quot;functional lung volume&quot; constraint&#xD;
           defined by PET/CT images, will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up will be carried out for 12 months, including repeated perfusion PET/CT imaging at&#xD;
      3 and 12 months.&#xD;
