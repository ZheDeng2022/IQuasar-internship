    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSA) is one of the most common chronic diseases and is&#xD;
      associated with prognostic cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities. OSAS is the&#xD;
      recurrence of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) collapse of the upper airway during&#xD;
      sleep resulting in sleep fragmentation and chronic intermittent hypoxia (ICH) which are the&#xD;
      major determinants of cardiovascular and metabolic complications including type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver. These comorbidities are associated with a change in&#xD;
      intestinal microbial ecology. In most cases, there is a reduction in bacterial genetic&#xD;
      diversity and more or less specific signatures of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases,&#xD;
      making it possible to envisage personalized and innovative therapeutic treatments. In animals&#xD;
      exposed to intermittent hypoxia, there is local hypoxia that increases intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, produces a reduction in microbiota diversity and favors microbial species that&#xD;
      are at the origin of pro-inflammatory factors. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is&#xD;
      the standard treatment for OSA. Its effect on the intestinal microbiota has not yet been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is one of the most common chronic diseases associated&#xD;
      with cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities (high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) that make it a prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These comorbidities are associated with a change in intestinal microbial ecology. In most&#xD;
      cases, there is a reduction in bacterial genetic diversity and more or less specific&#xD;
      signatures of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases which make it possible to envisage&#xD;
      personalized and innovative therapeutic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animals exposed to intermittent hypoxia, there is a local hypoxia that increases&#xD;
      intestinal permeability, produces a reduction in microbial diversity, and favors microbial&#xD;
      species that cause the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard for OSAS treatment. Its&#xD;
      effect on the gut microbiota has never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be totally original in the field. The impact of this study can be major in&#xD;
      allowing to propose pre/probiotics or drug treatments modulating intestinal dysbiosis during&#xD;
      OSAS, combined or not with CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of the study is to compare gut microbiota changes (diversity and&#xD;
      composition : relative abundance of different phyla, genera, families, alpha and beta&#xD;
      diversity...) after 3 months of effective CPAP versus 3 months of placebo (nasal dilators),&#xD;
      in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSAS patients (with AHI &gt; 30 / hour) will be screened in EFCR Service, Pneumology Department&#xD;
      or Sleep Laboratory and proposed the study. If eligible they will be then followed over 3&#xD;
      months with 2 visits (inclusion visit at J0 and follow-up visit at 3 months). After the&#xD;
      inclusion visit (J0) OSAS patients will be randomized for their treatment into &quot;CPAP group&quot;&#xD;
      (effective CPAP treatment) or &quot;nasal dilators group&quot; (placebo treatment) for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same assessments will be carried out at J0 and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers (with no OSAS) will be the control group. They will be recruited by ad.&#xD;
      They will carry out the assessments of inclusion visit (J0) only and compared then to the&#xD;
      group of OSAS patients.&#xD;
