      Physical training can improve metabolic health in patients with insulin resistance and/or&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2D). The cellular and molecular changes underlying the improvements in&#xD;
      metabolic health are multi-factorial and only partly understood, but most likely involve&#xD;
      adaptation at a multi-organ level that includes improvements in skeletal muscle glucose&#xD;
      uptake and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to study the transcriptional differences in skeletal muscle and&#xD;
      adipose tissue at baseline and after a 3-month physical training program in obese patients&#xD;
      with and without T2D and to use this information to identify novel therapeutic targets for&#xD;
      improvement of glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators aim to find answers to the question: What is the mechanism behind the&#xD;
      effect of physical activity on insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes?&#xD;

      Background and aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical training can improve metabolic health in patients with insulin resistance and/or&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2D). The cellular and molecular changes underlying the improvements in&#xD;
      metabolic health are multi-factorial and only partly understood, but most likely involve&#xD;
      adaptation at a multi-organ level that includes improvements in skeletal muscle glucose&#xD;
      uptake and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature on the effects of an acute bout of exercise on glucose uptake in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle is large, but so far, there is a lack of studies investigating the specific molecular&#xD;
      basis for the insulin sensitizing effect of regular physical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to study the transcriptional differences in skeletal muscle and&#xD;
      adipose tissue at baseline and after a 3-month physical training program in obese patients&#xD;
      with and without T2D and to use this information to identify novel therapeutic targets for&#xD;
      improvement of glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators aim to find answers to the question: What is the mechanism behind the&#xD;
      effect of physical activity on insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty obese patients with (n=15) and without (n=15) type 2 diabetes will be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cohort Study Intervention: 12 weeks intervention period consisting of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training 3 sessions/week, 45 min/session. All training sessions are supervised.&#xD;
      Aerobic training is conducted as ergometer bicycle training at an intensity of 70% of maximal&#xD;
      oxygen uptake (x2/wk.) and rowing ergometer exercise at 70% of maximal heart rate (x1/wk.).&#xD;
      In week 3, 6 and 9 VO2max is measured to ensure sufficient adjustment of the workload during&#xD;
      the training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental methods: Before (1-2 weeks) and after the intervention, the following tests and&#xD;
      measurements are performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day A: (Overnight fasting. Duration approx. 3 h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (body composition and body fat)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graded exercise test on an ergometer bike (maximal fat oxidation rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handgrip strength (by dynamometer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leg power (Power Rig and sit-to-stand test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day B: (Overnight fasting. Duration approx. 9 h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-step euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy vastus lateralis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat biopsy subcutaneous lower abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow measurements (Femoral artery by Doppler ultrasound and forearm by strain-gauge&#xD;
           plethysmography)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Energy expenditure (ventilated hood method)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day A and B are repeated after the training intervention has finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Muscle and fat biopsies: Mitochondrial respiratory capacity and reactive oxygen species&#xD;
           production. Single nuclei RNA sequencing (snSeq). Fiber type determination and&#xD;
           capillarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood samples: Hormones, metabolites and substrates (e.g. insulin, catecholamines,&#xD;
           cortisol, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies, cytokines, and myokines). Plasma&#xD;
           proteomic/peptidomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this study will reveal cell types and genes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue&#xD;
      that are affected by training and/or that shows differential regulation in patients with T2D&#xD;
      versus control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power calculation indicates that a significant difference in training induced insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity will be detectable when n â‰¥ 10, based on power = 0.95 and level of significance&#xD;
      set to P&lt;0.05. This allows for a dropout rate of a 15-20% with some margin. Mixed model&#xD;
      analysis will be used for data analysis of phenotypical data, and bioinformatical tools for&#xD;
      the snSeq data and for the interaction between gene- and phenotype expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was approved by The Regional Ethical Committee of the Capital Region (H-20046605)&#xD;
      the 15th of December 2020.&#xD;
