      The SCION Trial is a clinical trial in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      The purpose of the trial is to investigate whether it is safe and effective to combine&#xD;
      standard radiation treatment with a drug called durvalumab, a type of immunotherapy. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will use a blood test to look for cancer cell DNA to determine how long&#xD;
      treatment with durvalumab should last. Both the use of durvalumab and the use of the blood&#xD;
      test are new strategies for managing early stage non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PURPOSE The intent of the study is to determine whether disease control in early non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) achieved by stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) can be&#xD;
      augmented locally, regionally, and distantly by safely combining it with durvalumab.&#xD;
      Moreover, the study will assess whether patients who are likeliest to benefit from extended&#xD;
      treatment with durvalumab can be predicted by assaying for molecular residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      after initial treatment using the AVENIO assay for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Combining SABR and Durvalumab in patients with T1-2 N0 M0 NSCLC reduces the&#xD;
      overall relapse rate at 18 months by 50% compared with historical controls treated with SABR&#xD;
      alone, from 19.3% to 9.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the overall relapse rate at 18 months in patients with T1-2 N0 M0 NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with SABR and Durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine rates of Local Relapse, Regional Nodal Relapse, Distant Relapse, and Second&#xD;
           Primary Lung Cancer in patients with T1-2 N0 M0 NSCLC treated with SABR and Durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine rates of Overall Survival, Cause-Specific Survival, and Relapse Free&#xD;
           Survival in patients with T1-2 N0 M0 NSCLC treated with SABR and Durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine rates of pneumonitis, immune-related toxicity, adverse events, serious&#xD;
           adverse events in patients with T1-2 N0 M0 NSCLC treated with SABR and Durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of MRD detection using the AVENIO ctDNA assay in patients with&#xD;
           T1-2 N0 M0 NSCLC treated with SABR and Durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare clinical outcomes between patients with detectable versus undetectable MRD&#xD;
           using the AVENIO ctDNA assay following treatment with SABR and Durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare clinical outcomes between patients with detectable MRD using the AVENIO ctDNA&#xD;
           assay following treatment with SABR and Durvalumab who receive extended Durvalumab&#xD;
           versus no further therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be candidates for enrolment. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive one infusion of Durvalumab every 4 weeks for four cycles (4 weeks = 1&#xD;
      cycle), with SABR delivered concurrently with cycle 2. Subjects will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      using the AVENIO assay initially on tumor tissue. This will allow the subsequent evaluation&#xD;
      for molecular residual disease (MRD) following cycle 4 to be tumor-informed, and&#xD;
      ultrasensitive. Subjects with no detectable ctDNA at the MRD assessment will receive no&#xD;
      further therapy. Subjects with detectable ctDNA at the MRD assessment will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either no further therapy or 8 additional cycles of q4w Durvalumab. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated by recording the occurrence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and&#xD;
      laboratory abnormalities, with special attention to pneumonitis and immune-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future research will be enabled through the collection of biospecimens. Subjects will&#xD;
      separately consent to the optional collection of these biospecimens. Blood samples collected&#xD;
      for this purpose at multiple timepoints (0, 3, 12, 24 months) will be archived in a&#xD;
      biorepository created for this study operated by the BC Cancer Tumour Tissue Repository&#xD;
      (Victoria, BC). Stool samples collected for this purpose at multiple timepoints (0, 3, and 12&#xD;
      months) will be archived in the Oncomicrobiome Repository (Montreal, QC).&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Previous radiotherapy to the chest or mediastinum. Subjects who have had previous&#xD;
             breast radiotherapy may be eligible at the discretion of the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of IP.&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable&#xD;

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase&#xD;
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra&#xD;
                  articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed &lt;&lt;10 mg/day&gt;&gt; of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from&#xD;
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Prior randomization or treatment in a previous durvalumab clinical study regardless of&#xD;
             treatment arm assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Patients who have received prior anti-PD-1, anti PD-L1 or anti CTLA-4:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must not have experienced a toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of&#xD;
                  prior immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. All AEs while receiving prior immunotherapy must have completely resolved or&#xD;
                  resolved to baseline prior to screening for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Must not have experienced a ≥Grade 3 immune related AE or an immune-related&#xD;
                  neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior immunotherapy. NOTE:&#xD;
                  Patients with endocrine AE of ≤Grade 2 are permitted to enroll if they are stably&#xD;
                  maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced recurrence of&#xD;
                  an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses of &gt; 10 mg&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent per day.&#xD;
