  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several common viruses thrive and persist in intraocular fluid due to ocular immune&#xD;
      privilege. Immune privilege is maintained by lack of lymphatic tissue, a strong blood ocular&#xD;
      barrier, and regulation of the systemic immune response via immunosuppressive factors such as&#xD;
      TGF-B and processes like anterior chamber associated immune deviation. Notable viruses that&#xD;
      benefit from ocular immune sequestration include DNA viruses such as Herpes simplex virus,&#xD;
      Varicella Zoster, Cytomegalovirus and RNA viruses like Ebola and Rubella.In light of the&#xD;
      global 2019 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 virus (SARS CoV-2 or commonly&#xD;
      COVID-19) pandemic, there has been growing interest on COVID-19's long term effects on the&#xD;
      ocular system. Ocular symptoms at the time of diagnosis and during illness have been reported&#xD;
      previously. The most commonly reported are epiphora, chemosis, and conjunctivitis. Less&#xD;
      common were findings of retinal hemorrhages and retinal ischemic changes. Recent literature&#xD;
      has demonstrated its presence in ocular fluid such as tears and the aqueous humor, but&#xD;
      whether this is sustained for an extended period of time has yet to be determined. Long term&#xD;
      effects of covid on the neurological system are being identified - large vessel ischemic&#xD;
      strokes, cerebral hemorrhages, cranial nerve palsies, and memory loss in young adults are&#xD;
      being reported. The persistence of COVID 19 in the intraocular fluid several months after&#xD;
      covid infection has not been studied previously.&#xD;

      Animal Studies and Previous Human Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other coronavirus murine and feline models have shown ocular involvement. In Robbins et al&#xD;
      experiment, mice underwent intracameral and intravitreal injections with murine coronavirus.&#xD;
      Within 3 days, those with injections into the AC demonstrated a variety of findings such as&#xD;
      keratitis and anterior uveitis; whereas those who underwent intravitreal injection had&#xD;
      multilayered retinal lesions with RPE scarring and retinal atrophy. CNS disease and/or death&#xD;
      occurred in a third of those from intravitreal injections. Viral antigens have been isolated&#xD;
      from these mice but there is evidence immune cells and pro-inflammatory factors also&#xD;
      contribute to the retinopathy findings. This murine model, known as Experimental CoV&#xD;
      Retinopathy, has been used to examine host immune response that lead to retinal damage. Cats&#xD;
      infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus, a feline coronavirus, manifested with&#xD;
      conjunctivitis, pyogranulomatous anterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, choroiditis and&#xD;
      retinal detachment. Over 90% of the cats had antigen detected in the conjunctiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viruses such as VZV, HSV, and CMV and parasites like Toxoplasmosis have been isolated from&#xD;
      the intraocular fluid of human eyes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), despite having&#xD;
      normal or negative serum titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment/Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who meet inclusion criteria will be provided an opportunity to participate in study.&#xD;
      They will provide written informed consent in accordance with the HIPAA regulations and&#xD;
      Vanderbilt IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients selected for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           80 total patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           20 patients undergoing ocular surgery who are COVID negative will be included as control&#xD;
           patients and undergo the same procedures 60 patients undergoing ocular surgery with&#xD;
           previous COVID infection will be stratified into three groups by time since diagnoses:&#xD;
           3, 6, 12 months ~ 20 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients will get a vitreous tap from operative eye 0.1-0.2 ml fluid. This&#xD;
                fresh sample will be tubed to the lab using a unique marked label. This will be&#xD;
                performed after the trocar is placed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At the end of surgery, the BSS bag will be tubed to the lab using the same label.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be obtained during pre-operative clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples will get a special-colored label and tubed to Dr Schmitz and Dr. Maris lab from&#xD;
           the OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      VUMC MIDL Lab Testing Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Specimens: 100-200ul dry taps of vitreous fluid will be delivered to the VUMC MIDL lab and&#xD;
      frozen (-80C) until nucleic acid is extracted. 1L bags of BSS saline containing ocular fluid&#xD;
      will be delivered to the VUMC MIDL lab and aliquoted into 3 10ml falcon tubes and then frozen&#xD;
      (-80C) until nucleic acid is extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nucleic acid extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Specimens will have total RNA &amp; DNA extracted on the easyMAG, EMAG, or EZ1 automated&#xD;
      nucleic acid extraction platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time RT-PCR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • RNA present in nucleic acid extracts will be reverse transcribed into cDNA. Target cDNA&#xD;
      will be amplified by PCR and target fluorescence emission will be measured and detected in&#xD;
      real time. Targets include the N1 &amp; N2 regions of the nucleocapsid gene of SARS-CoV-2, and an&#xD;
      internal control to monitor for adequate nucleic acid extraction and absence of PCR&#xD;
      inhibitors: human RNase P (RP). Target Ct values will be recorded from detected samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next Generation Sequencing (NGS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Illumina: Nucleic acid extracts will undergo targeted SARS-CoV-2 whole genome&#xD;
           amplification by tiling PCR. Amplicons will undergo DNA library preparation, barcoding,&#xD;
           and QC. DNA libraries will be inoculated onto MiSeq flow cells and sequenced. Reads will&#xD;
           be outputted as FASTQ files.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MinION: Total nucleic acid extracts will undergo DNA library preparation, barcoding, and&#xD;
           QC. DNA libraries will be inoculated onto MinION Mk1C &amp; Flongle flow cells for&#xD;
           metagenomic deep sequencing. Reads and associated quality data will be outputted as&#xD;
           FASTQ files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures involve minimal risk as they are performed in an eye that is undergoing&#xD;
      an elective scheduled operative procedure for medical reasons. The safe and sterile procedure&#xD;
      greatly decreases the risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or&#xD;
      Others&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events will be reported to the Vanderbilt Eye Institute, and VUMC IRB per policy&#xD;
      and procedure. These will be submitted within one week of occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      VUMC IRB will be notified of study withdrawal and discontinuation. We anticipate the study to&#xD;
      last approximately 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ct values from RT-PCR detected samples will be compared and correlated with clinical data.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Illumina and MinION NGS platforms will be analyzed for variants and&#xD;
      correlated with clinical data. non-SARS-CoV-2 microbial sequences will be analyzed and&#xD;
      identified to the microbial species level. The ocular fluid 'microbiome' will be compared&#xD;
      across samples and correlated with clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy/Confidentiality Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information will be de-identified and uploaded to REDCAP survey to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality and privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and Record Retention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration is expected to be one year. The data will be retained for six months following&#xD;
      closure of the study. This will be destroyed afterward.&#xD;

        We plan to recruit 80 patients to be enrolled in the study. This will be 20 COVID negative&#xD;
        patients and 60 COVID positive patients stratified into three groups (20 per group) based&#xD;
        on time since diagnosis as detailed above. This will provide sufficient sample size to be&#xD;

        how long the virus can subsist in intraocular fluid.&#xD;
