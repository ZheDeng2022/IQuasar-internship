  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational study. We aim to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between immune-related myopathy (myasthenia gravis&#xD;
      and inflammatory myopathy) patients and health controls. The main study factors include&#xD;
      adverse events following immunization (AEFI), serum specific antibody (Acetylcholine receptor&#xD;
      (AChR) antibody, Anti-MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) antibody, myositis antibody) and virus&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody titers.&#xD;
