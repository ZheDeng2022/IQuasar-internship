    <textblock>
      Systematic nurse-led consultations based on electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) will&#xD;
      be tested among women with ovarian - and endometrial cancer receiving first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with ovarian- and endometrial cancer often experiences a high disease and&#xD;
      treatment-related physical and psychological burden. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) have the&#xD;
      potential to improve patient-clinician communication, symptom management, involvement, and&#xD;
      quality of life. Electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) can facilitate appropriate and&#xD;
      continuous symptom monitoring reported by the patients. Nurses are with their holistic&#xD;
      approach and their specialized knowledge and experience in a prominent position to address&#xD;
      and facilitate symptom-management in a multidisciplinary context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to develop a model of care for systematic nurse-led&#xD;
      consultations based on ePRO facilitating symptom management and to investigate how these&#xD;
      consultations can be a part of the multidisciplinary treatment regimen for women with&#xD;
      ovarian- and endometrial cancer receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;
