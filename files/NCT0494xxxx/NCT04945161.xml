      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to explore the&#xD;
      mechanism of action (MOA) of ON101 in treating chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). There&#xD;
      will be 6 subjects ON101 treatment (Arm A) and 6 subjects in Placebo (Arm B) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve(12) eligible subjects with DFUs and are not undergoing dialysis will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either ON101 treatment (Arm A) or Placebo (Arm B) for six weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment arm allocation will be done through randomization in a double-blind fashion. SoC&#xD;
      will be provided throughout the study period.Subjects with DFUs not undergoing dialysis, N =&#xD;
      12 Arm A: ON101 plus SoC, N = 6 Arm B: Placebo plus SoC, N =6 SoC will be provided throughout&#xD;
      the study period (from screening to end of treatment). SoC includes evaluation to ensure&#xD;
      adequate arterial flow, wound cleaning, removal of necrotic, infected and/or nonviable tissue&#xD;
      by debridement, maintenance of moist wound environment via regular changing of dressings, and&#xD;
      management of infection through oral antibiotics, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three periods, a Screening/Run-in Period, a Treatment Period, and a&#xD;
      Safety Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Run-in Period (14 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period (up to 6 weeks ± allow window):&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be five (5) visits during the Treatment Period. Baseline/V1 (Day 1 ± 3 days) Visit&#xD;
      2 to Visit 5/EOT (Day 14 to Day 42/EOT) Safety Follow-up Period (Day 49±1 or Day of EOT + 6-8&#xD;
