  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dance as a treatment to support physical, cognitive and emotional functioning, has gained&#xD;
      increased acceptance as a healthcare intervention for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD).&#xD;
      The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been far reaching with devastating effects for&#xD;
      at-risk populations. To find alternative and safe treatment delivery options during the&#xD;
      pandemic has been of outmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed-methods, feasibility study on digital for people with Parkinson's Disease aimed to&#xD;
      investigate: (1) the feasibility and safety of a digital home-based dance intervention for&#xD;
      people with PD; (2) change in self-reported quality of life, cognitive complaints,&#xD;
      psychological health and fatigue; and (3) the experience of digital dance for people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-three participants partook in 10 weekly digital dance classes at home via zoom.&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes measures were administered at post-test. Pre-post changes in&#xD;
      self-reported quality of life, cognitive complaints, psychological health and fatigue were&#xD;
      measured, as well as the experience of digital dance via focus groups.&#xD;

    <description>The following feasibility outcome measures were assessed: (a) Technical and safety issues, (b) Compliance and motivation, (c) Self-assessed improvement in physical function, wellbeing and cognitive function and (d) The importance of dance as an artistic and creative activity.&#xD;
Each feasibility outcome measure was assessed via a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1=very unsatisfactory, 5=very satisfactory), (1=not motivated, 5=very motivated), (1=noticeable worsening, 5=noticeable improvement) or (1=not meaningful, 5=very meaningful). Furthermore, each feasibility outcome measure had an open-ended question connected to it in order to capture any details related that feasibility domain. Two open-ended questions regarding positive and negative aspects of digital dancing were also included.&#xD;
For each feasibility outcome measure, a criterion of success was developed in order to judge the the success rate of these feasibility outcome measures.</description>
