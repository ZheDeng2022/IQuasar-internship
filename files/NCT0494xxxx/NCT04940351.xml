  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent times, many patients want their treatment duration to be reduced, because lengthy&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment duration is associated with negative sequelae such as discomfort, pain,&#xD;
      white spot lesions, and decreased patient's compliance. Several techniques have been employed&#xD;
      in an attempt to accelerate the tooth movement and shorten the lengthy orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      duration. So, this study will investigate the effectiveness of minimal invasive technique&#xD;
      like piezocision and microosteoperforation in alleviating mandibular anterior crowding which&#xD;
      is one of the common malocclusiom and provide scientific knowledge regarding which minimal&#xD;
      invasive tecnique will relieve the crowding faster.&#xD;

      Records will be taken from patients who are meeting selection criteria and then analysis of&#xD;
      record will be done to attain a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Afterthat, those&#xD;
      patients will be referred to oral surgery department for extraction of first premolar. After&#xD;
      healing, orthodontic treatment will be started with bonding of preadjusted MBT 0.022&quot; slot&#xD;
      straight wire appliance(Patient will be instructed to report immediately in case of breakage&#xD;
      of appliance), after that, randomisation and allocation of two groups will be done and on the&#xD;
      day of initial aligning archwire placement i.e., 0.014&quot; NiTi, active&#xD;
      interventions(piezocision and micro-osteoperforations) will be done for each group and then&#xD;
      levelling and alignment will be continued with the following arch wire sequence 0.016&quot; ,&#xD;
      0.016&quot; x 0.022&quot; and 0.017&quot; x 0.025&quot; NiTi. Levelling and alignment will be considered finished&#xD;
      when 0.017x0.025&quot; NiTi archwire will be engaged passively in the brackets. Records i.e,.&#xD;
      mandibular study models will be taken on the day of surgical procedure before surgery (T0)&#xD;
      and then after every 4th week i.e., 4th week(T1), 8th week(T2), 12th week(T3), 16th week(T4).&#xD;
      Following this, data collection and interpretation of results will be done. And also, CBCT&#xD;
      will be taken at post levelling and alignment with 0.017&quot; x 0.025&quot; arch wire to assess the&#xD;
      root resorption and marginal alveolar bone loss.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>GROUP - A: PIEZOCISION GROUP</intervention_name>
    <description>This group will receive piezocisions after placement of initial arch wire, in between the roots of mandibular anteriors (in a vertical line) i.e., between mandibular canine and lateral incisors bilaterally, lateral incisors and central incisors bilaterally and between two cental incisors with the help of piezotome. These piezocisions will be performed on the labial cortical bone only, 4mm below the interdental papilla under 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and with standard asepsis, and gingival overlying will be incised first with blade number 15 in a Bard Parker handle. A piezosurgical microsaw with piezosurgical drill will be placed over that incision with irrigation. Then, vertical 5- to 8-mm and 3mm deep corticotomies will be perform using periapical radiographs as a guide to avoid penetrating into the adjacent roots. No subsequent sutures required.</description>

    <description>This group will receive MOPs after initial arch wire placement. These MOPs will be performed under local anesthesia with standard asepsis, using a self drilling 1.6mm x 8mm orthodontic mini-implants and mini-implant screw driver and no flap will be raised. MOP's will be placed on three sites i.e., interproximally between mandibular canine and lateral incisors bilaterally and between two central incisors. Each site will receive two MOP's, first 2mm apical to alveolar crest and second 2mm below the first in a vertical line and 2mm deep into the bone. Then the mini-implant will be removed by rotating the screw driver anticlockwise and pressure will be applied to achieve hemostasis.</description>
