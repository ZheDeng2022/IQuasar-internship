      This randomised controlled trial will determine the non-inferiority of stopping empiric&#xD;
      antibiotics prior to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery (Early Stopping) versus&#xD;
      stopping antibiotics upon ANC recovery (Standard of Care/ Late Stopping) , in children with&#xD;
      cancer and high-risk febrile neutropenia (FN).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of childhood cancer treatment and a leading&#xD;
      cause of hospital admission and antibiotic exposure. Management typically involves&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics until resolution of fever and absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&#xD;
      recovery &gt;500 cells/mm3. However, despite the frequency with which FN occurs, evidence to&#xD;
      guide duration of antibiotics is limited to observational studies and small randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials.Current international clinical guidelines provide conflicting&#xD;
      recommendations on when to cease empiric antibiotics for FN. Early cessation of antibiotics&#xD;
      in FN may translate to reduced antibiotic exposure and limit potential harms including drug&#xD;
      side-effects, antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection and microbiome&#xD;
      disruption. This randomised controlled trial will use a composite endpoint of fever&#xD;
      recurrence, physiological instability, new bacteremia, intensive care admission and death to&#xD;
      determine the non-inferiority of stopping antibiotics prior to ANC recovery compared with&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC), in children with cancer and high-risk FN. Adopting a health&#xD;
      informatics approach, patient identification, consent, randomisation and reporting of&#xD;
      outcomes will be embedded within the electronic medical record (EMR). Children with high-risk&#xD;
      FN who have been afebrile and clinically stable for at least 48 hours will be randomised to&#xD;
      cease antibiotics or continue SOC. Data on primary outcomes, antibiotic duration, length of&#xD;
      stay, C. difficile infection and antimicrobial resistance will be automatically collected by&#xD;
      the EMR. This is the first study of its kind in children with high-risk FN and adopts a novel&#xD;
      embedded trial design. Results will inform optimal antibiotic duration in FN, potentially&#xD;
      reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure.&#xD;
