  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease is known as glycogen storage disease type II, an autosomal recessive disease&#xD;
      that results from acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency leading to lysosomal glycogen&#xD;
      accumulation. Patients with classic infantile form have less than 1% of enzyme activity,&#xD;
      which explains severe impairment before one year with rapid death without treatment, while&#xD;
      later-onset form shows progressive symptoms later in childhood (juvenile form) or adulthood&#xD;
      (adult form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) consists of periodic intravenous infusion of missing GAA&#xD;
      produced by the recombinant method. ERT improves significantly the cardiac function and the&#xD;
      children's survival in classic infantile form. This therapy has been approved for all&#xD;
      patients with Pompe's disease in the United States and the European Union since 2006, but its&#xD;
      efficacy was not clear for patients with later-onset form. Recent studies show motor&#xD;
      improvement in adult patients, but there is little published data for the juvenile form&#xD;
      disease. A separate analysis of juvenile form is justified as patients are still in a&#xD;
      developmental stage and show clinical symptoms early in life, may have more severe disease&#xD;
      and a different response to ERT. The recommendation is no treatment in the absence of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, but the consensus does not stratify patients into juvenile- or adult-onset&#xD;
      form. ERT is an expensive long-term therapy, and its administration every 2 weeks in the&#xD;
      hospital is a great limitation for patients. Therefore, an evaluation of the treatment effect&#xD;
      in patients with the juvenile form is necessary.&#xD;

        This study includes the patients who have Pompe disease documented by deficient&#xD;
        alpha-glucosidase activity and/or DNA analysis and follow-up in the French referral&#xD;
        centers. These patients must be younger than 18 years at diagnosis and not have the&#xD;
        infantile form of Pompe disease. The children who have cardiomyopathy at diagnosis are&#xD;
        excluded in order to take only juvenile form.&#xD;
