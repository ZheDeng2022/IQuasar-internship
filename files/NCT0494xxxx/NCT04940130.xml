    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 222 healthy Malian children aged&#xD;
      6-10 years, residing in Bancoumana and surrounding villages, will be administered three doses&#xD;
      of 9.0x10^5 Pf sporozoites (PfSPZ) of PfSPZ Vaccine (or placebo) at 1, 8, and 29-days using&#xD;
      direct venous inoculation (DVI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is composed of a single cohort with two arms (categorized by placebo&#xD;
      control/experimental groups) designed to assess the safety, immunogenicity and protective&#xD;
      efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive artemether-lumefantrine (AL) approximately 1- 2 weeks before the&#xD;
      first and third doses of PfSPZ Vaccine or normal saline for clearance of Pf parasitemia.&#xD;
      Vaccinated participants and non-immunized controls will be followed for safety and monitored&#xD;
      for development of parasitemia through the natural malaria transmission season to estimate&#xD;
      vaccine efficacy (VE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will enroll healthy Malian children between 6 and 10 years of age residing&#xD;
      in Bancoumana and surrounding villages to participate in a randomized, double blind, placebo-&#xD;
      controlled study to assess the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of PfSPZ&#xD;
      Vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be immunized with a 3-dose series of 9.0 x10^5 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine or&#xD;
      normal saline (placebo) at 1, 8, and 29 days. Subjects will be screened for eligibility for&#xD;
      enrollment. Enrollment will begin with AL dosing approximately 1-2 weeks prior to their first&#xD;
      dose of vaccine. Volunteers will be randomized into two arms (Arm 1- Vaccine arm, Arm 2-&#xD;
      control arm with normal saline) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinated subjects and controls will then be followed for safety and assessment for malaria&#xD;
      infection during the subsequent malaria transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      222 children between the ages of 6 and 10 years old inclusive will be enrolled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1(PfSPZ Vaccine): (n = 111) children ages 6 - 10 will receive three doses of PfSPZ&#xD;
      Vaccine (9.0x10^5 PfSPZ) via direct venous inoculation (DVI) at 1, 8, and 29 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 (normal saline): (n = 111) children ages 6 - 10 will receive normal saline via DVI at&#xD;
      1, 8, and 29 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive artemether-lumefantrine (AL) approximately 1- 2 weeks before the&#xD;
      first and third doses of PfSPZ Vaccine or normal saline for clearance of Pf parasitemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinated participants and non-immunized controls will be monitored for development of Pf&#xD;
      malaria with symptoms and Pf malaria (parasitemia) through the natural malaria transmission&#xD;
      season to estimate vaccine efficacy (VE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pf malaria with symptoms is defined as a positive thick blood smear (see definition of Pf&#xD;
      malaria below) plus:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measured fever ≥ 37.5 degrees Celsius or history of fever (subjective or objective) in&#xD;
           the last 24 hours, or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any of the following -&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Verbal individual (individual able and willing to answer questions): A verbal&#xD;
                individual is considered symptomatic if reporting at the time of evaluation at&#xD;
                least two of the following symptoms/symptom groups: headache, chills and/or rigors,&#xD;
                malaise and/or fatigue, dizziness and/or light-headedness, myalgias and/or&#xD;
                arthralgias; or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-verbal individual (small child or any individual unable or unwilling to answer&#xD;
                questions): A non-verbal individual is considered symptomatic if manifesting at the&#xD;
                time of evaluation at least two of the following signs/sign groups: drowsiness,&#xD;
                irritability and/or fussiness, inability and/or refusal to eat or drink,&#xD;
                prostration; or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any individual: Signs of severe malaria (e.g. impairment of consciousness, severe&#xD;
                anemia, hemoglobinuria, acute kidney injury, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pf malaria is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - At least one unambiguous asexual parasite on thick blood smear identified by two&#xD;
      independent microscopists after each examining 0.50 μL of blood in a study participant&#xD;
