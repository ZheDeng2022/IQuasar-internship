  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures occur nearly twice as often for older adults residing in long-term care as they&#xD;
      do in older adults of a similar age still living in other settings. Hip fractures are the&#xD;
      leading cause of hospitalization and often result in loss of independence, problems with&#xD;
      walking and sometimes death. To address this problem the PREVENT (Person-centered Routine&#xD;
      Fracture PrEVENTion in LTC) program was designed for use in long-term care homes. PREVENT&#xD;
      uses a tool (&quot;fracture risk calculator&quot;) based on a residents electronic health record to&#xD;
      capture who is most at risk of fracture due to osteoporosis and falls. The program then&#xD;
      trains the health care team including doctors, pharmacists and nurses on the latest&#xD;
      recommendations on how to best assist residents and their families in making treatment&#xD;
      decisions. The healthcare teams are also given tools that help them stay on track such as&#xD;
      templates for ordering medications, strategies to reduce falls and fractures and making care&#xD;
      plans. The study will examine if this program is effective for decreasing hip fractures by&#xD;
      assigning some homes to receive the PREVENT program (intervention group) and some homes to&#xD;
      usual care (control group) and comparing the results.&#xD;

    <description>A standardized PREVENT educational program will be offered to each intervention LTC home and health-care staff. The curricula includes video modules with fracture-prevention care recommendations and an orientation to the Fracture Prevention Toolkit. Using the Fracture Risk Scale (i.e., a clinical decision support tool embedded in the RAI-MDS 2.0), the LTC team will identify residents at high-risk for fracture and will implement the fracture prevention recommendations into care plans on an individual resident basis.</description>
