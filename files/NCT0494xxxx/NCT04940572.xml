      Open label, phase II study non randomized single group assignment of 20 evaluable patients 13&#xD;
      years and older, over 37,5 kg body-weight, with sensorineural hearing loss of at least 20 dB&#xD;
      at 8 kHz in high frequency average (HFA), AND with documented genetic mutations in the WFS1&#xD;
      gene AND with at least one other major documented clinical symptom pertaining to Wolfram&#xD;
      syndrome (i.e. diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy). Every patients will&#xD;
      receive over three years a treatment by VPA (Depakine chrono).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effective dose and duration of this 3 years therapy has to be determined individually&#xD;
      with the aim to obtain preservation of auditory function defined as no decrease higher than 5&#xD;
      dB on one ear compared to baseline at 8 kHz on high frequencies average and to reduce the&#xD;
      dose of insulin and/or desmopressin needed, therefore monitoring of the patients plasma&#xD;
      concentration of VPAis required for dose adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally a plasma level between 40 and 100 mg/l (ie, 300 to 700 micromol/l) sodium valproate&#xD;
      is aimed to be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially 10-15 mg of sodium valproate/kg bodyweight per day will be taken in one or two&#xD;
      doses during meals. The dose will then be increased every 3 days in steps of 10 mg sodium&#xD;
      valproate/kg bodyweight per day till the optimal plasma level is reached but does not exceed&#xD;
      100 milligrams per liter (ie, 700 micromol/l) during 156 weeks (refer to Appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will compare Pure tone audiometry (PTA), Speech interference index (SII) and High&#xD;
      frequency pure tone audiometry hearing test between baseline and final visit.&#xD;
