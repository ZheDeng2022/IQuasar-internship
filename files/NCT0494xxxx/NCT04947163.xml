      The disease burden of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is growing rapidly, and multiple complications&#xD;
      have been reported including cardiopulmonary and high fall risk which declines the overall&#xD;
      quality of life. IMT can be useful technique to improve the physical and functional&#xD;
      performance, reduce the severity of complications and enable the individuals to become active&#xD;
      members of community. The current study is intended to evaluate the dual effects of IMT on&#xD;
      postural stability and pulmonary function of diabetic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to&#xD;
      either deficiency of insulin or the inability of the body to utilize it. Hyperglycemia&#xD;
      ultimately leads to multiple organ damage in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. The&#xD;
      incidence occurs mostly at the age of 55 years equally affecting both genders. The prevalence&#xD;
      of diabetes has been increased four times in the last three decades worldwide and global&#xD;
      prevalence is increasing alarmingly with about 1 out of every 11 individuals having diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus with 90% patients having type 2 diabetes mellitus. The statistical data depicts a&#xD;
      huge burden of disease both in morbidity and mortality globally and an anticipated threat on&#xD;
      health care system in future. (1) The complications of diabetes have been reported higher in&#xD;
      the South Asia region as compared to western counterparts. In Pakistan, according to National&#xD;
      Diabetes Survey of Pakistan (NDSP 2016 - 2017), the pooled prevalence of diabetes was&#xD;
      projected to be 26.3% affecting 27.4 million people above 20 years of age. These high numbers&#xD;
      are directly and indirectly linked with the economic burden on society and ultimately affect&#xD;
      the quality of life of diabetics, families, and community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, there are different complications (micro &amp; macro vascular) associated with DM and&#xD;
      these are main sources of morbidity and mortality. Neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy&#xD;
      are the microvascular complications whereas macrovascular complications include&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, stroke as well as other vascular diseases. Apart from these&#xD;
      complications, there are few other complications including decreased resistance to&#xD;
      infections, dental issues, birth complications in gestational diabetes, poor balance,&#xD;
      sarcopenia and increased risk of fall and fractures. The reduced strength and endurance of&#xD;
      diaphragm the vital muscle of respiration lead to compromised respiratory functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy and vestibular impairments alter the biomechanical&#xD;
      stability and strength of postural control in individuals with DM. The instability generates&#xD;
      disparity among muscular and neural structures to execute locomotion abilities, so abnormal&#xD;
      gait pattern, weakness in lower limb musculature, impair sensory function, diminished&#xD;
      reflexes and high fall risk have been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These musculoskeletal complications compromise the mobility level and impede the performance&#xD;
      of functional tasks and Activities of Daily Life (ADLs) in patients with DM. The limited&#xD;
      movements and participation restrictions in social activities create inaccessibility and&#xD;
      dependence on caregiver has been increased. The overall activity level has been declined and&#xD;
      decreases the quality of life of individuals and ultimately developing social and economic&#xD;
      burden on community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of DM always emphases to improve the current health status and prevent further&#xD;
      complications due to uncontrolled DM. Multiple management approaches have been reported in&#xD;
      the literature to maintain adequate glycemic control and manage diabetes related&#xD;
      complications and co morbidities. Treatment strategies also focus to maximize the quality of&#xD;
      life and minimize the risk of treatment related complications including hypoglycemia. Balance&#xD;
      and postural impairments are common in DM due to neuropathic changes and there are different&#xD;
      training strategies have been documented in literature to improve postural stability and&#xD;
      reduce fall risk. The training approaches include Tai Chi, Wii Fit based training, circuit&#xD;
      training, strengthening exercises of lower limbs, gait training and task oriented dynamic&#xD;
      training to enhance the overall balance abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central trunk stability and core strength are integral part of postural stability and&#xD;
      balance but there is limited evidence to address these for balance training in DM. There is&#xD;
      lacking evidence in literature on specific training targeting the central trunk and core&#xD;
      strength to improve the balance ability, reduces fall risk and improve quality of life in DM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) is a device-based training and widely used therapeutic&#xD;
      technique for improving inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, thoracic mobility,&#xD;
      exercise capacity, reducing dyspnea and increasing quality of life. Recently, IMT has been&#xD;
      used to improve balance and physical performance among elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How IMT is a useful intervention to improve cardiopulmonary function, postural control and&#xD;
      quality of life? The underlying mechanism of IMT principal and clinical implications has&#xD;
      three-fold mechanisms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First: Diaphragm thickness and strength enhances balance in two ways. Firstly, there is&#xD;
      activation of diaphragm during upper limb movements indicating that the co-activation of&#xD;
      diaphragm assists in the mechanical stabilization of the spine. Secondly, it plays a major&#xD;
      role in the generation of intra-abdominal pressure which helps in the stabilization of lumbar&#xD;
      spine during movements like shoulder abduction and adduction i.e., balance perturbations.&#xD;
      These changes will improve the lower limb mobility, quadriceps strength, functional&#xD;
      performance, postural control response and exercise tolerance among individuals. It creates&#xD;
      an overall impact on enhanced balance strategies, physical performance and postural stability&#xD;
      in elderly and other pathological conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD), cystic fibrosis and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second: Increases in diaphragmatic mobility and hypertrophy as well as improved neural&#xD;
      control and thickness of respiratory muscles including transversus abdominus and internal&#xD;
      obliques leads to increase in exercise capacity, pulmonary function and decreased perceived&#xD;
      breathlessness and exertion in the patients. It will increase the strength of respiratory&#xD;
      muscles ultimately proving it to be an effective treatment strategy in COPD, chronic heart&#xD;
      failure, multiple sclerosis and various respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third: IMT exerts certain ergogenic effects through increasing diaphragmatic mobility and&#xD;
      strength thereby improving the recovery time in sprinters, limiting cardiac sympathetic&#xD;
      hyperactivity in cyclists and enhance rowing performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it can be hypothesized that IMT is not only effective for improving&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function but is also strongly linked with postural stability. The disease&#xD;
      burden of DM is growing rapidly, and multiple complications have been reported including&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary and high fall risk which declines the overall quality of life. IMT can be&#xD;
      useful technique to improve the physical and functional performance, reduce the severity of&#xD;
      complications and enable the individuals to become active members of community. The current&#xD;
      study is intended to evaluate the dual effects of IMT on postural stability and pulmonary&#xD;
      function of diabetic patients.&#xD;
