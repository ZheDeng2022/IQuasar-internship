  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy (decrease in severe fatigue), safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of RSLV-132 in subjects with long Corona Virus (COVID) syndome&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled study in approximately 70 subjects with long COVID&#xD;
      syndrome. After being informed about the study and potential risks, all subjects giving&#xD;
      written informed consent will be screened to determine eligibility in the 10 days before the&#xD;
      start of study treatment. Prior to the first study treatment administration, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive six administrations of 10 mg/kg RSLV-132 or placebo on&#xD;
      Days 1, 8, 15, 29, 43 and 57. Subjects will then attend an end of study visit approximately&#xD;
      10 weeks after the start of treatment (Day 71).&#xD;

    <measure>PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a T-score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Short Form 7a (PROMIS Fatigue 7a) T-score at the end of treatment compared to baseline. The PROMIS Fatigue 7a consists of seven questions measuring symptoms severity at five-point intervals, with higher scores representing a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FACIT Fatigue questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire at the end of treatment compared to baseline. The FACIT-F is a 13 item measure of fatigue with a 7 day recall memory. Items are scored on a five point scale (0-not at all to 4-very much). The total score therefore ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores reflecting greater fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Long COVID-19-related Symptom Assessment patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the Long COVID-19-related Symptom Assessment patient questionnaire at the end of treatment compared to baseline. Subjects will be asked to describe the severity of eight COVID-19 related symptoms (muscle pain, joint pain, chest pain, brain fog, chills, sweats, abdominal pain and chest tightness) over the last 7 days on a four point scale (0-none to 3-severe) with a higher score representing a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported Global Impression of Severity questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the Patient-reported Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) questionnaire at the end of treatment compared to baseline. Subjects will be asked to describe the severity of fatigue on the assessment day compared to the past 7 days on a four point scale (1-no improvement to 4-significant improvement) with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit Symbol Substitution Test</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) at the end of treatment compared to baseline. The DSST is a highly validated measure of the patient's ability to focus and concentrate of a simple task. Subjects with profound fatigue take more time to complete the test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the Physician Global Assessment at the end of treatment compared to baseline. The assessment is measured on a 0 to 100 mm scale with score 0 to be no disease activity and score 100 to be the most severe disease activity.</description>
