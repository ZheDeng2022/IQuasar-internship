  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will include 75 patients with evident or suspected ischemic heart disease refered&#xD;
      to Department of Nuclear Medicine &amp; PET Centre, Aarhus University Hospital, for perfusion&#xD;
      imaging by 15O-H2O PET/CT scan of the heart during rest and stress. Instead of the clinical&#xD;
      scan participants will undergo perfusion imaging by 15O-H2O PET/MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will receive diagnostic information based on the 15O-H2O PET scan as if the&#xD;
      patient had not participated in the study. As such, the study has no influence on the&#xD;
      diagnostics or treatments of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the scans will be used to compare 15O-H2O PET with cardiac MR for evaluation of&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will be done for up to 10 years in regards to major cardiovascular events in order&#xD;
      to determine the prognostic value of the scan.&#xD;
