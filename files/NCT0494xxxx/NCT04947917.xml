  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study investigates if SpotTM ink can help breast surgeons retrieve sampled&#xD;
      lymph node as well as or better than the standard clip and radioseed guidance methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the novel study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SpotTM ink tattooing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the standard of care study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Core needle biopsy and/or fine needle aspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical Removal of the Lymph Nodes via clip and radioseed guidance&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Feasibility Study, in which investigators are examining SpotTM ink&#xD;
      to find out if retrieval rates of the inked lymph node at surgery are as good as or better&#xD;
      than the standard of care, which is to clip and then radioseed-label the positive axillary&#xD;
      lymph node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves placement of SpotTM ink on the surface of the lymph node at the&#xD;
      time of sampling. As per standard of care, if the lymph node is positive for malignant cells,&#xD;
      the surgeon will remove the lymph node at the time of surgical excision. The lymph node&#xD;
      tissue will then be evaluated by the pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SpotTM ink for use in the large&#xD;
      intestine to mark colon polyps. The FDA has not approved SpotTM ink for use in axillary lymph&#xD;
      nodes. However, SpotTM ink has been used in axillary lymph nodes by other institutions in&#xD;
      smaller studies similar to this one with success in retrieving the lymph node after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study until surgical removal of their breast cancer and&#xD;
      lymph nodes after their tattoo ink placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 80 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any patient presenting with a new diagnosis of breast cancer or with imaging findings&#xD;
        highly suspicious for breast cancer (BI-RADS® 4C and 5) and suspicious axillary lymph&#xD;
        node(s) is potentially eligible. Inclusion criteria are those eligible patients who have&#xD;
        axillary lymph node(s) that are suspicious by imaging. Evaluation of the axilla with US&#xD;
        will be performed when clinically warranted, with lymph node sampling recommended by the&#xD;
        radiologist based on morphologically abnormal features.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of Spot™ ink in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to undergo breast imaging and surgical procedures, and therefore have&#xD;
        a ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating are eligible as Spot™ ink is placed focally in the&#xD;
             axillary lymph node and breast tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria includes patients who have upper body or ipsilateral arm tattoos, as&#xD;
        that ink may already be present in regional nodes and may confound visibility of Spot™ ink&#xD;
        [19]. If NAC has already been initiated and the lymph node is no longer visualized,&#xD;
        tattooing will not be performed, and that patient will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Spot™ ink.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
