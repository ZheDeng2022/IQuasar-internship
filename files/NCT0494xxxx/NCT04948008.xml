  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBI306 is a bio-innovative drug against proprotein convertase subtilisin 9 (PCSK-9)&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody. Currently, cholesterol-lowering drugs with multiple mechanisms of action&#xD;
      are on the market or under development. Among them, anti-PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies have&#xD;
      received widespread attention due to their good safety and efficacy. The results of existing&#xD;
      preclinical studies show that IBI306 has a clear structure, good stability, and is not&#xD;
      inferior to other drugs of its kind in terms of drug activity, animal pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into two phases: the dose exploration phase (the first phase) and the&#xD;
      confirmatory phase (the second phase). Each stage is divided into screening period, treatment&#xD;
      period, and safety follow-up period. The first phase of this research is the randomized&#xD;
      design of open labels. The second stage is an open, single-arm design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the first phase of the study: to evaluate the tolerability and safety of&#xD;
      multiple-dose repeated administration of IBI306 in the Chinese population with&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, and to recommend the dose for the second phase. The main purpose of the&#xD;
      second phase of the study: to evaluate the effectiveness of IBI306 in the Chinese homozygous&#xD;
      familial hypercholesterolemia population. Secondary research purpose: To evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of IBI306 in Chinese homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia population.&#xD;
