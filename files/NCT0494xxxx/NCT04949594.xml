  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a chronic neurological condition that impacts the quality of life due to&#xD;
      decreased mobility, social repercussions caused by others's perception of abnormal&#xD;
      involuntary movement and frequent pain. Botulinum toxin has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing pain in dystonia. However, many patients remain painful despite the injections,&#xD;
      especially when the decrease in the effect of the latter, performed every 3 months on&#xD;
      average. Despite frequent use of TENS in pain relief, only a few small studies studying TENS&#xD;
      in dystonia were published and none of them reported TENS effects on dystonic pain using&#xD;
      sensory threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to quantify the efficacy and tolerance of TENS in the indication of pain&#xD;
      related to dystonia, focusing on cervical dystonia which is the most common form of dystonia.&#xD;

      TENDYS (TENs use in cervical DYStonia) is an observational, prospective, single arm,&#xD;
      monocentric study including subjects between September 2019 and July 2020 with cervical&#xD;
      dystonia treated or not with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) type A at the Nancy Regional&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who benefited from a simple follow-up or injections of BoNT every 3 or 4 months&#xD;
      for a painful cervical dystonia were proposed the use of TENS during a neurologic&#xD;
      consultation with one of two specialist physicians trained to cervical dystonia. Patients who&#xD;
      accepted had to give informed consent and were re-evaluated about 1 month later to ensure&#xD;
      that pain persisted and to have a demo of TENS. The electro-stimulator was delivered to&#xD;
      posterior cervical muscles over or close to the painful site, according to a Conventional or&#xD;
      High frequency/Low intensity mode (Gate control). Patients were encouraged to use the machine&#xD;
      daily, as often and long and possible, except for sleeping and driving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments of pain occurred at the consultation toxin injection 3 months later and&#xD;
      at 4 months for all patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (abbreviated TWSTRS) is a mixed clinician and patient rated cervical dystonia-specific scale. TWSTRS total score is scored from 0-85 (best to worst).</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TWSTRS is comprised of 3 subscales : severity (range 0-35), disability (range 0-30), and pain (range 0-20), each of which is scored independently (best to worst).</description>
