  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently in Russia there is no available self-evaluating tools with appropriate diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy for screening of patients with haemorrhoids. Therefore, the primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate a new patient specific questionnaire (HDQ) with appropriate&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity to use for screening of patients with haemorrhoids in Russia.&#xD;
      Once evaluated, the HDQ will be used in clinical practice for wider screening of haemorrhoids&#xD;
      in population and for increasing patients' awareness of the disease and prompting them to&#xD;
      seek professional advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to describe a prevalence of haemorrhoids among patients&#xD;
      in the study and to describe a prevalence of the symptoms of haemorrhoids among patients in&#xD;
      the study&#xD;

      Main parameters (primary outcomes) to be evaluated in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. sensitivity of the HDQ for screening of patients with haemorrhoids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. specificity of the HDQ for screening of patients with haemorrhoids;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional parameters (secondary outcomes) in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence rate of haemorrhoids among study population established by physicians basing&#xD;
           on the results of the objective examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevalence of the symptoms of haemorrhoids among patients in the study&#xD;
