  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MyoMobile study is a single-center, randomized, controlled three-armed cohort study with&#xD;
      prospective data collection to investigate the effect of a personalized mobile health&#xD;
      intervention compared to usual care on the physical activity levels in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure and preserved ejection fraction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects more than 15 million people in Europe and represents the leading&#xD;
      cause of hospitalization. The prevalence of HF is increasing, which has been attributed to an&#xD;
      ageing population with subsequently higher prevalence of predisposing risk factors (e.g.&#xD;
      arterial hypertension, type-2-diabetes, obesity), a better survival, and more effective&#xD;
      treatment of precursors (e.g. myocardial infarction). In the community, heart failure with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common HF phenotype. Currently, the benefit&#xD;
      of medical therapies is limited to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&#xD;
      (HFrEF) only, whereas no specific medical therapy is currently approved for patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In HF patients, physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle lead to disease progression and&#xD;
      increased mortality, and an increase of physical activity is positively correlated with&#xD;
      improved outcome. Guidelines from the Heart Failure Society of America recommend at least 30&#xD;
      minutes of moderate-intensity activity for ≥ 5 days/week (i.e. at least 150 min/week).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, exercise recommendations are poorly implemented in daily clinical practice and&#xD;
      even patients enrolled in supervised exercise training programs have been reported to show&#xD;
      low adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MyoMobile study has been designed to assess the effect of a 12-week, app-based coaching&#xD;
      program on physical activity in patients with HFpEF. Physical activity including daily step&#xD;
      count will be assessed by accelerometry and, in addition, a pedometer will be used to measure&#xD;
      the daily step count and provide direct feedback to the patient. Accelerometers provide an&#xD;
      objective and continuous assessment of physical activity during patients' daily life over&#xD;
      longer periods and may therefore reflect the true effect of the activity coaching&#xD;
      intervention on physical activity more accurately than intermittent supervised exercise tests&#xD;
      such as the six minute walk test. These efforts are complemented by a comprehensive&#xD;
      (sub)clinical and molecular characterization of HFpEF patients at baseline and after the&#xD;
      follow-up period of 12 weeks. In order to evaluate the potential effect of awareness for&#xD;
      physical activity and of surveillance, due to participants wearing a pedometer throughout the&#xD;
      study period, two intervention groups will be investigated. This will allow for the effect of&#xD;
      an individualized, app-based coaching intervention, compared to standard care in patients&#xD;
      with HFpEF, to be deciphered.&#xD;
