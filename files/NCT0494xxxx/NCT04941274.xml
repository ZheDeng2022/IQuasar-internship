      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is common in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but can also&#xD;
      occur in people who do not have HIV. KS tumors usually involve the skin, but may also involve&#xD;
      lymph nodes, lungs, bone, and gastrointestinal tract. Researchers want to see if a drug that&#xD;
      is currently used to treat a type of breast cancer can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of abemaciclib to treat KS and to see if it can shrink lesions or tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with some or all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray and/or computed tomography scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung or gastrointestinal tract exam with an endoscope (a flexible instrument to examine the&#xD;
      interior of the organ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      KS lesion assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin sample from a KS lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in 28-day cycles. Participants will take the study drug tablets by&#xD;
      mouth everyday. They will keep a medicine diary. They will get the study drug until their&#xD;
      cancer gets worse or they have unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a study visit at the beginning of each cycle. At these visits, they&#xD;
      will repeat some screening tests. They may have medical photographs taken of body surfaces.&#xD;
      They may complete questionnaires about their quality of life. They may give skin and saliva&#xD;
      samples. For skin samples, an area of skin will be numbed. A small circle of skin over an&#xD;
      area affected by KS will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits for up to 2 years after treatment ends.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric angioproliferative tumor, caused by Kaposi&#xD;
           sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, that most frequently involves the skin, but may also&#xD;
           involve lymph nodes, lungs, bone and gastrointestinal tract. It is most common in people&#xD;
           with HIV but may also occur in patients without a diagnosis of HIV. Patients with&#xD;
           HIV-associated KS have worse survival than HIV-infected patients without KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As it is a relapsing and remitting condition, patients with KS often require prolonged&#xD;
           courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy and improved approaches for refractory and recurrent&#xD;
           KS are needed to decrease morbidity among patients with KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell cycle dysregulation is one of the hallmarks of cancer and has been developed as a&#xD;
           therapeutic target in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Cell cycle is controlled&#xD;
           by several proteins, including cyclin D kinases (CDKs), cyclins and retinoblastoma&#xD;
           (Rb)-E2F signaling pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib is an orally available cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that targets&#xD;
           the CDK4 (cyclin D1) and CDK6 (cyclin D3) cell cycle pathways thereby inhibiting&#xD;
           retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation in early G1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KS is an endothelial tumor, and KSHV-infected endothelial cells serve as the best&#xD;
           current model for KS as there are no good animal models for this disease. Abemaciclib&#xD;
           was found to inhibit proliferation of KSHV-infected and uninfected human umbilical vein&#xD;
           endothelial cells (HUVEC) at doses as low as 0.1 microM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Published Phase I/II studies demonstrated that abemaciclib led to clinical responses in&#xD;
           patients with metastatic breast cancer and other tumor types, such as glioblastoma,&#xD;
           colorectal cancer, and melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib is a therapy licensed for use in metastatic breast cancer both as&#xD;
           monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies and the safety and efficacy&#xD;
           profiles of this agent are very well known. We hypothesize that abemaciclib will be&#xD;
           well-tolerated and patients with KS who have received prior therapies will derive some&#xD;
           clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in participants with both untreated&#xD;
      and previously treated Kaposi sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed Kaposi sarcoma (KS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KS requiring systemic therapy, with either no prior systemic therapy or history of at&#xD;
           least 1 prior line of systemic therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3 weeks from last chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3 weeks from last immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local radiation, surgical&#xD;
           or intralesional cytotoxic therapy to these measurable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) &lt;= 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant must be willing to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can be HIV positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants receiving other investigational agents will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I/II study assessing the safety and efficacy of abemaciclib in&#xD;
           participants with previously untreated or treated KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase I portion of the study, up to 18 KS participants treated with prior therapy&#xD;
           will be enrolled in a 3+3 dose de-escalation schema using 2 dose de-escalation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following identification of an optimal dose and schedule, an expansion phase (Phase II)&#xD;
           will be initiated. Up to 25 previously untreated or treated KS participants will be&#xD;
           enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib will be administered as an oral planned starting dose of 200 mg twice daily&#xD;
           (in the morning and evening) without regard to meals. Abemaciclib will be given&#xD;
           continuously; one cycle equals 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive therapy until optimal tumor response, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
           the participant s request to discontinue therapy, or PI decision. Participants with&#xD;
           disease progression will have the option of an additional 12 weeks of treatment, if the&#xD;
           PI feels that they are deriving clinical benefit.&#xD;

             eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of abemaciclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because CDK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, persons of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and their sexual partners must agree to use adequate pregnancy contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study treatment. Should a person become pregnant or suspect they are&#xD;
             pregnant while they or their partner is receiving study drug in this study, the&#xD;
             pregnant person should inform their treating physician immediately. Participants with&#xD;
             sexual partners of childbearing potential treated or enrolled on this protocol must&#xD;
             also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             treatment, and 4 months after completion of abemaciclib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from&#xD;
             the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required&#xD;
             between end of radiotherapy and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to CDK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong/moderate&#xD;
             inhibitors of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with serious and/or uncontrolled severe intercurrent illness that in the&#xD;
             judgement of the investigator would preclude participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease, KSHV-associated inflammatory&#xD;
             cytokine syndrome or primary effusion lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit adherence&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant persons are excluded from this study because abemaciclib is CDK inhibitor&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the nursing person with abemaciclib, breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
             if the nursing person is treated with abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment&#xD;
             does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with interstitial lung disease&#xD;
