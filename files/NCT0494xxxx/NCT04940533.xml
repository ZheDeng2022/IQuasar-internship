  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy, postpartum, and in&#xD;
      breast milk in cystic fibrosis patients receiving a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance&#xD;
      regulator (CTFR) modulator, including Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor, Ivacaftor, or Lumacaftor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advent of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) therapy has&#xD;
      significantly increased the life expectancy for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, adults with CF are more likely to have families than they have in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the overall pregnancy rate among women with CF age 18-44 is declining (mirroring&#xD;
      trends in the general population), the overall number of pregnancies is increasing due to the&#xD;
      increasing number of adults with CF. However, little is known about CFTR modulator use in&#xD;
      pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, as outlined in a recent review of CF-therapies in pregnant&#xD;
      and breastfeeding women. Presently, there is one report of an uncomplicated pregnancy during&#xD;
      ivacaftor use, and one case of a successful pregnancy in a woman who was maintained on&#xD;
      lumacaftor/ivacaftor with reported maternal and fetal drug levels. In this study, we aim to&#xD;
      study the pharmacokinetics of CFTR modulators in pregnancy as well as while breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will hopefully improve counseling while offering them for CF patients given&#xD;
      the tremendous improvements seen in non-pregnant adults.&#xD;
