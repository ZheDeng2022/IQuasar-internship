      The aim of this study is to develop a one-step diagnostic method for adrenal diseases,&#xD;
      Patients with adrenal diseases including non-functioning adrenal adenoma, adrenal Cushing's&#xD;
      syndrome, primary aldosteronism, and pheochromocytoma will be recruited. Using mass&#xD;
      spectrometry analysis based on a multisteroid panel, serum, urine, saliva, and hair samples&#xD;
      of the patients will be analyzed. The diagnostic yield of each and combination of steroids&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Adrenal diseases consist of heterogenous diseases. To differentiate various adrenal diseases,&#xD;
      multiple steps of diagnostic tests are needed. In this study, the investigators aimed to&#xD;
      develop a one-step diagnostic method to differentiate various adrenal diseases using&#xD;
      multisteroid panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 400 patients with adrenal diseases including non-functioning adenoma, adrenal Cushing's&#xD;
      syndrome, primary aldosteronism, and pheochromocytoma will be recruited. Serum, hair, saliva,&#xD;
      and urine samples of the patients will be analyzed using mass spectrometry. Each and&#xD;
      combination of multisteroid will be evaluated for diagnosing adrenal diseases.&#xD;
