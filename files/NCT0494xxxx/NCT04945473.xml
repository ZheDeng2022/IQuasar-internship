  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a technique used for bariatric surgery, with results&#xD;
      comparable to conventional surgery, in order to treat morbid obesity. It has also less risks&#xD;
      of complications, and it is not an irreversible technique. It can be repeated overtime,&#xD;
      regarding the evolution of the gastroplasty. There is little data in the literature on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of endoscopic &quot;revision&quot;. This study will assess the benefits and costs of a&#xD;
      revision during the follow-up endoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a health dilemma with an increased risk of premature death. Bariatric surgery is&#xD;
      considered to be the most effective and durable treatment for morbid obesity as compared to&#xD;
      other available options. However, only the most severe cases, namely class III or class II&#xD;
      patients with obesity-related comorbidities fit the criteria for bariatric surgical&#xD;
      interventions and are offered these options. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a&#xD;
      restrictive procedure based on the tubulization and shortening of the stomach, achieved by&#xD;
      means of multiple full-thickness sutures applied endoscopically. ESG offers the possibility&#xD;
      to obtain results (weight loss, improvement of comorbidities and quality of life) comparable&#xD;
      to conventional surgery while reducing the risk of complications. One of the major advantages&#xD;
      of this technique is that it does not make irreversible changes to gastric anatomy and&#xD;
      function and can be repeated overtime if needed placing additional sutures. ESG appearance&#xD;
      might be subject to changes overtime. In fact, depending on the sutures' integrity, the&#xD;
      gastroplasty can be regarded as tight, partially open or completely open. Very little data&#xD;
      currently exists in the literature on the effectiveness of endoscopic &quot;revision&quot; with the&#xD;
      placement of additional sutures on weight loss and its impact on co-morbidities. In order to&#xD;
      objectively assess the benefits and costs of a revision during the follow-up endoscopy&#xD;
      patients who present a TWL &lt;10% or a BMI greater than 30 at 6 months from the primary ESG,&#xD;
      will be randomized into 2 groups: a &quot;Revision&quot; group in which a revision will be performed&#xD;
      systematically in the event of suture disruption at the control EGD, and a &quot;Control&quot; group&#xD;
      which will only benefit of a control endoscopy regardless of the state of the gastroplasty.&#xD;
