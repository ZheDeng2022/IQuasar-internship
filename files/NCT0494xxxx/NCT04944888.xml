  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint blockade has made great but unsatisfied success in treating cancers. One&#xD;
      important reason is the hijacked HLA-I antigen presentation. Eliglustat could inhibit&#xD;
      glycosphingolipids synthesis and restore HLA-I antigen presentation and transform the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of tumor cells. Therefore,GSL synthetase inhibitor eliglustat monotherapy or&#xD;
      in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor may explore a new avenue for therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention in cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint blockade has led to great strides in the management of various cancers,&#xD;
      however, durable response could be seen in approximately 20% of treated patients with most&#xD;
      solid tumors and hematological malignancies. One important reason is that tumor cells often&#xD;
      escape from immune surveillance by downregulating one or multiple molecules critical in HLA-I&#xD;
      antigen presentation. As a consequence, options that could restore HLA-I antigen presentation&#xD;
      may augment immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal expression of glycosphingolipid (GSL) synthetase is a basic and specific&#xD;
      characteristic of most tumors and tumor microenvironment, such as Globo H Ceramide, which is&#xD;
      overexpressed in multiple epithelial-derived tumors. Several studies also reported that GSL&#xD;
      synthetase was overexpressed in chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Eliglustat is an orally GlcCer&#xD;
      synthase inhibitor, which is approved for treating Type-1 Gaucher disease. However, one most&#xD;
      recent study reveals that it could inhibit glycosphingolipids synthesis and restore HLA-I&#xD;
      antigen presentation, and transforming the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Therefore, GSL&#xD;
      synthetase inhibitor eliglustat monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor may explore a new avenue for therapeutic intervention in cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of GSL synthetase&#xD;
      inhibitor eliglustat monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives include assessing antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the pathological, immunological&#xD;
      or clinical predictive biomarkers for efficacy and toxicity, transformation of tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and dynamic changes of immune cells in peripheral blood.&#xD;
