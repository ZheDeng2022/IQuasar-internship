  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and&#xD;
      oleclumab in treating patients with primary pancreatic cancer that may be able to be removed&#xD;
      by surgery (resectable/borderline resectable). Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and oleclumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and oleclumab may help control the&#xD;
      disease in patients with resectable/borderline resectable primary pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimation of major pathological response (MPR) rate (=&lt; 5% viable tumor cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the safety of combining immunotherapy (durvalumab and oleclumab) with&#xD;
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore the changes in various immune parameters, including PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in&#xD;
      the tumor, during treatment and correlate with efficacy outcomes with the goal of biomarker&#xD;
      discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Radiographic response rate and CA19-9 response to neoadjuvant therapy. III. Estimate the&#xD;
      relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in enrolled subjects who undergo&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate the frequency of intraoperative and postoperative complications in these&#xD;
      patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Impact of adjuvant durvalumab/oleclumab +/- gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel on circulating&#xD;
      tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) kinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, oleclumab IV over 1&#xD;
      hour, nab-paclitaxel IV, and gemcitabine IV over 1 hour over 30-40 minutes on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-6 cycles. Within 4-8 weeks after completion of last&#xD;
      cycle of treatment, patients undergo surgical resection. After surgical resection, patient&#xD;
      may receive adjuvant therapy with durvalumab and oleclumab, durvalumab, oleclumab,&#xD;
      gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel, other chemotherapy, or observation only at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 28 days and then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;
