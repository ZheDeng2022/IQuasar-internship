  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Explore the use of microcurrent therapy for fibromyalgia patients and evaluate its effect on&#xD;
      generalized pain and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if microcurrent therapy be effectively self-administered by the patient as an&#xD;
      adjunct to medical pain management.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is not intended to be definitive and should be considered an exploratory&#xD;
      randomized trial to determine conditions for which microcurrent is more effective. Thus,&#xD;
      extensive subgroup analyses will be performed so that definitive trials can be developed.&#xD;
      This is a double-blind study where subjects will not know if they are receiving microcurrent&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0, Screening visit (may occur during the patient's regular health visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain and document signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review past medical history to verify inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proper hydration is essential before any microcurrent therapy. Hydration is ensured by&#xD;
           the patient drinking at least 8 ounces of water 1 hour before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record onset and chronicity of fibromyalgia syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record any medicines that the subject is taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect demographic information to include age, weight (pounds), height (inches), race,&#xD;
           ethnicity, and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record any standard treatment subject is receiving. Standard treatment may include, but&#xD;
           is not limited to one or more of the following: medications, physical therapy,&#xD;
           acupuncture, pain management clinic, dry needling, occupational therapy, osteopathic&#xD;
           manipulative treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized using complete block design with repeated measure&#xD;
      into one of two research-related treatment groups: Group 1 (microcurrent) and Group 2&#xD;
      (placebo microcurrent)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (may be same day as screening):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete the following pre-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-treatment measurement of active range of motion of both wrists, knees, trunk, neck,&#xD;
           and head with the Myovision 3G Wireless System (Myovision, Seattle, WA) ¹ .&#xD;
&#xD;
           --*(Myovision will be performed for some subjects based off the availability of Myvision&#xD;
           trained staff)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proper hydration is essential before any microcurrent therapy. Hydration is ensured by&#xD;
           the patient drinking at least 8 ounces of water 1 hour before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research participant will receive microcurrent according to their randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment measurement of active range of motion of both wrists, knees, trunk, neck,&#xD;
           and head with the Myovision 3G Wireless System (Myovision, Seattle, WA) ¹ .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research participant will be loaned a microcurrent box to bring home with them for this&#xD;
           study. They will be instructed to bring the microcurrent box back. A hand-receipt will&#xD;
           be signed by the patient accepting responsibility for device replacement if they fail to&#xD;
           return or break it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2-7 (at home microcurrent application):&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The research participant will self-administer the microcurrent according to their&#xD;
      randomization group daily.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQR assesses three domains (function, overall impact and symptoms) from which a total score of pain impact is derived. FMS patients have a mean (SD) total score of 56.6 (19.9) and healthy patients have a mean (SD) total score of 12.1 (11.6). FMS patients' means for function, overall impact and symptoms domains are 15.6, 11.0, and 30.0 respectively. Higher total scores are indicative of greater dysfunction or symptom severity. While total scores are slightly negatively skewed favoring severe cases, scores can be assessed with parametric methods.</description>
