  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing of the world's population is accelerating. Despite the health challenges they face,&#xD;
      older people should not be stereotyped as frail and dependent. Healthy ageing is possible if&#xD;
      adequate care is provided and effective intervention is delivered for healthy living. Common&#xD;
      oral diseases (dental caries and periodontal diseases) are determined to a great extent by&#xD;
      health behaviours (diet and oral hygiene) and are controllable through effective&#xD;
      interventions. Hence, this study aims to test the theoretical models for health promotion,&#xD;
      develop theory-derived intervention, and evaluate its effectiveness in improving oral health&#xD;
      of older adults. The study hypothesis is that theory-derived intervention is more effective&#xD;
      than conventional health education in eliciting positive behaviours and controlling oral&#xD;
      diseases in older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study targets older adults and aims to (i) test the explanatory power of the dominant&#xD;
      theoretical models/ frameworks, (ii) develop theory-derived intervention, and (iii) evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the theory-derived intervention. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      theoretical-derived intervention is more effective than conventional health education in&#xD;
      improving oral health behaviours and preventing oral diseases among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size needed for this study was calculated by using the software G*Power version&#xD;
      3.1.9.2 (Franz Faul, University of Kiel, Germany). The primary outcomes are number of carious&#xD;
      surfaces and number of sites with bleeding on probing or periodontal pockets. Since both&#xD;
      outcomes are continuous variables, the sample size calculation was based on independent&#xD;
      t-tests for comparing means of two independent groups. An effect size of 0.3 is considered&#xD;
      clinically significant. Based on a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 176&#xD;
      subjects per group are needed. Allowing for a 20% attrition rate, 220 participants will need&#xD;
      to be recruited into each group, giving a total sample size of 440.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be required to complete a detailed questionnaire at the initial visit&#xD;
      through face-to-face interviews. Information on socio-demographic background (gender, age,&#xD;
      education level, past occupation, and type of housing) and oral health behaviours (diet,&#xD;
      toothbrushing and dental flossing) will be collected. The questionnaire will also include the&#xD;
      scales for three dominant theoretical models, namely, Health Belief Model (HBM), Theory of&#xD;
      planned behaviour (TPB) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical model that best explains the health behaviours will be selected for designing&#xD;
      oral health intervention. Intervention materials and activities will be carefully designed to&#xD;
      address all the constructs/ domains of the selected theoretical model(s). Relevant medical&#xD;
      literatures will be referred to. The needs, interest, and health literary of the target group&#xD;
      (i.e. older adults of varied social and educational backgrounds) will be taken into full&#xD;
      consideration. The intervention will be tested in a small group of 15-20 older people to&#xD;
      ensure its relevance, practicality, and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups, stratified by gender and education&#xD;
      level. Allocation concealment will be ensured by using sealed opaque envelopes. The two&#xD;
      groups will receive conventional health education and theory-derived intervention,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-intervention, each participant will a) undergo an&#xD;
      oral examination (dental checkup) by a trained dentist, who will be calibrated against an&#xD;
      experienced oral epidemiologist and blinded to the group allocation, and b) complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire (detailed questionnaire at baseline and short questionnaire for follow-ups).&#xD;
      Chi-square tests will be used for comparing proportions. Parametric or non-parametric methods&#xD;
      will be adopted for comparing means. ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) and multiple regressions&#xD;
      will be performed to evaluate the effects of various factors on the outcomes.&#xD;
