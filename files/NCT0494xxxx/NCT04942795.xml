  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke from&#xD;
      large vessel occlusion compared to standard medical therapy alone has been demonstrated by&#xD;
      several randomized clinical trials and become the standard of care for these patients. A&#xD;
      direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) for the endovascular treatment of stroke using&#xD;
      a large-bore catheter has been reported to be an effective method of achieving MT. Recent&#xD;
      studies reported that ADAPT is as efficient and safe as stent retrievers, with a similar&#xD;
      successful recanalization rate, but may have better functional outcomes, fewer procedure&#xD;
      related-adverse events, and a tendency for faster revascularization compared to the&#xD;
      stent-retriever thrombectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, navigation of a large-bore aspiration catheter is not always possible due to&#xD;
      unsuccessful passage of the ophthalmic artery origin (&quot;ledge effect&quot;) or tortuous vascular&#xD;
      anatomy. The coaxial technique comprises guiding the large-bore catheter with a smaller inner&#xD;
      catheter and can facilitate distal access. However, there is a gap between the inner catheter&#xD;
      and the distal tip of the large-bore outer catheter that creates a risk of damaging the&#xD;
      vessel wall and causing dissection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Even with this coaxial&#xD;
      technique, it is not always possible to reach the clot site with the large-bore catheter. To&#xD;
      decrease the gap between the two catheters, several authors have used, in place of the inner&#xD;
      microcatheter, a compliant balloon catheter positioned and inflated at the distal tip of the&#xD;
      large-bore catheter. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      ADAPT assisted by a compliant balloon (ADAPT-AB) when ADAPT using the coaxial technique fails&#xD;
      to reach the clot site.&#xD;
