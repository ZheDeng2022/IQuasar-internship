  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of serious neurodevelopmental disorders. Intestinal&#xD;
      microbial disturbance is common in children with ASD, and about 40% of ASD children suffer&#xD;
      from gastrointestinal dysfunction. A great deal of evidence shows that intestinal microbes&#xD;
      can influence the brain to play its role through &quot;brain-intestinal-microbiota axis&quot;. Fecal&#xD;
      microbial biota transplantation (FMT) is the most direct way to change the intestinal flora&#xD;
      rapidly. We intend to study the difference of intestinal flora structure and metabolism&#xD;
      between ASD children and control children at the level of phylum, genus and species; To&#xD;
      explore the role of fecal bacteria transplantation in improving core symptoms and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction of children in autism spectrum disorder; To study the potential&#xD;
      etiological mechanism of autism spectrum disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 ASD children and 50 healthy children who are 3 to 18 years of age will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial. The fecal donors who are 50 healthy children, will be extensively screened for&#xD;
      infectious diseases prior to providing stool for the transplant. After being informed about&#xD;
      the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo&#xD;
      screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. 50 ASD children who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility requirements will receive a fecal microbiota transplantation following a 2-week&#xD;
      treatment with Vancomycin. Fecal bacteria transplantation will be achieved through&#xD;
      nasogastric tube, nasojejunal tube, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy or enema. The&#xD;
      amount of fecal bacterial liquid transplantation for children is 5ml/kg each time. Microbiota&#xD;
      analysis will also be performed on both the donor and recipient stool sample prior to&#xD;
      transplantation, and on the recipient sample at 1 month, 3 month and 6 months post&#xD;
      transplantation. We evaluate the difference of intestinal flora structure and metabolism&#xD;
      between ASD children and control children at the level of phylum, genus and species, and&#xD;
      explore the role of fecal bacteria transplantation in improving core symptoms and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction of children in autism spectrum disorder.&#xD;

    <description>The ADOS consists of a series of structured and semi-structured tasks that involve social interaction between the examiner and the person under assessment. The examiner observes and identifies segments of the subject's behavior and assigns these to predetermined observational categories. Categorized observations are subsequently combined to produce quantitative scores for analysis and diagnostic classification of ASD. Children at or above predetermined cutoff lines are considered to be positive for ASD. The assessment will be conducted before and after each intervention, namely baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>ABC is a scale used for nonadaptive behaviors created to screen and indicate the probability of a diagnosis of autism. The questionnaire including 57 items related to five areas: sensorial, relational, use of body and objects, and social skills. Scale score&gt; 67 strongly suggests the presence of autism. The assessment will be conducted before and after each intervention, namely baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) in ASD children</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>CARS assesses the child on a scale from 1 to 4 in each of 15 dimensions or symptoms. A total score of at least 30 strongly suggests the presence of autism. Children with score between 30 and 36 have mild-to-moderate autism while those with score between 37 and 60 have severe autism. The assessment will be conducted before and after each intervention, namely baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) in ASD children</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS is a 65-item rating scale with standardized measure of the core symptoms of autism. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The score of each individual item is summed to create a total raw score. A total scores results are as follows:&#xD;
0-62: Within normal limits 63-79: Mild range of impairment 80-108: Moderate range of impairment 109-149: Severe range of impairment. The assessment will be conducted before and after each intervention, namely baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) in ASD children</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>ASD symptoms will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), which comprise four subscales to measure child speech/language/communication, sociability, sensory/cognitive awareness, and health/physical/behavior. The scale has 77 items that are scored by parents. The health/physical/behavior subscale is rated using a 0 (not a problem)-to-3 (serious problem) point scale, whereas the other three subscales are rated using a 0 (not true)-to-2 (very true) point scale. Higher scores represent more ASD symptoms. The assessment will be conducted before and after each intervention, namely baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation.</description>

    <description>Assessment will be conducted for the Rome IV diagnoses of cyclic vomiting, functional vomiting, functional dyspepsia, and/or functional constipation. The presence or absence of meeting criteria for the Rome IV diagnoses will be coded as a binary variable (true/false) to represent resolution of symptoms. The assessment will be conducted before and after each intervention, namely baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation.</description>

    <description>Fecal samples from ASD and healthy children were collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks , 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 14 weeks, and 1 month, 3 month, 6 months post transplantation.The composition of the gut microbe was evaluated by sequencing faecal metagenome. We evaluate the differences in the structure of the flora and its metabolism between the two at the phylum, genus and species levels of the intestinal flora and control children, and to develop a model for predicting the structure of the flora.</description>
