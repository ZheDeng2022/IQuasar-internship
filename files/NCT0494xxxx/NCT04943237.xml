  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ankylosing spondylitis were divided into 2 groups as anti-TNF and conventional&#xD;
      therapy according to the treatments they were using for the last 5 years. Nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies in the upper and lower extremities of the patients were compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demyelinating lesions in central nervous system after anti-TNF agents were reported&#xD;
      previously. There are limited studies investigating the effects of anti-TNF treatments on the&#xD;
      peripheral nervous system. The aim of this study is to investigate whether peripheral nerves&#xD;
      are affected due to long-term use of anti-TNF agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis who received conventional or anti-TNF&#xD;
      therapy for five years at Istanbul Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Training and Research&#xD;
      Hospital were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups as&#xD;
      conventional group and anti-TNF group according to the treatment they received. All patients&#xD;
      were evaluated in a single section. Sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and Bath&#xD;
      Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis&#xD;
      Functionality Index (BASFI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) scores&#xD;
      were recorded. Median-ulnar motor and sensory conduction studies and tibial-peroneal motor&#xD;
      and sural nerve sensory conduction studies were performed in both upper extremities of all&#xD;
      patients. Median, ulnar, and tibial nerve F-response studies were also performed.&#xD;
