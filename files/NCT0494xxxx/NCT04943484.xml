  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iGreenGO Study aims to investigate whether the intraoperative application of NIR/ICG&#xD;
      technology is associated with a change in the surgical conduct (CSC) during curative-intent&#xD;
      gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy in a cohort of Western patients affected by AGC. The&#xD;
      preoperative clinical variables potentially associated with CSC will be also investigated&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Near infra-red/ indocyanine green imaging fluorescence (NIR/ICG) technology is showing&#xD;
      promising results in several fields of surgical oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical value of NIR/ICG (near infrared range/indocyanine green) technology in surgical&#xD;
      treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is not clearly established and data regarding&#xD;
      whether its application is associated with a change of the intraoperative surgical conduct&#xD;
      are lacking in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the &quot;iGreenGO (indocyanine Green Gastric Observation) Study&quot; protocol: an&#xD;
      international, prospective, multicentre, study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will be a cohort of western patients who will undergo preoperative upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy at the most 20 hours before surgery (intraoperative endoscopic&#xD;
      injection before starting surgical dissection is also allowed) with submucosal peritumoral&#xD;
      ICG injection and curative-intent gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for locally AGC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the incidence of &quot;change of the surgical conduct&quot; (CSC) at the&#xD;
      moment of intraoperative NIR/ICG technology activation after a D2 lymphadenectomy performed&#xD;
      &quot;with the naked eye&quot;. Secondary endpoints will be the preoperative clinical variables&#xD;
      potentially associated with CSC, the pattern of abdominal fluorescence distribution according&#xD;
      to tumor and patient characteristics, the number of additional lymph nodes retrieved using&#xD;
      NIR/ICG technology, the incidence of stage migration due to NIR/ICG application, 90-day&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality The iGreenGO Study will be the first Western study to investigate the&#xD;
      clinical role of NIR/ICG technology for surgical treatment of AGC in a large cohort of&#xD;
      western patients. Results from the present study could provide novel information about which&#xD;
      help NIR/ICG technology can supply to surgeons during lymphadenectomy for AGC and the&#xD;
      patterns of ICG abdominal fluorescence distribution according to tumor and patient&#xD;
      characteristics, which are unanswered questions at present time.&#xD;

Subsequently, surgery is performed &quot;with the naked eye&quot;.&#xD;
At the end, a visualization of the OF is performed using NIR/ICG technology to verify whether residual lymph nodes in each D2 nodal station exist. CSC is defined as the occurring of the following situation: in case of persistence of nodal fluorescence in D2 nodal stations, the completion of the dissection of the residual nodal fluorescent structures.</description>
