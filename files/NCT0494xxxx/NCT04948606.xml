  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the persistence to therapy in&#xD;
      participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) treated with diroximel fumarate&#xD;
      (DRF) in routine clinical practice. The secondary objectives of the study are to assess&#xD;
      short-term persistence to treatment; to assess long-term persistence on treatment; to assess&#xD;
      the effect of DRF on relapses; to assess the impact of DRF on cognition; to assess the impact&#xD;
      of DRF on participant reported outcomes (PROs); to assess the impact of DRF on disability; to&#xD;
      assess treatment satisfaction with DRF; to explore the real-world safety profile of DRF&#xD;
      (i.e., gastrointestinal [GI] tolerability, lymphocyte dynamics, adverse events [AEs] leading&#xD;
      to discontinuation, and serious adverse events [SAEs].&#xD;

    <measure>Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) with DRF</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>For ARR at 1 year, the total number of days on study will be defined as the number of days since date of first dose to 1 year (365 days) if participant stay on DRF treatment for longer than 1 year, or the date of first dose to the date of DRF discontinuation if participant die or withdraw from the study prior to 1 year. For ARR at 2 years, the total number of days on study is defined as the number of days since the date of first dose to the date of DRF discontinuation. The relapse rate will be calculated as the total number of relapses experienced divided by the total number of days on DRF treatment, and the ratio multiplied by 365.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Processing Speed Test (CPST) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Change in CPST will be assessed using the Konectom application. Cognitive function will be evaluated based on elements of attention, psychomotor speed, visual processing and working memory. Cognitive function is assessed by having the participant pair abstract symbols with specific numbers using a key as a guide. Higher number of correct responses indicates better cognition</description>

    <measure>Change in Score for Each Domain of Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro- QoLâ„¢) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Neuro-QoL uses a T score which has a mean of 50 and SD of 10, based on the norming sample used. All Neuro-QOL banks and scales are scored such that a high score reflects more of what is being measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disability, as Measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]), with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM Version 1.4 is comprised of 14 questions that provide scores on four scales: effectiveness (3 items), side effects (5 items), convenience (3 items) and global satisfaction (3 items). The scale scores are transformed and range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Gastrointestinal (GI) Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 32</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Month 32</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>
