  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers of the liver, pancreas and gall bladder can partially or fully block the bile duct&#xD;
      leading to jaundice. Where these tumours are inoperable, maintaining adequate bile duct&#xD;
      drainage is an important factor in survival, both as jaundice itself can ultimately be fatal&#xD;
      and because and because it can prevent the administration of chemotherapy. The current&#xD;
      standard care is the placement of a stent and possible manual 'trawling' in an attempt to&#xD;
      clear the blockage. But these stents often become blocked by tumour ingrowth requiring&#xD;
      reintervention. However it may not be safe to do so at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraductal radiofrequency ablation (IDRFA) uses heat energy both to 'necrose' the tumour&#xD;
      tissue in attempt to slow ingrowth in the channels before inserting stents and to clear&#xD;
      blocked stents. There is some evidence that this increases the length of time for the stents&#xD;
      to become blocked or with secondary benefits to quality of life and survival however long&#xD;
      term data from within the NHS setting is lacking. A full trial is not currently feasible&#xD;
      therefore a pilot study is to be conducted to help inform the design of a full trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will randomise patients attending with malignant biliary obstruction in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive either intraductal radiofrequency a. Participants will be recruited through&#xD;
      the standard clinical pathway (i.e it will be offered to all potentially eligible patients)&#xD;
      over a period of 12 months. Participants will be monitored for a period of up to 12 months&#xD;
      for survival, stent blockage, symptoms, resource use, quality of life and adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted between Royal Bournemouth Hospital and The Christie, both cancer&#xD;
      care centres experienced in the management of these conditions, stent placement and&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will follow a multicentre randomised controlled trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by the standard clinical pathway. Patients with these cancers will&#xD;
      be under the care of the oncology team, this may be a new referral (fast-track cancer) or&#xD;
      ongoing care. If they are symptomatic of potential biliary obstruction (jaundiced) they will&#xD;
      undergo an ultrasound and/or CT scan to determine the cause. In the case of fast-track&#xD;
      referrals a biopsy will be taken where possible to confirm diagnosis. If these investigations&#xD;
      confirm biliary obstruction the case will be referred to the upper gastrointestinal cancer&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team for review. In the case of newly diagnosed patients, if the tumour is&#xD;
      resectable and the patient is fit for surgery then the patient will be referred to the&#xD;
      appropriate surgical team. In newly diagnosed patients the patient may also be referred to&#xD;
      the medical oncology team for consideration for chemotherapy or other systemic treatment&#xD;
      however this will generally occur after the procedure being studied as such cases are&#xD;
      generally 'emergencies' with reliving the obstruction being the most important prognostic&#xD;
      factor in the short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients unsuitable or unwilling for surgery will then be reviewed by the interventional&#xD;
      radiology/endoscopy team, either in clinic as an outpatient or on the ward as an inpatient&#xD;
      depending on the nature of their case. If as an inpatient this is often performed in&#xD;
      conjunction with the oncology team. Treatment options will be discussed with the patient&#xD;
      including biliary stenting and at this point the trial will be introduced. The patient will&#xD;
      be provided with written information and given the opportunity to ask any questions they may&#xD;
      have about the trial. If the original CT imaging does not provide a clear indication of the&#xD;
      location of the obstruction the patient will also be referred for magnetic resonance&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once given sufficient time to consider the study the patient will be reviewed again to make a&#xD;
      decision on the course of treatment they would like to take and at this point if willing&#xD;
      written informed consent will be taken. The duration of this period will be determined by the&#xD;
      nature of the case however adequate time will be given. The results from the previous work-up&#xD;
      and any other relevant medical history will be reviewed alongside a clinical assessment a by&#xD;
      the investigator to confirm eligibility. This will be entered onto the eCRF prior to&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has been confirmed as eligible and entered into the trial the procedure will&#xD;
      be arranged. If the participant is suitable for stenting but not eligible for the trial this&#xD;
      will be performed outside the trial. Prior to the procedure blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      for Full Blood Count ,liver profile, renal profile and clotting analyses. The participant&#xD;
      will also complete two baseline quality of life questionnaires and baseline symptom scores&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then undergo intraductal radiofrequency ablation and biliary stenting. In&#xD;
      accordance with local practice, at Bournemouth the approach used will be determined by the&#xD;
      nature of the case, where the obstruction is below the cystic duct and the patient is&#xD;
      suitable for general anaesthetic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography will be used.&#xD;
      Where the obstruction is above the cystic duct or at the hilium, the participant has altered&#xD;
      gastrointestinal anatomy or the participant is unsuitable for general anaesthetic,&#xD;
      percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography will be used. At the Christie all procedures will&#xD;
      use the latter approach. The procedure used will be the same for primary biliary obstruction&#xD;
      and biliary stent occlusion. The participant will be discharged once deemed medically fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be asked to attend 2 follow-up visits, at one week and 1 month following&#xD;
      the procedure. At this visit they will undergo a clinical review of their symptoms and any&#xD;
      complications from the procedure. A blood sample will be collected and they will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the quality of life questionnaires again. Participants will also be asked these&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires at home at 2,3, 6 and 12 months post procedure alongside an&#xD;
      additional short questionnaire evaluating their symptoms and healthcare use. After the 1&#xD;
      month visit they be followed up as per standard care by the oncology team and any relevant&#xD;
      information will be collected for the study. The participant will be monitored for stent&#xD;
      occlusion and any relevant clinical findings recorded if this is suspected. This will be&#xD;
      confirmed by at least 1 investigation in accordance with standard practice. The participant&#xD;
      may be referred for further stenting which will be recorded in the patients eCRF. At this&#xD;
      point trial follow up (questionnaires and recording of routine care visits) will terminate&#xD;
      however the patient will continue to monitored for survival. Otherwise patients will undergo&#xD;
      a CT scan at 12 months post procedure to evaluate stent patency and monitored until death.&#xD;

The power of the generator should be set at either 7 or 10 W depending on the electrode used per manufacturer instructions. An ablation should then be applied at a temperature of 70 to 80â„ƒ for 2 minutes.
