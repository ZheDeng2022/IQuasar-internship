  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pathology has a high prevalence in the field of musculoskeletal diagnoses, as well&#xD;
      as being a common etiology in cases of disability. Passive and active-assisted kinesitherapy&#xD;
      are used in the physiotherapy protocol. These techniques sometimes lead to feedback of fear&#xD;
      and increased sensation of pain on the part of the patient that can slow or hinder the&#xD;
      optimal recovery. A randomized clinical trial is intended to demonstrate that techniques for&#xD;
      myofascial release of muscles important in the biomechanics of the shoulder, it is more&#xD;
      effective than kinesitherapy in improving myofascial and also by eliminating the&#xD;
      aforementioned unwanted effects and, therefore, improving the recovery of these processes.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of myofascial therapy and kinesitherapy&#xD;
      in improving function in shoulder pathology with prolonged immobilization. Design&#xD;
      Prospective, single-blind randomized controlled trial. Setting Inpatient department of a&#xD;
      secondary university hospital. Participants Shoulder pain patients (N=44) were consecutively&#xD;
      recruited and randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Interventions Patients&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to a Control Group, to which conventional kinesitherapy was applied,&#xD;
      or to the intervention group to which a Myofascial therapy protocol was applied. Both groups&#xD;
      completed a therapeutic exercise program based on specific mobilization and strengthening&#xD;
      exercises. Main Outcome Measures The QuickDash questionnaire was the primary outcome, visual&#xD;
      analog scale and the passive range of motion of the shoulder joint, grades were the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. The outcomes were evaluated at baseline (T0) and at 4 (T2),&#xD;

    <description>The trial group will also be referred by the rehabilitating doctor to the physiotherapy room, these patients will be treated by two physiotherapists with training in myofascial release therapy with which they will carry out a treatment protocol that will consist of myofascial release of the shoulder blade angle, subscapularis and global pectoral technique as well as superficial myofascial release of said musculature with a during 12-15 minutes, in addition to a 30-minute session of active kinesitherapy with exercises and mechanotherapy. Same as the control group.&#xD;
These mobilizations are carried out in the absence of pain, although the difference between joint tension or stretching and pain is explained to the patient.</description>

    <description>This group will be treated in a protocolized way with techniques such as passive kinesitherapy, active-assisted and active kinesitherapy to win mobility.&#xD;
They consist of mobilizing the affected arm in the movements of flexion (upward), separation (towards the outer side) and rotation, these lateral decubitus (bring the hand to the nape of the neck) and internal (bring the hand to the lower back) trying to win joint amplitude.&#xD;
These mobilizations are performed in the absence of pain, although the difference between joint tension or stretching and pain will be explained to the patient. The treatment will be carried out as usual with a duration of about 12-15 minutes of mobilization and about 30 minutes of active kinesitherapy with exercises and mechanotherapy, these consist of active shoulder mobility exercises. Emphasis will be placed on working with the pain threshold so as not to cause damage or negative nociceptive reactions.</description>
