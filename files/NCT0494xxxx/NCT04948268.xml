  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility trial of a personalized 8-week text messaging intervention aimed at&#xD;
      young adults (ages 18-25) with depression and anxiety who are not interested in -- or&#xD;
      experience barriers to -- receiving traditional face-to-face psychological treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of a pilot test of (1) an 8-week adaptive (personalized) messaging&#xD;
      intervention relative to (2) a static digital mental health intervention, or (3) an active&#xD;
      control which will send weekly psychoeducation information by way of URLs. The adaptive&#xD;
      intervention will uses machine learning to tailor SMS messages to an individual's needs and&#xD;
      preferences, and URL links to provide access to psychoeducational content to contextualize&#xD;
      messages, when the length of that content exceeds the limitations of messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goals of the project are to conduct a feasibility trial using a sequential&#xD;
      multiple assignment randomized treatment (SMART) design, which will evaluate (a) the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an adaptive, personalized messaging intervention in reducing engagement&#xD;
      relative to a static version; and (b) whether human coaching results in greater symptom&#xD;
      reduction and engagement, relative an unguided implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to test the feasibility of conducting a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of digital mental health intervention (DMHI) for non-treatment seeking young&#xD;
      adults with symptoms of depression or anxiety, comparing an 8-week adaptive (personalized)&#xD;
      messaging intervention, an 8-week static digital mental health intervention, or an active&#xD;
      control which will deliver psychoeducational content via clickable URLs. The adaptive&#xD;
      intervention will be powered by reinforcement learning to deliver tailored SMS messages based&#xD;
      on user profiles and the ways in which a user interacts with the intervention system, along&#xD;
      with links to longer psychoeducational content. The static intervention arm will not&#xD;
      personalize the messages, but will still be an active treatment. The active control condition&#xD;
      will receive the adaptive treatment after an 8-week waiting period. This study will examine&#xD;
      the adaptive intervention's ability to engage users and effectiveness in decreasing&#xD;
      psychological distress relative to a static intervention. Participants who become disengaged&#xD;
      (5 continuous days of not clicking on content URL links or message ratings, or completing&#xD;
      symptom assessments) from the adaptive or static intervention arms at any point in the first&#xD;
      two weeks of treatment will be randomized to receive low-intensity human coaching or continue&#xD;
      without coaching for the remainder of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment till take place via Mental Health America's (MHA) website. MHA is a large mental&#xD;
      health advocacy organization that hosts online screeners and has large number of visitors the&#xD;
      majority of whom meet clinical cutoffs for depressive or anxiety disorder symptoms. This&#xD;
      study will enroll individuals who have completed a depression or anxiety disorder screener on&#xD;
      MHA's website, and meet clinical cut-offs on the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 (min. score of 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial randomization will be generated in permuted blocks of 5 using a computer program. To&#xD;
      prevent allocation bias, randomization will be conducted by the biostatistician, who will not&#xD;
      inform the study team of the treatment arms until the baseline assessment has been completed&#xD;
      and the patient has been enrolled. Second randomization of disengaged participants will occur&#xD;
      as disengagement is detected during the first two weeks. Half (50%) of disengaged individuals&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive additional human coaching throughout the remainder of the study&#xD;
      while remaining in either the adaptive or static treatment arms. The disengaged participants&#xD;
      not randomized to receive additional human coaching will continue to receive either the&#xD;
      static or adaptive automated treatment the participants were randomized to initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coaching will consist providing users with support and accountability via positive&#xD;
      reinforcement, goal and expectation setting, and monitoring. Coaching outreach will focus on&#xD;
      adherence to the treatment but will not provide treatment advice. Coaches will provide a&#xD;
      brief (15-minute phone call or equivalent depending on the medium) engagement session over&#xD;
      the phone, SMS, or email, depending user preference. Thereafter, coaches will check in with&#xD;
      participants via messaging, phone call, or email, twice per week and respond to patient&#xD;
      texts. Additional outreach will be made available to participants who continue demonstrate&#xD;
      low engagement (defined as &lt;50% response to ratings or URL psychoeducational content).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed using self-report measures at baseline, weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and&#xD;
      16 weeks (note: week 1 assessment comprises a usability questionnaire and a measure of&#xD;
      subjective engagement). The primary outcomes are feasibility markers, including meeting&#xD;
      recruitment goals (100 participants), obtaining 80% of follow-up self-report data, and having&#xD;
      an overall study dropout rate of &lt;30%.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study uses a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design. The first level of randomization is to one of the three treatment conditions: self-guided static intervention, self-guided adaptive intervention, or active control. The second level of randomization occurs during the first two weeks of intervention. Participants who meet criteria for disengagement from either the static or adaptive intervention (defined as 5 days with no engagement) are then randomized to receive coaching or continue as self-guided. This will provide the investigators with preliminary information on the need for and value of coaching. Participants will receive the assigned intervention from baseline to week 8, followed by an 8 week follow-up period</intervention_model_description>
