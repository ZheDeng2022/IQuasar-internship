  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will test the hypothesis that objective social isolation and loneliness&#xD;
      are linked to neurobehavioral mechanisms involved in social perception and motivation in&#xD;
      individuals with and without serious mental illness. Moreover, it will investigate the&#xD;
      specific dynamic interactions among these experiences in daily life and how they, and their&#xD;
      neurobehavioral predictors, are linked to day-to-day functioning. The findings of this&#xD;
      project could provide novel targets for therapeutics aimed at improving functioning and&#xD;
      overall quality of life in individuals with serious mental illnesses, as well as quantitative&#xD;
      phenotypes for use in early detection efforts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some of the most debilitating and harmful aspects of serious mental illnesses (SMI) are the&#xD;
      1) social isolation (low numbers of social contacts) and 2) the subjective experiences of&#xD;
      social disconnection (loneliness) that frequently accompany these conditions. Social&#xD;
      isolation and loneliness greatly impact day-to-day functioning and are associated with poor&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health and early mortality in SMI, and currently there are no available&#xD;
      treatments that can prevent or reverse these devastating consequences of having these&#xD;
      illnesses. This may be in part because the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      social isolation and loneliness in SMI, and how they impact functioning and health outcomes,&#xD;
      are poorly understood. However, recent clues from studies employing advanced neuroimaging and&#xD;
      digital assessments have formed the basis of a novel approach to investigating such&#xD;
      mechanisms, outlined in this proposal. Prior work has indicated that objective isolation and&#xD;
      loneliness are correlated but also somewhat independent. Recent neuroimaging findings support&#xD;
      this model, revealing that social isolation and loneliness have both shared and distinct&#xD;
      neural correlates. However, it is also clear that these are not static phenomena;&#xD;
      smartphone-based assessments have revealed transient, dynamic changes in social isolation and&#xD;
      loneliness. Individual differences in the anticipation of rejection are associated with&#xD;
      momentary experiences of loneliness, greater avoidance and subsequent increases in social&#xD;
      isolation. Thus, in the current application, we propose to comprehensively measure both the&#xD;
      relatively stable neural and behavioral predictors of social isolation and loneliness, as&#xD;
      well as the moment-to-moment changes in these experiences, in 60 individuals with SMI and 60&#xD;
      control subjects. In Aim 1 of the proposed project, we will show that the higher levels of&#xD;
      social isolation and loneliness in SMI are linked to shared and distinct neural responses to&#xD;
      social stimuli, with deficient responses of social perception-related circuitry (medial&#xD;
      temporal lobe regions) linked to social isolation, and deficient responses of reward-related&#xD;
      circuitry (basal ganglia regions) linked to loneliness. In Aim 2, we will measure transient&#xD;
      changes in social isolation and loneliness with smartphone assessments using a longitudinal&#xD;
      &quot;burst&quot; design. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will determine how the quantitative markers of social&#xD;
      isolation and loneliness identified in Aims 1 and 2 predict indices of real-world&#xD;
      functioning, measuring the stability of these associations over time. Thus, in this project,&#xD;
      we will show that fundamental neural and behavioral processes drive momentary variation in&#xD;
      the experience of social isolation and loneliness, and directly impact functioning in SMI. In&#xD;
      follow-up work, these findings can be used as objective targets in studies of novel&#xD;
      interventions which aim to address these major causes of disability.&#xD;
