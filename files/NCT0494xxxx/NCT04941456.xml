  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of the Passy-Muir Valve improves&#xD;
      endurance for patients in the Long Term Acute Care setting as measured with the Six- Minute&#xD;
      Walk Test.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Passy-Muir Valve (PMV) is a one-way valve that blocks air flow from exhalation in patients&#xD;
      with a tracheostomy, and redirects it through to the upper airway to enable functional use of&#xD;
      the glottis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, PMVs are used to assist patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation to&#xD;
      communicate more effectively after tracheostomy. Devices are available that can be used&#xD;
      in-line with the ventilator, as well as after ventilator liberation with a tracheostomy&#xD;
      collar. PMVs provide patients with the ability to communicate, swallow, and improve&#xD;
      diaphragmatic strength, which lengthens the periods of time that patients remain free from&#xD;
      ventilator assistance, which ultimately leads to decannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the PMV during physical therapy helps restore the pressure support in the trunk,&#xD;
      allowing for natural increases in intra-thoracic pressure (ITP) and intra-abdominal pressures&#xD;
      (IAP) in response to increased postural demands. With an open tracheostomy tube and&#xD;
      therefore, an open system, thoracic pressures cannot be increased or sustained as airflow&#xD;
      passes through the tracheostomy tube and bypasses the upper airway. This difficulty would be&#xD;
      observed when a patient needs to crawl, sit, push, or stand up. The typical means of gross&#xD;
      motor movement for mobility is to engage the glottis (vocal cords) to restrict the expiratory&#xD;
      lung volume in order to stabilize the chest and upper body. Placing a PMV on the tracheostomy&#xD;
      tube closes the system and restores a patient's ability to use the upper airway to control&#xD;
      expiratory flow and improve ITP and IAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a commonly used test for the objective assessment of&#xD;
      functional exercise capacity for management of patients with moderate to severe pulmonary&#xD;
      disease. The patient is asked to walk as far as possible along a 30 meter minimally&#xD;
      trafficked corridor for a period of six minutes. The 6MWT is a safe test with rare&#xD;
      complications, the most common adverse event is oxygen desaturation below 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consist of inpatients with tracheostomy who can tolerate use of Passy-Muir&#xD;
      Valve; participants will be approached and consented into the study within 72 hours of being&#xD;
      deemed medically appropriate for PMV use by medical staff. The 6MWT will be administered each&#xD;
      session to assess ambulation distance, alternating open tracheostomy vs Passy-Muir Valve in&#xD;
      place on sequential days to compare results. The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)&#xD;
      scale will be administered before and after each session to assess patient's subjective&#xD;
      rating of physical exertion levels on a scale from 6 through 20; 20 being the most exertion&#xD;
      possible. Oxygen saturation and heart rate will be monitored before and after each session&#xD;
      via pulse oximeter to assess for physiologic appropriateness of exercise response. For safety&#xD;
      of the participant, while performing the six-minute walk test, participants will be allowed&#xD;
      to use assistive devices as prescribed by the participant's primary physical therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A convenience sample of 30 participants will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data: All data will be collected and analyzed in a paired fashion as appropriate; adjustments&#xD;
      for abnormal distribution, unequal variance, and repeated measure will be applied as&#xD;
      necessary. In the case of missing or inconsistent data due to early withdraw, early&#xD;
      participant discharge, or other unforeseen events, the datasets will be evaluated as normal.&#xD;
      Paired T-test and Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate differences in Borg RPE scores and six-minute walk tests, between treatment arms, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Correlation analysis may also be conducted to evaluate if there is any&#xD;
      correlation to treatment arm, Borg RPE scores, six-minute walk test, and other variables such&#xD;
      as session number.&#xD;
