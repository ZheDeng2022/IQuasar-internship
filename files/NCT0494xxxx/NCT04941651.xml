  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OBE-COACH program is an automated online nutritional coaching service that was evaluated&#xD;
      in its first version (MXS-CARE program) in a clinical trial coordinated by our team, in type&#xD;
      2 diabetic patients with abdominal obesity. Results have confirmed the efficiency of the&#xD;
      program to improve lifestyle habits, including the 4-month diet, and to reduce weight and&#xD;
      HbA1c levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our experience and the scientific literature, the investigators assume that&#xD;
      adherence to the program may diminish in the long term to the point of calling into question&#xD;
      its efficiency. So IRIADE compagny developed an enhanced program called OBE-COACH. The&#xD;
      OBE-COACH program has been specifically designed to facilitate long-term user adherence. The&#xD;
      OBE-COACH program, integrates a bidirectional interactive link between the patient and an&#xD;
      automated support system (IRIADE-MED system) associated with an inexpensive remote human&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the TOOLBAR study, the investigators will evaluate the efficiency of the OBE-COACH&#xD;
      solution in a population of obese patients or overweight persons with at least one&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of patients will have access to the OBE-COACH program. It will be compared to a&#xD;
      control group which will receive an e-learning program with free access to advice sheets via&#xD;
      the web, to a menu generator, videos and a catalog of physical activity, (resources made&#xD;
      available by the web site www.mangerbouger.fr (public health France, ministry in charge of&#xD;
      health) . Indeed, the investigators judged that the loss of patients during follow-up would&#xD;
      be greater if e-learning was not offered in the control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of patients in the TOOLBAR study will be in accordance with French&#xD;
      recommendations: a patient who is overweight should benefit from a dietary, physical&#xD;
      activity, psychological assistance and medical monitoring advices which can be provided by a&#xD;
      general practitioner. In the control group, subjects have access to an e-learning program,&#xD;
      including free access via the web to a nutritional information portal and to automated tools&#xD;
      providing information and advice for adopting a balanced, low-carb diet and to practice&#xD;
      physical activity in line with the guidelines of the national health nutrition plan (PNNS).&#xD;
      However, this group will not have access to the OBE-COACH program. The usual follow-up with&#xD;
      the attending doctor will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. In an ancillary study they&#xD;
      could be also assessed at 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>OBE-COACH works through private exchanges between the user and an automatic generator of recommendations, advice and messages of encouragement. Web focus groups are propoposed by specialist to respond to the questions of the participants and a tele-interview at 6 months with a dietetician to encourage and assist the patient to make the best use of the program.&#xD;
The program is divided into missions to perform. These missions are grouped into 10 families. The completion of each mission and the correct answers to the quiz offer points and bonuses.&#xD;
To promote better adherence to the program, missions are not repetitive. They are proposed to surprise the user and constantly renew his desire to connect to the program and achieve goals.&#xD;
The intensity level of the program is selected by the user at any time.</description>
