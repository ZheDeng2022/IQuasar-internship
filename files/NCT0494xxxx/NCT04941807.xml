  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline until week 16 of follow up using the Physician Global Improvement Assessment of the 8 target nails</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIA will be based on a comparison of photographs taken at baseline to the nails at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and week 16 of treatment and follow-up. The PGIA has five components: lamellar splitting, transverse splitting, ridging and longitudinal groove, longitudinal splitting, and nail thickness. The presence of each of these components will represent 1 point on a scale. This allows a minimum and maximum score of 0 to 5 per fingernail, respectively. A score of 0 represents no signs of brittle nail syndrome, while a score of 5 represents severe brittle nail syndrome. The mean change from baseline will be calculated at week 16.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject-reported assessment of nail health with a patient satisfaction survey administered at baseline and week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjective assessments of nail health will be collected at baseline and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A patient satisfaction survey assessing nail health and satisfaction with the treatment composed of 7 questions will be used. Subjects-reported assessments of nail health will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.</description>

    <description>Blood will be drawn from a vein in the patient's arm into an 11 ml Eclipse platelet-rich plasma Tube. The blood is processed using a centrifuge machine from eclipse medical. After centrifugation, the platelet poor portion will be separated from the platelet-rich portion. The proximal nail folds are cleansed with alcohol. Using a 1ml syringe and 30g needle, 0.1-0.2 ml of platelet-rich plasma is injected into 8 proximal nail folds.</description>
