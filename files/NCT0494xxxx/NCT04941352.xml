      Introduction: A poor therapeutic relationship, low insight and lack of motivation are&#xD;
      associated with poor adjustment (to symptoms, treatment, and environment) in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. In order to achieve better compliance and results, the therapeutic&#xD;
      relationship and insight should be developed by increasing the motivation of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study examines the effect of Interpersonal Relations Theory-Based motivational&#xD;
      interviews on functional recovery and insight levels of patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This single-blind, randomized controlled study used the simple randomization method&#xD;
      and employed a pretest-posttest control group design, which is an experimental research&#xD;
      design. The study was conducted at Pamukkale University, Health Research and Application&#xD;
      Center, Habib Kızıltaş Psychiatric Hospital from November 2019 to June 2020 and included 40&#xD;
      individuals (20 in the experimental and 20 in the control groups). Study data were collected&#xD;
      using a personal information form, the Functional Remission of General Schizophrenia Scale&#xD;
      (FROGS) and the Scale for Assessing the Three Components of Insight (SAI). The researchers&#xD;
      carried out a 6-session Interpersonal Relations Theory-based motivational interview with the&#xD;
      participants in the experimental group. No intervention was made to the control group. The&#xD;
      data were analyzed on the basis of pre-intervention, post-intervention and 3 months after the&#xD;
      intervention (follow-up).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that causes problems in the thoughts, feelings, and&#xD;
      behaviors of the individual, impairs the ability to evaluate reality, has a unique world and&#xD;
      keeps the individual away from social life, causes difficulties in his family and social&#xD;
      environment, relapses, and is a progressive, severe mental illness when regular treatment is&#xD;
      not applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reported that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have poor insight into how they&#xD;
      evaluate the symptoms of the disease and what they expect from treatment. One of the problems&#xD;
      of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia is lack of motivation. It is stated that this may&#xD;
      be caused by the dopaminergic system. This situation can cause individuals to have&#xD;
      difficulties in social life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, it is important to evaluate motivational processes in the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and to plan and implement initiatives that will increase motivation. A poor&#xD;
      therapeutic relationship, low insight and lack of motivation are associated with poor&#xD;
      adjustment (to symptoms, treatment, and environment) in patients with schizophrenia. In order&#xD;
      to achieve better compliance and results, the therapeutic relationship and insight should be&#xD;
      developed by increasing the motivation of individuals. Nurses need to establish a therapeutic&#xD;
      relationship in order for the nursing care to produce effective results in the recovery&#xD;
      process of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is thought that Interpersonal Relations-Based Motivational Interviewing can&#xD;
      be effective in increasing the symptom management, social-occupational functionality,&#xD;
      adherence to treatment, daily life skills and insight levels of patients with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      and may shed light and guide psychiatric nursing interventions.&#xD;

The highest total score of the first seven questions is 14. The eighth question is presented as an appendix. It is left to the researcher to ask this question. The highest total score with this question is 18. Increased score indicates an increase in insight.</description>
