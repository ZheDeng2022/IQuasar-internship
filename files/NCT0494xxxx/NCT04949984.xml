      INTRODUCTION: Bright light therapy (BLT) has demonstrated positive effects on sleep, mood,&#xD;
      and behavioral problems in older adults with dementia. However, there is little research in&#xD;
      people with advanced stages of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Main objectives are to study the immediate effects, short and long-term effects&#xD;
      of BLT in a sample of institutionalized older adults with moderate to very severe dementia.&#xD;
      Later, to compare the potential effectiveness of bright light therapy sessions with other&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions in people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study was a 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial using a two-group&#xD;
      design (BLT vs. control) and two repeated measures (pre- vs. postintervention). In addition,&#xD;
      the BLT group participants were assessed immediately before, after, and during each session.&#xD;
      The BLT protocol consisted of 30-minute morning sessions of 10,000 lux, Monday through&#xD;
      Friday, for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to determine the&#xD;
      existence of differences at two points in time (pre- vs. post-). The Wilcoxon signed-rank&#xD;
      test or the Paired t test are used to measure changes from before to after the intervention&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the main causes of disability and dependence among older&#xD;
      adults worldwide, constituting a public health priority due to its significant human and&#xD;
      financial costs to society. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been&#xD;
      proposed for the management of its clinical manifestations. The nonpharmacological&#xD;
      interventions, which include bright light therapy (BLT), are recommended by numerous&#xD;
      guidelines as initial treatment strategies due to the absence of adverse events. BLT consists&#xD;
      of the controlled application of certain levels of light that can be administered in several&#xD;
      ways. There is some evidence that effective doses of light would stimulate circadian cycles,&#xD;
      thus affecting sleep efficiency, depression, or behavioral problems in older adults with&#xD;
      dementia, but there is little research on persons in advanced stages of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of consensus on the protocol for BLT application, as well as the existence of little&#xD;
      research on individuals in advanced stages of dementia, calls for further research to explore&#xD;
      in-depth the immediate, short- and long-term effects of BLT in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Main objectives were: (1) to study the short- and long-term effects of bright&#xD;
      light therapy on mood, behavior, sleep, and cognition in a sample of institutionalized older&#xD;
      adults with moderate to very severe dementia; (2) to explore the immediate effects of bright&#xD;
      light therapy sessions on behavior, mood and physiological parameters in a sample of&#xD;
      institutionalized older adults with moderate to very severe dementia; and (3) to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of bright light therapy sessions with other non-pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      in people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This longitudinal, comparative and prospective study, is a 2 x 2 randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial using a two-group design (BLT vs. control) and two repeated measures (pre-&#xD;
      vs. postintervention). In addition, the BLT group participants were assessed immediately&#xD;
      before, after, and during each session. Participants were recruited among residents of the&#xD;
      Gerontological Complex La Milagrosa (A Coruña, Spain). The BLT protocol consisted of&#xD;
      30-minute morning sessions in the time slot between 10:30 and 12:00, 5 days a week (Monday to&#xD;
      Friday), for 4 weeks (total 20 sessions). The devices used for the intervention were bright&#xD;
      white light lamps providing an intensity of 10,000 lux. Four users participated in each&#xD;
      session, placing two users per lamp, seated 70 cm from the lamp. All data analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with the statistical programs SPSS- Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (version 25.0), RStudio software package (Version 1.3.1093), and JAMOVI (The jamovi project,&#xD;
      2020, Version 1.2).&#xD;

    <description>The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Mood evaluation: assessment of signs and symptoms of major depression in patients with dementia focusing on the week preceding the interview. The Cornell Scale utilizes two semi-structured comprehensive interviews that elicits information from the patient and the informant. In those cases in which the patient is not able to respond due to the level of cognitive impairment, information is obtained only from the interview with the informant. Total score ranges from 0 to 38; above 10 indicate a probable major depression and above 18 indicates a definite major depression.</description>

    <measure>Mood and behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Mood and behavior evaluation: a brief retrospective (1 month) caregiver self-administered questionnaire to assess caregiver distress and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behaviors, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite/eating disturbances. For each of the symptoms the informant rates both its severity on a 3-point scale and the associated caregiver distress on a 5-point scale. The NPI-Q provides symptom severity and distress ratings for each symptom reported, and scores for total severity (0 to 36 points) and total distress (0 to 60 points) reflecting the sum of individual domain scores. Higher scores indicate higher severity and caregiver distress.</description>

    <measure>Sleep-disturbed behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Disorders Inventory (SDI). Sleep evaluation: this inventory is an expanded version of one item of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). It records the frequency (ranging from 0 to 4), the severity (from 0 to 3), and the caregiver distress (from 0 to 5) with respect to eight sleep-disturbed behaviors referred to the two weeks prior to its administration. Higher SDI scores mean greater frequency and severity of sleep disturbances.</description>

    <measure>Sleep-Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Actiwatch AW4 - Actigraphy. Sleep evaluation: actigraphy is a non-invasive method of monitoring circadian rhythm. Actiwatchs are worn on the non-dominant wrist of the participants and record movements that are used to estimate sleep parameters with specialized algorithms in computer software programs. Both experimental and control group participants wore the actiwatch for 5 days before and 5 days after the intervention.&#xD;
Among the parameters obtained from actigraphy records, the following were chosen for analysis in the present study: sleep latency, sleep efficiency and total sleep</description>
