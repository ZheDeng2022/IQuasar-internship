      The study Design was randomized control trial in which data was collected From Riphah&#xD;
      Rehabilitation And Research Center and Pakistan Railway Hospital-IIMCT. Convenient sampling&#xD;
      technique was used for data collection. 39 patients having knee osteoarthritis were recruited&#xD;
      in this study. After taking consent from patients, patients were divided randomly into two&#xD;
      groups through lottery method. The Experimental Group received compression mobilization with&#xD;
      Conventional Physiotherapy (n = 19) and the Control group received Conventional Physiotherapy&#xD;
      (n = 20). Research data was collected through structural questionnaire. the main variables&#xD;
      were ROM, MMT, Muscle length and mBBS.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease which since long times is considered to be a &quot;wear and tear&quot;&#xD;
      malfunctioning disease leading to a loss of cartilage. Osteoarthritis is considered as a&#xD;
      &quot;degenerative joint disease Osteoarthritis is a term used for disease in which destruction of&#xD;
      cartilage is involved (articular), with a bone thickening (subchondral) and formation of new&#xD;
      bone. . Joint swelling is also considered as one significant clinical feature of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis attributes to inflammation. Osteoarthritis is one of the most common type in&#xD;
      arthritis as well as the major cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain. In addition it is&#xD;
      attributed to mobility disability in the elder or high aged population all over the world. If&#xD;
      we have a glimpse of Asia, prevalence rate of knee osteoarthritis is believed to be higher in&#xD;
      the elder population most probably in women. Susan et all conducted a mega level study&#xD;
      related to symptomatic OA, where it has been observed that there is an increasing shift in&#xD;
      the incidental rates of OA with the age. So, it was concluded that incidence related to knee&#xD;
      OA in women limiting the age between 70-89, approached per year is 1% in women and they had&#xD;
      the higher rates as compared to males, especially once they are over 50 years of age.&#xD;
      Levelling-off or declining shift tends to occur for both groups approximately at the age of&#xD;
      80. Research says that in China, this prevailing rate of mentioned osteoarthritis disease is&#xD;
      7.50%, with a ratio of 10.9 &amp; 13.6% in males and females respectively. Bangladesh and India&#xD;
      reports 5.80 &amp; 10.20% respectively. Now considering mainland of Pakistan, 28% urban whereas&#xD;
      25% rural population suffer this particular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are likely to suffer more with the OA as compared to men and they also tend to undergo&#xD;
      the disease of OA with more severity. The marked increase of OA in females at menopause&#xD;
      stages has directed towards investigational hypothesis that hormonal imbalance factor may&#xD;
      perform a significant role for the developing of OA. However, results appearing on estrogen&#xD;
      effects, either it's endogenous or exogenous, on OA as revealed from various observational&#xD;
      researches have been contradictory. In a randomize clinical trials(the Heart and&#xD;
      Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study) considering the group of elder postmenopausal females&#xD;
      suffering from heart disease, none significant variation was observed in persistence of knee&#xD;
      pain or any associated disability while comparing those undergoing estrogen plus progestin&#xD;
      therapy or those taking placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of OA disease and joints patterns that are effected by OA possibly vary&#xD;
      amongst the ethnic and racial groups. The frequency of Hand and Hip OA was found remarkably&#xD;
      less in Chinese, concluded in the Beijing Osteoarthritis Study, in resemblance to whites&#xD;
      researched under Framingham Study. it's important to mention that Chinese females observed&#xD;
      under the Beijing Osteoarthritis Study had considerably high prevalence of both symptomatic&#xD;
      knee OA and radiographic knee OA as compared to white females at Framingham Study. Results&#xD;
      while having consideration of Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project have showed the&#xD;
      prevalence of hip OA in African American females(23%) was similar to that in white ladies&#xD;
      (22%), with a conclusion that prevalence was a bit higher in African American men (21%) than&#xD;
      that in white.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result of various studies showed that dietary factor is a subject of considerable interest&#xD;
      related to OA affected individuals. Vitamin D is considered as most advantageous nutritional&#xD;
      factor for OA patients. Insufficiency of this specified vitamin will lead to bones thinness,&#xD;
      brittleness or any mishaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corpulence (Obesity leading to overweight) have since long been predicted as the most potent&#xD;
      risk factor to OA, especially knee OA. A more consistence and reliable evidence found is that&#xD;
      the alarming effects occurs due to obesity are the risks of bi-lateral radiography and&#xD;
      symptomatic hip OA. So, it is considered that application of increased loads on joints is&#xD;
      probably a major cause, but not necessarily, a mechanism by which the obesity results into&#xD;
      hip or knee OA. Whereas, an application of overloading the knee and hip joints could possibly&#xD;
      directed towards synovial joint breakdown and failure of ligamentous as well as other&#xD;
      structural support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot many studies provides evidence that knee injury is surely one of the strongest factor&#xD;
      for risking OA. Severe conditions of injury to joints structures, particularly mentioning the&#xD;
      meniscal tear that requiring meniscectomy, or trans-articular fracture or anterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament injury; may these all results into increased risk involvement of OA development and&#xD;
      also musculoskeletal symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated use of particular joints for work is marked with the increasing risk of OA. The risk&#xD;
      factor involved in the development of knee OA was at least two times more for men whose&#xD;
      consistency in jobs require both kneeling and carrying or squatness in a mid-life would&#xD;
      definitely have more risk of developing OA by the nature of their commitments as compared to&#xD;
      women whose job commitments do not offer these physical activities in common. Therefore, its&#xD;
      a must mention that knee OA risks which are associated with squatness or kneeling are much&#xD;
      higher amongst those who are overweighed or who are indulgent in lifting.&#xD;
