  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetomaternal hemorrhage is the passage of fetal red blood cells through the placental barrier&#xD;
      into the maternal blood. This phenomenon frequently occurs in the third trimester for small&#xD;
      quantities of blood &lt; 0.5 ml and is without fetal consequences in rhesus positive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hemorrhage can sometimes be more important and be the cause of fetal anemia or even&#xD;
      fetal death in utero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic confirmation is biological and is performed using the Kleihauer test. It is based&#xD;
      on the identification by the biologist of fetal cells circulating in the maternal blood by&#xD;
      counting acid-fast fetal cells under the microscope. It is therefore a time-consuming&#xD;
      examination with significant inter- and intra-observer variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical sign most often reported in the literature, and the earliest sign that may&#xD;
      suggest fetomaternal hemorrhage complicated by fetal anemia, is a decrease in active fetal&#xD;
      movements. However, this is an aspecific sign and is one of the most common reasons for&#xD;
      consultation in obstetric emergencies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are other arguments in favor of complicated fetomaternal hemorrhage: The fetal heart&#xD;
      rate is often altered in severe fetal anemia, with sinusoidal rhythm being pathognomonic but&#xD;
      uncommon. A slightly oscillating rhythm or variable decelerations are also found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On ultrasound, peak systolic middle cerebral artery velocity &gt; 1.5 MoM correlates with fetal&#xD;
      anemia early before the appearance of hydrops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies show that peak systolic middle cerebral artery velocity correlates better with&#xD;
      neonatal hemoglobin than the Kleihauer test, for which no threshold has been found to predict&#xD;
      an unfavorable outcome. Thus, even if the Kleihauer test is positive, the positive predictive&#xD;
      value for fetal anemia is low. The detection of a small amount of fetomaternal hemorrhage by&#xD;
      Kleihauer in the absence of evidence of anemia could even be deleterious, potentially leading&#xD;
      to an excess of additional investigations and obstetrical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of systematically performing the Kleihauer test to search for fetomaternal&#xD;
      hemorrhage is uncertain at this time because of the development and the undeniable&#xD;
      contribution of ultrasound. However, in France, it is still carried out in most maternity&#xD;
      wards in the absence of recommendations for any decrease in active fetal movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one article has looked specifically at fetomaternal hemorrhage in a group of patients&#xD;
      consulting for a decrease in active fetal movements, calling into question its interest.&#xD;
