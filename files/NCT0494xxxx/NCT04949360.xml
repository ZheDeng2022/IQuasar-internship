    <textblock>
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is a well-established therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention for insomnia. SleepUp provides a digital therapeutics platform based on CBTi and&#xD;
      additional features. This clinical trial aims at analyzing the efficacy of the CBTi-based&#xD;
      platform offered by SleepUp in reducing symptoms of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be composed of 160 individuals, both males and females, from 20 to 60 years&#xD;
      old, with insomnia symptoms considered as at least mild. Those who accept to participate will&#xD;
      be randomized and distributed in four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard CBTi (CBTi-S): This treatment consists of an eight-week treatment composed by&#xD;
           weekly and structure appointments with board-certified sleep psychologists. The&#xD;
           appointments will be made remotely (video calls with psychologists).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal intervention - Sleep hygiene (MI-SH): This group informative material regarding&#xD;
           normal sleep pattern and sleep hygiene (through regular mail and e-mail). This procedure&#xD;
           is more adequate as a control than the commonly used no treatment or waiting list&#xD;
           controls, due to the behavioral nature of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online CBTI (CBTI-O): This group will receive access to an eight-month CBTi-based&#xD;
           treatment through the SleepUp app. The platform will be updated into a non-commercial&#xD;
           version, and all features other than the CBTi track, the sleep log and the clinical&#xD;
           tests will be removed. This way, the participants of this group will receive&#xD;
           interventions equivalent to the standard in-person CBTi, but provided through a digital&#xD;
           platform. The treatment last eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online CBTi + additional features (CBTi-O+): This group will have access to the complete&#xD;
           premium version of SleepUp platform. It includes those presented in the CBTi-O group and&#xD;
           other therapeutic and complementary features (including meditation audios and videos,&#xD;
           mindfulness therapy, relaxation soundtracks, sleep hygiene tips, virtual assistant, and&#xD;
           telehealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in all groups will be assessed periodically throughout the eight weeks of&#xD;
      intervention with standard sleep questionnaires and sleep logs. Additionally, follow ups will&#xD;
      be made at two, four and six months after the end of the intervention. Equivalent intervals&#xD;
      will be applied to the SH-MI group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is a well-established therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention for insomnia. In its standard presentation, it is composed by 6 to 12 weekly&#xD;
      appointments with a board-certified sleep psychologist. SleepUp provides a digital&#xD;
      therapeutics platform based on CBTi and additional features. This clinical trial aims at&#xD;
      analyzing the efficacy of the CBTi-based platform offered by SleepUp in reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be recruited based on SleepUp's records and database and invited to&#xD;
      participate. Those participants who are eligible in accordance to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be contact by a member of the research team who will provide a consent form and&#xD;
      will explain the terms and conditions of this research project. The sample will be composed&#xD;
      of 160 individuals, both males and females, from 20 to 60 years old, with insomnia symptoms&#xD;
      considered as at least mild, according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). All groups shall&#xD;
      have similar proportions of gender and of insomnia symptoms severity. Those who accepted to&#xD;
      participate will be randomized and distributed in four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard CBTi (CBTi-S): This is a positive control group, in which standard CBTi (the&#xD;
           golden standard behavioral treatment for insomnia) will be made available. This&#xD;
           treatment consists of an eight-week treatment composed by weekly and structure&#xD;
           appointments with psychologists. Only psychologists board-certified in sleep medicine&#xD;
           will perform the CBTi sessions, and none of them are part of the research team. Due to&#xD;
           the restriction imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the appointments will be made remotely&#xD;
           (video calls with psychologists), which have already been proven to be equivalent to the&#xD;
           in-person CBTi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal intervention - Sleep hygiene (MI-SH): This group corresponds to a negative&#xD;
           control group, subjected to minimal intervention. It is based on the delivery of&#xD;
           informative material regarding normal sleep pattern and sleep hygiene (through regular&#xD;
           mail and e-mail). This procedure is more adequate as a control than the commonly used no&#xD;
           treatment or waiting list controls, due to the behavioral nature of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online CBTI (CBTI-O): This group will receive access to an eight-month CBTi-based&#xD;
           treatment through the SleepUp app. The platform will be updated into a non-commercial&#xD;
           version, and all features other than the CBTi track, the sleep log and the clinical&#xD;
           tests will be removed. This way, the participants of this group will receive&#xD;
           interventions equivalent to the standard in-person CBTi, but provided through a digital&#xD;
           platform. The treatment last eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online CBTi + additional features (CBTi-O+): This group will have access to the complete&#xD;
           premium version of SleepUp platform. It includes those presented in the CBTi-O group and&#xD;
           other therapeutic and complementary features (including meditation audios and videos,&#xD;
           mindfulness therapy, relaxation soundtracks, sleep hygiene tips, virtual assistant, and&#xD;
           telehealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in all groups will be assessed periodically throughout the eight weeks of&#xD;
      intervention. Additionally, follow ups will be made at two, four and six months after the end&#xD;
      of the intervention. Equivalent intervals will be applied to the SH-MI group. The following&#xD;
      clinical questionnaires and scales will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep log: It includes self-reported items regarding wake and bedtime, sleep latency and&#xD;
           other sleeping habits. It allows the calculation of total sleep time, sleep efficiency&#xD;
           and wake time after sleep onset. Fille daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morningness and Eveningness Questionnaire: It evaluates chronotype based on 19 items,&#xD;
           allowing categorizing the participants according to the following categories: morning&#xD;
           type (definitive or moderate), intermediate, or evening type (definitive or moderate).&#xD;
           Applied once, in the first week of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insomnia Severity Index: It evaluates the presence and severity of insomnia,&#xD;
           categorizing the participants according to the following categories: no, mild, moderate&#xD;
           or severe insomnia. Applied once every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale: It evaluates excessive daytime sleepiness by inquiring about&#xD;
           the chance of sleeping in eight daily situations. Scores higher than 10 indicates&#xD;
           excessive daytime sleepiness. Applied once every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: It evaluates overall sleep quality based on 19&#xD;
           self-reported items. Scores higher than 5 indicates poor sleep quality. Applied once&#xD;
           every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep Hygiene Index: It habits related to sleep hygiene, based on 13 self-reported&#xD;
           items.&#xD;
