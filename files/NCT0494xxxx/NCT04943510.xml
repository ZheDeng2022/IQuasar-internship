  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric study comparing hamstring and quadriceps neuromuscular fatigue after&#xD;
      simulated soccer game, anaerobic and aerobic training sessions. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To quantify the decrease of isometric force immediately after a simulate soccer game.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize peripheral and central fatigue between hamstring and quadriceps muscles&#xD;
           and described the kinetics of recovery after specific tasks of soccer training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the level neuromuscular fatigue induced by anaerobic and aerobic training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To highlight correlation between neuromuscular fatigue and performance markers.&#xD;
