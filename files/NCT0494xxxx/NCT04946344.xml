    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of a systematic, practical,&#xD;
      cost-effective diet-induced weight loss and exercise intervention in Cherokee, North Caroling&#xD;
      that will recruit American Indian participants; that can reduce pain and improve other&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in knee OA patients. This pragmatic community-based trial will determine if&#xD;
      the investigators previous findings translate to real-world settings and will address common&#xD;
      concerns about barriers to effectiveness/ implementation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for knee osteoarthritis (OA), and weight loss is an&#xD;
      effective non-pharmacologic treatment to reduce pain. Recently, the investigators determined&#xD;
      that under ideal, highly controlled circumstances, a diet-induced weight loss of 10% combined&#xD;
      with exercise was significantly better at reducing pain than either intervention alone.&#xD;
      Compared to the investigators previous longterm weight loss and exercise trials of knee OA,&#xD;
      the diet-induced weight loss and exercise group was twice as effective at relieving pain.&#xD;
      Whether the investigators results can be generalized to less rigorously monitored patient&#xD;
      cohorts is unknown. Thus the challenge the investigators now face is to provide the practical&#xD;
      means to implement this proven treatment in the community setting. This study aims to develop&#xD;
      and demonstrate the effectiveness of a systematic, practical, cost-effective diet-induced&#xD;
      weight loss and exercise intervention in both urban and rural communities that can reduce&#xD;
      pain and improve other clinical outcomes in knee OA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 30 ambulatory, community-dwelling, overweight and obese men and women&#xD;
      who meet the American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for knee OA. The primary aim&#xD;
      is to determine whether a pragmatic, community-based 3-month diet-induced weight loss and&#xD;
      exercise intervention implemented in Cherokee, North Carolina significantly decreases knee&#xD;
      pain in overweight and obese adults with knee OA relative to an attention control group.&#xD;
      Secondary aims will determine whether this intervention improves self-reported function,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and mobility. The investigators will also establish the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of this pragmatic, community-based, multimodal diet-induced weight-loss&#xD;
      and exercise program by conducting cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact analyses using&#xD;
      data from the current trial in a validated computer-simulated model of knee OA.&#xD;

    <measure>Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) - Change in Knee pain</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale in overweight and obese adults with knee OA compared to an attention-control group - The pain index assesses participants' pain on the same scale, ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). The pain subscale consists of 5 items and total scores can range from 0-20, with larger scores indicating greater pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) - Change in Function</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale in overweight and obese adults with knee OA compared to an attention-control group - participants indicate on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme) the degree of difficulty experienced in the last week due to knee OA. Individual scores for the 17 items are totaled to generate a summary score that could range from 0-68, with higher scores indicating poorer function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with a higher score defining a more favorable health state - The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability -The SF-36 measures eight scales: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Component analyses showed that there are two distinct concepts measured by the SF-36: a physical dimension, represented by the Physical Component Summary (PCS), and a mental dimension, represented by the Mental Component Summary (MCS). All scales do contribute in different proportions to the scoring of both PCS and MCS measures.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend an exercise class 3 days/week for 3 months. The exercise program will consist of a 15-minute aerobic phase, a 20-minute strength training phase, a second 15-minute aerobic phase, and a 10 minute cool down phase. Participant's will also attend individual and group diet sessions. Each participant will be prescribed an individual walking prescription by the exercise leader, which will be adjusted accordingly, as each participant progresses throughout the 3 months. The exercise will be of moderate intensity. Alternate forms of aerobic exercise, such as but not limited to stationary bike, elliptical trainer, or treadmill walking, can be used in place of over-ground walking. This choice could be based on participant preference, the limitations of the exercise facility, or the participant's pain level.</description>
