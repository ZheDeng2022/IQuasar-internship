  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely preterm infants have high and prolonged exposure to positive pressure ventilation,&#xD;
      which contributes to acute lung injury and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD). Despite the risk of diaphragmatic dysfunction in infants with BPD, the effect of&#xD;
      prolonged ventilator support on the diaphragmatic function of preterm infants has not been&#xD;
      well characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, we aim to characterize the diaphragmatic function of very preterm neonates with BPD&#xD;
      who are corrected to ≥ 36 weeks using bedside ultrasound in comparison to healthy newborns&#xD;
      born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation.&#xD;

      Study Design and setting; This is a prospective descriptive pilot study that will be&#xD;
      conducted on infants born at ≤ 32 weeks gestation who meet eligibility criteria and are&#xD;
      admitted to the neonatal intensive care at Mount Sinai Hospital and healthy newborns born at&#xD;
      at ≥ 36 weeks gestation. Enrollment of eligible infants will start after obtaining approval&#xD;
      from the Research Ethics Board at Mount Sinai Hospital and parental consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of assessment; Parents of infants who are eligible for the study will be approached for&#xD;
      consent. Chest ultrasound (lung ultrasound and diaphragmatic function assessment) will be&#xD;
      performed at ≥ 36 weeks corrected gestational age. Chest ultrasound will be done before a&#xD;
      feeding to avoid any concerns of a full stomach on diaphragmatic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure; Functional assessment of the diaphragm combined with lung ultrasound&#xD;
      examination will be done by one of the following investigators. A sample of 10-15&#xD;
      consecutively selected infants will have lung ultrasound and diaphragmatic function&#xD;
      assessment done twice by 2 operators (inter-rater variability will be measured at the end of&#xD;
      the study). The operators will not be aware of the result of chest ultrasound done by the&#xD;
      other operator for the same patient but consecutive exams will be conducted by 2 different&#xD;
      operators in a time separated by one feed interval. Standard variables for assessing&#xD;
      diaphragm function will be used including diaphragmatic thickness fraction, and diaphragmatic&#xD;
      excursion (DE). Lung ultrasound severity score, diaphragmatic thickness fraction, and&#xD;
      diaphragmatic excursion will be calculated. Inter-rater agreement will be assessed using raw&#xD;
      percentage of agreement (Pa), Cohen's and Kappa (κ), and G wet agreement coefficient (AC1).&#xD;
      Intra-class correlation (ICC) will be determined for variables with continuous measurements&#xD;
      (mixed factorial design). High-resolution linear and curvilinear US probes of 20-5 and 10-3&#xD;
      MegahertZ will be used to assess lung ultrasound score and to measure diaphragmatic thickness&#xD;
      fraction, and diaphragmatic excursion [amplitude] respectively using both B and M modes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound assessment technique; Lung ultrasounds will be performed in a standardized&#xD;
      manner. A longitudinal scan of the anterior and lateral chest walls will be performed. Three&#xD;
      chest areas for each side (upper anterior, lower anterior, and lateral) will be assessed.&#xD;
      Each area will have a score of 0 to 3 points with a total score between 0 to 18, which&#xD;
      inversely correlates with lung aeration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragmatic assessment technique; Diaphragm assessment will be performed in the supine&#xD;
      position. To measure diaphragmatic excursion, the curvilinear probe will be placed on the&#xD;
      lower intercostal spaces between the mid-clavicular and anterior axillary lines on the right&#xD;
      side and between the anterior and mid-axillary lines for the left side. Using the B mode, the&#xD;
      proper exploration line of the diaphragm will be detected by directing the beam perpendicular&#xD;
      to the posterior third of the right hemidiaphragm. By M mode, the cyclic caudal diaphragmatic&#xD;
      displacement with respiration will be measured as the perpendicular distance between the most&#xD;
      caudal point of the liver or spleen at the end of expiration and the end of inspiration. The&#xD;
      average of three respiratory cycles will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the diaphragmatic efficiency as a pressure generator will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the diaphragmatic thickness fraction. Diaphragmatic thickness will be measured at the&#xD;
      apposition zone which can be obtained by placing the linear transducer above the 10th rib in&#xD;
      the mid-axillary or anterior axillary lines in the right intercostal spaces. By B mode, three&#xD;
      distinct layers will be seen, the diaphragm as a hypo-echoic area bordered by two clear&#xD;
      echogenic lines of the pleural membrane (upper line) and the peritoneal membrane (lower&#xD;
      line). Using M-mode tracing, inspiratory diaphragmatic thickness will be measured as the&#xD;
      maximum perpendicular distance between pleural and peritoneal layers and by the same way&#xD;
      expiratory diaphragmatic thickness will be recorded. diaphragmatic thickness fraction will be&#xD;
      calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickness fraction = [(inspiratory thickness - expiratory thickness)/expiratory&#xD;
      thickness] x 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average of the calculated diaphragmatic thickness fraction from three respiratory cycles&#xD;
      will be estimated. The higher scores the better the diaphragmatic function. All Chest&#xD;
      ultrasound assessments will be undertaken using a standard aseptic technique.&#xD;
