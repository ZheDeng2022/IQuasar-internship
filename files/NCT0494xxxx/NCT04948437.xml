      Now, the investigators carried out a prospective study enrolling patients with thyroid&#xD;
      cancer, who had received ablative thyroidectomy and /or radioactive iodine therapy for two&#xD;
      more years. The investigators' study already enrolled seventy-three patients with thyroid&#xD;
      cancer, and the investigators plan to enroll 30 new patients in this consecutive research&#xD;
      study. All patients received total thyroidectomy under clinically surgical judgement in&#xD;
      initial therapeutic option. The investigators also further found some difference between&#xD;
      papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer, and the investigators will continue&#xD;
      annually to closely monitor the change of U-Ex Tg and urinary exosomal galectin-3 between&#xD;
      differently cellular types of thyroid cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although, most thyroid cancers are clinically endocrine tumors of low malignancy, most&#xD;
      patients usually receive radioactive iodine-131 treatment and thyroidectomy. Such patients&#xD;
      are followed up with thyroid ultrasound and continuous serum thyroglobulin assessment after&#xD;
      surgery. Previous studies have shown that one third of well-differentiated thyroid cancers&#xD;
      may be transformed into poorly differentiated or even fatal malignant tumors during disease&#xD;
      progression, but the efficacy of surgery, chemotherapy and external radiation therapy is not&#xD;
      significant. . In other words, effective treatment strategies and tracking models will be&#xD;
      very important, including surgical removal of thyroid cancer, radioactive iodine-131&#xD;
      treatment, and tracking of biomarkers in thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When thyroid cancer cells are poorly differentiated, cell dedifferentiation is a key factor&#xD;
      for malignant transformation and invasion. Usually in papillary thyroid carcinoma and&#xD;
      follicular thyroid carcinoma, the cancer cells will gradually dedifferentiate, and&#xD;
      undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma is the final result. Therefore, the investigators try to&#xD;
      find biomarkers and therapeutic tracking targets based on the expression of exosomal proteins&#xD;
      in urine. The basis of this clinical study depends on the previous basic experiments of&#xD;
      culturing undifferentiated thyroid cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exosomes are nanosomes that are secreted into the extracellular environment. Cancer&#xD;
      cell-derived exosomes can be found in the plasma, saliva, urine and other body fluids of&#xD;
      cancer patients. The investigators will analyze exosomal proteins in urine, including&#xD;
      thyroglobulin and galectin-3, and discover early prognostic biomarkers in urine through the&#xD;
      prospectively observation study. The investigators have published preliminary research papers&#xD;
      on 16 patients with thyroid mastoid carcinoma and follicular carcinoma in international&#xD;
      scientific journals. During the period of surgery and further radioactive iodine-131 therapy,&#xD;
      including before and one day after surgery, 3 months and 6 months after surgery, the urinary&#xD;
      biomarkers of thyroglobulin and galectin-3 in the urine were analyzed at different stages . A&#xD;
      prospective study currently in progress has enrolled 73 patients with thyroid mastoid&#xD;
      carcinoma and follicular carcinoma. After thyroidectomy, urine was collected during&#xD;
      outpatient follow-up and analyzed for exosome biomarkers in the urine. During the first two&#xD;
      years of this project, such new urinary biomarkers of thyroid papillary carcinoma and thyroid&#xD;
      follicular carcinoma had shown certain different patterns. The investigators' research team&#xD;
      expects to enroll 30 new thyroid cancer patients in this consecutive plan. Under continuous&#xD;
      follow-up research, in addition to identifying the clinical application of new biomarker as&#xD;
      prognostic predictors for future thyroid cancer patients after surgery, the investigators&#xD;
      also plan to observe current patients with thyroid follicular cancer. Up to date, follicular&#xD;
      thyroid cancer cannot be diagnosed preoperatively via images or aspiration cytology, because&#xD;
      pathology after surgery is the only diagnostic golden rule. According to the observations&#xD;
      conducted in the current experiment, the urine exosomal thyroglobulin has the opportunity to&#xD;
      be a way to diagnose thyroid follicular carcinoma before surgery.&#xD;
