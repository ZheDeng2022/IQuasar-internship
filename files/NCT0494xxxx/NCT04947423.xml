  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose&#xD;
      efficacy and safety study evaluating the use of a nasal gel to prevent nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      associated with motion&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to DPI-386 Nasal Gel or matching placebo nasal&#xD;
      gel and assigned a time and date for travel on an ocean vessel. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      self-administer the study medication while the ship is in harbor. The Modified Performance&#xD;
      Self-Assessment Questionnaire (mPSAQ) will be completed by each participant prior to the&#xD;
      administration of nasal gel, approximately every 30 minutes of travel, and at the end of&#xD;
      travel. The participants will complete the Nausea Assessment Scale (NAS) every 30 minutes&#xD;
      afer dosing, and at the end of travel. The participants will also be asked to complete a&#xD;
      Sopite Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and a Patient Global Assessment of Severity (PGI-S) at&#xD;
      4 hours to describe their travel experience. All questionnaires will be submitted for&#xD;
      analysis. An exit interview will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase will last approximately 4-5 hours&#xD;
