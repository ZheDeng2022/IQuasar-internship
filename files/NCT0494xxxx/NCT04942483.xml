  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wheezing is common in preschool children and affects quality of life. Although asthma&#xD;
      treatments such as inhaled steroids (ICS), which reduce swelling (inflammation) in the&#xD;
      airways are used in this age group, they are often ineffective. That is because only some&#xD;
      preschool children have the type of inflammation (known as Type 2 inflammation) that responds&#xD;
      to ICS, thus many children are being unnecessarily exposed to side effects. It is difficult&#xD;
      diagnosing Type 2 inflammation through history and examination, thus other indicators are&#xD;
      needed to ensure ICS are only given to children who will benefit. These indicators are&#xD;
      commonly known as biomarkers, and we are trying to find out if they are useful. We want to&#xD;
      measure three biomarkers, without changing children's treatment. The first is blood&#xD;
      eosinophils. which can be measured using a finger prick sample (like the blood drop used for&#xD;
      measuring sugar levels in diabetic children). The second is to determine if allergic&#xD;
      sensitization is present to allergens that are breathed in; these will be house dust mite,&#xD;
      grass pollen, tree pollen, cat and dog hair. The final biomarker is a molecule that is&#xD;
      produced in the airways of preschool children with Type 2 inflammation, called nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO). This is easily obtained, by having children breathe through a mask and collecting their&#xD;
      breath in a bag, measuring NO later on. The children will be followed up with monthly&#xD;
      electronic questionnaires and 3-monthly visits (virtual or face-to-face) for a year to&#xD;
      evaluate whether these markers individually or in combination relate to subsequent wheezing&#xD;
      outcomes, and how acceptable the measurements are to families using a questionnaire and focus&#xD;
      group approach. The results will form the basis of the design of a national trial of&#xD;
      biomarker-driven therapy in such children.&#xD;

    <description>Exacerbation of the wheezing condition that will require a visit to a hospital that was not scheduled. This will be determined with monthly electronic questionnaires sent by email to the parents of preschool children with wheeze, as well as by follow-up face-to-face visits in primary care every 3 months.</description>

    <description>Days the parent/carer has taken off work in order to be with their child that has an acute wheezing. This will be determined with monthly electronic questionnaires sent by email to the parents of preschool children with wheeze, as well as by follow-up face-to-face visits in primary care every 3 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children unable to attend childcare facility</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the number of days a child did not attend a childcare facility due to exacerbation of his/her wheezing condition. This will be determined with monthly electronic questionnaires sent by email to the parents of preschool children with wheeze, as well as by follow-up face-to-face visits in primary care every 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Use of oral corticosteroids</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>In case a child has been prescribed oral corticosteroids, this has to be declared so that we can assess treatment effectiveness according to the biomarkers tested. This will be determined with monthly electronic questionnaires sent by email to the parents of preschool children with wheeze, as well as by follow-up face-to-face visits in primary care every 3 months.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Preschool children with a history of wheeze, aged 1 to 5 years old</arm_group_label>
    <description>This is a pragmatic, observational study involving preschool children with wheeze aged one to five years old. All treatment and routine monitoring decisions will be at the discretion of their treating general practitioner (GP) or paediatrician (as per usual clinical practice), blinded to the study measurements.&#xD;
The following three biomarker tests will be performed a) atopic sensitisation, b) blood eosinophil count and c) FeNO (off-line method).</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Blood eosinophil count</intervention_name>
    <description>Peripheral blood eosinophil count will be measured from a finger prick blood sample, using the Haemocue machine, allowing a result in approximately 2 minutes. The test will allow to assess the presence or not of eosinophilia and if it can predict future wheezing exacerbations and response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).</description>

    <description>Skin prick tests will be performed to: (a) house dust mite, (b) grass pollen, (c) tree pollen, (d) cat hair, (e) dog hair, as well as normal saline and histamine which will act as negative and positive controls respectively. In addition, skin prick tests will allow the assessment of which aeroallergen is the most useful predictor of outcomes in preschool children.</description>
