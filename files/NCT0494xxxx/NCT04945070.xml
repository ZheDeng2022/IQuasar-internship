  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive insulin therapy using multiple daily injections (MDI) constitutes the most intense&#xD;
      type of regimen in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Although highly effective in lowering&#xD;
      blood glucose, it can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia, promote weight gain and cause&#xD;
      significant treatment burden for the patients. As demonstrated by a number of clinical&#xD;
      studies, overtreatment is a common and generally unrecognized problem in patients with T2D;&#xD;
      nevertheless, medication de-escalation is still infrequent in everyday clinical practice.&#xD;
      IGlarLixi is a once-daily fixed-ratio combination (FRC) of a basal insulin and a&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), which can offer similar efficacy in&#xD;
      glucose control with lower rates of hypoglycemia and smaller weight gain that basal insulin&#xD;
      regimens. The aim of our randomised, controlled study is to examine prospectively the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of de-escalating MDI regimens to iGlarLixi in T2D adult patients.&#xD;
