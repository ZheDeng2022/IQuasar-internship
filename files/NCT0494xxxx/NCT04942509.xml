  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether nurses who did mindful coloring for at&#xD;
      least five working days during a 10-day period experienced stress reduction afterwards.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants who met inclusion criteria (full-time clinical nurses working for at&#xD;
      least five days during a specified 10-day period) were randomized in 1:1 ratio to the&#xD;
      coloring or control groups. A third party did the allocation sequence and concealment. After&#xD;
      giving informed consent, participants completed the baseline questionnaire and the coloring&#xD;
      group watched an instructional video on mindful coloring. The coloring group were asked to&#xD;
      color for any length of time on at least five working days during a 10-day period (period A)&#xD;
      while the control group were asked to do it on a subsequent 10-day (period B). The&#xD;
      post-intervention questionnaire was completed by both groups at the end of period A. The&#xD;
      study was completed after period B.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>Time point 1: pre-intervention. Time point 2: post-intervention (10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Three subscales (each with a separate score) assessing three facets of burnout including Emotional Exhaustion (scores 0-54), Depersonalisation (scores 0-30) and Personal Accomplishment (scores 0-48) measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey for medical personnel. Burnout is represented by a combination of high emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores, together with a low personal accomplishment score. Positive outcomes are indicated by a lower score in Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalisation, and a higher score in Personal Accomplishment.</description>
