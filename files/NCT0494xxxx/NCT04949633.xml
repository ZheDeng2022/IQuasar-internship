  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-two percent of deliveries in France are induced. In cases where labor is induced and&#xD;
      cervix is unfavorable, cervical ripening prior oxytocin administration is advised in order to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of cesarean delivery. Cervical ripening agents, pharmacological&#xD;
      (prostaglandins) or mechanical are administered during 24 hours. After 24 hours, most women&#xD;
      will be either delivered or in labor but 25% of women will require further induction of&#xD;
      labor. For 16% of women who undergo cervical ripening, whatever the cervical ripening method,&#xD;
      the cervix remains unchanged after 24 hours. The management of these women is not consensual&#xD;
      and depends on the maternity unit where women are cared for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to identify the most appropriate strategy for the management of women with&#xD;
      an unfavorable cervix after 24 hours of cervical ripening, a strategy which would be&#xD;
      associated with the lowest maternal and perinatal morbidity but also with the best maternal&#xD;
      satisfaction. Because both strategies are practiced in France, the trial would compare:&#xD;
      induction of labor with oxytocin and repeated cervical ripening. The aim is to show that&#xD;
      repeating cervical ripening is an unnecessary procedure. And more specifically that oxytocin&#xD;
      administration is not associated with a higher caesarean delivery rate and that it reduces&#xD;
      the time to delivery in comparison with cervical ripening with prostaglandins.&#xD;

      repeated in order to obtain a favorable cervix and to reduce the risk of caesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to identify the most appropriate strategy for the management of women with&#xD;
      an unfavorable cervix after 24 hours of cervical ripening, a strategy which would be&#xD;
      associated with the lowest maternal and perinatal morbidity but also with the best maternal&#xD;
      satisfaction. Because both strategies are practiced in France, the trial would compare:&#xD;
      induction of labor with oxytocin and repeated cervical ripening. The policy of induction of&#xD;
      labor with oxytocin, being the simpler strategy, would be acceptable if it did not lead to a&#xD;
      substantially proportion of women with caesarean deliveries compared with a second cervical&#xD;
      ripening. This multicenter non inferiority randomized trial will recruit women with an&#xD;
      unfavorable cervix (bishop score ≤ 6) after 24 hours of cervical ripening (pharmacological or&#xD;
      mechanical) and randomize them to either induction of labor with oxytocin or to a second&#xD;
      cervical ripening with prostaglandins. The aim is to show that repeating cervical ripening is&#xD;
      an unnecessary procedure. And more specifically that oxytocin administration is not&#xD;
      associated with a higher caesarean delivery rate and that it reduces the time to delivery in&#xD;
      comparison with cervical ripening with prostaglandins.&#xD;

    <description>women randomized in the experimental group will be admitted to the labor ward to undergo induction of labor with intra-veinous oxytocin and early amniotomy. Oxytocin will be administered according to the French guidelines for induction of labor. Maximum oxytocin used should not exceed 10 UI.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Second cervical ripening</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>women randomized in the control group will undergo a second cervical ripening lasting a maximum of 24 hours with either:&#xD;
Vaginal slow releasing system of dinoprostone PROPESS® which is inserted in the vagina, against the cervix and left in place during 24 hours.&#xD;
Oral misoprostol (ANGUSTA®) 25 µg every 2 hours, 8 times (maximum dosage should not exceed 200µg). Tablets will be given one at the time by midwives.&#xD;
Vaginal gel of dinoprostone (2 mg PROSTINE®) every 6 hours, maximum dose of 6 mg.&#xD;
The choice of the cervical ripening agent will depend of the local protocol of the participating maternity unit. The choice between ANGUSTA®, PROPESS® and PROSTINE® will be made by investigators of each participating unit at the beginning of the trial.&#xD;
At the end of the second cervical ripening procedure women not in labor will be transferred to the labor ward for induction of labor with oxytocin.</description>
