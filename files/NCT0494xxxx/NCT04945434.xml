    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the clinical effectiveness of S53P4 bioactive glass (BAG) as a&#xD;
      bacterial growth inhibiting bone graft substitute in a one-stage or two-stage surgical&#xD;
      procedure for treatment of chronic long bone osteomyelitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective multicenter study, patients from two different university hospitals in&#xD;
      the Netherlands were included. Treatment consisted of debridement surgery, implantation of&#xD;
      S53P4-BAG, if necessary wound closure by a plastic surgeon and additional culture based&#xD;
      systemic antibiotics. Primary outcome was eradication of infection based on clinical&#xD;
      presentation, radiographic imaging and laboratory tests. Secondary analysis was performed on&#xD;
      probable risk factors for treatment failure after S53P4-BAG implantation.&#xD;
