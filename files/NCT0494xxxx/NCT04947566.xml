      Comparison between Naproxen and Ibuprofen in management of post operative endodontic pain was&#xD;
      done.Total 116 patients were selected and divided in to two groups.One group was given&#xD;
      Naproxen and other was given Ibuprofen.&#xD;

      This Randomized Controlled Trial was carried out in Outpatient Department of Operative&#xD;
      Dentistry, Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan and was completed in six months from&#xD;
      September 2nd,2019 to February 25th,2020. Sample size of 116 cases(58 in each group) of&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis was calculated with 80% power of test, 5% level of significance,&#xD;
      P1(prevalence) for naproxen was 61.53% and P2 for ibuprofen is 38.46%. Estimation of P&#xD;
      (prevalence) as 90% is based on pilot study carried in our Department. The patients were&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two groups, A and B, by random number table. In both groups teeth&#xD;
      were anaesthetized using 1.8ml of 2% lignocaine containing 1:100,000 epinephrine and isolated&#xD;
      with rubber dam. An access cavity was prepared with round bur and pulpectomy was done using&#xD;
      hand files. Working length was determined using an electronic apex locator and confirmed with&#xD;
      periapical radiograph. Canals were prepared with step back technique. Canals were then dried&#xD;
      with paper points and the access cavities were restored temporarily with cavit(Cavit3M&#xD;
      ESPE).Visual analogue scale for pain score was measured for both groups before initial&#xD;
      endodontic procedure . group A was given (naproxen 550 mg B.D), while group B was given&#xD;
      (Ibuprofen 400mg B.D).Post-operative pain was measured subjectively after 24 hours with&#xD;
      standard Visual Analogue Score (VAS) scored on a 10 cm scale, with markings at every 1 cm&#xD;
      anchored by the end points of &quot;no pain&quot; on the left and &quot;worst pain&quot; on the right. Patient&#xD;
      were asked to point the number most precisely describing the amount of pain he or she&#xD;
      experienced after 24 hours. All this data was recorded in a specially designed proforma&#xD;
      (attached).Efficacy was labelled as per operational definitions. Data was analyzed using SPSS&#xD;
      version 20. For descriptive analysis, mean and standard deviation were reported for age, BMI&#xD;
      and VAS score, whereas frequency and percentages were calculated for categorical variables&#xD;
      like gender and educational status. A chi square was used to determine the significance of&#xD;
      the difference between the efficacy of naproxen and ibuprofen. Data was stratified for age,&#xD;
      gender, BMI and educational status .This comparison also included feelings of patients in&#xD;
      terms of side effects. A p value 0.05 or less was taken as significant. Post stratification&#xD;
      chi-square was applied with p value ≤0.05 considered as significant.&#xD;
