      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBMA is an inherited chronic disease. It affects males in mid to late adulthood. It causes&#xD;
      slowly progressive weakness of muscles and hand tremors. Researchers want to learn more about&#xD;
      the effects of SBMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify measurements that change over time in SBMA, including tests of muscle strength&#xD;
      and function, as well as measurements of muscle and fat size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men over the age of 18 both with and without a history of SBMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. They will&#xD;
      have neuromuscular ultrasound. They will have a lumbar puncture to obtain spinal fluid. For&#xD;
      this, a needle will be inserted into the spinal canal in the lower back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have muscle strength and function tests. These tests may include pushing,&#xD;
      pulling, rising from a chair and sitting back down, and/or walking. During these tests, they&#xD;
      may wear an accelerometer (activity tracker) on their wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get an activity tracker to wear on their wrist for 10 days at home every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with SBMA will also have lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      optional whole-body MRI. They will have lung function tests. They will have speech and&#xD;
      swallow tests. They will complete questionnaires. They may have optional body scans to&#xD;
      measure bone density and lean body mass. They may have optional muscle biopsies. For&#xD;
      biopsies, a needle will be used to take a small piece of muscle from the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with SBMA will have 5 study visits over 2 years (every 6 months). Participants&#xD;
      without SBMA will have 1 study visit.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational study to assess clinical, molecular and imaging biomarkers in spinal and&#xD;
      bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited form of motor neuron disease caused&#xD;
      by a CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome for which there&#xD;
      is no treatment currently. Biomarkers will be collected from participants with SBMA during&#xD;
      this study to understand the natural history and progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to develop clinical, molecular and imaging outcome&#xD;
      parameters that correlate with disease progression and severity and that predict clinical&#xD;
      decline. These biomarkers and outcome measures can serve as potential tools for the&#xD;
      evaluation of efficacy in future therapeutic studies in SBMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies performed under this protocol are exploratory. However, the following measures&#xD;
      may be used to characterize baseline status and disease progression over the course of the&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength by manual and quantitative myometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distance traveled in meters on the 6-minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity levels as measured by an accelerometer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global disability measured by the SBMAFRS questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing function measured by pulmonary function test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallow and speech function measured by questionnaires, tongue muscle strength, digital audio&#xD;
      recordings for analysis of voice and speech, and barium swallow&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle MRI measurement of muscle volume and fat fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body MRI measurement of body muscle fat fraction, muscle fat infiltration, and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle ultrasound measurement of muscle thickness, echogenicity and elasticity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve ultrasound measurement of nerve cross sectional area and anterior posterior diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies from blood, serum, urine, and CSF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsy assessment of androgen receptor levels and function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of up to 70 male participants in this study. The target number of&#xD;
      completers is 25 male participants with genetically confirmed SBMA and 25 healthy male&#xD;
      participants who are age (plus or minus 5 years) and gender matched to the SBMA participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 months for data collection and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBMA participants will be seen for a baseline visit followed by a visit every six months for&#xD;
      a total of 5 visits (about 29 months). Healthy volunteers will have a single visit.&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
