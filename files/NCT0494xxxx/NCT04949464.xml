      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility of a smartphone-based human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV)-specific behavioral smoking cessation intervention that can be delivered at the time of&#xD;
      low dose computed tomography (LDCT), as measured by use of and engagement with the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the adherence to LDCT in a study setting for persons living with HIV (PLWH) who&#xD;
      smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the prevalence of positive LDCT screens and related follow-up procedures (which&#xD;
      may include any of the following: follow-up computed tomography [CT] scan at an interval less&#xD;
      than 12 months from the screening LDCT; (2) positron emission tomography (PET) with or&#xD;
      without CT scan; (3) transthoracic needle biopsy; (4) bronchoscopy, with or without biopsy;&#xD;
      (5) surgical biopsy and/or resection) in PLWH who smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quantify the proportions of persons who quit smoking at 3 and 6 months after using the&#xD;
      HIV-specific smoking cessation intervention and receiving LDCT screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Obtain preliminary estimate of the proportion of participants who use prescribed&#xD;
      nicotine replacement (self-reported) at 3-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify characteristics associated with PLWH who smoke who are more likely to engage with&#xD;
      an HIV-specific smoking cessation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quantify LDCT screening-related study endpoints (i.e. incident lung cancers, emphysema,&#xD;
      and other incidental findings in PLWH who smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare LDCT screening-relevant patient reported outcomes (anxiety, insomnia, pain) at 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after LDCT to evaluate screening tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients use the smartphone application, Positively Smoke Free - Mobile, for 42 days.&#xD;
      Patients also receive nicotine replacement therapy for 12 weeks. Within 60 days of study&#xD;
      registration, patients undergo LDCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive. Documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documentation of HIV diagnosis in the medical record by a licensed health care&#xD;
                  provider;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documentation of receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (at least two different&#xD;
                  medications that do not constitute a prescription for pre-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
                  [PrEP] or post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP]) by a licensed health care provider.&#xD;
                  Documentation may be a record of an ART prescription in the participant's medical&#xD;
                  record, a written prescription in the name of the participant for ART, or pill&#xD;
                  bottles for ART with a label showing the participant's name;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay&#xD;
                  demonstrating &gt; 1000 RNA copies/mL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay&#xD;
                  confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot&#xD;
                  confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a kit that has been certified or licensed by an&#xD;
        oversight body within the participating country and validated internally (e.g., U.S. Food&#xD;
        and Drug Administration [FDA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&#xD;
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is&#xD;
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test&#xD;
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a&#xD;
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus&#xD;
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving antiretroviral therapy and CD4 count at least 200 cells/uL within 6 months&#xD;
             of registration (due to increased risk of LDCT false positivity with CD4 count &lt;&#xD;
             200cells/uL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 45-80 years. This age restriction reflects lung cancer risk and appropriateness&#xD;
             for lung cancer screening; in epidemiologic studies lung cancer emerges 5-10 years&#xD;
             earlier in PLWH, and therefore this is an appropriate risk group for screening.&#xD;
             Although younger persons are likely to benefit more from smoking cessation as a lung&#xD;
             cancer prevention measure, the risk/benefit ratio associated with lung cancer&#xD;
             screening is unlikely to be optimal at ages &lt; 45 years for PLWH&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biochemically confirmed current smoker (exhaled carbon monoxide [CO] &gt;= 7 parts per&#xD;
             million)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria for LDCT (age&#xD;
             50-80 and &gt;= 20 pack-years smoking) or high-risk but not meeting USPSTF (age 45-49 and&#xD;
             &gt;= 20 pack-years smoking)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possession of a smartphone that can support Positively Smoke Free Mobile (PSF-M) (&gt;&#xD;
             95% of subjects had eligible phones in prior trials although researchers will include&#xD;
             specific study screening questions assessing for adequate smartphone for the&#xD;
             intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient literacy; &gt;= 4 on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short&#xD;
             Form (REALM-R) literacy scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any other smoking cessation interventions currently or within the prior 30&#xD;
             days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to nicotine replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pneumonia or serious lung infection in prior 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             major infection, malignant tumors (unless these tumors were: (a) completely resected&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinomas or (b) in-situ squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the cervix or anus), or any other major uncontrolled comorbid condition that would&#xD;
             limit life expectancy or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because computed tomography introduces&#xD;
             radiation exposure and may have teratogenic effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are breastfeeding (the safety of nicotine replacement therapy has not been&#xD;
             established with breastfeeding)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a chest computed tomography scan in the previous twelve months&#xD;
