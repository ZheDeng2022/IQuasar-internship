  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic behavioral treatment&#xD;
      -- Amplification of Positivity (AMP) -- intended to enhance positive social connections in&#xD;
      individuals with elevated anxiety and/or depression. Social relationship impairments are&#xD;
      common and debilitating consequences of anxiety and depression. Existing treatments have some&#xD;
      beneficial impact on social functioning; however, many people continue to have few and/or&#xD;
      poor quality relationships following treatment, even after experiencing symptom relief. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the effects of AMP on the brain systems that have been shown to be&#xD;
      important for establishing positive connections with others. Approximately 100 individuals&#xD;
      (ages 18-55) seeking treatment for anxiety or depression will participate in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned with equal probability to either AMP or stress&#xD;
      management training (SMT) (6 sessions each). Participants will be assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment and compared on measures assessing brain responses to social reward (primary&#xD;
      outcome), as well as physiological, behavioral, and emotional responses to social reward&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes). It is hypothesized that the AMP group will experience greater increases&#xD;
      from pre- to post-treatment in activity in brain systems that regulate the processing of&#xD;
      social reward cues (e.g., striatum) relative to participants in the SMT group. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that changes in brain activation to social reward from pre- to post-treatment&#xD;
      will be correlated with the degree of improvement in social connectedness.&#xD;
