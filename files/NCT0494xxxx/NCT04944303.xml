    <textblock>
      The effectiveness and safety of sugammadex were confirmed in pancreas kidney transplatation&#xD;
      patients for reversal of deep neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium.Sugmmadex can&#xD;
      reduce the length of PACU stay.&#xD;

      A randomized clinical trial was conducted between 18 December 2020 and 21 April 2021.A total&#xD;
      of forty patients who underwent simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation surgery.All&#xD;
      of the patients were randomized divided into normal saline group (Group C, n =20) and&#xD;
      sugammadex group (Group S, n =2). Group C did not receive any neuromuscular block&#xD;
      antagonist（NMBA). Group S received sugammadex 4 mg kg-1 at 1-2 post-tetanic counts for&#xD;
      reversal of rocuronium NMB. The neuromuscular blockade was monitored via a peripheral nerve&#xD;
      stimulator TOF watch SX acceleromyography. Patients received adequate doses of rocuronium to&#xD;
      maintain an enough neuromuscular blockade during the whole surgery. Serum creatinine (CREA),&#xD;
      blood glucose (Glu) levels were measured at T0, 8h(T1), 12h(T2), 36h(T3), 60h(T4), 84h(T5),&#xD;
      and 108h(T6), and blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and&#xD;
      stay time in PACU were recorded.&#xD;
