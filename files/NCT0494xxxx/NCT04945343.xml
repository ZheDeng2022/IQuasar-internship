      The aim of this work is to evaluate the long-term outcome of the graduates (those who&#xD;
      completed the gradual lengthening procedures), to better understand the full scope and&#xD;
      natural course of Growing Rods treatment for EOS and to have a glimpse of what happens to the&#xD;
      graduates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of progressive early onset scoliosis (EOS) is challenging. The natural history&#xD;
      can be severe deformity, restrictive lung disease, and early mortality . In the past, the&#xD;
      standard of care for these children was early definitive spinal fusion and instrumentation.&#xD;
      The belief was that a short and straight spine was superior to a long and deformed spine&#xD;
      despite the negative effects of a short trunk. The principles of EOS treatment have changed&#xD;
      with the appreciation that early fusion of the thoracic spine limits the growth of the spine&#xD;
      and lungs, and eventually leads to respiratory failure and increased mortality. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the cosmetic disfigurement from the disproportionate Trunk-Limb length is always not&#xD;
      acceptable by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical treatment strategy for EOS has evolved significantly with the use of modern&#xD;
      growth friendly implants, of these, Growing Rods(GR), first described by Moe and colleagues,&#xD;
      attempt to allow the growth of the spine and thorax while controlling curve progression to&#xD;
      preserve normal lung volume. Since then, several modifications and developments have been&#xD;
      made and introduced worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the mid to long-term follow up has seldom been reported in the literature. In&#xD;
      Assiut university hospital the investigators operated a fair amount of children with EOS&#xD;
      using growing rods starting 2009, with favourable short term results. The long-term outcome&#xD;
      of the graduates (those who completed the gradual lengthening procedures), remains yet to be&#xD;
      evaluated and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods and techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study: case series&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: Assiut University Hospitals, Department of Orthopaedics, Spine Surgery Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any patient with EOS who has been managed with GRs in our centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients whose parents or guardians are not willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with EOS operated in our centre who have completed the GR procedures and became&#xD;
      graduates since we started doing surgeries in 2009 to the present date. We expect to have&#xD;
      complete data for 30 patients during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Study tools (in detail, e.g., lab methods, instruments, steps, chemicals, ):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data sheet (Personal data, Cobb's angle, kyphosis angle, Shoulder balance, Coronal and&#xD;
           sagittal balance, Pelvic obliquity, T1-S1 height,Span-Height ratio, patient satisfaction&#xD;
           score (Likert scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early Onset Scoliosis 24-Item Questionnaire (EOSQ-24) Arabic version .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological assessment (Cobb's angle, kyphosis angle, Shoulder balance, Coronal and&#xD;
           sagittal balance, Pelvic obliquity, T1-S1 height, Implant Failure.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data will be collected and recorded using the REDCap to facilitate data recording,&#xD;
           analysis and creation of safe dedicated database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary (main):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Percentage of improvement in the functional outcome of these patients using the EOSQ-24,&#xD;
           Arabic Version)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary (subsidiary):&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-Patient satisfaction (Likert scale). 2 Trunk Height Gain (T1-S1 height). 3-Span-Height&#xD;
           ratio. 4-The degree of correction of the scoliosis and kyphosis. 5-Maintenance of&#xD;
           sagittal and coronal balance. Incidence of complications (PJK, DJK, recurrent&#xD;
           infections, neurology, crankshaft phenomenon, etc)&#xD;
