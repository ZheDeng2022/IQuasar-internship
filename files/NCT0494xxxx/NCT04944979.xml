    <description>The PedsQL™ Measurement Model is a modular approach to measuring health-related QoL in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The 23-item PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales were designed to measure the core dimension of health as delineated by the World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning.&#xD;
The total scale score (23 items) consists of Physical health summary score (8 items) and Psychosocial health summary score (15 items). Physical health summary includes Physical Functioning (8 items) and Psychosocial health summary score includes Emotional Functioning (5 items), Social Functioning (5 items) and School Functioning (5 items). The overall range for PedsQL scores is 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life.</description>
