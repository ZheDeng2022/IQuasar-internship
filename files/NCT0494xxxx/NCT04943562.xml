    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the viability of the combined use of wearable and portable&#xD;
      technologies for sleep staging. The results will be compared with polysomnography, in order&#xD;
      to achieve clinical and diagnostic validation. Three domains of devices will be used:&#xD;
      Movement sensors, wearable EEG band and smartphones&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be composed of two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, the use of the combination of actigraphy and EEG will be used for sleep&#xD;
      staging in a sample of 12 healthy volunteers from 20 to 40 years old, both genders and with&#xD;
      no sleep disorders for each combination of ACT+EEG. Considering there will two of each (thus&#xD;
      four combinations), the final sample will be composed of 48 individuals. Once recruited,&#xD;
      evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consented with the terms of&#xD;
      this study, the participants will be referred to the sleep lab, in which they will undergo a&#xD;
      full night type-1 in lab polysomnography, following the setup recommended by the American&#xD;
      Academy of Sleep Medicine. Concomitantly with the polysomnography, the participants will also&#xD;
      use the combination of ACT+EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, the most successful combination tested in the first stage will be tested&#xD;
      in a clinical sample, composed by 60 participants from both genders, from 20 to 60 years old&#xD;
      and with at least one sleep disorder or complaint. Among these, at least 30% of the sample&#xD;
      should have moderate to severe insomnia, 30% should have high risk to sleep apnea and 70%&#xD;
      should have excessive sleepiness scale. All the procedures, including the polysomnography&#xD;
      will be performed identically to the first step.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the viability of the combined use of wearable and portable&#xD;
      technologies for sleep staging. The results will be compared with polysomnography, in order&#xD;
      to achieve clinical and diagnostic validation. Three domains of devices will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Movement sensors: Devices equipped with movement sensors (such as an accelerometer) able&#xD;
           to monitor movement over the using period, converting this information in data related&#xD;
           to the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In this category, the reference devices are the&#xD;
           actimeters/actigraphs (ACT). Its use is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep&#xD;
           Medicine to the diagnosis of insomnia and circadian sleep disorders, and should be used&#xD;
           for 3 to 14 consecutive days. Other wearable devices, such as smartwatches, are also&#xD;
           used with the same purpose, although not validated for clinical use. In this study two&#xD;
           wearable devices with movement sensors will be used, with the following minimal&#xD;
           specifications: accelerometer in three axes, minimal sampling rate of 25Hz, maximum&#xD;
           weight of 100g, battery lasting at least a week and support for Bluetooth connection.&#xD;
           The desirable criteria are: light, body temperature and hearth rhythm sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wearable EEG band: EEG is a mandatory feature for type-1 polysomnography and a&#xD;
           requirement for regular sleep staging. In this project, the EEG will be used in&#xD;
           combination with actigraphy to allow a better estimation of sleep stages. In this study&#xD;
           two wearable EEG bands will be tested, with the following minimal specifications: dry&#xD;
           EEG electrode (no need of paste, gel or other conductor), presented as a head band or&#xD;
           stripe, minimal sampling rate of 500Hz, noise, high and low filters, battery lasting at&#xD;
           least 8h, maximum weight of 200g (including the whole device) and support for Bluetooth&#xD;
           connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smartphones: Additionally to the movement sensors and the EEG bands, the evaluation of&#xD;
           sleep pattern will be based on smartphone-based accelerometers. This is the most common&#xD;
           approach among the currently available sleep tracking applications, although is the&#xD;
           least accurate. In this project the smartphones will be equipped with SleepUp's app and&#xD;
           its sleep tracking functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be composed of three stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, the use of the combination of actigraphy and EEG will be used for sleep&#xD;
      staging in a sample of 12 healthy volunteers from 20 to 40 years old, both genders and with&#xD;
      no sleep disorders for each combination of ACT+EEG. Considering there will two of each (thus&#xD;
      four combinations), the final sample will be composed of 48 individuals. Once recruited,&#xD;
      evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consented with the terms of&#xD;
      this study, the participants will be referred to the sleep lab, in which they will undergo a&#xD;
      full night type-1 in lab polysomnography, following the setup recommended by the American&#xD;
      Academy of Sleep Medicine. Concomitantly with the polysomnography, the participants will also&#xD;
      use the combination of ACT+EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, the most successful combination tested in the first stage will be tested&#xD;
      in a clinical sample, composed by 60 participants from both genders, from 20 to 60 years old&#xD;
      and with at least one sleep disorder or complaint. Among these, at least 30% of the sample&#xD;
      should have moderate to severe insomnia (as measured by the insomnia severity index), 30%&#xD;
      should have high risk to sleep apnea (as measured by the STOP-BANG questionnaire) and 70%&#xD;
      should have excessive sleepiness scale (as measured by the Epworth sleepiness scale). All the&#xD;
      procedures, including the polysomnography will be performed identically to the first step.&#xD;
