  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effects of botulinum neurotoxin&#xD;
      type A (BoNT-A) injection applied to the ankle plantar flexor muscles on lower extremity&#xD;
      sensation and quantitative balance parameters in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral&#xD;
      palsy who are ambulatory without an assistive device in daily life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of movement and posture disorders that limit activity&#xD;
      and participation, that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances in the developing&#xD;
      fetus or infant brain. One of the main clinical findings of CP is postural control disorder.&#xD;
      Many concomitant impairments such as joint range of motion limitations, spasticity,&#xD;
      contractures, sensory deficits and loss of selective motor control contribute to postural&#xD;
      control disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common causes of motor dysfunction in children with CP is the presence of&#xD;
      spasticity. Spasticity in the ankle plantar flexor muscles and weakness in the dorsiflexor&#xD;
      muscles are the main factors that cause gait disturbance. Thus, impairments in gait function&#xD;
      cause limitation of postural stability. Although there are many methods in spasticity&#xD;
      management, BoNT-A injections have been used effectively and safely for many years,&#xD;
      especially in reducing ankle plantar flexor spasticity. There are limited number of studies&#xD;
      in the literature investigating the effect of BoNT-A injection on postural control in&#xD;
      children with spastic CP, and only one study included children with spastic hemiplegic&#xD;
      (unilateral) CP and it was clearly highlighted that new studies are needed in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reclassification of CP acknowledges the contribution of impaired sensation in motor&#xD;
      performance. Although it has been shown that somatosensory deficits in the lower extremities&#xD;
      of children with spastic CP can negatively affect gait and balance, the effect of spasticity&#xD;
      in the ankle has not been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effects of BoNT injection applied&#xD;
      to the ankle plantar flexor muscles on lower extremity sensation and quantitative balance&#xD;
      parameters in children with spastic hemiplegic CP who are ambulatory without an assistive&#xD;
      device in daily life.&#xD;
