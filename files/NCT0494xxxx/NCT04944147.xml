  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate effects of brain stimulation-assisted cognitive&#xD;
      training in patients with persistent subjective or objective cognitive impairment after&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term persistent symptoms occur in a substantial number of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). First evidence suggests that long-term symptoms develop&#xD;
      not only after severe courses of the disease, but also after less serious illness and include&#xD;
      various symptoms such as fatigue and impaired memory, concentration or sleep. During&#xD;
      recovery, these symptoms present a heavy burden for patients, who then often experience&#xD;
      psychological distress and reduced quality of life. The goal of the present study is to&#xD;
      assess the effects of cognitive training alone or in combination with tDCS on cognitive&#xD;
      performance, quality of life and mental health in patients with subjective or objective&#xD;
      cognitive impairments following post-COVID disease. Patients will either participate in a&#xD;
      three-week cognitive training with concurrent online high-definition tDCS application or&#xD;
      placebo (&quot;sham&quot;) tDCS or participate in an evidence-based muscle relaxation training combined&#xD;
      with placebo tDCS. We hypothesize that cognitive training with sham or active tDCS will&#xD;
      result in more pronounced improvement on a transfer task compared to the control group. We&#xD;
      also hypothesize that training combined with anodal tDCS will lead to significantly higher&#xD;
      performance on a transfer task than training combined with sham tDCS. Additionally, we will&#xD;
      determine effects on specifically trained and other untrained cognitive functions immediately&#xD;
      after the intervention as well as their maintenance one month later.&#xD;
