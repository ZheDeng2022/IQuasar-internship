  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assist with the development of a first, truly non-invasive&#xD;
      technology for blood glucose monitoring, which will have the potential to eliminate the need&#xD;
      for painful finger pricking or expensive continuous blood glucose monitor use. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to collect biometric data, such as bioimpedance (how well the body impedes&#xD;
      electric current flow), from participants who are living with type 2 diabetes. A&#xD;
      proof-of-concept prototype (non-invasive continuous glucose monitor; NI-CGM) will be used to&#xD;
      collect this biometric data. The data will then be used to develop and refine a computer&#xD;
      model that can be used to predict blood glucose levels (BGLs). Individuals with diabetes&#xD;
      experience a great range of blood BGLs throughout their daily life and activities, therefore&#xD;
      it is essential to gather biometric data corresponding to this large range to build a&#xD;
      computer model, to ensure model reliability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted over a two-week period where the participants are required to&#xD;
      wear the prototype, that will continuously collect the biometric data. Participants are&#xD;
      required to use this device together with two existing commercially available blood glucose&#xD;
      meters that are considered management routine for diabetes (an Abbott FreeStyle Libre and an&#xD;
      Accu-ChekÂ® Mobile), throughout the duration of the study. The majority of the study is&#xD;
      carried out independently, by the participants, where they wear the prototype throughout&#xD;
      their daily life and activities. The data collected from the non-invasive custom-built device&#xD;
      and the existing blood glucose meters will be used to develop a computer model that will&#xD;
      allow for blood glucose levels to be predicted, over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not interfere with any of the participants' diabetes management plans provided&#xD;
      to them, by their regular doctor, under regular care, such as medications, diet and current&#xD;
      use of blood glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that the bioimoedance data collected using the non-invasive prototype&#xD;
      device, in conjunction with existing devices used in diabetes management, will enable the&#xD;
      development of a computer model that allows for blood glucose levels to be predicted in&#xD;
      people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
