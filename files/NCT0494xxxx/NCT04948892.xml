  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concerns cesarean sections, category 1, meaning those cases where the life of&#xD;
      mother and/or fetus is in immedeate danger and the child must be delivered within 15 minutes&#xD;
      from activating the cesarean section team. In most hospitals in Denmark, these cesarean&#xD;
      sections are most often performed in general anesthesia and the mother is endotracheally&#xD;
      intubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously in these situations, as the mother was rushed from the Labour Ward to the&#xD;
      operation room (OR), her spouse/partner, would be placed outside the operating room (OR), and&#xD;
      would stay there until the child had been delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Lillebaelt Hospital, Kolding, Denmark, the newborn-resuscitation table is placed inside&#xD;
      the OR. The father would most often be allowed to enter the OR when the child was delivered&#xD;
      and placed on the resuscitation table (no matter the status of the child).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, during spring 2021, Lillebaelt Hospital Kolding updated the policy regarding the&#xD;
      handling of the father/partner during cesarean section category 1. Now the father/partner is&#xD;
      present in the OR during the whole procedure, including induction of general aesthesia,&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation, performance of the cesarean section (drapings are positioned so that&#xD;
      the father cannot see the operation field) and potential resuscitation efforts of the&#xD;
      newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another hospital in the same region (Region of Southern Denmark), Aabenraa Hospital, the&#xD;
      father is not present in the OR during the cesarean section. He waits in the labour ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore wish to investigate how the cesarean section category 1 is&#xD;
      experienced by: the father/partner; the mother; the obstetrician; the anestesiologist; the&#xD;
      midwife; the OR nurse; the anesthetic nurse, both in Kolding where the father/partner is&#xD;
      present in the OR, and in Aabenraa, where the father/partner is not present in the OR during&#xD;
      the cesarean sectio.&#xD;
