  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the performance of different camera imaging&#xD;
      systems in assessing the positive predictive values and sensitivity of OTL38 to detect folate&#xD;
      positive ovarian cancer cancers using the gold standard of pathologic review.&#xD;

      Patients will be seen in the Ovarian Cancer Clinic. Patients that have or are suspected to&#xD;
      have ovarian cancer, and are candidates for debulking surgery based on the clinician&#xD;
      evaluation, may be considered candidates for this study. As over 90% of ovarian epithelial&#xD;
      cancers express folate receptor, we would expect a high percentage of these patients&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery, to have eligible cancer types for entry into the study. These patients&#xD;
      will be prospectively consented to participate in this trial. There will be no randomization&#xD;
      or control group and only patients previously scheduled to undergo surgery will be eligible&#xD;
      to participate. We anticipate a 2-year period will be necessary to reach our accrual goal of&#xD;
      up to 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patients will receive a one-time dose of 0.025 mg/kg of&#xD;
      OTL38, infused over approximately 60 minutes and completed at least 1 hour prior to&#xD;
      intraoperative imaging. As a prophylactic measure, we recommend 25mg of IV Benadryl to the&#xD;
      patient prior to the infusion of OTL38 to decrease the possibility of a hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of surgical procedures to resect ovarian cancers varies substantially, anywhere&#xD;
      from 3- 8 hours or more. During the phase 2 study, the median time spent imaging the patients&#xD;
      with a single camera was 14 minutes. Utilizing two cameras to complete imaging would not&#xD;
      overly increase the duration of time patients spend under anesthesia. However, there is a&#xD;
      chance that being under anesthesia for the additional 25-35 minutes could put the patient at&#xD;
      an increased risk of having of a common side effect associated with anesthesia. These common&#xD;
      side effects include, but are not limited to: nausea and vomiting after surgery, sore throat&#xD;
      and hoarseness, shivering/chills, confusion, and muscle aches&#xD;

    <description>The study drug in question is an Investigational New Drug (IND), folate analog ligand conjugated with an indole cyanine green-like dye called OTL38. There will be a single dose of 0.025 mg/kg for intravenous injection over approximately 60 minutes, completed at least 1 hour prior to intraoperative imaging</description>
