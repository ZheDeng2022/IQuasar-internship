      The aim of the current study was to evaluate the knowledge of Chinese gastroenterologists on&#xD;
      vaccinating patients with IBD under the assistance of Chinese Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation.&#xD;
      The Chinese Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation (CCCF) is the first nonprofit,volunteer-driven&#xD;
      foundation specifically for patients with IBD in China.It has been joined by IBD specialists&#xD;
      at various hospitals in China.&#xD;

      The questionnaire contained questions regarding the respondents'information, including their&#xD;
      gender, years in practice, clinical specialty,and source of knowledge on immunization&#xD;
      practices. The questionnaire mainly contained three sections: knowledge of vaccinations for&#xD;
      hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, and varicella; current vaccination practices for the IBD group;&#xD;
      and reasons for not recommending these vaccinations to patients with IBD. The questionnaire&#xD;
      composed of 13 items specifically on the three vaccinations mentioned above for&#xD;
      immunosuppressed patients with IBD. All questions were conducted based on recognized&#xD;
      guidelines and were reviewed by 18 IBD experts. The questionnaire captured the frequency with&#xD;
      which the respondents assessed patients with IBD for anti-HAV/hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
      (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis B surface antibody/ anti-HAV levels, and&#xD;
      acquired infection and immunization histories. Whether the respondents recommended these&#xD;
      three vaccines to the IBD group before treatment was also elicited.&#xD;
