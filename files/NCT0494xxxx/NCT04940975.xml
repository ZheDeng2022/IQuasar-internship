    <textblock>
      Introduction. Sleep problems are a health issue worldwide. Based on the&#xD;
      Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance model and the theory of occupational balance, we&#xD;
      developed an occupation-based sleep program to address several objectives by lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention: 1) minimize the influence of bodily function on sleep; 2) promote an&#xD;
      environment conductive to sleep; and 3) restructure daytime activity with a focus on&#xD;
      occupational balance through psychoeducation and lifestyle coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an occupation-based sleep&#xD;
      intervention on sleep pattern, mood, and occupational balance among community-dwelling adults&#xD;
      with insomnia when compared with other, more usual, forms of treatment, typically focused on&#xD;
      education, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. A total of 42 subjects were recruited: 22 for the&#xD;
      intervention group and 20 for the treatment as usual group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of occupation-based sleep program&#xD;
      for patients with insomnia. It compares the treatment outcomes of sleep pattern, mood, and&#xD;
      occupational balance between an intervention group (occupation-based sleep program) and a&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) group (sleep hygiene education and relaxation training) upon&#xD;
      completion of their respective programs and at one-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occupation-based sleep program includes both group and individual sessions. Each group&#xD;
      consists of 4 to 6 patients. Each session last for two hours and are held on a weekly basis.&#xD;
      Group session focus on sharing information and goal setting to facilitate the formation of&#xD;
      good habits and positively restructure lifestyle. Individual coaching sessions aim to follow&#xD;
      up on action planning to promote occupational balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a quasi-experimental design. The participants of the intervention group&#xD;
      attended the occupation-based sleep program in general outpatient clinic A. Participants in&#xD;
      the comparison group received TAU in a general outpatient clinic B of another district. The&#xD;
      three time-points for collection of outcome data are at baseline (T1), after the intervention&#xD;
      (week 8) (T2), and a one-month post intervention follow up (week 12) (T3). The outcomes will&#xD;
      be collected by a blinded assessor who is not involved in the delivery or administration of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The inclusion criteria for recruitment of participants are: 1) diagnosis of&#xD;
      insomnia disorder, 2) referral by general practitioner; 3) aged 18 to 65 years old; 4)&#xD;
      Insomnia Severity Index score over 14; 5) regularly uses a smart phone, which enable data&#xD;
      synchronization with the MiBand2 activity wristband; 6) able to complete self-administered&#xD;
      study questionnaires and 7) able to communicate in Cantonese. The exclusion criteria are: 1)&#xD;
      diagnosis of severe mental illness; 2) Personal Health Questionnaire 9 (measures depressive&#xD;
      symptoms), score over 19 and/or anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorder 7 score over 15);&#xD;
      3) On regular pain medication during the last month, for more than 3 days per week); 4) sleep&#xD;
      affected by respiratory disease or 5) regular user of alcohol or addictive substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures of the study are insomnia and sleep quality, and the secondary&#xD;
      measures are measures of occupational balance, depression, and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cantonese Version Insomnia Severity Index (C-ISI). The C-ISI is a self-report questionnaire&#xD;
      that measures the severity of insomnia. A higher score indicate more severe insomnia: Total&#xD;
      of 0-7 = No clinically significant insomnia 8-14 = Subthreshold insomnia 15-21 = Clinical&#xD;
      insomnia (moderate severity) 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe). Previous studies have&#xD;
      reported adequate psychometric properties for both the English and Chinese versions.&#xD;
      Reliability is excellent (α = 0.90-0.91). Sensitivity and specificity at cut-off 10 were&#xD;
      86.1% and 87.7%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chinese Version Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (C-PSQI). The C-PSQI is a self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire that measures sleep quality. The questions focus on seven aspects of sleep: 1)&#xD;
      quality; 2) latency; 3) duration; 4) efficiency; 5) disturbance; 6) use of sleep medication;&#xD;
      7) daytime dysfunction. Under the seven component scores, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3&#xD;
      (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to&#xD;
      21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.The psychometric properties of the PSQI have&#xD;
      been well documented. The Chinese translated version demonstrated good internal consistency&#xD;
      (α = 0.82-0.83), and acceptable test-retest reliability over a 14- to 21-day intervals (r =&#xD;
      0.77) for patient with insomnia. It demonstrated good convergent validity, with significant&#xD;
      correlations with sleep quality-visual analogues scale and sleep diary. It could&#xD;
      differentiate people with and without insomnia, sensitive and specificity of 98% and 55%&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity Wristband. The Mi Band 2 is a commercially available activity wristband commonly&#xD;
      used for measuring activity level and sleep pattern. A recent research stated that three&#xD;
      types of CAM (including Mi Band 2, the device selected for use in the present study) were&#xD;
      good at detecting the most basic parameters, actual time spent in bed. MiBand2 that was&#xD;
      selected for this study monitors a user's sleep and physical activity neutrally. It provides&#xD;
      objective data on sleep duration on a weekly basis, including information about sleep&#xD;
      duration, number of nighttime awakenings, and typical sleeping habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OB-Quest). The OB-Quest is a self-completed questionnaire&#xD;
      developed to measure occupational balance in daily life, It focuses on satisfaction with the&#xD;
      amount and variation of occupation. It consists of 13 items measured on six-step ordinal&#xD;
      scales, and a lower score indicates a better balance. The internal consistency of the&#xD;
      OB-Quest is 0.9, and test-retest reliability is also 0.9. A translation and validation study&#xD;
      of the Chinese OB-Quest was completed. The study results showed that the Chinese version of&#xD;
      OB-Quest can be readily used for research with Chinese persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9). PHQ9 is a self-administered version of part of the&#xD;
      Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) diagnostic instrument for common&#xD;
      mental disorders. It is the depression module of the PHQ, which scores each of the nine&#xD;
      Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual version 4 (DSM-IV) criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot;&#xD;
      (nearly every day). It has been validated for use in primary care, for monitoring the&#xD;
      severity of depression and response to treatment. A higher total score indicate more severe&#xD;
      depression. It is commonly used for screening depression. PHQ9 is a reliable tool with good&#xD;
      reliability and validity. The psychometric properties for patients with depression in a&#xD;
      Chinese primary care population were found to be acceptable to good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD 7). This questionnaire is part of the PRIME-MD diagnostic&#xD;
      instrument for common mental disorders. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) is a&#xD;
      seven-item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety&#xD;
      disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms&#xD;
      over the past two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response&#xD;
      categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and ' nearly'. The Cut&#xD;
      points of 5, 10, and 15 might be interpreted as representing mild, moderate, and severe&#xD;
      levels of anxiety on the GAD-7. Previous studies have shown GAD7 to have a high degree of&#xD;
      reliability and validity, as well as high internal consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (Version 25) is&#xD;
      used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic&#xD;
      characteristics and outcomes. The baselines of the two groups were compared by t test and&#xD;
      Chi-square. Repeated measure ANOVA (General Linear Model) was used to analyze the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the program. Pairwise difference was tested on the outcomes between&#xD;
      different time points (baseline vs. post treatment, post treatment vs. one-month follow-up),&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
