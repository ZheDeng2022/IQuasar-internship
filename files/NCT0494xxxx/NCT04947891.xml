      In order to establish the specialist consensus of the integration of posterior approach&#xD;
      surgical treatment and postoperative intensive recovery management, and verify its safety,&#xD;
      practicability and reliability, this study enrolled 130 patients with CSM or OPLL undergoing&#xD;
      C3-7 open-door laminoplasty. Patients are divided in two groups randomly. The study group has&#xD;
      80 patients, treated with postoperative intensive recovery management, and the control group&#xD;
      has 50 patients. The data is collected preoperatively, at 3-month follow-up and 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Intensive recovery management includes 3 parts: (1) Preoperative analgesia and airway evaluation. (2) The protection and reconstruction of the musculo-ligamentous complex during the surgery, the safe intubation, and the local infiltration anesthesia during surgery. (3) Collar free, multimodal analgesia, airway management, and early recovery after surgery.</description>
