      The purpose of this study is to learn more about pregnant women's' experience with Reach Out,&#xD;
      Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of newborns (ROSE) and to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the ROSE program in preventing and reducing post-partum depressive symptoms, decreasing&#xD;
      stress, and increasing social support among pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-phase study, including a feasibility phase (Pilot, Phase 1), and an outcomes&#xD;
      evaluation phase (Phase 2). Phase 1 tests the acceptability and feasibility of a postpartum&#xD;
      depression prevention intervention among pregnant women attending a prenatal clinic in Sunset&#xD;
      Park, Brooklyn. NYU research staff will be trained to implement this intervention. Based on&#xD;
      the feedback received from women and staff in phase 1, the intervention will be modified&#xD;
      accordingly. Phase 2 will be an outcomes evaluation to test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention to decrease maternal stress and depressive symptoms, and increase perceived&#xD;
      social support and self-efficacy among new mothers.&#xD;
