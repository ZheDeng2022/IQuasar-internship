      To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of arthroscopic inlay bristow procedure in&#xD;

      Aim: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes following the arthroscopic Chinese&#xD;
      Unique Inlay Bristow (Cuistow) procedure and the arthroscopic Bristow procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The Cuistow procedure is a modified Bristow surgery in which a Mortise and Tenon&#xD;
      structure was added to the contact surface between the coracoid tip and the glenoid. In&#xD;
      previous retrospective study, patients received Cuistow procedure have satisfying clinical&#xD;
      performance and excellent postoperative bone healing rate (96.1%). However, no prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 70 patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability were included and&#xD;
      randomized to either an arthroscopic Cuistow procedure or arthroscopic Bristow procedure.&#xD;
      Radiological evaluations with 3D CT scan were performed preoperatively, immediately after the&#xD;
      operation, and postoperatively at three months and during the final follow-up (more than 2&#xD;
      years). Clinical assessment for a minimum of 24 months including the 10-point visual analog&#xD;
      scale for pain and subjective instability, University of California at Los Angeles scoring&#xD;
      system (UCLA score), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES score), ROWE score,&#xD;
      Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) and active range of motion were completed by independent&#xD;
      observers and analyzed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2-year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES score (Michener 2002) is a 10-item measure of shoulder pain and function. Pain is assessed on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and accounts for 50% of the total score. The remaining 50% of the score is determined by the responses to 10 4-point Likert-scale questions related to physical function.</description>

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score is the most commonly used to describe pain levels in patients, ranging from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating more intense pain.</description>
