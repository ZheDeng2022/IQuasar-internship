  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal radial access (DRA) has recently introduced and previous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that it is feasible option, showing several advantages including less bleeding and&#xD;
      access-site complications over proximal radial access (PRA). Previous study reported the&#xD;
      feasibility of DRA as an alternative option for primary percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) in STEMI patients without major complication. However, comparison study of each&#xD;
      vascular access for primary PCI have not been conducted until now. Here, The investigators&#xD;
      aim to compare the DRA, PRA and femoral access (FA), in terms of feasibility and safety, in&#xD;
      patients with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study with patients who underwent primary PCI for STEMI between March&#xD;
      2020 to May 2021. The primary outcome of this study is the access-site complication including&#xD;
      major bleeding requiring transfusion or surgery, hematoma and arterial occlusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, DRA has gained the interest of interventional cardiologists and previous studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated several advantages including patient and operator comfort, shorter&#xD;
      hemostasis duration, less bleeding, and access-site complications over PRA. More recently,&#xD;
      randomized trial demonstrated that DRA prevents radial artery occlusion after the procedure&#xD;
      compared with PRA. From this perspective, DRA could be considered an alternative access route&#xD;
      for primary PCI in selected STEMI patients using potent P2Y12 inhibitors such as ticagrelor&#xD;
      or prasugrel, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.&#xD;
