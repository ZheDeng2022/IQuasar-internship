      This a prospective observational study will be conducted on 100 patients who were diagnosed&#xD;
      as SARS-CoV2 positive. The data will be collected from isolation hospital in Sohag&#xD;
      governorate during the period from the start of June 2021 to the end of July 2021. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for at least one month to evaluate the prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with SARS-CoV2 positive PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease Chronic renal failure Patients with&#xD;
      malabsorption Organ transplant recipient Pregnant women The study protocol will be approved&#xD;
      by the scientific Research Ethical committee, Faculty of Medicine, Sohag University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data will be collected after taken informed written consent from the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about clinical manifestation including as fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue and diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBC , liver function tests, CRP, D-dimer Serum creatinine, Random blood sugar, Serum ferritin&#xD;
      and zwsVitamin D level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment the severity of the disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were classified into severe or mild cases based on results from chest radiography,&#xD;
      clinical examination, and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mild symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, expectoration, and other upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract symptoms), and without abnormalities, or with mild changes on chest radiography, were&#xD;
      classified as non-severe types. A mild change in chest radiography is defined by multiple&#xD;
      small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, mainly in the outer zone of the lung and under&#xD;
      the pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe pneumonia was defined by the presence of any of the following conditions: i)&#xD;
      significantly increased respiration rate (RR): RR ≥30 times/minute; ii) hypoxia: oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (resting state) ≤93%; iii) blood gas analysis: partial pressure of oxygen/fraction&#xD;
      of inspired oxygen (PaO2) /FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg (millimeters of Mercury); or iv) the occurrence&#xD;
      of respiratory or other organ failure that require Intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and&#xD;
      treatment, or shock 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median and interquartile&#xD;
      range and compared with the student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test according to the&#xD;
      distribution of data. Categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages and&#xD;
      compared using the chi squared test or the Fisher exact test as appropriate. Spearman P rho&#xD;
      was used to assess the relationships between serum 25OHD levels and several clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters. P value will be considered significant if it was less than 0.05.&#xD;
