      Aims of this research are to detect if an improvement in sleep pattern in patients suffering&#xD;
      from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), produces a reduction in pain and dysfunction in the&#xD;
      orofacial area by examining variation in temporo-mandibular disorder (TMD) signs and symptoms&#xD;
      and if the prevalence of TMDs in OSA patients controlling this disease decreases to levels&#xD;
      comparable to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      41 OSA patients will undergo a complete TMD examination prior to start any OSA treatment and&#xD;
      after at least 18 months of therapy. Variations in TMD signs and symptoms will be recorded.&#xD;

      Since a bidirectional relationship has been suggested for poor sleep and pain and considering&#xD;
      that patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been reported to present a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of temporo-mandibular disorder (TMD) signs and symptoms compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls; aims of this research are to detect if an improvement in sleep pattern in patients&#xD;
      suffering from OSA, produces a reduction in pain and dysfunction in the orofacial area by&#xD;
      examining variation in TMD signs and symptoms and if the prevalence of TMDs in OSA patients&#xD;
      controlling this disease decreases to levels comparable to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      41 OSA patients will undergo a complete TMD examination prior to start any OSA treatment and&#xD;
      after at least 18 months of therapy. Variations in TMD signs and symptoms will be recorded.&#xD;
