      • This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, positive-controlled&#xD;
      phase III study to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of SYN008 versus omalizumab for&#xD;
      injection (Xolair®) in the treatment of CSU patients who remain symptomatic despite&#xD;
      antihistamine treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 340 patients with H1 antihistamines (H1AH) refractory CSU will be&#xD;
      randomized into two treatments arms (SYN008 300 mg s.c., and omalizumab 300 mg s.c.) at a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. Both SYN008 and omalizumab will be injected every 4 weeks as an add-on therapy on top&#xD;
      of H1AH treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three distinct epochs over 27 weeks, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening epoch: Day -21 to Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized-treatment epoch: Day 1 to Week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment follow-up epoch: Week 1&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline in the Weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS7) at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the itch was recorded by the patient twice daily in their Diary, on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe). Baseline ISS7 was calculated 7 days prior to the first treatment date. A weekly score (ISS7) was derived by adding up the average daily scores of the seven days preceding the visit. The possible range of the weekly score was therefore 0 to 21, where 0 is the best score and 21 is the worst score. The complete itch response was defined as ISS7 = 0.&#xD;
Itch (Pruritus) Severity Score Scale:&#xD;
0 = None&#xD;
= Mild (minimal awareness, easily tolerated)&#xD;
= Moderate (definite awareness, bothersome but tolerable)&#xD;
= Severe (difficult to tolerate)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline in Urticaria Activity Score Over 7 Days (UAS7) at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>UAS7 is the sum of the NHS7 and the ISS7 scores. The possible range of the weekly UAS7 score is 0 to 42. A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline in Weekly Number of Hives Score (NHS7) at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Hives Severity Score (HSS), defined by number of hives, were recorded by the patient once daily in their Diary, on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe). A weekly number of hives score (NHS7) was derived by adding up the average daily scores of the seven days preceding the visit. The possible range of the weekly score was therefore 0 to 21. The complete hives response was defined as NHS7 = 0.&#xD;
Hives Severity Score scale:&#xD;
0 = None&#xD;

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with UAS7≤6</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>UAS7 is the sum of the NHS7 and the ISS7 scores. The possible range of the weekly UAS7 score is 0 to 42. A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Week 12 responders were defined as patients who achieved an absolute UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 12. A patient with missing data at Week 12 was imputed as a responder if the patient was a responder at Week 10 and Week 11, otherwise as a non-responder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation analysis between baseline changes of ISS7/UAS7 and baseline IgE level</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days. UAS7 is the sum of the NHS7 and the ISS7 scores.A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. CSU patients' baseline IgE level correlates with the improvement to a certain extent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to ISS7 minimal important differences (MID) response</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching. A negative change score indicates improvement.&#xD;
The MID response for weekly itch severity score was defined as a reduction from baseline in weekly itch severity score of 5 points or more. The time to weekly itch severity score MID response was defined as the time (in weeks) from Day 1 to the study week when weekly itch severity score MID response was first achieved.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with ISS7 MID response</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MID response for weekly itch severity score was defined as a reduction from baseline in weekly itch severity score of 5 points or more. This outcome measure shows the percentage of participants classified as MID Responders at Week 12, meaning their weekly itch severity scores at Week 12 were at least 5 points lower than at Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology life quality index (DLQI) is a 10-item dermatology- specific health-related quality of life measure. Patients rated their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives. An overall score was calculated as well as separate scores for the following domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, treatment. Each domain had 4 response categories ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). &quot;Not relevant&quot; is a valid score also and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of all 10 responses. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment.</description>
