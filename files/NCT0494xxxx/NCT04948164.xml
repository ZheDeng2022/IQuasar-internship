      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of sumatriptan naproxen sodium succinate tablets in the treatment of&#xD;
      acute migraine attacks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common chronic nerve vascular disease, the disease characteristic to break out&#xD;
      repeatedly, one side or both sides of the pulsatile partial side head, severe headache and&#xD;
      can combine autonomic nervous system dysfunction such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and&#xD;
      fear the symptom such as, about one-third of patients with migraine aura symptoms can appear&#xD;
      before the onset of the nervous system. Sulaptan is a 5-HT1 receptor agonist with a high&#xD;
      affinity for binding to 5-HT1b and 5-HT1D receptors. Naproxen is an NSAID that inhibs the&#xD;
      synthesis of inflammatory mediators. Thus, sulaptan and naproxen alleviate migraine through&#xD;
      different pharmacological mechanisms of action. For this test center, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Ⅲ phase of clinical trial, aimed to verify&#xD;
      shu Ma Putan naproxen sodium treatment of acute migraine headache, headache complete&#xD;
      remission rate after 2 hours, evaluation of succinic acid shu Ma Putan naproxen sodium&#xD;
      tablets for efficacy and safety of the treatment of acute migraine attacks.&#xD;
