  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study was designed to assess the agreement between the recently marketed&#xD;
      electromyographic neuromuscular blockade monitor Tetragraph® (Senzime, Uppsala, Sweden) and&#xD;
      the TOF Watch® SX (Organon Teknika B.V., Boxtel, Holland), an accelerometric neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade monitor frequently used in clinical practice&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the induction of general anesthesia both monitors will be placed in the same arm.&#xD;
      After induction of general anesthesia and before neuromuscular blocking agent administration&#xD;
      both devices will be consecutively calibrated and a baseline measurement will be obtained.&#xD;
      During the surgical procedure the investigators will monitor neuromuscular function with one&#xD;
      of the two devices. Then the investigators will switch the device used as a guide between&#xD;
      subsequent patients. The protocol will start as soon as the leading device will register a&#xD;
      train-of-four ratio (TOFr) ≥ 0.2. During the protocol a comparison between the two devices&#xD;
      will be conducted as soon as the device used as a guide will display a TOFr ≥ 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,&#xD;
      0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1. For each of the TOFr reported, we will deliver two subsequent TOF&#xD;
      stimulations with the guiding device followed by two TOF stimulations with the other monitor.&#xD;
      Both the stimulations delivered by each device and the two consecutive stimulations delivered&#xD;
      by different monitors will be conducted 20 sec from one another. Stimulations with the same&#xD;
      device will be used to assess intraobserver variability for each methodology, while the&#xD;
      second and the third measurements (consecutive stimulations with different devices) will be&#xD;
      used to assess agreement between them. The protocol will end when the leading device will&#xD;
      show a TOFr ≥ 1.0, or if, at the end of the surgical procedure, acceleromyographic TOFr will&#xD;
      be &gt; 0.9.&#xD;
