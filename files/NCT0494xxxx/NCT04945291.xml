      This research aims to measure anew way of calories counting using a mobile app on weight loss&#xD;
      and adherence to the mobile app. The participants should be adults who is overweight or obese&#xD;
      and should have a smartphone with access to the internet. The participants will fill a&#xD;
      baseline survey, take the height and weight measurements, watch a video about the use of the&#xD;
      calories counting and app. A follow up visit will be in 4 weeks to take the height and weight&#xD;
      measurements and fill a questionnaire. There is an option for the participants to continue&#xD;
      with the research for additional 11 months with visit at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity has been recognized as a disease by the American Medical Association in 2013. It has&#xD;
      been alarmingly on the rise over the past two decades, especially in the MENA region. In&#xD;
      Lebanon, 53.5% of the population is overweight and 18.16% obese. Self-monitoring, as part of&#xD;
      behavioral interventions, is beneficial for weight loss, especially in the context of mobile&#xD;
      application interventions. However, estimation of the food portions for proper food logging&#xD;
      remains a challenge despite the use of databases, scales and household utensils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To measure the efficacy of a novel 12-month self-monitoring program for weight&#xD;
      loss and long-term adherence to the use of the application. The program entails estimation of&#xD;
      food consumption using the hand and a mobile application (developed by the research team)&#xD;
      that relies on evidence-based behavioral interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled trial Setting: American University of Beirut Medical Center&#xD;
      Participants: Adults who are overweight or obese will be recruited from AUB/AUBMC staff and&#xD;
      students and the community. Participants should be 18 years old and above and should have a&#xD;
      smartphone with access to the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: This research will be a three-armed randomized controlled trial. The first&#xD;
      phase (I) will test three different methods of calorie counting each allocated to an arm of&#xD;
      our trial at 4 weeks and the second phase (II) will test the long term efficacy of our method&#xD;
      and its sustainability. One arm specific for the control group will be using a commercial&#xD;
      mobile application called Fitness Pal (or رشاقة for Arabic preference) alone; another arm&#xD;
      will be using the commercial mobile application Fitness Pal (or رشاقة for Arabic preference)&#xD;
      along with the food estimation method using hands, and the third arm will be using the&#xD;
      developed mobile application of the study along with the food estimation method using hands.&#xD;
      Phase I constitutes a baseline and 4-weeks-visit where we will seek the participants'&#xD;
      feedback concerning the mobile application and the hand counting method. Phase II:&#xD;
      participants who are motivated to continue using the mobile applications and self-monitoring&#xD;
      will be followed up to a period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will take place at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months following the start of&#xD;
      trial to assess for any change in participant's weight and adherence to the use of the mobile&#xD;
      application and counting method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome of phase I will be the satisfaction with the&#xD;
      counting method and mobile app mobile application rating and satisfaction with the various&#xD;
      application features. The primary outcome of phase II will be the difference in the&#xD;
      percentage of participants who achieved weight loss of 5% of their baseline weight among the&#xD;
      three groups at 3 months, 6 months, and weight loss of 10% of their baseline weight at 12&#xD;
      months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include (1) a decrease in weight in Kg from baseline at 1,3,6 and 12&#xD;
      months; (2) a decrease in waist circumference in cm from baseline at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months,&#xD;
      (3) frequency of logging in days, (4) adherence to the use of the application. In addition,&#xD;
      demographics characteristics, self-regulation and internal motivation of the participants&#xD;
      will be explored whether they affect any of the primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
