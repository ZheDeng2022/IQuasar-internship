  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a low-fat, plant-based dietary&#xD;
      intervention and a portion-controlled dietary intervention (compliant with current American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines) on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure of this study is insulin requirements (measured as the total daily&#xD;
      dose (TDD) of insulin or basal and bolus insulin units injected per day). The study duration&#xD;
      is 12 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by loss of β-cell mass and&#xD;
      function in the pancreas, leading to reduced secretion of insulin and hyperglycemia. The&#xD;
      management of type 1 diabetes requires the administration of exogeneous insulin. Total daily&#xD;
      dose (TDD) of insulin, a measure of the total amount of exogeneous insulin utilized per day,&#xD;
      can be affected by multiple factors including insulin resistance, carbohydrate intake, body&#xD;
      weight, and body composition. While the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      differ, a low-fat, plant-based diet has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, reduce body&#xD;
      weight, improve body composition, and improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. A low-fat, plant-based diet has also been shown to improve β-cell function in&#xD;
      individuals who are overweight. This finding is consistent with other research that shows&#xD;
      that therapies that reduce body fat, or modify the distribution of body fat, improve β-cell&#xD;
      function and glucose homeostasis. To date, a low-fat, plant-based diet has never been&#xD;
      adequately tested in adults with type 1 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      effects of low-fat, plant-based dietary intervention and a portion-controlled dietary&#xD;
      intervention (compliant with current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines) on&#xD;
      insulin requirements in adults with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a parallel group design, participants with type 1 diabetes will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      follow a low-fat, plant-based diet or a portion-controlled diet (compliant with current ADA&#xD;
      guidelines) for 12 weeks. The principal dependent measures of this study are TDD of insulin,&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), interstitial fluid glucose levels, and 24-hour carbohydrate: insulin&#xD;
      ratio. Secondary and tertiary dependent measures include inflammatory biomarkers, blood&#xD;
      lipids, body weight, diet quality, diet acceptability, and medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that both the low-fat, plant-based dietary intervention and the&#xD;
      portion-controlled dietary intervention will elicit changes in insulin requirements, HbA1c,&#xD;
      variability in interstitial glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and body weight in&#xD;
      participants with type 1 diabetes. The investigators further hypothesize that the low-fat,&#xD;
      plant-based dietary intervention will confer a more substantial effect on changes in insulin&#xD;
      requirements, HbA1c, insulin sensitivity, variability in interstitial glucose levels, and&#xD;
      body weight in participants with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ), a self-reported measure, will be implemented to assess the subjective responses (palatability; satisfaction; ease of preparation; financial feasibility; and perceived physical benefits) of participants to their baseline diets and the intervention diet. The FAQ has twelve (12) total questions. Eleven (11) of the questions are scored on a Likert scale (1-7) and one (1) unscored question (physical benefits) will prompt the participant to &quot;check all that apply.&quot; A higher FAQ score corresponds with a more positive subjective response.</description>

    <description>For a 12-week period, participants will be asked to follow a low-fat, vegan diet which consists of whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits, with no restriction on energy intake. Animal products and added oils will be excluded. In choosing grain products and starchy vegetables (e.g., bread, potatoes), participants will be encouraged to select those retaining their natural fiber and having a glycemic index &lt;70, using tables standardized to a value of 100 for glucose.</description>

    <description>For a 12-week period, participants will be asked to follow a portion-controlled diet that is compliant with American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. This diet will include individualized diet plans that reduce daily energy intake by 500-1,000 kcal for overweight (body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m2) participants and keep carbohydrate intake reasonably stable over time. It will derive 15-20% from protein, &lt;7% saturated fat, 60-70% carbohydrate and monounsaturated fats and ≤200 mg/day of cholesterol/day.</description>
