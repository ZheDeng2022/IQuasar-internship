      Trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of one or two boosting doses of Comirnaty or&#xD;
      one dose of BNT162b2s01 (Variant of concern (VOC) strain B.1.351) in BNT162-01 trial&#xD;
      participants, or two boosting doses of Comirnaty in BNT162-04 trial participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants from BNT162-01 who received two injections of 30 μg Comirnaty will be&#xD;
      randomized 2:1 to one booster injection (BNT162b2s01: Comirnaty). Trial participants in&#xD;
      either the trial BNT162-01 or BNT162-04 who did not receive the full two vaccinations of 30&#xD;
      μg Comirnaty will be offered two injections of 30 μg Comirnaty as per the conditional&#xD;
      marketing authorization. All potential rollover volunteers must enroll in this trial within&#xD;
      less than 18 months of their last injection of a BNT162 candidate vaccine in the parent&#xD;
      BNT162-01 or BNT162-04 trials.&#xD;

             tests, lifestyle restrictions (including those requested by the German and federal&#xD;
             Governments, e.g., to follow good practices to reduce chances of spreading COVID 19),&#xD;
             and other requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received BNT162 vaccine candidates in the BNT162-01 or BNT162-04 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Remain overall healthy (i.e., has not medically deteriorated significantly since&#xD;
             participation in the parent trial, is not anticipated to die in the next 26 weeks, and&#xD;
             is able to provide blood as specified by the trial without anticipated, deleterious&#xD;
             medical consequences) in the clinical judgment of the investigator based on medical&#xD;
             history and physical examination. Screening clinical laboratory tests are to assess&#xD;
             the participants &quot;new baseline&quot; unless required for eligibility. Note: in particular,&#xD;
             caution should be used with a subject who has a history of cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
             e.g., myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy, or clinically significant arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree not to enroll in another trial of an IMP, starting after Visit 0 and&#xD;
             continuously until Visit 5 (day 50).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 18 months have passed since their last IMP injection in their parent trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If they received 30 µg Comirnaty twice in the BNT162-01 trial, Visit 1 in this trial&#xD;
             is ≥24 weeks after their last IMP injection, unless the subject is a Cohort 13&#xD;
             transplant subject of the BNT162-01 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If they received any other BNT162 vaccine candidate than Comirnaty in the BNT162-01 or&#xD;
             BNT162-04 trial or are a Cohort 13 transplant subject, Visit 1 in this trial is ≥12&#xD;
             weeks after their last IMP injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 12 weeks prior to day 1&#xD;
             (baseline). Participants who screen-fail on this criterion may be rescreened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine outside of the BNT162-01 or BNT162-04 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to the planned IMP including&#xD;
             any excipients of the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a current febrile illness (body temperature ≥38.0°C) or other acute illness&#xD;
             within 48 hours prior to day 1/IMP injection in this trial. Participants who&#xD;
             screen-fail on this criterion may be rescreened.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received a live or live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to day 1/IMP&#xD;
             injection, or any other vaccination within 14 days prior to day 1/IMP injection.&#xD;
             Participants who screen-fail on this criterion may be rescreened.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an ongoing AE assessed as related to any BNT162-01 or BNT162-04 trial vaccine.&#xD;
