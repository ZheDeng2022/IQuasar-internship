    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to study the effects on bone remodeling induced by training carried&#xD;
      out with the trampoline in order to evaluate the reduction of the resorption itself and&#xD;
      therefore the onset of osteoporosis in women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone mineral density is modified by various factors and in particular by diet, nutritional&#xD;
      status and exercise recommended to preserve or increase bone mass in adults. The degree of&#xD;
      bone formation and resorption can be assessed by measuring bone resorption markers in the&#xD;
      blood or urine. To date, there is no information about the effect of training with an elastic&#xD;
      trampoline on the reduction of bone resorption. The aim of the project is to study the&#xD;
      effects on bone remodeling induced by training carried out with the trampoline, in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the reduction of the resorption itself and therefore the onset of osteoporosis in&#xD;
      women. To examine whether exercise affects bone remodeling, the C-terminal telopeptide bone&#xD;
      resorption markers (CTX) and osteocalcin formation marker will be measured. For the&#xD;
      evaluation of bone metabolism osteocalcin parathyroid hormone, Calcitonin, Vitamin D,&#xD;
      Calcium, albumin, Phosphate, Potassium markers will be evaluated. The markers can be detected&#xD;
      in serum. Women with no previous experience with the trampoline activity will participate in&#xD;
      the project randomly assigned to the experimental training group (Jumpers) or to the control&#xD;
      group, who will not do any training during the observation period (not Jumpers). The control&#xD;
      group will be inserted in order to compare the data and further verify the efficiency of the&#xD;
      treatment. Blood samples for bone resorption assay will be collected on the first day of&#xD;
      training with the trampoline and 20 weeks. Each training session will be monitored by&#xD;
      detecting heart rate (heart rate monitor) and subjective perception of fatigue (Borg scale).&#xD;
      Each subject will be subjected to two venous blood samples taken at the beginning of the&#xD;
      observation and at the end. The samples thus obtained will be transported in certified&#xD;
      containers for the safe transport of biological samples, and, subsequently, processed by the&#xD;
      experimenters at the laboratories of the Molecular Biology section of the University of&#xD;
      Palermo. Serum and plasma will be obtained from each blood sample. All information thus&#xD;
      obtained will be recorded in a database in which each person will be identified with a&#xD;
      numerical code, in order to comply with current privacy regulations. Body weight, Barefoot&#xD;
      standing height, Body mass index, Body composition will be measured in the different groups&#xD;
      of study. Blood samples will be collected from the different groups of study. Samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed and compared for Osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, CTX, Calcitonin, Vitamin D&#xD;
      Calcium, albumin, Phosphate, Potassium.&#xD;
