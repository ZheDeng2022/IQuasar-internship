  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether trained medical detection dogs can&#xD;
      accurately detect the presence of COVID-19 in people infected with the virus, or using&#xD;
      samples of their clothing or body odour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will train dogs to identify and discriminate between individuals wearing clothing&#xD;
      collected from people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and uninfected individuals under semi-field&#xD;
      conditions.Following this training, field testing will be used to determine whether trained&#xD;
      dogs can distinguish between people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and uninfected individuals,&#xD;
      producing estimates of dogs' sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When the COVID-19 epidemic wanes it will be important to prevent outbreaks of, and the&#xD;
      reintroduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the&#xD;
      country, since there will be many susceptible individuals remaining in the population. In&#xD;
      order to prevent third and further waves of COVID-19, it will be important to screen&#xD;
      passengers arriving from high-risk countries. This task would be made simpler if a rapid&#xD;
      non-invasive method were available for detecting infected individuals, particularly those&#xD;
      with asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic or prodromal symptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 from&#xD;
      those individuals who are not carrying the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal screening, practised in many airports and ports around the world, has a low&#xD;
      sensitivity since not all patients develop fever. Consequently, it has received considerable&#xD;
      criticism in some quarters. The use of trained dogs could provide a rapid primary screen for&#xD;
      detecting those potentially carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Travellers indicated by the dogs&#xD;
      as likely to be carrying the virus would then be tested by nasal and throat swabs, with&#xD;
      diagnosis confirmed/excluded using real-time RT-PCR or an accurate rapid diagnostic test&#xD;
      according to Government Guidelines. Using trained dogs would enable extremely rapid&#xD;
      screening, with each dog able to assess up to 250 travellers per hour, saving time and money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that viral and bacterial respiratory infections cause the release of&#xD;
      specific odours from human cells. Other work with detection dogs has found dogs can detect&#xD;
      and learn the smell of virus-associated volatiles in real time, with sensitivities of up to&#xD;
      96% and specificity of up to 98%. The current study will build further investigate whether&#xD;
      trained dogs can differentiate between odours associated with viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1 of this study (Clinical Trials ref: NCT04509713), the investigators hypothesised&#xD;
      that dogs, with their highly advanced sense of smell could be trained to detect people&#xD;
      infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Medical Detection Dogs were trained and tested using&#xD;
      stand trials with clothing samples worn by people who had variously tested positive or&#xD;
      negative for SARS-CoV-2 in RT-PCR tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, the clothing collected in Phase 1 will be used to train and transition the dogs&#xD;
      from Phase 1, where they identified samples in the laboratory environment, to semi-field&#xD;
      settings. Phase 1 clothing samples will be worn by human volunteers in a series of 'line-up'&#xD;
      trials, under increasingly complex settings. As part of phase 2, study staff will&#xD;
      opportunistically conduct line-up tests with volunteers confirmed to be infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, to allow dogs to learn the whole-body odour of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 will take place once the investigators have demonstrated the dogs can work within a&#xD;
      real-world environment (Phase 2 above). In this phase, trainers will deploy the dogs and&#xD;
      evaluate performance through in use testing. This will be done at a suitable venue, most&#xD;
      likely a COVID-19 testing centre, airport or university, to ensure a high enough rate of&#xD;
      potential positive individuals.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 2: Sensitivity of dogs detecting COVID-19 on worn clothing samples.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The phase 2 study section is designed to measure the sensitivity of the dogs to detect participants infected with SARS-CoV-2 using clothing samples.&#xD;
During testing the reaction of each dog to a positive sample will be observed (i.e. standing, sitting or lying down). The dog's diagnostic accuracy will then be determined in a double-blinded study. Here the trainer and technician using the computer to record the results of the study are blinded to the identity of each sample until the trainer calls the final decision (positive or negative) based on the response of the dog to the sample.&#xD;
This outcome will assess dogs' sensitivity in screening clothing samples collected in an earlier trial, and worn by volunteers, all of whom are expected to be SARS-CoV-2 negative.&#xD;
Sensitivity will be calculated against 'gold standard' of RT-PCR test outcomes.</description>

    <description>The phase 3 study section will measure the sensitivity of the dogs in detection of SARS-CoV-2 on human participants in semi-field settings.&#xD;
During screening the reaction of each dog to an individual being screened will be observed (i.e. standing, sitting or lying down).&#xD;
The dog's diagnostic sensitivity will be calculated by comparing these indications against outcomes of RT-PCR tests, which must be conducted within 96 hours of test participation. Testing will be conducted under double-blinded conditions.&#xD;
This outcome will assess dogs' sensitivity on in-person volunteers, screened in semi-field settings. Volunteers will comprise both SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals.&#xD;
Sensitivity will be calculated to +/- 5% accuracy. Sensitivity= percentage of true positives correctly identified by dogs.</description>

    <description>Interviews and focus groups involving stakeholder groups will be used to assess acceptability of dogs as a disease-screening tool.&#xD;
Eligible volunteers belonging to relevant groups will be invited to a single event (either interview with researcher, or focus group with other volunteers from same group type). Concept of dogs as a screening tool will be explained, using verbal overview, and where possible photos or videos.&#xD;
Volunteers will be asked to share their views on acceptability of dogs as a screening tool. Key quotes will be noted from each session. At the conclusion of all sessions, key themes and opinions will be drawn from session notes, and reported using illustrative quotes where appropriate.</description>
