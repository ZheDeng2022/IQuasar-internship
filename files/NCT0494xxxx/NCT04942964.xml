  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of ASP0367 in participants with mild and&#xD;
      moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy participants with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP0367 in participants with mild&#xD;
      and moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy participants with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of three groups based on hepatic function. Participants will be&#xD;
      screened for up to 28 days prior to investigational product (IP) administration on Day 1.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 and will be residential&#xD;
      for a single period of six days/five nights. On Day 1, participants will receive a single&#xD;
      oral dose of ASP0367 under fasting conditions followed by a 96-hour in-house blood and urine&#xD;
      sampling period. Participants are to remain semirecumbent for four hours postdose. Standard&#xD;
      safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted. Participants will be discharged from&#xD;
      the clinical unit on Day 5 on the condition that all required assessments have been performed&#xD;
      and that there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place five to&#xD;
      nine days after the last pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at the time of early&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse Events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational product (IP), whether or not considered related to the IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures.</description>
