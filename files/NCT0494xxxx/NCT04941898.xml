  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about a factor VIII medicine called Adynovate (TAK-660) used during surgery for&#xD;
      people with hemophilia A who have low blood levels of factor VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check for side effects from TAK-660.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check how well TAK-660 controls bleeding when used routinely during surgery and other&#xD;
           invasive procedures such as tooth extractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how the participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will receive infusions of TAK-660 during their hospital stay&#xD;
      for surgery according to their clinic's standard practice. The study doctors will check for&#xD;
      bleeds and side effects from TAK-660 from surgery until discharge.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in a participant linked in time with the use of a pharmaceutical/ medicinal product. They are not limited to the events with clear causal relationship with treatment with concerned drug. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative Hemostatic Efficacy of TAK-660</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (date of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Intraoperative hemostatic efficacy will be assessed by following four rating and criteria. Excellent: Intraoperative blood loss was less than or equal to that expected for the type of procedure performed in a non-hemophilic population (â‰¤100%)), Good: Intraoperative blood loss was up to 50% more than expected for the type: of procedure performed in a non-hemophilic population (101-150%), Fair: Intraoperative blood loss was more than 50% of that expected for the type of procedure performed in a non-hemophilic population (&gt;150%) None: Uncontrolled hemorrhage that was the result of inadequate therapeutic response despite proper dosing, necessitating rescue therapy with study drug or other replacement therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Hemostatic Efficacy of TAK-660 1 Day after Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative hemostatic efficacy 1 day after surgery will be assessed by following four rating and criteria. Excellent: Postoperative hemostasis achieved with study drug was as good or better than that expected for the type of surgical procedure performed in a nonhemophilic population, Good: Postoperative hemostasis achieved with study drug was probably as good as that expected for the type of surgical procedure performed in a nonhemophilic population, Fair: Postoperative hemostasis with study drug was clearly less than optimal for the type of procedure performed but was maintained without necessitating rescue therapy with study drug or other replacement therapy, None: Participant experienced uncontrolled bleeding that was the result of inadequate therapeutic response despite proper dosing, necessitating rescue therapy with study drug or other replacement therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Hemostatic Efficacy of TAK-660 at Completion of Perioperative Management</measure>
    <time_frame>At completion of perioperative management (approximately 30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative hemostatic efficacy at completion of perioperative management will be assessed by following four rating and criteria. Excellent: Postoperative hemostasis achieved after Day 1 with study drug was as good or better than that expected for the type of surgical procedure performed in a non-hemophilic population, Good: Postoperative hemostasis achieved after Day 1 with study drug was probably as good as that expected for the type of surgical procedure performed in a non-hemophilic population, Fair: Postoperative hemostasis with study drug after Day 1 was clearly less than optimal for the type of procedure performed but was maintained without necessitating rescue therapy with study drug or other replacement therapy, None: Participant experienced uncontrolled bleeding after Day 1 that was the result of inadequate therapeutic response despite proper dosing, necessitating rescue therapy with study drug or other replacement therapy.</description>
