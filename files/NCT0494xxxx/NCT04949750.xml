  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. The score is between 0-30. Higher score indicating better cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Memory tests</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Delayed Recognition are tests that measure memory function. Higher score indicating better cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Trail Making test scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Raw score, assessing attention, executive function. TMT is divided into two parts, TMT-A and TMT-B. In the TMT part A, circles with number from 1 to 25 are arranged randomly. Numerical sequence should be connected by patients as quickly as possible, cutoff value &gt; 180 seconds. In the TMT part B, patients must alternate between numbers and letters, cut off value &gt; 300 second. Cutoff scores indicate the value above suggest cognitive performance is normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Digits Span forward and backward</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The longest digits of forward and backward are 8 and 7, respectively. The total scores are twelve for each test. Higher score indicating better cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Verbal fluency test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Semantic memory score will be measured using the Verbal fluency test. The verbal fluency test is a short test of verbal functioning. Participants are given 1 min to produce as many animals as possible within a semantic category (category fluency). The participant's score is the number of animals. Higher score means better cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Clock drawing test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>1-6 points, with higher scores indicating worse visuo-spatial function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the 15-Item Version of the Boston Naming Test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive test of semantic memory. Object naming to confrontation, which also depends upon intact perceptual and word retrieval ability. Higher scores indicating better cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) is a questionnaire to assess patient's capacity to live independently.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Zarit Burden Interview score is a questionnaire to assess patient's caregiver burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants completes the full 12-week cognitive training.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every 4 weeks participants will follow-up at Dementia Center and be able to continue the training if they complete 80% of each level of difficulty workload. Therefore, we aim to calculate the percentage of participants who can completes the full 12-week cognitive training.</description>
