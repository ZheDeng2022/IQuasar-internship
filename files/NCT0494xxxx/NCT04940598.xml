      This study will determine if the implementation of a home-based telehealth high intensity&#xD;
      interval exercise-training (HIIT)program can significantly improve cardiometabolic health and&#xD;
      physical function in a cohort of individuals with longstanding spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
      Results from this study will determine feasibility, overall enjoyment, and health impact of&#xD;
      implementing a home-based telehealth HIIT program in individuals with SCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), exercise participation reduces the risk of&#xD;
      developing chronic cardiometabolic diseases, which are leading causes of rehospitalization&#xD;
      and death within this population. Accordingly, recent SCI exercise guidelines have&#xD;
      highlighted a need for exercise trials that can improve cardiometabolic factors such as&#xD;
      glucose tolerance, blood lipids, blood pressure, and body composition. However, to date, the&#xD;
      number of exercise trials examining these cardiometabolic outcomes in SCI is low, and these&#xD;
      exercise regimens are often inconvenient for individuals with SCI to perform within their&#xD;
      community. In addition to the functional impairment associated with the disability,&#xD;
      individuals with SCI experience a number of barriers to exercise participation, such as lack&#xD;
      of time (e.g. conflict with work schedule), accessible or usable equipment and facilities,&#xD;
      and transportation. Thus, it is important to identify effective modes of exercise that can&#xD;
      improve overall health but do not require a significant overall weekly time commitment.&#xD;
      Investigators recently demonstrated that individuals with SCI could safely perform high&#xD;
      intensity interval training (HIIT) using arm crank cycling and that as few as two days per&#xD;
      week of HIIT could improve cardiometabolic health. Despite the advantages of HIIT, it is&#xD;
      important to identify methods of implementing exercise trials that can successfully reach and&#xD;
      maintain participation in larger cohorts. Recent work by the investigative group demonstrated&#xD;
      that individuals with SCI expressed favorable perceptions of home-exercise training that&#xD;
      incorporated telehealth technology, which allowed a fitness specialist to remotely monitor&#xD;
      participants' training progress in real-time and provide verbal support via&#xD;
      videoconferencing. This method of training holds even greater value for home-exercise&#xD;
      programs that require monitoring to dose-specific protocols such as HIIT. However, the&#xD;
      long-term success of HIIT will greatly depend on the ease at which the program can be&#xD;
      implemented, as well as participants' adherence and perceptions of using the technology,&#xD;
      which has not been investigated in SCI. The goal of this study is to integrate a home-based&#xD;
      telehealth HIIT arm crank exercise training program in individuals with SCI and assess&#xD;
      changes in cardiometabolic health and physical function. The secondary goal is to explore the&#xD;
      uptake and implementation of HIIT in SCI. 40 participants will be randomized to home-based&#xD;
      HIIT exercise or a no-exercise control group for 16-weeks. Body composition, aerobic fitness,&#xD;
      muscular strength, and changes in cardiometabolic health will be assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      16-weeks post training. In addition to changes in cardiometabolic health outcomes, the&#xD;
      investigators will also conduct interviews with participants to determine overall perceptions&#xD;
      of the program, program likes and dislikes, perceived satisfaction and value, usability of&#xD;
      equipment and technology, and factors that influence adherence.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will undergo a progressive peak oxygen assessment to determine aerobic capacity at the Lakeshore Foundation Exercise Physiology Facility. Subjects will be instructed to perform arm crank ergometer (Lode) at 10W for 2 min. Every 2 min thereafter, power output will be increased by 10W until voluntary fatigue. Peak aerobic power will be defined as VO2 at the point of failure to maintain 60-65 rotations per minute.</description>
