  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is currently a global public health problem,&#xD;
      declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, which today has more than one million&#xD;
      deaths in the world, of which , 30,000 approximately belong to Colombia, being the country&#xD;
      number 11 with the highest number of deaths. The most common symptoms related to this disease&#xD;
      are fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, headache, diarrhea and rhinorrhea. COVID-19 is&#xD;
      characterized by immune system dysfunction and hyperinflammation causing acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome, macrophage activation, and coagulopathy. The clinical course for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in most cases is mild, but approximately 14% of cases can be severe. In pneumonia&#xD;
      caused by SARS-CoV-2, the lung lining is known to alter the composition of the lung&#xD;
      microbiome, in addition to lymphocyte damage that can promote the growth of bacteria to&#xD;
      initiate bacterial pneumonia, and it is estimated that the prevalence of coinfection /&#xD;
      superinfection reaches 50% among deaths from COVID-19. Coinfection between different&#xD;
      microorganisms and SARS-CoV-2 is a serious problem in the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is&#xD;
      still little information on this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is for this reason that the researchs propose to develop this research project that will&#xD;
      allow to understand the possible mechanisms associated with the development of bacterial&#xD;
      coinfection / superinfection in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, which will allow expanding&#xD;
      the panorama of knowledge towards a better and adequate treatment in these patients, as well&#xD;
      as detection of biomarkers or clinical phenotypics that may be useful in the diagnosis, based&#xD;
      on evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that these results are of clinical importance since we will try to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers or changes in the lung microbiome that allow doctors to early identify&#xD;
      patients at risk of developing coinfection and thus initiate early treatments or preventive&#xD;
      measures, which allow the improvement of clinical outcomes in patients. Results will be&#xD;
      presented in a timely manner at national and international conferences and in peer-reviewed,&#xD;
      indexed, high-impact journals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, translational (T0-T2), multicenter, observational, cohort study of&#xD;
      consecutive patients with a first clinical phase, where the collection of different types of&#xD;
      samples (Bronco alveolar lavage, blood, nasopharyngeal swab, secretion orotracheal and rectal&#xD;
      swabbing) at the start of mechanical ventilation, on day 3 and before extubation and another&#xD;
      stage of molecular analysis in human samples collected where by different types of techniques&#xD;
      such as: characterization of the 16S ribosomal unit, ELISA, time PCR real, concentration and&#xD;
      cell discrimination techniques, we will characterize the microbiological, immunological and&#xD;
      cellular changes that condition the development of coinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analytical studies, techniques, and parametric and nonparametric tests will be&#xD;
      used to explore diagnostic, microbiological, or subgroup differences, as well as clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Independent predictors and associated hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      will be reported. A two-tailed p value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
