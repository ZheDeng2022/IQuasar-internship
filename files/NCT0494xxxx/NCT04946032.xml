  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia was introduced to the world of obstetrics in 1909 by Walter Stoeckel. Over&#xD;
      the following 100 years it has developed to become the gold-standard for delivery of&#xD;
      intra-partum analgesia, with between 60 and 75% of North American parturients receiving an&#xD;
      epidural during their labor. Effective labor analgesia has been shown to improve maternal and&#xD;
      fetal outcomes. One aspect of catheter insertion that has not been fully evaluated, and with&#xD;
      very little recent work undertaken, is the optimal length of epidural catheter to be left in&#xD;
      the epidural space. Dislodgement or displacement of epidural catheter remains a significant&#xD;
      cause for failure with analgesia. Novel methods of fixation may further reduce the risk of&#xD;
      catheter migration. Another factor is the direction of travel within the epidural space, only&#xD;
      13% of lumbar catheters remain uncoiled after insertion of more than 4 cm into the epidural&#xD;
      space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that catheters inserted to 4 cm will have a lower&#xD;
      rate of failure when compared to those inserted to 5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims to evaluate the difference in quality of labor analgesia delivered&#xD;
      by epidural catheters inserted to either 4 or 5 cm into the epidural space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as an interventional double-blinded randomised control trial to&#xD;
      establish best practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective labor analgesia has been shown to improve maternal and fetal outcomes. It is of&#xD;
      paramount importance to the obstetric anesthesiologist to optimize the quality of labor&#xD;
      analgesia and identify any factors leading to ineffective epidural analgesia. One aspect of&#xD;
      catheter insertion that has not been fully evaluated, and with very little recent work&#xD;
      undertaken, is the optimal length of epidural catheter to be left in the epidural space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have advocated, for varying reasons, different lengths of catheter to be&#xD;
      left in the space; these range from 2cm to 8cm. Longer epidural lengths in the space can be&#xD;
      associated with foraminal escape, leading to unilateral block, and intravascular insertion,&#xD;
      prompting additional manipulation. Shorter lengths have previously been associated with more&#xD;
      frequent dislodgement. The directionality of the epidural catheter once in the space has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to correlate with misdirection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study would be to standardize practice in how much epidural catheter is&#xD;
      threaded into the epidural space.&#xD;
