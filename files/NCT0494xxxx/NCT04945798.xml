  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proprioception: Active Hip Flexion Position Detection.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements use a goniometer. Measurements are in degrees. Participant judges accuracy of position on a scale of 1-5: 1= very inaccurate, 2= somewhat inaccurate, 3=neutral, 4= somewhat accurate, 5= very accurate.</description>

    <measure>Proprioception: Active Shoulder Joint Position Detection.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements use a goniometer. Measurements are in degrees. Participant judges accuracy of position on a scale of 1-5: 1= very inaccurate, 2= somewhat inaccurate, 3=neutral, 4= somewhat accurate, 5= very accurate.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Awareness: Scale of Body Connection</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A higher score represents better outcomes with increased body awareness. Minimum score: 0. Maximum for whole scale: 4. Scores are based on 12 items for body awareness (BA) and 8 items for body dissociation (BD). The items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0-4 with 0 at &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 at &quot;all of the time.&quot; To score the BA subscale: sum the endorsed items and divide by the total number of items (12). To score the DB subscale: sum the endorsed items and divide by the total number of items (8). A positive change on the BA scale would represent an increase in bodily awareness, and a positive result. A negative change on the DB scale would represent a decrease in bodily dissociation, and a positive result.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood: Depression Anxiety Stress Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Increasing scores are associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. Items are scored within three subscales: depression, anxiety and stress. For individual subscales the scoring is as follows. Depression: normal (0-9), mild (10-13), moderate (14-20), severe (21-27), extremely severe (28+). Anxiety: normal (0-7), mild (8-9), moderate (10-14), severe (15-19), extremely severe (20+). Stress: normal (0-14), mild (15-18), moderate (19-25), severe (26-33), extremely severe (34+). Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 126 for the entire scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood: State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A higher score is associated with increased anxiety trait. The minimum score is 20. The maximum score is 80. The range for no or little anxiety is 20-37. Moderate anxiety scores are from 38-44. High anxiety range is from 45-80.</description>
