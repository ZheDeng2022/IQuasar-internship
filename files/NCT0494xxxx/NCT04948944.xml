  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 50% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not respond to initial treatment&#xD;
      and relapse is common. In particular, comorbid depression and anxiety disorders are&#xD;
      associated with more treatment resistance. Thus, there is a great need for novel, more&#xD;
      targeted treatments. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel intervention&#xD;
      that can be used to causally target neural excitability and plasticity in brain&#xD;
      regions/circuits implicated in regulating mood and anxiety and emerging evidence suggests&#xD;
      that it reduces threat sensitivity. Here the investigators propose to use tDCS to target&#xD;
      threat sensitivity as a core symptom of anxious depression to determine if the investigators&#xD;
      can engage the neural circuits that are treatment targets. Following the administration of a&#xD;
      single dose of anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment, early changes in emotional processing&#xD;
      have been observed in healthy people and clinical groups. Among patients, acute cognitive&#xD;
      effects - such as a reduction in threat sensitivity - have been shown to predict response to&#xD;
      drug and behavioral treatments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have&#xD;
      confirmed hyperactive amygdala and/or hypoactive prefrontal activity in patients, indicating&#xD;
      an imbalance of activity within this cortico-limbic circuit that sub-serves threat&#xD;
      identification (amygdala) and top-down control (prefrontal). Specifically, treatments aiming&#xD;
      to remediate prefrontal/ amygdala dysfunction could be a critical target in patients&#xD;
      exhibiting these deficits. Several clinical trials have shown that administration of frontal&#xD;
      cortex tDCS is a potentially effective treatment for MDD. However, underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      action are unclear. To meet this gap, the investigators propose an experimental medicine&#xD;
      study (target identification and initial target engagement paths) where 120 volunteers with&#xD;
      anxious MDD will be randomized to receive a single session of active or sham tDCS in a&#xD;
      parallel design. Threat sensitivity will be measured using task and resting state fMRI and&#xD;
      potentiated startle electrophysiology. Preliminary data suggest reductions in behavioral&#xD;
      threat sensitivity from a single session of frontal tDCS. This was followed up with an fMRI&#xD;
      study which found that a single session of active vs sham frontal tDCS reduced amygdala&#xD;
      response to fearful faces whilst simultaneously increasing frontal attentional control&#xD;
      signals. This provides evidence that modulating activity in the frontal cortex inhibits&#xD;
      amygdala response to threat, highlighting a potential neural mechanism for the behavioral&#xD;
      reduction in threat sensitivity. In addition, this offers initial mechanistic insights into&#xD;
      the efficacy of tDCS in clinical trials for the treatment of MDD and anxiety disorders,&#xD;
      suggesting that threat sensitivity may be a suitable cognitive target. The current proposal&#xD;
      builds on this to establish acute effects of frontal tDCS on amygdala response to threat&#xD;
      (primary aim), frontoparietal response to threat (secondary aim), startle response under&#xD;
      threat (secondary aim), approach-avoidance-conflict (exploratory aim) and model-based&#xD;
      learning (exploratory aim). The ultimate aim is to apply these multi-level acute findings to&#xD;
      mechanistic clinical trials of tDCS, to test their prediction of treatment response (full&#xD;
      model path) and improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

      120 participants with anxious MDD will be recruited from the community. Participants will&#xD;
      undergo screening and baseline assessments using self-report and clinical assessments.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be invited for an additional screening session where they will&#xD;
      allocated to either active or sham stimulation arms (50% in each arm, balanced for biological&#xD;
      sex). Participants in the active arm will receive 30 minutes tDCS over bilateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex using an optimized lateral electrode (OLE) placement montage. This montage is selected&#xD;
      as it is commonly used in clinical trials of tDCS for MDD and is designed to target the&#xD;
      lateral DLPFC. Moreover, hypoactive frontal activation and related impaired top-down control&#xD;
      is associated with MDD and anxiety disorders. Resting state (rs) fMRI data will be collected&#xD;
      immediately before, during and after active or sham tDCS. After tDCS, task-based fMRI data&#xD;
      (attentional control task with fearful distractors and approach avoidance task) will be&#xD;
      acquired. Mood will be assessed with a single item 0-100 visual analogue scale (VAS) question&#xD;
      and Positive and Negative Affective schedule (PANAS) at multiple time points before and after&#xD;
      imaging and tDCS. Subjective and neural responses to fearful faces and approach/avoidance&#xD;
      decisions in prefrontal cortical areas and subcortical-limbic areas (fearful&gt;neutral and&#xD;
      avoid&gt;approach activations) and their connectivity during resting state will be assessed with&#xD;
      contrasts made between active and sham stimulation. Anxiety (unpredictable shock &gt; neutral)&#xD;
      and fear (predictable shock &gt; neutral) potentiated startle will be measured using EMG.&#xD;
      Reinforcement learning will be assessed using a behavioral task. For additional exploratory&#xD;
      analyses relating to blood based markers of neuroplasticity (Kynurenine), a blood sample will&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;

    <description>The significant acute reduction in behavioral threat sensitivity from a single session of tDCS is similar that seen with anxiolytic treatments. Anxiolytic treatments also reliably reduce startle response to unpredictable threat.
