      PMNIDAT from October 2013 to September 2019 were included. Patients aged 18-65 years who met&#xD;
      the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) criteria of CIP and Had a positive&#xD;
      urine test of cannabis were included. Cannabis use is a component cause of psychosis.More&#xD;
      than half of symptoms of cannabis-induced psychosis (CIP) were hallucination, delusion,&#xD;
      irritable and anxiety. Antipsychotic drug was still a key psychotropic drugs for treatment of&#xD;
