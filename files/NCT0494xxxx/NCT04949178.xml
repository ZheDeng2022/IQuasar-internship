      Consecutive critically ill cirrhotics with septic shock and AKI who give written informed&#xD;
      consent will be included in this prospective study. A blood and urine sample (~10 ml) would&#xD;
      be stored for assessing the serum cytokine profile, endotoxin levels, NT-Pro BNP, Troponin I&#xD;
      levels, urine N-GAL before, 6 hours and at 24 hours after initiation of CRRT. Septic shock&#xD;
      will be defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection with hypotension non-responsive&#xD;
      to adequate fluid resuscitation assessed by no evidence of stroke volume variation on flow&#xD;
      track and need of a vasopressor to achieve a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mm&#xD;
      Hg. A record of SVR, SVRI, global ejection fraction, extravascular lung water index and&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular permeability index, CVP, IVC diameter and B-lines on ultrasound lung would&#xD;
      be recorded. A record of the clearance of lactate at 6, 12 , 24 and daily till recovery or&#xD;
      death would be performed. Patients with age less than 18 years, severe known cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      disease (structural or valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, COPD) pregnancy,&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, extremely moribund patients with an expected life&#xD;
      expectancy of less than 24 hours, failure to give informed consent from family members.&#xD;

      AIM: Assessment of the impact of CRRT on systemic hemodynamics and microcirculation in&#xD;
      critically ill cirrhotics with septic shock and AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To study the impact of continuous renal replacement therapy on systemic&#xD;
      hemodynamics (improvement in systemic vascular resistive index, cardiac index) and lactate&#xD;
      clearance in critically ill cirrhotics with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Impact on endothelial function and inflammatory cytokines Impact on&#xD;
      renal functions and ammonia Incidence of hemodynamic instability and/or intradialytic&#xD;
      hypotension Impact on lung injury scores (as determined by EVLW and PVPI) To study the&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay Impact on transplant-free survival To&#xD;
      evaluate the improvement in SOFA, MELD and APACHE scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Consecutive critically ill cirrhotics with septic shock and AKI who give written&#xD;
      informed consent will be included in this prospective study. A blood and urine sample (~10&#xD;
      ml) would be stored for assessing the serum cytokine profile, endotoxin levels, NT-Pro BNP,&#xD;
      Troponin I levels, urine N-GAL before, 6 hours and at 24 hours after initiation of CRRT.&#xD;
      Septic shock will be defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection with hypotension&#xD;
      non-responsive to adequate fluid resuscitation assessed by no evidence of stroke volume&#xD;
      variation on flow track and need of a vasopressor to achieve a target mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) of ≥ 65 mm Hg. A record of SVR, SVRI, global ejection fraction, extravascular lung&#xD;
      water index and pulmonary vascular permeability index, CVP, IVC diameter and B-lines on&#xD;
      ultrasound lung would be recorded. A record of the clearance of lactate at 6, 12 , 24 and&#xD;
      daily till recovery or death would be performed. Patients with age less than 18 years, severe&#xD;
      known cardiopulmonary disease (structural or valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      COPD) pregnancy, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, extremely moribund patients with an&#xD;
      expected life expectancy of less than 24 hours, failure to give informed consent from family&#xD;
      members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective observational cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Critically ill cirrhotics with septic shock and AKI undergoing CRRT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: May 2021- December 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: It will be time based study with a minimum sample size of 50 patients.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no study looking at these outcomes in critically ill cirrhotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: (Not a part of the study protocol), Patients on Continuous Renal Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy (CRRT) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Assessment: Hourly till the time patient is on dialysis then as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects: Worsening of hypotension, sepsis, bleeding, allergic reactions to dailyser,&#xD;
      any cardiac side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All variables shall be expressed in mean (sd) or median (range)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables will be compared by Mann- Whitney U test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Categorical variables we will use Chi-Square or Fisher's test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival analysis will be done using cox-proportional regression analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actuarial probability of survival shall be calculated by Kaplan- Meier graph and compared by&#xD;
      log- rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rule: Unstable hemodynamics, worsening of shock and lactic acidosis.&#xD;
