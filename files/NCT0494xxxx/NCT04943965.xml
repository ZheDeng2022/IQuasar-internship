  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if software can accurately predict certain heart&#xD;
      parameters from chest wall ultrasound (non-radiation, non-invasive, imaging modality). An&#xD;
      approved ultrasound device (Lumify) will be used to obtain images prior to cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single visit clinical study. No additional&#xD;
      interventions or follow-ups to the subject will be conducted as part of the study. All&#xD;
      investigational scanning will be conducted using the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA)&#xD;
      principle to ensure the safety of the subjects. As ultrasound imaging is based on&#xD;
      non-ionizing radiation, it is generally considered safe when used by appropriately trained&#xD;
      health care providers. The study population will be adults. There are no specific enrollment&#xD;
      targets, however it is expected that 120 subjects or fewer will be scanned to obtain the&#xD;
      required 40 echocardiographic exams to complete this study. Exceeding the enrollment target&#xD;
      of 120 subjects will require an amendment to the protocol. It is estimated this study will&#xD;
      last for 12 months, at that time it will be evaluated and may potentially be amended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is considered non-significant risk. There is no specific benefit to individuals&#xD;
      participating in the study, however the feedback received is used to improve Philips systems&#xD;
      and that can lead to increased diagnostic ability in future products.&#xD;
