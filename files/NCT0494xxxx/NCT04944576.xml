  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a post-market clinical follow-up conducted in order to collect long-term data&#xD;
      on safety and performance of the EasyMove prosthesis, which is intended to be implanted in&#xD;
      case of total ankle replacement, when used in real life conditions according to the&#xD;
      instructions for use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the total ankle prosthesis, EasyMove, up&#xD;
      to five years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate both the safety and the performance of the total&#xD;
      ankle prosthesis, EasyMove, up to five years of follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Functional ouctomes will be evaluated through the AOFAS score. This score is comprised of nine questions covering three categories: pain (40 points), function (50 points) and alignment (10 points). These are all scored together for a total of 100 points. The higher the score, the better the patient outcome. AOFAS is a clinician reporting tool that required both patient and provider participation to be fully complete.</description>

    <measure>Functional outcomes evaluation such as mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 1 year postop, 2 years postop, 5 years postop</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ouctomes will be evaluated through the FAAM score. This score is a 29-item questionnaire divided into two subscales: 21-item Activities of Daily Living Subscale and 8-item Sports Subscale. Item score totals, which range from 0 to 84 for the Activities of Daily Living subscale and 0 to 32 for the Sports subscale, are transformed to percentage scores. The higher the score, the better the patient outcomes. It is a self-report outcome instrument.</description>

    <description>Health status outcomes will be evaluated through the SF-12 questionnaire to measure the quality of life. It is a self-reported outcome measure, composed of 12 questions. It provides an eight-scale profile of functional health and wellbeing, as well as two psychometrically based physical and mental health summary measures, scored on a T-score metric. The higher the score, the better the patient outcomes.</description>
