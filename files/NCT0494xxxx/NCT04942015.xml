      Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease. It is a gynecological disease caused by the&#xD;
      growth and reproduction of the endometrium beyond the surface of the uterine tissue and&#xD;
      organs, which causes recurrent abdominal pain, infertility and other main symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recurrence of endometriosis and the side effects of medication have troubled clinicians&#xD;
      and patients for a long time and the search for new drugs is going on all the time.&#xD;
      Honghuaruyi Wan is the traditional Tibetan prescription, clinical research has proved that&#xD;
      Honghuaruyi Wan can significantly reduce risk mouse dysmenorrhea caused by oxytocin, improve&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea model of mice body torsion times and improve the estrogen and progestogen&#xD;
      operator Netherlands rat pituitary estradiol and prolactin level, at the same time also can&#xD;
      reduce the amount of TNF alpha, thus improving endometriosis dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the therapeutic effects of Honghuaruyi Wan provided by Tibet Qizheng Tibetan&#xD;
      Medicine Co.,Ltd on secondary dysmenorrhea in patients with endometriosis was evaluated&#xD;
      clinically. A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed to provide evidence-based medical evidence for Honghuaruyi Wan in the treatment of&#xD;
      endometriosis dysmenorrhea. In the design of this trial, the therapeutic effects and safety&#xD;
      of Honghuaruyi Wan in the treatment of dysmenorrhea secondary to endometriosis were evaluated&#xD;
      with Honghuaruyi Wan in the treatment group and placebo in the control group.&#xD;

      Endometriosis (EM) is a common gynecological disease at present. It is a gynecological&#xD;
      disease caused by the growth and reproduction of the endometrium on the surface of tissues&#xD;
      and organs beyond the uterine covering surface, resulting in recurrent abdominal pain and&#xD;
      infertility. The pathogenesis of endometriosis may be related to female endocrine dysfunction&#xD;
      and abnormal levels of estrogen and progesterone in the body. Its clinical symptoms mainly&#xD;
      include dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain and sexual pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recurrence of endometriosis and the side effects of medication have troubled clinicians&#xD;
      and patients for a long time. The search for new drugs has been going on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Honghuaruyi Wan is a traditional Tibetan prescription, which is made by addition and&#xD;
      subtraction on the basis of the traditional and classic Tibetan medicine prescription &quot;25 Wei&#xD;
      Guijiu Wan&quot;. Its main ingredients are:&#xD;
      Honghua,Xihonghua,Taoerqi,Kezi,Zangqiancao,Rougui,Baxiaga,Zangmuxiang,Yuansuiguo,Jiangxiang,X&#xD;
      iongdanfen,Zangzicao,Guangmingyan,Ximalayazimoli,Bangga,Hujiao,Huasherou,Aizijin,Yuganzi,Shaj&#xD;
      igao,Naosha,Zicaorong,Gouqizi,Chenxiang,Huoxiao. It has the effects of dispelling wind-evil&#xD;
      and relieving pain, regulating menstrual blood and removing spots. It can be used for&#xD;
      vaginitis, cervical erosion, irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhea and other common&#xD;
      gynecological diseases. The main medicinal ingredients of Honghuaruyi Wan are Honghua&#xD;
      ,Taoerqi and Zanghonghua, which have the effects of relieving pain, regulating menstruation&#xD;
      and blood and dispersing knots. Some clinical studies have shown that the basic prescription&#xD;
      of Honghuaruyi Wan have a significant effect on the improvement of dysmenorrhea, which can&#xD;
      significantly reduce the incidence of dysmenorrhea caused by oxytocin in mice, and improve&#xD;
      the number of body twisting in dysmenorrhea model mice. Other clinical studies have shown&#xD;
      that Honghuaruyi Wan can improve estradiol and prolactin levels of pituitary gland in rats&#xD;
      with estrogen and progesterone, as well as reduce TNF-α levels, thus improving endometriosis&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women of childbearing age who do not have fertility requirements, pain is the most&#xD;
      important clinical symptom that needs to be addressed, especially with progressive&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea. Therefore, in this study, the therapeutic effects of Honghuaruyi Wan, provided&#xD;
      by Tibet Qizheng Tibetan Medicine Co.,Ltd, on the secondary dysmenorrhea of patients with&#xD;
      endometriosis was evaluated clinically. A multi-center, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to provide evidence-based medical evidence for&#xD;
      Honghuaruyi Wan in the treatment of endometriosis dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the design of this trial, the therapeutic effects and safety of Honghuaruyi Wan in the&#xD;
      treatment of dysmenorrhea secondary to endometriosis were evaluated with Honghuaruyi Wan in&#xD;
      the treatment group and placebo in the control group.&#xD;
