  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to evaluate, after 5 to 8 years, the marginal bone loss around tissue-level&#xD;
      implants and bone-level implants in patients who have not followed the maintenance program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records of patients who have been implanted for at least 5 to 8 years and who have&#xD;
      been lost during this period are collected from three private clinics in Beirut,Lebanon and&#xD;
      the Saint Joseph University Health Center in Beirut,Lebanon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On an individual sheet, the patient as well as the implants data will be noted. Patients will&#xD;
      be called for reevaluation after 5-8 years. After signing the informed consent, the&#xD;
      measurements by a PCP-15 probe of the plaque index (FMPS) and the bleeding index (FMBS) as&#xD;
      well as the height of the keratinized tissue are indicated on the sheet. If the smoking&#xD;
      status has changed, this will be mentioned too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The marginal bone loss will be measured on the X-rays taken immediately after the implant&#xD;
      placement, after 1 year of loading and then at the reevaluation session.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the individual sheet for each patient, the data concerning the name, age, sex, general&#xD;
      condition, smoking status, periodontal status , the number of follow-up sessions and the&#xD;
      plaque index as well as bleeding on probing (if noted in the file before placing the&#xD;
      implants) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the data concerning the implant such as the site (maxilla or mandibular), the type of&#xD;
      implant, the length, the diameter, the surface, sealed or screwed, presence of a cantilever,&#xD;
      hiatus or over-contour, a one or two surgical time, the date of placement and the number of&#xD;
      years of operation will also be noted on the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be called for reassessment appointments after 5-8 years. After signing the&#xD;
      informed consent, the measurements by a PCP-15 periodontal probe of the plaque index (FMPS),&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (FMBS) as well as the height and thickness of the keratinized mucosa are&#xD;
      indicated on the sheet. The smoking status will also be updated and indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants will be classified into one of these groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with tissue implants (TL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with bone level implants with internal connection (BL, Internal hex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with bone level implants with external connection (BL, External hex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays taken after insertion, after 1 year of loading and after 5-8 years will be collected&#xD;
      and analyzed on the DBSWIN software. Mesial and distal bone loss after implant placement and&#xD;
      after 5 to 8 years will be measured on retro-alveolar radiographs with calibration and&#xD;
      recorded on the patient file. The total bone loss will then be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographic measurement technique is as follows. The platform of the mesial and distal&#xD;
      implant (MIS: Mesial Implant Shoulder and DIS: Distal Implant Shoulder) will be defined and a&#xD;
      line (A) connecting the two is drawn. Another line (B) tangential to the apex of the implant&#xD;
      and parallel to A is also drawn. The bisecting line at A and B is therefore produced and&#xD;
      measured to assess the distorted implant length (DIL: Distorted Implant Length). Bone level&#xD;
      (BL) measurements will be recorded from the implant platform (MIS-DIS) to the most coronary&#xD;
      bone-to-implant contact (BIC) on the mesial and distal sides of each implant. The length of&#xD;
      the implant will be used as an actual measurement to calibrate the other measurements.&#xD;
