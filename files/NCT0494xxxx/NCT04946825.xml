      The overarching aim of this proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy (NRT) with text message support for two smoking cessation approaches&#xD;
      among young adult dual users of ombustible cigarettes (CC) and electronic cigarettes (EC).&#xD;
      The investigators will use a 2x2 factorial design (Table 1) to randomize 390 participants to&#xD;
      receive A) NRT plus text messages to quit CCs only, B) NRT plus text messages to quit CCs and&#xD;
      ECs simultaneously, C) text messages alone to quit CCs only, or D) text messages alone to&#xD;
      quit CCs and ECs simultaneously. The investigators' primary outcome will be 7-day&#xD;
      point-prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment (i.e., 3 months after randomization). All&#xD;
      treatment will be provided remotely in order to increase treatment access and comply with&#xD;
      COVID-19 restrictions. The proposed RCT addresses the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test whether NRT is an effective smoking cessation treatment for young adult dual&#xD;
      users of ECs and CCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To identify the influence of continued EC use versus stopping ECs on achieving CC&#xD;
      abstinence among young adult dual users of ECs and CCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To identify whether continued EC use results in more acute adverse events than&#xD;
      stopping ECs among young adult dual users who are quitting CCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit and consent 390 participants with the aim of retaining 312&#xD;
      (80%) by the end of treatment. Participants in each condition will complete a survey at&#xD;
      baseline, weekly surveys throughout the 3-month treatment period, brief daily surveys for one&#xD;
      week before and one week after the assigned quit date, an end of treatment survey, and a&#xD;
      survey at a follow-up 6 months after treatment began. In addition, participants will provide&#xD;
      breath CO samples at baseline, all weekly surveys, the end of treatment, and the 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up using the CoVita iCO personal smokerlyzer (https://www.covita.net/ico-overview/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments will be remote and accessible by smartphone, tablet, or computer. After&#xD;
      confirming eligibility and consenting to participate, participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the four study groups and study personnel will mail a welcome package including&#xD;
      study information, a CoVita iCO personal smokerlyzer device, and NRT (for groups A and B&#xD;
      only). Upon receipt of the welcome package, participants will complete a brief baseline&#xD;
      survey on the internet and provide a baseline breath CO sample using the CoVita iCO device&#xD;
      and Vincere Health mobile application which is compatible with Mac iOS and Android operating&#xD;
      systems for smartphones and tablets. The investigators will not ask participants to return&#xD;
      their personal CoVita iCO Smokerlyzer. All participants will be free to keep their personal&#xD;
      CoVita iCO Smokerlyzer after the conclusion of their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete brief daily surveys for two weeks: one week pre- and one week&#xD;
      post-quit date. Participants will receive a daily text and/or email containing a link for the&#xD;
      daily survey and will be able to complete the survey via internet on a smartphone, tablet or&#xD;
      computer. Participants will report CC smoking, EC use, NRT use (groups A and B only), text&#xD;
      message utilization, nicotine dependence, quit attempts, and adverse events on daily surveys&#xD;
      (Table 2). At the conclusion of the 12-week treatment period, participants will complete an&#xD;
      end of treatment survey to report CC smoking or EC use and withdrawal symptoms. Those still&#xD;
      smoking will also report motivation to quit, nicotine dependence, and self-efficacy to quit.&#xD;
      In addition, participants will provide another breath CO sample using their CoVita iCO&#xD;
      device. The primary outcome for this RCT is CO confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence&#xD;
      from CCs at the end of treatment (i.e., at the 3-month follow-up). Per the Society for&#xD;
      Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) report on biochemical verification, the investigators&#xD;
      will use CO of &lt; 6 parts per million (ppm) as the cutoff for confirming CC abstinence. The&#xD;
      investigators will not contact participants for the 12 weeks following the treatment period.&#xD;
      All participants will then complete a 6-month follow-up survey (i.e., 24 weeks after the&#xD;
      baseline assessment) to report any CC smoking or EC use and withdrawal symptoms. Those who&#xD;
      relapsed or continued to smoke CCs will also report motivation to quit, nicotine dependence,&#xD;
      and self-efficacy to quit. In addition, all participants will provide a final breath CO&#xD;
      sample using their CoVita iCO device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment. The consent form explains that a primary aim of this RCT is to test whether&#xD;
      quitting versus continuing ECs is more effective when quitting CCs, and currently there is&#xD;
      mixed evidence supporting both strategies. After randomization, all participants will receive&#xD;
      information about the study including instructions to set a quit date and which product(s) to&#xD;
      quit. Written instructions for the intervention will be provided and participants will also&#xD;
      be asked to view a supplementary video presentation. The investigators will provide&#xD;
      participants in groups A and C with instructions to quit CCs but continue using ECs with the&#xD;
      rationale that ongoing use of ECs could help them abstain from CCs. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will instruct participants in groups A and C to use ECs in place of CCs to help&#xD;
      cope with cravings or urges to smoke CCs. In contrast, participants randomized to conditions&#xD;
      B and D will receive instructions to quit CCs and quit ECs with the rationale that quitting&#xD;
      ECs could help them abstain from CCs. The investigators will instruct participants in groups&#xD;
      B and D to abstain from vaping because ECs could trigger relapse to CCs. Participants in&#xD;
      groups A and B will also receive instructions for how to use NRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to conditions A and B will be mailed 3 one-month supplies of dual 14&#xD;
      mg NRT patches and 4 mg mini-lozenge because this appears to be the most effective&#xD;
      non-prescription medication combination for smoking cessation However, participants will have&#xD;
      the option to stop receiving NRT from the study. Participants will be instructed to start&#xD;
      using both forms of NRT 2 weeks prior to their quit date because pre-quit NRT appears to&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of NRT. Further, the recommended use for the NRT has recently been&#xD;
      changed to incorporate use while smoking because &quot;the FDA has determined that there are no&#xD;
      significant concerns with using NRT products at the same time as another nicotine-containing&#xD;
      product like a cigarette (https://www.nicodermcq.com/faq.html).&quot; The investigators will&#xD;
      instruct participants to use one patch per day and use mini-lozenges when they have cravings&#xD;
      to smoke CCs (condition A) or cravings to smoke CCs or use ECs (condition B), without&#xD;
      surpassing 24 mini-lozenges in one 24-hour period. Anyone for whom NRT is contraindicated&#xD;
      will be excluded from the proposed RCT. In addition, though risk of serious adverse events&#xD;
      from NRT is low, the investigators will assess adverse events related to study procedures on&#xD;
      nightly surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive daily text message support throughout the 12-week treatment&#xD;
      period. The investigators will modify a text message library from SmokefreeTXT, a free&#xD;
      interactive text message cessation service provided by Smokefree.gov that has been used with&#xD;
      young adult smokers, uses empirically validated Behavior Change Techniques, and has been&#xD;
      employed to support engagement in prior smoking cessation research. Data from the&#xD;
      investigators' ongoing research indicate young adult smokers generally find daily text&#xD;
      messages to be helpful and acceptable. The investigators will modify text messages according&#xD;
      to participants' assigned group. For example, text messages for participants in groups A and&#xD;
      B will encourage regular use of NRT throughout the study period. Text messages for groups B&#xD;
      and D will support CC and EC cessation while messages for groups A and C will support CC&#xD;
      cessation and EC continuation. The text message service will be interactive for all&#xD;
      participants. In addition to receiving daily texts, participants will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      send text messages to the investigators' service which will prompt automatic responses. The&#xD;
      investigators will work with ICF incorporated, the provider for National Cancer Institute's&#xD;
      SmokefreeTXT platform, to deliver all daily text messages and to deliver links to daily&#xD;
      surveys.&#xD;
