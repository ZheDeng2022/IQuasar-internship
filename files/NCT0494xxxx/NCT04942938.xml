  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an individual with MS the central nervous system (CNS) is over-protective and causes the&#xD;
      threshold for stretch reflex and muscle tightness to be set lower than normal. This inhibits&#xD;
      normal movement and causes abnormalities in posture, stiffness and at times joint&#xD;
      contractures. In this pilot study we hope to assess the ability for the direct current of&#xD;
      NeuBie, which creates mechanoreceptor inputs and lengthening at the sarcomere level of muscle&#xD;
      and joints in the spine and lower extremity, to alter the proprioceptive peripheral nervous&#xD;
      system (PNS) at muscle spindle and GTO level with a change in CNS over-guarding during the&#xD;
      treatment and after the treatment. If the investigators are able to create normalized stretch&#xD;
      and muscle tension at the PNS level, it may be possible to create temporary or sustained CNS&#xD;
      level changes. This would allow the amount of stretch and tension at the PNS level to be&#xD;
      normalized and possibly reduce spasticity. If this theory is accurate, the investigators may&#xD;
      be able to increase access to normalized movement, strength and functional ability in&#xD;
      individuals with neuro-compromise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 66%6 to 84% of individuals with multiple sclerosis experience various levels of&#xD;
      debilitating spasticity limiting freedom of movement at ankles, knees and hips causing&#xD;
      deficits in ambulation, weakness from disuse of muscles not accessible due to spasticity. Per&#xD;
      the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis, a survey was conducted on&#xD;
      spasticity prevalence and results show 84% have some degree of spasticity from mild to&#xD;
      incapacitating. Spasticity pathophysiology is complex and not completely understood with&#xD;
      higher levels of incapacitating spasticity reported in this survey by those who were male,&#xD;
      disabled and unemployed, indicating that psychosocial and subjective variables are&#xD;
      significant. The pathophysiology currently best understood demonstrates an imbalance between&#xD;
      inhibitory dorsal reticulospinal tract (RST) fibers and excitatory bulbopontine tegmentum.&#xD;
      RST neurons receive direct somatic, vestibular, tectal, cerebellar and motor excitatory input&#xD;
      and are scattered in the ventral and lateral spinal cord columns intermingled with&#xD;
      propriospinal fibers. The peripheral Golgi tendon organ of muscle tendon and muscle spindle&#xD;
      intrafusal fibers ubiquitous throughout the musculoskeletal system have direct monosynaptic&#xD;
      connection to these central nervous system propriospinal fibers and heavily influence the&#xD;
      degree of spasticity and overactive stretch reflexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who deal with all levels of spasticity use compensatory movement strategies causing&#xD;
      altered arthrokinematics and have loss of strength, balance and efficient muscle use with&#xD;
      postural changes. Spasticity management has been studied and treated from a pharmaceutical&#xD;
      standpoint with some improvements but often side effects including fatigue, muscle weakness&#xD;
      and cognition limit dosing in oral Baclofen, Dantrolene Sodium, Tizanidine and&#xD;
      Benzodiazepines. Marijuana especially in form of cannabinoids shows mixed evidence for&#xD;
      spasticity improvement and is a growing area of interest. There is a growing CBD interest in&#xD;
      the MS population due to known reduction of CNS neurodegeneration in animal MS studies and no&#xD;
      significant negative side effects with possible mild to moderate improvement in spasticity&#xD;
      levels. Therapy interventions offered include frequent stretching especially of muscles that&#xD;
      cross two joints including lumbricals, hamstrings, gastrocnemius and iliopsoas; light&#xD;
      stroking over lower limbs demonstrated a 30% decrease in H-reflex amplitude lasting even 30&#xD;
      minutes after treatment; muscle cooling was shown to reduce muscle stretch activity and&#xD;
      clonus; Armutlu et al. Reported significant reduction in plantar flexor spasticity in 10&#xD;
      patients with MS using high-frequency (100Hz) TENS for 20min daily for 4 weeks. Reduction&#xD;
      noted on Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), electrophysiologic measurements and the AI; and&#xD;
      serial casting performed over a 9-day period with cast changes every 3 days demonstrated&#xD;
      reduced spasticity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NeuFit company offers a NeuBie EMS product with a direct current using high fidelity&#xD;
      audio equipment to decrease intensity of the treatment noxious stimulus and protect skin&#xD;
      integrity from burns or intolerable pain. This system uses an exponential wave pattern to&#xD;
      mimic the natural pattern neurologically to lengthen fibers of the sarcomere and engage force&#xD;
      velocity of muscle with minimized protective co-contraction of nearby muscle groups9. The&#xD;
      golgi tendon and muscle spindles code for joint position and muscle/tendon stretch with 66%&#xD;
      of fibers being intrafusal. Impacting these structures has direct impact on reticulospinal&#xD;
      tract (RST) fibers and proprioceptive central fibers modulation of levels of spasticity.&#xD;
      However, finding effective means to impact these areas is difficult. The NeuBie direct&#xD;
      current is designed to improve positioning of these stretch receptors. As discussed within&#xD;
      the paper hypothesis, the theory is that this may improve spasticity levels as well as&#xD;
      agonist strength enough to create long term, significant functional improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Terry Wahls who has MS and has studied and marketed a protocol for MS treatment, promotes&#xD;
      this product and has a home unit she uses daily to control her own MS symptoms and gain&#xD;
      strength. Currently there is no research study conducted on the effects of the NeuBie direct&#xD;
      current treatment combined with exercise and ramifications of spasticity in multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. There have been only a few studies conducted with quantitative spasticity measures&#xD;
      mostly with FES and NMES targeting tibialis anterior and quadriceps to lessen plantar flexor&#xD;
      spasticity in spinal cord injury (SCI) and hemiplegia. In the SCI study Mirbagheri et al.&#xD;
      observed decreases in intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness in all 4 subjects studied over a&#xD;
      16-month period. Robinson et al. stimulated quadriceps muscle pulse duration 500, 20 Hz and&#xD;
      amplitude of 100 with spasticity quantitatively reduced immediately after stimulation but&#xD;
      return of baseline spasticity level when measured 24 hours later. Levin and Hui-Chan assessed&#xD;
      sensory level stimulation of the common peroneal nerve for a total of 15, 60 min sessions for&#xD;
      3 weeks in people with hemiplegia using pulse duration 125 continuously at 99Hz and observed&#xD;
      inhibition of H-reflex at soleus, increase in dorsiflexion voluntary force and reductions in&#xD;
      stretch reflex at triceps surae. The NeuFit method of treatment allows the recipient to&#xD;
      voluntarily concentrically or eccentrically activate muscles while receiving the direct&#xD;
      current passive eccentric input. In order to assess the feasibility of this papers'&#xD;
      hypothesis the investigators will perform a pilot study of 4-6 individuals with MS in the&#xD;
      greater Denver metro area.&#xD;

NeuBie Mapping mode scanning process to scan for 1) spots that stimulate movement they couldn't do before per initial assessment, 2) spots that allow movement which is a greater range than available before per initial assessment, 3) spots that lead to decreased spasticity, and 4) diminished sensation areas - drive signal to increase sensory nerves and become metabolically active.&#xD;
