  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We know that broccoli is a vegetable that is associated with a number of health benefits and&#xD;
      is a good choice in a healthy diet. Researchers at major universities, including Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins University, have identified nutrients in broccoli that have specific health benefits&#xD;
      such as improving antioxidant protection. One of these nutrients is called glucoraphanin&#xD;
      (GR). However, in order for GR to deliver health benefits in the human body, it first has to&#xD;
      be converted to its active form, sulforaphane (SF). This conversion can happen one of two&#xD;
      ways. GR can be converted to SF by our gut bacteria (the microbiota) or it can be converted&#xD;
      to SF by an enzyme called myrosinase that is naturally occurring in certain plants, including&#xD;
      mustard (the same mustard that is used to make table mustard spread and mayonnaise). The&#xD;
      purpose of the present study is to test in healthy human volunteers the oral bioavailability&#xD;
      (absorption) of GR in broccoli seed extract (BSE) with or without the presence of active&#xD;
      plant myrosinase in mustard seed powder (MSP) delivered in a nutritional supplement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to determine in healthy human volunteers the oral&#xD;
      bioavailability of sulforaphane (SF) derived from broccoli seed extract (BSE) standardized to&#xD;
      glucoraphanin (GR) content with and without the presence of active plant myrosinase derived&#xD;
      from mustard seed powder. Once absorbed, SF is rapidly metabolized by initial conjugation&#xD;
      with the endogenous nucleophile glutathione (GSH). The glutathione conjugate then undergoes&#xD;
      successive steps of hydrolysis leading ultimately to the formation of the N-acetylcysteine&#xD;
      derivatives (mercapturic acids). All of these conjugates are chemically designated&#xD;
      dithiocarbamates (DTC) and can be quantified in the blood and urine by mass spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MS). Based on previous published studies, it is expected that the conversion of the oral&#xD;
      dose of 115 umol of GR to DTC will be about 30-40% (on a molar basis) when GR is co-delivered&#xD;
      with mustard seed powder myrosinase, but only 10% when delivered without the myrosinase&#xD;
      source. Blood samples will be collected to determine if the supplements influence biomarkers&#xD;
      for oxidative stress and inflammation. The stool sample will be used to measure the&#xD;
      alpha-diversity of the gut microbiome and whether this has an influence on urine levels of SF&#xD;
      and DTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 16 male and female adults ages 25 to 65 years, and employ a&#xD;
      randomized crossover design, with a 7 day washout period between trials. Supplements&#xD;
      (broccoli seed extract, BSE, and vitamin C (VC) with or without mustard seed powder, MSP)&#xD;
      will be in identical capsules, with the double blind code held by the sponsor until after the&#xD;
      study is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited and then contacted prior to visit #1 to determine if they&#xD;
      match the criteria for entry into the study. Participants will record food and beverages&#xD;
      consumed during the evening meal prior to visit #1. Participants will also be instructed to&#xD;
      refrain from consuming cruciferous vegetables and condiments that might contain&#xD;
      glucosinolates or isothiocyanates (e.g., mustard, horseradish, wasabi, mayonnaise) for 3 days&#xD;
      before and during the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #1: Screening, Orientation, Supplementation and Basic Study Procedures Participants&#xD;
      will come to the Human Performance Lab (600 Laureate Way, North Carolina Research Campus,&#xD;
      Kannapolis, NC) at 7:00, 8:00, or 9:00 am after an overnight fast (at least 9 hours) having&#xD;
      avoided consumption of cruciferous vegetables and condiments for at least three days. This&#xD;
      visit will begin with a review of the consent form. Height, body weight, body composition&#xD;
      (i.e., percent body fat measured on a special scale that participants stand on with bare&#xD;
      feet), and blood pressure (automated unit, Omron Healthcare, Inc. Lake Forest, IL,&#xD;
      IntelliSense Blood Pressure Monitor Model: HEM-907XL) will be measured in a private section&#xD;
      of the lab. The food record for the prior evening meal will be turned in and reviewed with&#xD;
      instructions to consume the same meal the evening before Visit #3. Participants will next&#xD;
      provide a spot urine sample in a private stall in the restroom. A mid-stream urine sample&#xD;
      will be collected in a cup. Next, participants will be randomized to consume 2 capsules&#xD;
      containing either BSE + VC or BSE+VC+MSP along with 8 oz. of water. Participants will consume&#xD;
      all of the water along with the 2 capsules. The two supplements will be in identical looking&#xD;
      capsules so that participants will not be able to determine their identity. Participants and&#xD;
      the research will not know which capsules were received at visits 1 or 3 until the study is&#xD;
      over. Following intake of the supplement, participants will consume a muffin and coffee&#xD;
      within 15 minutes of taking the supplement. Participants will abstain from eating any food or&#xD;
      beverages except for water for 2 hours following consumption of the supplement. After the 2-h&#xD;
      delay, participants can resume their normal dietary patterns. Participants will collect all&#xD;
      urine for the 24 h period after consuming the supplements. Participants will collect all&#xD;
      urine for the first 8 hours in one container, and then collect the remaining 8-24 h of urine&#xD;
      in a second container. This first visit will take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #2: Return urine samples and provide blood sample Participants will come to the lab in&#xD;
      an overnight fasted state the next morning, drop off the urine collection containers, and&#xD;
      provide a blood sample. A stool collection kit with instructions will be given to each&#xD;
      participant. (Instructions are included in the forms file attached to this application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Day Prior to Visit #3 Participants will collect a small swab sample of stool in a&#xD;
      container provided by the lab on Visit #1. Participants will consume the same dinner that was&#xD;
      consumed prior to Visit #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #3: Supplementation and Basic Study Procedures One week after visit #1, participants&#xD;
      will return to the Human Performance Lab at the same time in an overnight fasted state. All&#xD;
      the procedures from Visit #1 will be repeated except that participants will consume the&#xD;
      opposite supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #4: Return urine samples and provide blood sample Participants (overnight fasted state)&#xD;
      will drop off the final urine collection containers at the lab the next morning and provide&#xD;
      the fourth and final blood sample.&#xD;
