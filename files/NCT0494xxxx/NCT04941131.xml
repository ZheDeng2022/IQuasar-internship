    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the coronaviruses such&#xD;
      as (SARS &amp; MERS) which are commonly known for causing severe respiratory illnesses.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be the leading cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) . On March&#xD;
      11th 2020, the WHO announced that SARS-CoV-2 is a global pandemic. Based on COVID-19 Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia Ministry of Health Dashboard, globally, as of April 5th 2021, there have been more&#xD;
      than 131 million confirmed cases of the disease including more than 2 million deaths.&#xD;
      Nationally, as of April 5th 2021, there have been 392,682 confirmed cases including 6,697&#xD;
      deaths .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of COVID-19 involves molecular testing which is the gold standard and the WHO&#xD;
      most recommended method of diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 seemed to be very contagious and the chances&#xD;
      of its transmission even before any symptoms occur are very high. It has been documented that&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease incubation period to range between 1-14 days, most reported to be between 3&#xD;
      to 7 days with some evidence suggested the incubation period of 5 days. Evidence concerned&#xD;
      about the spread of infection due to missed screened cases especially when individuals are&#xD;
      unaware of their infection status and didn't show any symptoms yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing evidence confirmed that saliva and oral cavity to be a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 .&#xD;
      Multiple studies suggested SARS-CoV-2 to be airborne infection, and get transmitted through&#xD;
      aerosols. In dental clinic aerosol-producing-procedures pose a significant risk for&#xD;
      transmission of the infection. It is very important to minimize the risk of transmission in&#xD;
      dental office reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva if possible, in suspect or conformed&#xD;
      cases. Preprocedural mouth rises have been used widely to minimize the number of oral&#xD;
      microorganisms. Multiple studies confirmed the efficacy of those mouth rinses in reducing the&#xD;
      possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to determine the efficacy of different mouthwash in reducing the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva of COVID-19 confirmed cases compared with tap water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to determine the viral load, assess the cases clinical&#xD;
      information &amp; disease manifestation, plus the cases demographic characteristics believed to&#xD;
      have an influence on the disease characteristics.&#xD;
