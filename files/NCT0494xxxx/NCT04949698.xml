    <textblock>
      Early identification of the risk factors of pregnancy-related thrombotic microangiopathies&#xD;
      can help us reduce the complications of such patients and increase the survival rate of&#xD;
      patients. In addition, it is still controversial whether patients with pregnancy-related&#xD;
      thrombotic microvessels should receive plasma therapy.&#xD;

      &quot;Objective: To evaluate the risk factors of pregnancy-related thrombotic microangiopathies&#xD;
      and the effect of plasma exchange on the prognosis (recovery status of renal function,&#xD;
      recovery status of platelets, survival or death within 28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A retrospective analysis of pregnant patients admitted to the ICU from 2015 to 2019.&#xD;
      According to the outcome indicator of the occurrence of pregnancy-related thrombotic&#xD;
      microangiopathies, they were divided into thrombotic microangiopathies group and&#xD;
      non-thrombotic microangiopathies group. Patients in the pregnancy-related thrombotic&#xD;
      microangiopathy group were divided into plasma exchange combined non-plasma exchange group&#xD;
      according to whether they received plasma exchange. Collect the clinical data of the&#xD;
      patients, and analyze the data using SPSS 1 7.0 statistical software package. The measurement&#xD;
      data were compared by paired t test and one-way analysis of variance; the count data were&#xD;
      compared by Ï‡2 test. Compare the differences of the indicators between the two groups and&#xD;
      analyze the risk factors of pregnancy-related thrombotic microangiopathies. Then compare&#xD;
      whether there is a difference in the prognosis between the plasma exchange group and the&#xD;
      non-plasma exchange group.&quot;&#xD;
