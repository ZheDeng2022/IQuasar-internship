  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators will perform a multicenter randomised controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine whether advice to consume a moderate, whole food-based low-carbohydrate high-fat&#xD;
      (LCHF) ad libitum diet (CarbCount program) can produce and maintain equal remission rates of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) as a nutritionally complete very-low-calorie formula diet followed by a&#xD;
      energy-restrictive (i.e., calorie counting) diet (DiRECT principles). Within the principles&#xD;
      of each approach, the dietary goals and change will be adjusted according to individual&#xD;
      needs/capabilities conducive to long-term adherence. Furthermore, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine whether the rate of diet-induced remission is reflected in/can be predicted by&#xD;
      baseline or diet-induced changes in glucose variability (e.g., time-in-range measured by&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring) and other factors such as anthropometric changes and genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility. Each center will also conduct locally-lead standalone mechanistic research,&#xD;
      including analyses of intra-abdominal/hepatic fat accumulation, adipose tissue biopsies&#xD;
      and/or measurements of energy metabolism. Additionally, changes in medication use,&#xD;
      nutritional status, cardiovascular disease risk, as well as adverse events, will be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 750 patients with T2D will be recruited, approximately 120-150 men and women at each&#xD;
      research center. The participants will be randomised to 1) a nutritional complete formula&#xD;
      diet for 3 months followed by an energy restricted diet for 12 months or 2) a very&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate high-fat (VLCHF) diet for 3 months, followed by a low-carbohydrate high-fat&#xD;
      diet (LCHF) for 12 months. Each of the diets will cover all basic requirements for essential&#xD;
      nutrients including amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to consume at least 200 g of vegetables per day. Furthermore, we will emphasize&#xD;
      high-quality, minimally processed foods. In arm 2 they will receive advice to eat specific&#xD;
      fat sources such as extra virgin olive oil, butter and high-fat cheeses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DiRECT trial showed remission in 46% of participants after 12 months. Assuming that both&#xD;
      the DiRECT program and LCHF dietary strategies yield a 45% chance of T2D remission after 12&#xD;
      months, it is calculated (using nQuery v8) that each group needs 235 participants to complete&#xD;
      the trial. This sample size yields 90% statistical power to conclude, with respect to the&#xD;
      primary outcome, whether the CarbCount Program is no more than 15% more or less effective&#xD;
      than the DiRECT principles (equivalence study, one-sided p-value at 0.025). To allow for&#xD;
      expected loss to follow-up (estimated at 20%), each of the arms needs at least 294&#xD;
      participants for a total of 588.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have access to electronic platforms that include an online database of&#xD;
      recipes (breakfast, easy-to-cook lunches, snacks, dinners, and food for special occasions).&#xD;
      The platforms will facilitate planning of week menus, and include an e-learning course&#xD;
      covering topics such as how to cook and prepare foods, meal planning, dining out, sleep and&#xD;
      individual aspects that challenge habit change. If the participants are failing in their&#xD;
      efforts to establish or maintain lifestyle change, they will be encouraged to seek possible&#xD;
      solutions in the e-learning courses or to contact one of the study's health educators and/or&#xD;
      dietitians. Specific rescue plans involving direct contact with study staff will be&#xD;
      implemented if a participant regains more than 2 kg or experiences T2D relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After individual assessment by a doctor, the participants will be taken off diabetes&#xD;
      medication upon starting the diet, and be asked to self-monitor blood sugar changes during&#xD;
      the first 2 weeks on the diet, followed by a consultation that includes evaluation of these&#xD;
      changes. The need of reintroduction of medication will be done in consultation with the study&#xD;
      doctor at least every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between visits, the participants will complete dietary assessments and an e-learning course,&#xD;
      and at least once a month have follow-ups with dietitians/health educators and/or online&#xD;
      group workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll eligible participants to the study continuously, until the total number&#xD;
      of participants needed for the study is reached. Each participant will follow their own&#xD;
      timeline, and attend visits at the study center at baseline, 3, 9 and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 2 weeks before each visit, participants will wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)&#xD;
      and record food intake for at least 3 consecutive days during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements during visits will include anthropometric variables/body composition and energy&#xD;
      expenditure, blood, saliva, urine and stool samples will be collected, and participants will&#xD;
      be asked to fill out questionnaires on physical activity, sleep pattern, meal frequency,&#xD;
      quality of life, problem areas in diabetes, eating efficacy and eating behaviors. They will&#xD;
      also have a consultation with a registered dietitian and meet with the study medical doctor&#xD;
      when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded statistician will perform the statistical analyses for the primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

The questionnaire consists of 18 items on a 4-point response scale ( ranging from definitely true/mostly true/mostly false/definitely false). Responses to each item are given a score between 1 and 4 and and total scores are summed by the 3 measured aspects mentioned above. The raw scale scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale. Changes in these scores will be compared between the study groups for the respective time-points throughout the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 9 and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life measured by the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, which includes 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain /discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The levels are scored with a 1-digit number and the digits for the five dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. We will compare change at all timepoints between groups using both the 1-digit and the 5-digit number.&#xD;
The questionnaire includes the patient's self-rated health on a Visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0-100. The endpoints are labelled &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;. The scale will be transposed into percentages and the percent change will be compared between the study groups.</description>
