      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      efficacy, and PK/ Pharmacodynamics of APG-2575 in combination with Pd/DRd in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM). The study consists of dose escalation and&#xD;
      dose expansion phases. The study consists of will start with 2 arms noted below, both arms&#xD;
      are independent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: APG-2575 will be administered in combination with Pd to determine the MTD and /RP2D of&#xD;
      APG-2575 in subjects with R/R MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3+3 design will be utilized in dose escalation phase of APG-2575 in combination with Pd. The&#xD;
      starting target dose of APG-2575 is 400 mg (dose level; DL1) and will be escalated in&#xD;
      subsequent cohorts to 600 mg (DL2), 800 mg (DL3) accordingly. Dose reduction to 200 mg (DL-1)&#xD;
      is acceptable if APG-2575 at dose of 400 mg cannot be tolerated. This rule-based design&#xD;
      proceeds with cohorts of three patients. If none of the three patients enrolled in DL1&#xD;
      experiences a DLT, another three patients will be treated at DL2, and so on. However, if one&#xD;
      patient experiences a DLT, three more patients will be treated at the same dose level. The&#xD;
      dose escalation continues until at least two patients among a cohort of three to six patients&#xD;
      experience DLT. MTD is conventionally defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 33% of&#xD;
      patients experience DLT. Higher dose level would be considered after a comprehensive analyses&#xD;
      of safety data in the context of 800 mg can be well tolerated, otherwise, 800 mg (DL3) should&#xD;
      be considered as MTD (Arm A). RP2D (Arm A) will be determined based on efficacy and safety&#xD;
      profile of APG-2575 in combination with Pd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive APG-2575 at target dose once daily for 28 days plus pomalidomide (4 mg&#xD;
      ) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg for patients ≤ 75 years old or 20 mg for&#xD;
      patients &gt; 75 years old) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a repeated 28-day cycle&#xD;
