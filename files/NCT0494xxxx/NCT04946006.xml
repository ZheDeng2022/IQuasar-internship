  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the minimal effective oxytocin maintenance dose required&#xD;
      during cesarean delivery to achieve the best effect. Oxytocin is a drug which is routinely&#xD;
      used to help contract the uterus and keep it contracted after the delivery of the baby and&#xD;
      placenta. The aim of oxytocin is to reduce the amount of blood that might be lost. In order&#xD;
      to determine the minimal effective dose, the investigators will conduct a dose-finding study.&#xD;
      The first patient will receive a set oxytocin infusion. If the uterus contracts well, this is&#xD;
      considered satisfactory and the next patient will receive the same dose. If the uterus does&#xD;
      not contract well, this is considered unsatisfactory and the next patient will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose. The dose for the next patient will be determined based on the results of the&#xD;
      uterine contraction of the previous patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the ED90 of an oxytocin infusion rate to maintain a&#xD;
      satisfactory uterine tone during a cesarean delivery in non-laboring women, would be lower&#xD;
      than that found in previous studies without an initial bolus (less than 16 IU/h).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a prospective, double blinded clinical trial (patient,&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and obstetrician blinded to the oxytocin dose), in an up-down sequential&#xD;
      allocation fashion. The objective of the study is to determine the minimum effective dose of&#xD;
      oxytocin infusion required to produce appropriate uterine contraction during and after&#xD;
      cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia in non-laboring women. For the purpose of this&#xD;
      study, the minimum effective dose is defined to be that at which adequate response occurs in&#xD;
      90% of patients, i.e. ED90.&#xD;

    <measure>Uterine tone upon discharge from the post anesthetic care unit (PACU): questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Uterine tone will be evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory by the obstetrician throughout the surgery, starting at 5 minutes after the oxytocin infusion. It will also be measured at 10 minutes following the oxytocin infusion and every 10 minutes following that for the duration of the surgery. Unsatisfactory uterine tone at any time until discharge from the PACU will be considered a failure of the maintenance infusion.</description>

    <measure>Calculated blood loss</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated blood loss will be calculated using the difference in hematocrit values prior to surgery and 24 hours post surgery, using the following formula:&#xD;
Calculated blood loss (mL) = EBV ((Pre-op Htc-Post-op Htc)/pre-op Htc) EBV (estimated blood volume) in ml: patient's weight in kg x 85.</description>
