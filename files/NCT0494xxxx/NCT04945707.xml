    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the correction of functional iron&#xD;
      deficiency by administering a single dose of intravenous iron (ferric derimaltose or&#xD;
      Monoferric®) in participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) will&#xD;
      improve exercise capacity as measured by the change in peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) from&#xD;
      baseline to 12 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess change in&#xD;
      exercise capacity after iron repletion with a single dose of ferric derisomaltose&#xD;
      (Monoferric®) IV compared to placebo in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and&#xD;
      with functional iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-six HFpEF participants who have functional iron deficiency will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) Laboratory and will have a recent or scheduled&#xD;
      clinical care CPET with exercise hemodynamic assessment. These measurements will serve as&#xD;
      baseline measures. After undergoing other baseline measurements such as echocardiogram,&#xD;
      actigraphy, research biomarkers, and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)&#xD;
      participants will be randomized (2:1) to either a single dose of ferric derisomaltose&#xD;
      (Monoferric®)1000 mg/100 ml (n=44) or placebo (n=22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the iron drug formulation is of brown color and the placebo is clear, unblinded&#xD;
      staff members will be assigned to order, pick up and administer drug to the subject. The&#xD;
      subject is blinded; therefore, the drug will be infused using a tented covering over the arm&#xD;
      in which the IV has been placed. The tented covering will allow adequate viewing of the IV&#xD;
      site, but outside of the view of the subject. All blinded staff will not be present during&#xD;
      study drug infusion. Prior to infusion the subject will undergo vital signs; blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, and temperature. A peripheral intravenous catheter will be placed followed by an&#xD;
      infusion of Monoferric 1000 mg (for subjects less than 50 kg, 20 mg/kg) as per current&#xD;
      FDA-approved dosing or placebo over 20 minutes. Vital signs will be performed immediately&#xD;
      after dosing and after 30 minutes. Subjects will remain in the clinic for observation for 30&#xD;
      minutes following infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by sex and will be performed in permutated blocks of 4 to&#xD;
      assure balanced group sizes. In order to allocate without bias, and in a manner blinded to&#xD;
      both participants and investigators, we will use random number generation at the time of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return for a CPET, echocardiogram, actigraphy, KCCQ, ECG, complete&#xD;
      metabolic panel, and blood draw for research biomarkers, cardiovascular exam, and assessment&#xD;
      of adverse experiences. A subset of subjects (n=33) will undergo a CPET with exercise&#xD;
      hemodynamic assessment. The remaining subjects will undergo an noninvasive CPET (N=33)&#xD;
