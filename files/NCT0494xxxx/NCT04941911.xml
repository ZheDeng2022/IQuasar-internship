  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether an octreotide infusion during liver&#xD;
      transplantation improves renal outcomes, intraoperative blood pressure and reduces&#xD;
      haemorrhage and transfusion requirement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common and serious complications of liver transplantation surgery include renal failure,&#xD;
      haemorrhage and blood transfusion. These complications prolong post-operative recovery,&#xD;
      increase the risk of liver graft failure, mortality and the need for long-term renal&#xD;
      dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug octreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin with comparable physiological&#xD;
      effects and a good side-effect profile. Existing evidence in liver transplantation supports&#xD;
      octreotide efficacy in improving renal function, reducing bleeding and enhancing blood&#xD;
      pressure. However, there is no robust randomised controlled trial evidence for octreotide in&#xD;
      liver transplantation and limited safety data regarding its use in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi centre, prospective double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      octreotide infusion during liver transplantation. The patients will be randomised in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio to either octreotide or placebo groups. Stratified randomisation of patients is by&#xD;
      donation type (DCD vs. DBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised in the anaesthetic room and study medication given as an initial&#xD;
      bolus of 5ml (100mcg octreotide or saline) prior to surgical incision and then continued&#xD;
      throughout surgery at 5ml/hr (100mcg/hour octreotide or saline).&#xD;
