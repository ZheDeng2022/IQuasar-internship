    <textblock>
      150 adults patients with locally advanced or metastatic BRAFV600E mutation-positive,&#xD;
      differentiated thyroid carcinoma who are refractory to radioactive iodine and have progressed&#xD;
      following prior VEGFR targeted therapy will enter in the trial. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 2:1 ratio to either dabrafenib plus trametinib or placebo. Patients will be stratified&#xD;
      by number of prior VEGFR targeted therapy (1versus2) and prior lenvatinib treatment (yes&#xD;
      versus no)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in adult patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic BRAFV600E mutation-positive, differentiated thyroid cancer who&#xD;
      are refractory to radioactive iodine and have progressed following prior VEGFR targeted&#xD;
      therapy. After eligibility assessment, approximately 150 patients will be randomized in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio to either dabrafenib plus trametinib or placebo. Patients will receive dabrafenib in&#xD;
      combination with trametinib or placebo until disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 as&#xD;
      determined by investigator and confirmed by BIRC or loss of clinical benefit as determined by&#xD;
      investigator, death, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, withdrawal of consent, lost to&#xD;
      follow-up or early termination of the study by the sponsor. Patients randomized in the&#xD;
      placebo arm and for whom progression as per RECIST 1.1 is confirmed by blinded independent&#xD;
      review committee and who meet the criteria will be given the option to cross over to the open&#xD;
      label combination drug dabrafenib plus trametinib&#xD;
