      The present study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot study. Approximately 40&#xD;
      males aged between ≥ 20 and ≤ 35 years, will be screened. Each trial arm will have at least 5&#xD;
      completed after accounting for dropout/withdrawal rate of 20%. The treatment duration for all&#xD;
      the study participants will be 28 to 56 days (Day 56 is only applicable for participants with&#xD;
      less than 10% increase in weight leg pressed for 1 RM on Day 28. All participants in arm 1 of&#xD;
      study will have their end of study visit on Day 28).Sponsor proposes ingredients that when&#xD;
      added to daily whey supplementation, can lead to increased muscle strength, improves sleep&#xD;
      quality and reduction in fatigue level.&#xD;
