      The main objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of patient's learning in&#xD;
      self-taking of prescribed treatments and provided by JOE, on the number of severe&#xD;
      exacerbations in children with an asthma graded 2, 3 or 4 according to GINA classification.&#xD;

      A new device, named JOE, manufactured by Ludocare, is available since 2019 in France. This&#xD;
      new device, compact and connected, was designed to be easy to use by children suffering from&#xD;
      chronic disease. JOE is a robot designed to improve compliance with chronic treatments. To&#xD;
      confirm efficacy and safety of a patient's learning in self-taking of prescribed treatments&#xD;
      provided by JOE, it has been decided to carry out a clinical study in 4 to 11 years old&#xD;
      patients and suffering from asthma graded 2, 3 or 4 according to GINA classification. These&#xD;
      patients will be recruited by pneumo-pediatricians at hospital or in private practice. The&#xD;
      study is a phase 3, multi-center, prospective, open, 2-parallel groups, randomized and&#xD;
      controlled study. Each patient will be randomly allocated in one of two studied treatment&#xD;
      groups: standard chronic treatments (group SCT) vs standard chronic treatments + JOE&#xD;
      robot(group SCT + JOE). Patients meeting eligible criteria will be included at Day 0 (Visit&#xD;
      V0). For each patient the maximal duration of this study will be 12 months. At day 7 a phone&#xD;
      call is planned to evaluate patient/parent's motivation and to detect potential technical&#xD;
      and/or therapeutic problems. Three visits are planned then after at4 (M4), 8 (M8)and 12&#xD;
      (M12)months.&#xD;
