  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the Correlation Of CoAGulation-Atrial Fibrillation (COAG-AF) study is to prove&#xD;
      that an increase in pro-thrombotic biomarkers in AF is associated with an increase in AF&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the impact of catheter ablation on serum pro-thrombotic biomarkers in&#xD;
           patients with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate coagulation biomarkers with imaging features such as, the degree of&#xD;
           fibrosis found on Late Gadolinium Enhancement Magnetic Resonance Imaging (LGE-MRI)&#xD;
           scans, which is a part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine baseline values of coagulation and pro-thrombotic biomarkers in the AF&#xD;
           population and compare those baseline values with the general population values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare central and peripheral thrombotic biomarkers in patients with atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COAG-AF is a 3-month prospective observational study in patients diagnosed with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and undergoing a first-time ablation procedure. It will be a pilot study&#xD;
      consisting of approximately twenty patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a baseline blood draw prior to ablation. A cardiac MRI (LGE-MRI) scan&#xD;
      will also be performed prior to ablation and is part of standard of care in patients&#xD;
      undergoing ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During catheter ablation, blood will be taken simultaneously from a peripheral blood vessel&#xD;
      and from the left atrium (LA) at two different timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have additional blood draws immediately following ablation, one month and three&#xD;
      months after ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Data Elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect data from electronic medical health records and/or REDCap&#xD;
      surveys sent through e-mail addresses provided by participants: demographic information,&#xD;
      medical history, medication use, family history, and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol,&#xD;
      eating habits etc.). Imaging data, notably echography and cardiac MRI will be recorded when&#xD;
      applicable. Imaging data collected will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LA fibrosis: %, and location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left Ventricular (LV) fibrosis: % and location&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LA shape&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LA volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LA functional assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart reviews and surveys will collect the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All-cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebrovascular events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AF free interval after ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect data from an FDA approved ElectroCardioGram (ECG)&#xD;
      wearable patch (BodyGuardian® MINI) by Preventice, when prompted. All data elements will be&#xD;
      stored on a secured, HIPAA compliant REDCap study database, only accessible by study team&#xD;
      members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venipuncture will be performed by a trained nurse or a trained technician. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected before ablation, twice during ablation, and after ablation at day 1, 30 and 90&#xD;
      at the Tulane Hospital blood laboratory. During ablation, two samples will be obtained from&#xD;
      the LA simultaneously while obtaining peripheral blood. Note that the catheter is already in&#xD;
      the LA while performing ablation. Therefore, no additional steps are required to obtain blood&#xD;
      samples from LA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation biomarkers that will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of endothelial dysfunction: Asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of platelet activation: P-selectin, Platelet factor 4, B-thromboglobulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of coagulation: Von Willebrand factor (vWf), Thrombin levels: Thrombin&#xD;
           Antithrombin levels (TAT), Prothrombin Factor 1+2, Fibrinogen levels, Factor 8, Factor&#xD;
           11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of fibrinolysis: D-dimers&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG Wearable Patch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an FDA approved BodyGuardian® MINI ECG patch provided by Preventice&#xD;
      to wear post- ablation, as part of the patient's standard of care. Duration of ECG Patch will&#xD;
      be determined by the treating physician. This will provide a continuous ECG strip to assess&#xD;
      the amount of AF burden a patient is in after their procedure. The patch must be worn for the&#xD;
      entire period and can be worn during exercise and during showering/bathing. A member of the&#xD;
      clinical trial team will help with the application set-up process. They will assign each&#xD;
      patient a unique identifier which will be entered into the device at the study site so that&#xD;
      the patient's ECG transmissions will always be associated with their participant identifier&#xD;
      (ID). These results will be uploaded onto the study data management platform for analysis.&#xD;
