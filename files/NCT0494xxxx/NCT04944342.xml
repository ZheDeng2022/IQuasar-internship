      This research; It will be done to perform thoracic movement analysis of young adult&#xD;
      individuals who have survived COVID-19 and to compare them with those without a history of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals' sternal movements using motion analysis sensors; will be recorded in sitting&#xD;
      position, standing, and walking. Sternal movement of the person; It will be recorded during&#xD;
      relaxed breathing and deep breathing. They will also be asked to walk on the treadmill in&#xD;
      such a way as to collect at least 500 steps.&#xD;
