    <textblock>
      The innovative drug XC221 100 mg tablet is designed for the treatment of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection). A multicenter, adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III&#xD;
      clinical study is aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of XC221 100 mg tablet, in mild&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients during a 14-days treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of XC221 100 mg tablet (200&#xD;
      mg daily dose) in achieving clinical improvement of mild COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of XC221 100 mg tablet (200 mg&#xD;
      daily dose) in mild COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

      8 Russian centers will participate in this study. The trail will consist of three periods:&#xD;
      screening (duration not more than 1 day, it may coincide with the randomization visit and&#xD;
      beginning of drug administration), treatment period (14 full days) and follow-up period (15 ±&#xD;
      1 days after completion of treatment with XC221 / Placebo). The duration of participation in&#xD;
      the study for each patient will be no more than 32 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      274 eligible patients with confirmed COVID-19 will be randomized into two groups (Group A and&#xD;
      Group B) in a 1:1 ratio: Group A - XC221 200 mg daily (137 patients); Group В - Placebo (137&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period (14 full days), 1 tablet of XC221 / Placebo will be administered&#xD;
      2 times a day in addition to the standard of care (SoC) for COVID-19 according to The&#xD;
      Temporary guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection of&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (the MoH Temporary Guidelines). The&#xD;
      follow-up period will last for 15 ± 1 days.&#xD;
