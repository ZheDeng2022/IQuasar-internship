      This study is a phase I clinical study evaluating TJ210001 monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors in dose escalation. The overall design of the study is shown in the&#xD;
      figure below. The purpose of the TJ210001 single-dose escalation study in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of monotherapy to determine&#xD;
      the MTD (or MAD) and clinically recommended doses of TJ210001 monotherapy.&#xD;
