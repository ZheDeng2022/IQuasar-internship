  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a commensal bacterium, often isolated in the&#xD;
      nasopharynx of preschool children and older adults with weakened immune systems, a pathogen&#xD;
      that remains the leading cause of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) and invasive&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease (IPD) such as Sepsis and Meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAP is the sixth leading cause of overall mortality and the first cause of infectious disease&#xD;
      in Colombia and the world (Montúfar et al, 2013; GBD, 2016; WHO, 2018), and both its&#xD;
      incidence and prevalence have remained stable over the past 3 decades. Likewise, CAP due to&#xD;
      S. pnemoniae is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in humans&#xD;
      worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients who suffer from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcus frequently colonizes the nasopharynx of children and adults and, therefore, this&#xD;
      condition has been postulated as a risk factor for the development of CAP. There are reports&#xD;
      of the effect of nasopharyngeal colonization in infants, but the implications of this&#xD;
      colonization in adults, especially adults with chronic comorbidities, are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, several studies point to a relationship between pathogenicity, colonization&#xD;
      capacity, and disease severity according to the infecting pneumococcal serotype. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is not known which pneumococcal serotypes are most frequently colonized by adults with&#xD;
      chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),&#xD;
      renal disease (RHD), rheumatological disease (MDR), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), among others) and&#xD;
      the potential clinical implications of this colonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, this research aims to study the phenomenon of colonization by pneumococcus&#xD;
      in patients with chronic diseases for the development of CAP, and the relationship between&#xD;
      the virulence genes of different serotypes and the outcome in invasive pneumococcal disease&#xD;
      (IPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on real evidence (from clinical practice) and translational medicine, is&#xD;
      prospective-observational, multicenter and cohort type in consecutive patients. Thus, in a&#xD;
      first phase the clinical observation of the subjects will be carried out, a second phase of&#xD;
      follow-up and sampling in the patients, and a third phase of molecular analysis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is responsible for more than 5 million deaths a&#xD;
      year globally (Aliberti et al., 2016; Reyes et al., 2017). This opportunistic Gram-positive&#xD;
      bacterium is the most frequently identified bacteria in patients with CAP, acute meningitis,&#xD;
      and otitis in children and adults (Paterson et al., 2010; Hinojosa et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pneumococcal disease has changed during the last decade due to universal pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccination programs, especially in children, patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, and&#xD;
      patients older than 65 years old. Now, serotypes thought to be not clinically significant are&#xD;
      frequently identified in patients with pneumococcal diseases (Imohl et al., 2015;&#xD;
      Vlachopoulos et al., 2015; Cilloniz et al., 2016; Diao et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, mortality and morbidity associated with pneumococcal infection in adults have&#xD;
      remained relatively steady during the last decades (Jain et al., 2015; Bellew et al., 2018;&#xD;
      Wunderink et al., 2018). Several hypotheses have been generated to explain this phenomenon.&#xD;
      Among the most studied, researchers have documentedthat circulating pneumococcal serotypes&#xD;
      are different now, and thus, currently available vaccines may not be as useful to prevent&#xD;
      invasive pneumococcal diseases now (Aliberti et al., 2013; Cilloniz et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, adults are not frequently vaccinated with the pneumococcal vaccine, and only a very&#xD;
      restrictive group of patients receive the vaccine. In Colombia, it is not known whether even&#xD;
      that restrictive group of adults with an indication for a pneumococcal vaccine have been&#xD;
      vaccinated, following national and international guidelines. More importantly, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether other groups of patients with chronic medical diseases might benefit from receiving&#xD;
      this vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, it is also unknown, which are the most prevalent serotypes causing colonization&#xD;
      and invasive infections in adults with chronic diseases in Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently carried out a multicenter, multinational, worldwide study designed to&#xD;
      characterize better the etiology of CAP (the most frequent infection caused by the&#xD;
      pneumococcus) (Aliberti et al., 2016; Carugati et al., 2016; Gramegna et al., 2018; Restrepo&#xD;
      et al., 2018; Radovanovic et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we enrolled more than 3,700 patients in six continents, finding that S.&#xD;
      pneumoniae continues to be the most frequent bacterial pathogen identified in patients with&#xD;
      CAP worldwide. However, in this study, we also documented that the pneumococcal vaccination&#xD;
      rate is meager (data not yet published). Thus, we firmly believe that identifying whether&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccination is adequate in our country (Colombia), and more importantly, which&#xD;
      are the most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes colonizing the nasopharyngeal epithelium of&#xD;
      patients with chronic medical conditions, might help us to identify new indications for&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccination and to help decrease the burden of pneumococcal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, here we will attempt to provide new information to characterize better&#xD;
      pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization of patients with chronic medical diseases, its&#xD;
      implications, its overtime dynamics, and how this colonization might be associated with CPA&#xD;
      development. Moreover, here we will be able to characterize vaccination compliance and how&#xD;
      this previous vaccination might modify the natural course of pneumococcal disease (i.e.,&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal colonization precedes pneumococcal pneumonia). Finally, here we will carry out&#xD;
      real-world evidence, prospective study evidence that will provide generalizable data for&#xD;
      clinicians around the globe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is real-world evidence, prospective, observational, multicenter, a cohort study of&#xD;
      consecutive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive ambulatory patients that assist to 5 outpatient clinics with chronic diseases&#xD;
      such as heart failure, HBP, chronic cardiac arrhythmias, rheumatic diseases,&#xD;
      non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis, COPD, among others, with the following inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Older than 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients assisting to cardiology, pulmonology, endocrinology or rheumatology clinic in&#xD;
           participating centers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in whom vaccination information is available and confirmed in the medical&#xD;
           records (this information will also be confirmed during the patient's interview)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that sign informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients diagnosed with CAP during the past 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients admitted to the hospital during the last 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with limitation to provide biological samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identifying potential study subjects, informed consent will be obtained for interested&#xD;
      patients, and a unique identification number will be assigned for each study' participant.&#xD;
      Under any circumstance, patients will receive more than one identification number. Then,&#xD;
      demographic data, past medical history, comorbid conditions, recent hospitalization, and&#xD;
      biological samples will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a nasopharyngeal swap to identify which patients are colonized with S.&#xD;
      pneumoniae and to identify which are the most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes. We will draw&#xD;
      20cc of blood to identify inflammatory biomarkers, and 30cc urine samples will be collected&#xD;
      for laboratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting samples in ambulatory clinics during study visits, these will be referred to&#xD;
      our centralized research laboratory localized in the Universidad de La Sabana to carry out&#xD;
      laboratory experiments. All nasopharyngeal swaps will be culture for pneumococcal&#xD;
      identification; if S. pneumoniae is identified, we will characterize in our laboratory&#xD;
      pneumococcal serotypes. Moreover, we will perform rtPCR to better identify and quantify&#xD;
      pneumococcal colonization in the nasopharyngeal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also quantify serum biomarkers of inflammation, using commercially available ELISA&#xD;
      kits. Importantly, all laboratory personnel will be blinded to patients' characteristics and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, to ensure data quality and avoid observer bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups and outcome determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the primary aim of this study is to determine the role of nasopharyngeal colonization in&#xD;
      the development of CAP or IPD; after identifying patients colonized by S. pneumoniae during&#xD;
      baseline experiments, patients will be followed every month by phone and every 6 months in&#xD;
      our outpatient clinics to identify patients that develop CAP or IPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to report any hospital visit (ER visit, hospital admission, and ICU&#xD;
      admission) to the study coordinator and to bring discharge summaries provided by hospitals.&#xD;
      Patients will be a follow-up for 2 consecutive years. During follow-ups, sample collection&#xD;
      will be performed to determine whether patients develop nasopharyngeal colonization or change&#xD;
      its systemic inflammatory profile. Samples will be collected and analyzed as baseline&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
