  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective case-control study aimed to evaluate the impact of presence, and severity of&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (UI) on pregnancy related anxiety. The study included 160 pregnant women&#xD;
      with uncomplicated pregnancies at the second trimester. The pregnant women with UI (n=80)&#xD;
      were compared to the control group including continent pregnant women (n=80) in terms of&#xD;
      Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Scores (PRAQ-R2) and Incontinence Consultation Questionnaire-Short&#xD;
      Form (ICIQ-SF) in pregnant women. Pelvic Organ Prolapse Questionnaire (POP-Q) was considered&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapsus. The UI was also divided into subgroups as stress&#xD;
      (SUI), urge (UUI), and mixed (MUI) types and they were also compared to the control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the presence and the severity of UI on&#xD;
      pregnancy related anxiety status in a well-defined pregnant cohort. The correlations were&#xD;
      also analyzed in terms of the UI subtypes as stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UUI) and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). A total of 160 pregnant women&#xD;
      applied to outpatient clinics of Obstetrics and Urology Departments were included in the&#xD;
      current study. Patients were compared in two groups in terms of Study group including&#xD;
      pregnant women who were diagnosed with the UI (n=80) and Control group including healthy&#xD;
      pregnant women (n=80). The study was approved by the institutional review board of Ankara&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital (# 0067/2019). All the participants were informed, and written&#xD;
      consent was obtained before the participated the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination was performed to diagnose the pelvic organ prolapse and the findings&#xD;
      were classified through the five categories based on Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification&#xD;
      (POP-Q). According to POP-Q, only the pregnant women diagnosed with category 0 or category 1&#xD;
      were included in the study. All the pregnant women included in the current study were married&#xD;
      and multiparous women, at the second trimester of the pregnancy, with uncomplicated&#xD;
      pregnancies and regular pregnancy follow-up. Pregnancies complicated by chronic maternal&#xD;
      diseases (rheumatological diseases, renal failure, vascular malformations, hypertension,&#xD;
      cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypo-hyperthyroidy, congenital hematological&#xD;
      disorders), acute inflammatory conditions (acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis), pregnancy&#xD;
      complications (gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm labor, preterm premature rupture&#xD;
      of membranes), history of alcohol consumption, having multiple pregnancies, psychiatric&#xD;
      diseases, cognitive disorders, neurogenic bladder, fecal incontinence, chronic constipation,&#xD;
      chronic cough, urinary infection, history of pelvic surgery including incontinence surgeries&#xD;
      and/or taking medication for UI were excluded from the current study. Pregnancy-Related&#xD;
      Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised (PRAQ-R2) scale was used to evaluate the anxiety status of the&#xD;
      participants. The International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form&#xD;
      (ICIQ-SF) which has been defined by Hajebrahimi et al. as a reliable scale, and validated in&#xD;
      Turkish by Demircan et al. was used for the evaluation of UI. This scale includes questions&#xD;
      about the frequency of UI, the conditions at which UI occurs and how much it affects the&#xD;
      social life of the person. UI subtypes were diagnosed according to the definitions of the&#xD;
      International Continence Society.&#xD;
