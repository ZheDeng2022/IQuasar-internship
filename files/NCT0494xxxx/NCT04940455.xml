  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teaching modalities that integrate digital educational technologies, such as educational&#xD;
      games, dummies and simulated environments, develop critical thinking in students, the&#xD;
      absorption of significant learning and the consequent reduction in the exposure of patients&#xD;
      to the damage associated with health care. Thus, this study will evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of simulation strategies and digital educational platforms in the teaching-learning process,&#xD;
      in self-confidence and its implications for the physiological variables and stressful&#xD;
      feelings of undergraduate nursing students. Our hypothesis is that students submitted to the&#xD;
      use of digital platforms will present lower levels of self-efficacy, capacity for clinical&#xD;
      judgment and retention of knowledge when compared to those who were submitted to the&#xD;
      simulation strategy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in the simulation laboratory of two Higher Education&#xD;
      Institutions, one public and the other private in the city of Bras√≠lia, Brazil. The sample&#xD;
      will consist of 100 students randomized into an experimental group (n=50) and a control group&#xD;
      (n=50). Students enrolled in the undergraduate nursing course, aged 18 years or over, will be&#xD;
      eligible; have minimal approval in a discipline related to the content of &quot;Nursing Care for&#xD;
      Adult Patients&quot;. Students who work actively in the scenario of patient care in critical and&#xD;
      risk situations will be excluded; members of the Academic League of Realistic Health&#xD;
      Simulation and those with prior training in the health field. It is expected that nursing&#xD;
      students, through active and innovative strategies, will be able to obtain and retain greater&#xD;
      knowledge, raise levels of self-efficacy and clinical judgment, for their performance in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
