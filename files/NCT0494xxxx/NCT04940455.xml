  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teaching modalities that integrate digital educational technologies, such as educational&#xD;
      games, dummies and simulated environments, develop critical thinking in students, the&#xD;
      absorption of significant learning and the consequent reduction in the exposure of patients&#xD;
      to the damage associated with health care. Thus, this study will evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of simulation strategies and digital educational platforms in the teaching-learning process,&#xD;
      in self-confidence and its implications for the physiological variables and stressful&#xD;
      feelings of undergraduate nursing students. Our hypothesis is that students submitted to the&#xD;
      use of digital platforms will present lower levels of self-efficacy, capacity for clinical&#xD;
      judgment and retention of knowledge when compared to those who were submitted to the&#xD;
      simulation strategy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in the simulation laboratory of two Higher Education&#xD;
      Institutions, one public and the other private in the city of Brasília, Brazil. The sample&#xD;
      will consist of 100 students randomized into an experimental group (n=50) and a control group&#xD;
      (n=50). Students enrolled in the undergraduate nursing course, aged 18 years or over, will be&#xD;
      eligible; have minimal approval in a discipline related to the content of &quot;Nursing Care for&#xD;
      Adult Patients&quot;. Students who work actively in the scenario of patient care in critical and&#xD;
      risk situations will be excluded; members of the Academic League of Realistic Health&#xD;
      Simulation and those with prior training in the health field. It is expected that nursing&#xD;
      students, through active and innovative strategies, will be able to obtain and retain greater&#xD;
      knowledge, raise levels of self-efficacy and clinical judgment, for their performance in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of satisfaction, learning, individual performance after educational actions. A self-efficacy scale will be used. IT'S self-applicable and has 13 items related to beliefs about their own abilities, motivation for action, coping with obstacles, predisposition to challenge, openness to experience, resilience in the face of failures, the influence of initial success on the the final success of an activity and the history of previous successes. These items are represented by a Likert-type scale of agreement, containing five points, in which 1 represents the participant's total disagreement and 5 the total agreement. Scores above 2.5 indicate that participants feel very capable.</description>
