      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy a Screening, Brief Intervention, and&#xD;
      Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) program for linking opioid dependent individuals currently&#xD;
      incarcerated in Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine to opioid substitution therapy in the&#xD;
      community after release.&#xD;

    <description>There are two objectives to the Brief Intervention. First, the BI is designed to inform potential participants on the risks of substance misuse, abuse, and dependency by illustrating the potential hazards and adverse health consequences. Second, the BI aims to motivate potential participants to reduce risky behavior (e.g., continued drug use) and seek treatment for their substance dependence disorder.</description>

    <description>First, the BI is designed to inform potential participants on the risks of substance misuse, abuse, and dependency by illustrating the potential hazards and adverse health consequences. Second, the BI aims to motivate potential participants to reduce risky behavior (e.g., continued drug use) and seek treatment for their substance dependence disorder. In our BI, we will provide evidence-based information on Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT) that is available to them in the community upon release. We will inform them of the risks and benefits of OAT and explain to them how OAT can be accessed in the community. OAT is provided at no cost to Ukrainian citizens with opioid dependence. The BI will last approximately 20 minutes and time will be made available for them to ask questions. The BI will not be audio recorded.</description>
