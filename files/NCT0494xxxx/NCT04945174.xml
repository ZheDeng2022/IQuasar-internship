  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial the effect of 12 weeks of cross-sectorial physical exercise&#xD;
      combined with patient education and individual follow-up session is investigated in patients&#xD;
      with minor stroke or non-disabling stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension and physical inactivity are the most common risk factors for stroke. Patients&#xD;
      with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have short-lasting symptoms, often with&#xD;
      remission within hours or days. Though patients experience a quick remission, they have an&#xD;
      increased risk of a recurrent stroke and progressive cognitive dysfunction. The patients are&#xD;
      also likely to have other disposing risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia which may increase the risk of a recurrent stroke. Following hospital&#xD;
      discharge, the patients are offered preventive medication, but no standardized rehabilitation&#xD;
      or exercise. Previous studies have shown that physical exercise decreases cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors for patients after stroke and increases physical function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to develop and evaluate a standardized exercise program (a stroke school) for&#xD;
      patients with minor stroke or TIA. The intervention consist of 6 weeks of supervised aerobic&#xD;
      exercise at the hospital combined with patient education including knowledge on stroke risk&#xD;
      factors. Subsequently, 6 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise in their local municipality.&#xD;
      After the 12 weeks of exercise, patients are offered individual, motivational follow-up&#xD;
      sessions with the purpose to facilitate the patients to stay physically active in their&#xD;
      everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will increase the patientsÂ´ knowledge regarding risk factors for stroke and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, increase their cardiorespiratory fitness and facilitate the patients&#xD;
      to be physical active and hopefully slow the progression of vascular disease.&#xD;
