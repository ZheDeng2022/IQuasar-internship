  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The plantar plate is an important static stabilizer of lesser metatarsophalangeal joints, and&#xD;
      disruptions of the plantar plate can lead to significant instability and lesser toe&#xD;
      deformities.Our study proposes an inexpensive and versatile method for plantar plate repair&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A torn plantar plate is small and difficult to access using regular instruments in a&#xD;
      restricted operative field. A unique method for plantar plate repairs was used to repair&#xD;
      various configurations of plantar plate tears with standard operative instruments that is&#xD;
      available in most operating rooms. A retrospective study was performed on patients who&#xD;
      underwent operations for lesser MTPJ instability between September 2015 and December 2019.&#xD;
      The outcome analysis included the Lesser Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scale from the&#xD;
      American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) forefoot score, the Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      score for pain and satisfaction, and answering the question &quot;Would you recommend this&#xD;
      procedure to other patients?&quot;&#xD;

    <measure>Lesser Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scale from the Americans Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) forefoot score (0-100 points)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-operative &gt;12 months</time_frame>
    <description>One of the most widely used PRO measures for foot and ankle conditions is the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS).&#xD;
Developed in 1994, the clinician-based AOFAS covers four different regions of the foot: The ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, metatarsophalangeal (MTP)-interphalangeal (IP) for the hallux, and MTP-IP for the lesser toes.&#xD;
These four anatomic regions have their own version of the AOFAS survey. Each c is designed to be used independent of the others. However, each measure is comprised of nine questions and cover three categories: Pain (40 points), function (50 points) and alignment (10 points). These are all scored together for a total of 100 points.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale score (VAS) for pain (0-10 points)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-opreative and post-operative &gt;12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.&#xD;
In this study, pre-operative VAS score and post-operative score for pain were obtained for evaluating the clinical outcome. &quot;0&quot; means no pain; &quot;10&quot; means very painful.</description>

    <measure>hallux valgus angle (degree)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-opreative and post-operative &gt;12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hallux valgus angle is the angle between the axis of the 1st metatarsal and the axis of the proximal phalanx of the 1st toe. It can only be measured on a radiograph performed whilst weight bearing.&#xD;
In this study, pre-operative and post-operative hallux valgus angle were obtained for evaluating the operative outcome.</description>

    <measure>1-2 intermetatarsal angle (degree)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-opreative and post-operative &gt;12 months</time_frame>
    <description>1-2 intermetatarsal angle is the angle between the axis of the 1st metatarsal and the axis of the 2nd metatarsal. It can only be measured on a radiograph performed whilst weight bearing.&#xD;
In this study, pre-operative and post-operative hallux valgus angle were obtained for evaluating the operative outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metatarsophalangeal joint angle( for lesser toes, degree)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-opreative and post-operative &gt;12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metatarsophalangeal joint angle is the angle between the axis of the metatarsal and the axis of the proximal phalanx of the lesser toe. It can only be measured on a radiograph performed whilst weight bearing. positive angle indicates a lateral inclination, and negative angle denotes a varus inclination.&#xD;
In this study, pre-operative and post-operative hallux valgus angle were obtained for evaluating the operative outcome.</description>
