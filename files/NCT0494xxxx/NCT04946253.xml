  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prior application (MH064372), the investigators' treatment research program (Services&#xD;
      for Kids In Primary-care, SKIP) developed and tested a chronic care model-based intervention,&#xD;
      called Doctor Office Collaborative Care (DOCC), that was found to be effective in the&#xD;
      management of childhood behavior problems and comorbid ADHD. In the &quot;SKIP for PA Study&quot;, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of team-&#xD;
      and practice leadership-level implementation strategies designed to enhance the use and&#xD;
      uptake of DOCC in diverse pediatric primary care offices.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial to support the&#xD;
      adoption of a chronic care model (CCM)-based intervention in pediatric primary care settings&#xD;
      by testing the impact of implementation strategies directed towards the provider care team&#xD;
      (TEAM) or practice leadership (LEAD) level. The treatment investigators seek to deliver here&#xD;
      is called Doctor Office Collaborative Care (DOCC), an evidence-based intervention for the&#xD;
      management of child behavior problems and comorbid ADHD. The implementation strategies being&#xD;
      tested to enhance DOCC uptake include TEAM coaching/consultation strategies, which will be&#xD;
      delivered to care team providers and target provider competency to deliver DOCC, and LEAD&#xD;
      facilitation strategies, which will be delivered to practice leaders and target&#xD;
      organizational support of DOCC delivery. These multi-level implementation strategies have not&#xD;
      been formally evaluated to learn about their separate and combined effects in any randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial conducted in pediatric primary care. Such information is needed to optimize&#xD;
      our approaches to promoting the implementation of a CCM-based intervention in pediatric&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statewide sample includes 24 primary care practices from the Medical Home Program of the&#xD;
      Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. After standard training in the&#xD;
      DOCC EBP, all practices will be randomized to one of four implementation conditions: 1) No&#xD;
      TEAM or LEAD (ongoing technical support only); 2) TEAM implementation; 3) LEAD&#xD;
      implementation, or 4) TEAM+LEAD implementation. TEAM and LEAD implementation will be&#xD;
      delivered via videoconference (or possibly in person) on a graded schedule. Care teams will&#xD;
      deliver DOCC to 25 children who meet a clinical cutoff for modest behavior problems and their&#xD;
      caregivers. Investigators will collect practice/provider measures from enrolled practice&#xD;
      staff (0, 6, 12, 18, 24 months) and caregivers over several timepoints (0, 3, 6, 12 months)&#xD;
      to support all analyses evaluating implementation and treatment outcomes, mediation, and&#xD;
      moderation. By proposing one of the first large pragmatic pediatric trials of a CCM-based&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention to address these aims in response to RFA-MH-18-701 and the NIMH's&#xD;
      Strategic Plan (4.2), this research will advance the implementation science knowledge needed&#xD;
      to optimize promising strategies for promoting the delivery and scale-up of DOCC in a&#xD;
      pediatric medical home.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators propose a randomized trial using a factorial design to test effects of implementation support strategies on uptake of an evidence-based intervention (DOCC) in 24 primary care practices from the Medical Home Program of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Practices will receive DOCC training in accord with the Replicating Effective Programs model. Practices will be randomized to 1 of 4 implementation support conditions: 1) No TEAM/LEAD (training and technical support only); 2) provider care team consultation (TEAM); 3) practice leadership facilitation (LEAD); and 4) combination of provider care team and leadership implementation (TEAM+LEAD). Care teams in each practice will identify families and deliver DOCC to 25 caregivers and their children with externalizing behavior. Investigators will collect measures from up to 250 practice staff over 5 assessments (24 months) and up to 600 caregivers over 4 assessments (12 months) to support analyses.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants are not directly informed of the implementation condition to which the practice site has been randomized. All formal standardized assessments will be conducted via secure electronic web-based data collection systems, limiting the potential for assessment bias. In the event that a caregiver requests that a staff member administer an assessment via phone, the assessor would be unaware of the implementation condition assigned to the child's practice where the caregiver receives care.</masking_description>

    <description>As part of a short checklist-style progress note completed after each service contact and housed in the study's web-based patient registry dashboard, providers will document each DOCC encounter delivered to each family. These encounters include referral, assessment, treatment or medication delivery, medication or treatment review/monitoring, case management, review of emergent symptoms, and care management and consultation meetings involving a family member. Investigators will report the total number of DOCC encounters delivered to each family during the intervention phase.</description>

    <description>The Mental Health Practice Readiness Inventory will be completed to document the degree to which a practice has the organizational and individual competencies needed to support integrated BH care. All 32 items reflect the diverse activities (e.g., workflows, financing, service delivery, care coordination) suggested as functions for PCPs (scale: 0 = no function exists; 1 = some function; 2 = function is complete). Thus, total scale scores can range from 0 to 64.

    <description>To assess the severity of the child's behavioral and emotional problems, the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale will be completed by caregivers. The VADPRS includes 5 symptom severity subscales, each with a varying number of items: (hyperactivity/impulsivity (n=9), inattention (n=9), oppositional behavior (n=7), conduct problems (n=15), and anxiety/depression (n=7). The scores for the hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention subscales are often aggregated to create an overall ADHD scale factor total score. Individual items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = never; 1 = occasionally; 2 = often; 3 = very often). There is also a performance (impairment) subscale (n=7) used to determine whether a child would meet clinical criteria for a given disorder. The range of scores per factor are as follows: hyperactivity/impulsivity (27), inattention (27), oppositional behavior (21), conduct problems (45), anxiety/depression (21) ,and performance (24).</description>

    <ipd_description>All requests for study data will follow NIMH's data sharing and data use policies. The final completely de-identified dataset(s) will include demographic and clinical data at baseline, and primary and secondary outcomes for all studies. These analytic datasets may also include derived variables with documentation. Our form datasets will include original case data, a detailed codebook of variable names, value labels, and programming formats and all study documentation including the protocol and manual of procedures. Study investigators/study staff will upload descriptive/raw data to NIMH's National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Health Illness (NDCT) on a semi-annual basis. Data will be released to NDCT after manuscripts reporting primary findings are accepted for publication.</ipd_description>
