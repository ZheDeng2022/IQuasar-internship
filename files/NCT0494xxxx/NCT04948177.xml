      Newly, botulinum toxin A application into the stomach has been proposed as a treatment method&#xD;
      in obesity. It impacts through acetylcholine receptors located in smooth muscle cells and&#xD;
      suppresses stomach motility. This method aims to decrease gastric emptying time and thus to&#xD;
      extend the duration of feeling full. This effect of intragastric botulinum toxin A injection&#xD;
      (GBI) makes it easier to adhere to dietary prescriptions, which is the cornerstone of any&#xD;
      obesity treatment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic inspections and the complicatedness in literature results, cases that have not&#xD;
      succeeded in losing weight after GBI might have pylorus contractility problems. Any&#xD;
      deterioration in pylorus activity is recognized to have the potential to influence gastric&#xD;
      emptying. In such a case, gastric emptying time would also be altered due to the paralysis of&#xD;
      pylorus muscles, which is one of the effect mechanisms of botulinum toxin A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pyloric orifice structure may have a crucial role in the success or failure of GBI&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has doubled globally in the last four decades to the extent that&#xD;
      nearly one-third of the world population is now classified as overweight/obese. Obesity&#xD;
      causes adverse impacts on almost every physiological system in the human body and comprises&#xD;
      an important public health problem. It is associated with an increased risk of many&#xD;
      developing co-morbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, several&#xD;
      types of cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, and poor mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment options for patients with obesity include lifestyle intervention, obesity&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. The components of lifestyle intervention involve&#xD;
      diet, exercise, and behavior modification and should be recognized as the cornerstone of any&#xD;
      obesity treatment method; however, the impact of lifestyle intervention is limited in&#xD;
      patients with morbid obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical therapies with laparoscopic approach are accepted as the most effective and&#xD;
      persistent obesity-treatment methods, with a significant reduction in complication rates and&#xD;
      postoperative recovery. Gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and&#xD;
      biliopancreatic diversion are commonly performed bariatric surgical procedures worldwide.&#xD;
      But, the idea of scarless methods in which the video-endoscopy device is used as the primary&#xD;
      carrier device, expecting to achieve results at least as good as laparoscopic procedures, has&#xD;
      significantly developed within the last decade. Additionally, the development of effective&#xD;
      and safe, newer endoscopic bariatric procedures provides another adjunctive treatment for&#xD;
      patients with obesity who cannot handle this disease with lifestyle modification alone or who&#xD;
      is not a candidate for surgical procedures. Endoscopic therapies, such as intra-gastric&#xD;
      balloons, duodenojejunal bypass liners such as the EndoBarrier, and endoscopic suturing&#xD;
      platforms, have also become proposed alternatives to surgery, considering their&#xD;
      minimally-invasive advantages. However, given the lack of long-term data at present, the role&#xD;
      of such devices continues to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly, botulinum toxin A application into the stomach has been proposed as a treatment method&#xD;
      in obesity. It impacts through acetylcholine receptors located in smooth muscle cells and&#xD;
      suppresses stomach motility. This method aims to decrease gastric emptying time and thus to&#xD;
      extend the duration of feeling full. This effect of intragastric botulinum toxin A injection&#xD;
      (GBI) makes it easier to adhere to dietary prescriptions, which is the cornerstone of any&#xD;
      obesity treatment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic inspections and the complicatedness in literature results, cases that have not&#xD;
      succeeded in losing weight after GBI might have pylorus contractility problems. Any&#xD;
      deterioration in pylorus activity is recognized to have the potential to influence gastric&#xD;
      emptying. In such a case, gastric emptying time would also be altered due to the paralysis of&#xD;
      pylorus muscles, which is one of the effect mechanisms of botulinum toxin A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pyloric orifice structure may have a crucial role in the success or failure of GBI&#xD;
      therapy for obesity treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to explore whether there is a correlation between weight loss after&#xD;
      GBI and pyloric orifice structure.&#xD;
