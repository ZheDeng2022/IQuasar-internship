  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide and the mortality ranks&#xD;
      first in the world. In recent years, with the development of targeted therapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy, the overall survival of lung cancer patients has improved significantly.&#xD;
      However, the inoperable advanced tumor remains the main reason for the poor prognosis of lung&#xD;
      cancer. Thus, we aim to carry out this single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of surgery after conversion therapy for locally advanced and advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      Previous studies have shown that selective surgery after conversion therapy is feasible and&#xD;
      safe in locally advanced or stage IV patients, and indicates potential benefits for these&#xD;
      patients. However, surgery after conversion therapy is difficult and has high risk of&#xD;
      postoperative complications which requires strict operation indications and patient&#xD;
      screening. At present, there are only relevant retrospective studies and no prospective&#xD;
      evidence. Therefore, our team plans to carry out this single-arm prospective clinical trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and feasibility of surgery in patients with locally advanced and&#xD;
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer after conversion therapy, so as to lay the foundation for&#xD;
      further research and clinical application.&#xD;
