  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening can reduce cancer deaths. However, screening and abnormal&#xD;
      test follow-up rates are low among underserved populations. The screening rates of 19-58%,&#xD;
      and rates of colonoscopy completion after abnormal stool tests of 18-57% in community health&#xD;
      centers (CHC) systems are low. This highlights an opportunity to improve early detection and&#xD;
      decrease burden of CRC in our region. Mailed outreach and navigation programs have been shown&#xD;
      to increase colonoscopy completion rate. The next step is to understand how to best implement&#xD;
      these programs in the community on a larger scale. To achieve this goal, the investigators&#xD;
      propose a Hub-and-Spoke intervention combining centralized strategies to maximize CRC&#xD;
      screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care. The investigators hypothesize that this&#xD;
      intervention will be superior to usual care for increasing CRC screening, abnormal test&#xD;
      follow-up, and referral-to-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to determine effectiveness in: 1)&#xD;
      improvement in proportion of individuals up-to-date with screening 3 years post&#xD;
      implementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6&#xD;
      months; and 3) proportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also evaluate the implementation, scalability, and sustainability of&#xD;
      the multi-level implementation strategy. The intervention consists of: Mailed FIT and&#xD;
      Reminders. Eligible individuals will receive an introductory letter describing the importance&#xD;
      of CRC screening and noting that follow-up mail will include a FIT Kit. It will also be&#xD;
      offered to patients who completed prior mailed FIT with normal test results. All materials&#xD;
      will be in English and Spanish. Two weeks later, participants will receive a packet via mail&#xD;
      containing the FIT kit, a one-page invitation inviting FIT completion and FIT instructions, a&#xD;
      postage-paid envelope for return to the patient's CHC, and COVID-19 message. For&#xD;
      non-compliant individuals not returning the kit, a reminder phone call and text message will&#xD;
      be delivered 2 weeks later. The investigators will track returned letters, individuals who&#xD;
      are later found to be up-to date with screening, and those who decline screening. The CHC&#xD;
      will provide care coordination for patients with an abnormal FIT result.&#xD;
