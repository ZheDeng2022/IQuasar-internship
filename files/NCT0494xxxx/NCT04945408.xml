  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal disease is a common cause of gastroenterology visits. In the United States, it&#xD;
      is considered the 3rd most common gastrointestinal diagnosis with nearly 4 million scheduled&#xD;
      or emergency visits. In France, self-reported questionnaires estimate that one person in five&#xD;
      has suffered at least one hemorrhoidal attack in the past year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal disease significantly alters the quality of life, can be life threatening in&#xD;
      case of heavy bleeding and has a significant economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are still many unknowns regarding the different types of hemorrhoidal disease,&#xD;
      its symptoms, its natural history, its etiology, its triggering and promoting factors, the&#xD;
      associated pathologies, the therapeutic indications, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the therapeutic management is not consensual, especially since the therapeutic&#xD;
      arsenal is constantly expanding over the last 20 years with the advent of minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the work is to answer some of these questions on the basis of a prospective cohort&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
