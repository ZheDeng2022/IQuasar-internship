      This trial is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study to explore Endostar in combination&#xD;
      with standard platinum-based chemotherapy with different methods in patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients in group A received a standard 21-day treatment cycle of platinum-containing&#xD;
      two-drug chemotherapy and endurance treatment. Yep The first cycle of the degree of use is&#xD;
      7.5mg/m2/day intravenous infusion for 4 hours (referred to as the time window of 4h 20min&#xD;
      From the 1st day to the 14th day (D1-14 Endo cycle 2-4 uses 105mg/m2/cycle From the first&#xD;
      day, continuous intravenous pump injection for 72 hours (the set time window is 72h±2h.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group B received a standard 21-day treatment cycle of platinum-containing&#xD;
      two-drug chemotherapy and endurance treatment. Yep The first cycle of the degree of use is&#xD;
      7.5mg/m2/day intravenous infusion for 4 hours (referred to as the time window is 4h±20min&#xD;
      From the 1st day to the 14th day (D1-14 Endo cycle 2-4 is used 105mg/m2/cycle From the first&#xD;
      day, continuous intravenous pump injection for 168 hours (set time window is 168h±2h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endostar and chemotherapy drugs are used for 4 cycles. Research will Use RECIST 1.1 standard&#xD;
      to evaluate in progress and after enrollment Efficacy assessment will be conducted every 6±1&#xD;
      weeks until the disease progresses, new anti-tumor therapy is started, and the study is&#xD;
      withdrawn or At the end of the study, the serum of Endo will be collected in different&#xD;
      expected ways to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics; Adverse events were evaluated&#xD;
      according to CTCAE5.0 standards. The start time of the test is The first fine was when the&#xD;
      informed consent form was signed. The end of the test is the last The subject completed 24&#xD;
      weeks after the first treatment.&#xD;
