    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the use of two adhesives for the placement of&#xD;
      occlusal sealants, evaluating their retention on the occlusal surfaces. Methods: A randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial, in Phase IV, triple-blind, with a split mouth study design will be adopted,&#xD;
      which consists of a simple division of the mouth into two parts (right and left) for the&#xD;
      first four permanent molars of each patient, where the placement of the materials will be on&#xD;
      the right / left side of the mouth and contralateral. They will then be randomly assigned&#xD;
      following block randomization procedures with a 1: 1 allocation. 50 participants (6-year-old&#xD;
      children) will be considered, and a pair of permanent first molars homologs will be used for&#xD;
      each participant. Inclusion criteria include: children whose parents accepted their&#xD;
      participation in the study and who signed the Informed Consent, children enrolled in the&#xD;
      Pichanaki District school, children who present upper and / or lower permanent molars with&#xD;
      absence of deep caries cavities and caries, graded 0 and 1 according to ICDAS II, Green and&#xD;
      Vermillion Simplified Oral Hygiene Index of 1-2, have a pair of non-cavitated caries-free&#xD;
      counterparts, and children with positive behavior. After selection of patients, the dental&#xD;
      sealants will be placed with two different adhesives: the 8th generation adhesive&#xD;
      intervention group (Scotchbond universal 3M) and the 5th generation adhesive control group&#xD;
      (Single bond 3M), both sealants will use the same flowable resin (Tetric N-flow ivoclar&#xD;
      vivadent). Results evaluation: Retention of the sealants will be evaluated at 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      months. Retention rates of pit and fissure sealant materials will be analyzed according to&#xD;
      the split mouth design. The study will use the Mc Nemar test to compare the retention of&#xD;
      sealants in the intervention group and the control group at 6, 9 and 12 months. A 95%&#xD;
      confidence level will be accepted. In addition, the Cochrane Q test will be applied to&#xD;
      determine if there are significant differences in survival for each group of sealants through&#xD;
      the evaluation time. The calculation of the survival months of the sealants will be carried&#xD;
      out using the actuarial method (survival tables). Expected conclusion: To identify which of&#xD;
      the two adhesives presents the best retention after 12 months.&#xD;

      Ethical considerations This research will be carried out in a Pichanaki District school, at&#xD;
      Chanchamayo province, for which we will request the review by the Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of the Institute of Tropical Medicine &quot;Daniel Alcides Carri√≥n&quot; UNMSM, in addition to process&#xD;
      the permits to the pertinent authorities of the school of the Pichanaki province (verbal and&#xD;
      written) on the principles of the treatment, the risks of the procedures and the purpose of&#xD;
      the study, and the parents or guardians of the participants will sign the consent forms&#xD;
      informed appropriate. Type and Research Design A split mouth study design will be adopted,&#xD;
      which consists of a simple division of the mouth into two parts (right and left) for the&#xD;
      first four permanent molars of each patient, where the placement of the materials will be on&#xD;
      the right / left side of the mouth and contralateral. Study population 6-year-olds from&#xD;
      kindergarden 380 of Pichanaqui, Junin department Sample size 50 participants. A pair of&#xD;
      permanent first molars homologs will be used for each participant.Data collection techniques&#xD;
      Coordination with the Ethics and Parental Authorization Committee Letters of invitation will&#xD;
      be made and they will be distributed in class through the teachers, and each student will&#xD;
      take it home to deliver to their parents or guardians. Each letter (envelope) will have the&#xD;
      informed consent, the informed assent, data record sheet and an informative bulletin where it&#xD;
      explains all the procedure that will be carried out for each participant, there will also be&#xD;
      an informative talk in the school for parents and teachers, where they will be informed about&#xD;
      the study and will collect the envelopes. The research team will not force any child to&#xD;
      participate; each will have the option to choose to participate in the study by verbal&#xD;
      assent. A report will be delivered to the parent or guardian of the child after the&#xD;
      intervention. Recruitment of participants Participants will be recruited within the month the&#xD;
      invitation letters will be delivered. Informed consent process Researcher 1 will give an&#xD;
      informative talk about the study and will collect the envelopes containing the informed&#xD;
      consent, informed consent and data record sheet). Students and parents who accept&#xD;
      participation will receive a summons for subsequent dental visits. It will collect the&#xD;
      consents signed by both parents / guardians and in case the signature of one of the parents&#xD;
      cannot be obtained either due to impossibility (Death, difficulty in obtaining the signature,&#xD;
      absence and reasons of personal strength). Only the signature of one will be accepted to give&#xD;
      consent; and informed assent if the child reports that he understands and is mature enough to&#xD;
      understand. Diagnostic Process Assistant 1 will be in charge of bringing the students for&#xD;
      their dental check-up and will also provide the materials to operator 1 who will do the oral&#xD;
      hygiene and prophylaxis index procedure. Afterwards, operator 2 will be previously calibrated&#xD;
      according to the ICDAS II criteria, using the visual method it will detect and classify the&#xD;
      lesions according to the International System criteria. Detection and Evaluation of Caries&#xD;
      (ICDAS-II) and the teeth that will represent scores 0 and 1 will be selected. The inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria mentioned above will be taken into account; and patients who have at&#xD;
      least one pair of homologous permanent first molars that meet the same requirements will be&#xD;
      considered. The maid 2 will be in charge of filling out the data sheets of the participants.&#xD;
      Operator 1 will evaluate the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index until you reach an OHI score of&#xD;
      1-2 over a period of one month. Researcher 1 will select the participants taking into account&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will deliver the list of those participants to the&#xD;
      programmer for randomization. Randomization Process There will be a programmer without&#xD;
      participation in the clinical trial who will do the randomization sequence, will generate a&#xD;
      list of numbers randomly assigned to participants and will be created with Stata 16&#xD;
      statistical software (Stata Corp. College Station, TX). The sample will be stratified by&#xD;
      gender. They will then be randomly assigned following block randomization procedures. with a&#xD;
      1: 1 allocation using the random block sizes of 4 and 8, a computerized random number&#xD;
      generator and combinations will be used to select the tooth and material to be sealed first.&#xD;
      The Adhesive will be placed in a dispenser and will be coded by letters (A and B) the 8th&#xD;
      generation adhesive intervention group (Scotchbond universal 3M) and the 5th generation&#xD;
      adhesive control group (Single bond 3M), both sealants will use the same fluid resin (Tetric&#xD;
      N-flow ivoclar vivadent). The name of each participant will be coded by numbers, this will be&#xD;
      done by the programmer; the materials are going to be encoded letters (A and B) and the cards&#xD;
      are going to be worked with these encodings for later data analysis.And with respect to the&#xD;
      patient's data, it will only be handled by the programmer who will be in charge of coding,&#xD;
      randomizing the first permanent molars, randomizing the materials to be used so that it is&#xD;
      placed in the first permanent molars and this information will be given to the coordinator so&#xD;
      that the put in sealed envelopes and then these sealed envelopes will be given to an&#xD;
      assistant so that such data is not disclosed or published. In case this section of data&#xD;
      confidentiality is in the informed consent it could be mentioned. The programmer will give&#xD;
      the randomized list to the coordinator and the coordinator will give the external assistant&#xD;
      not participating in the clinical trial in sealed envelopes labeled by each participant. This&#xD;
      external assistant will take the randomized patient for treatment. Allocation concealment&#xD;
      mechanism process and implementation The programmer will give this list generated to the&#xD;
      coordinator and an external assistant will receive the envelopes with the same&#xD;
      characteristics and will be in charge of taking the patient to receive treatment. Blinding&#xD;
      process Blinding and balancing will be strictly maintained; by emphasizing the operators,&#xD;
      assistants, evaluators, workers of the educational institution and the parents / guardians&#xD;
      and participants. While the participants, operators, evaluators, assistants assigned to carry&#xD;
      out the diagnosis, procedure and placement of the material, will not know the brand of the&#xD;
      adhesives for pits and fissures, due to that they will be in a dispenser with code (A and B).&#xD;
      Outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to allocation. Investigators who&#xD;
      performed the intervention procedure will not take the results measures. Procedures process&#xD;
      The external assistant to the study will be in charge of placing in the dispenser and listing&#xD;
      the intervention material A (Scotchbond universal 3M) and B (single bond 3M) in prior&#xD;
      coordination with the research coordinator. Operator 3 and assistant 4 will be previously&#xD;
      trained and calibrated; they will do the procedure, without knowing the names of the&#xD;
      stickers. Devices will be applied in the upper / lower first molars with adhesive, being the&#xD;
      order assigned according to the previous randomization, for the intervention group they will&#xD;
      be sealed by applying 8th generation adhesive (Scotchbond universal 3M) with a fluid resin&#xD;
      (Tetric N-Flow) and on the contralateral side the upper / lower first molars will be sealed,&#xD;
      the control group will be applied with a fifth generation adhesive (3M single bond) with a&#xD;
      fluid resin (Tetric N-Flow ) Placement of materials on the right / left side of the mouth&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned. A total of 100 upper / lower molar teeth will be sealed with both&#xD;
      materials (50 teeth for each material). The materials will be placed by the same operator&#xD;
      according to the protocol of Dr. Gilmer Torres Ramos for sealing pits and deep fissures.&#xD;
      Steps for the application of the sealant, the teeth will be isolated with cotton rolls&#xD;
      carefully and the assistant 4 will hold a plastic saliva ejector to avoid contamination of&#xD;
      the saliva and facilitate the operative procedures of the occlusal surfaces of the upper&#xD;
      molars and / or lower for each operator: The occlusal surfaces will be cleaned using water, a&#xD;
      brush and a low-pressure handpiece; they will wash and dry; then deproteinization will be&#xD;
      done with sodium hypochlorite (5.25%) for 60 seconds, it will be washed with a water / air&#xD;
      spray for 30s; it will dry up; The tooth will then be etched using a 37% orthophosphoric acid&#xD;
      gel for 15 seconds, rinsed with a water / air spray for 30 seconds, and dried with cotton&#xD;
      balls. universal 3M) to the etched surface will be dried under a gentle air flow for 2-3 s,&#xD;
      and light cured for 11 s using an LED curing unit with an output of 1500 mW / cm2 (Balloon.).&#xD;
      and for the control group, a 5th generation adhesive (SINGLE BOND 3M) will be applied to the&#xD;
      etched surface, it will be dried under a gentle air flow for 2-3 s, and it will be&#xD;
      light-cured for 11 s using an LED curing unit. with an output of 1500 mW / cm2 (Balloon.),&#xD;
      then a uniform layer will be applied to both groups, a sealant based on fluid resin (Tetric&#xD;
      N-Flow ivoclar vivadent) will be light-cured for 11 s using an LED curing unit with an output&#xD;
      1500 mW / cm2 (Balloon). The cotton rolls and plastic saliva ejector will be removed, and the&#xD;
      occlusion will be checked with articulating paper. The operator will not know the brand of&#xD;
      adhesive to be used, because it will be in the dispenser and will be delivered by another&#xD;
      person (external assistant to the study) previously trained for this activity and both&#xD;
      materials have a similar color. The child will also not be informed about the brand of the&#xD;
      material used. The assistant 5 will collect the data on the card. An average attendance will&#xD;
      be 6 participants per day with time intervals to prepare the work environment between each&#xD;
      procedure. Evaluation and monitoring process Assistant 6 will bring and take the participants&#xD;
      to operator 4 who will do the prophylaxis and help fill out the cards. Operator 5 with at&#xD;
      least ten years of experience will be previously trained, evaluated and calibrated; in&#xD;
      accordance with ICDASS II criteria and retention of sealants. The calibration will be given&#xD;
      by the Kappa measure (Œ∫ &gt; 0.7). Operator 5 will not have performed the pit and fissure&#xD;
      sealants procedure; he will record the retention of the sealant in a period of 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      months. Followup of sealed teeth will be observed with good lighting, after tooth&#xD;
      prophylaxis. It will be evaluated with an oral mirror and periodontal probe. Each sealant is&#xD;
      classified as Total retention of the sealant in all pits and fissures (TR); Partial retention&#xD;
      of the sealant in some pits and fissures (PR); Total loss of sealant in all pits and fissures&#xD;
      (TL) The coordinator will be in all evaluation follow-ups. Analysis and interpretation of&#xD;
      information A descriptive analysis of the study population will be made, where the&#xD;
      qualitative variables will be represented with absolute frequencies and percentages. With the&#xD;
      registration cards a database will be built (Excel software Version 18.0), retention rates of&#xD;
      pit and fissure sealant materials will be analyzed using SPSS software 23. An analysis will&#xD;
      be performed according to the split mouth design. This design proposes two types of analysis&#xD;
      as qualitative or binary measure. For the binary modality, the Mac Nemar Chi-square test is&#xD;
      recommended. The study will use the Mc Nemar test to compare the retention of sealants in the&#xD;
      intervention group and the control group used at 6, 9 and 12 months. A 95% confidence level&#xD;
      will be accepted. In addition, the Cochrane Q test will be applied to determine if there are&#xD;
      significant differences in survival for each group of sealants through the evaluation time&#xD;
      (6, 9 and 12 months). The calculation of the survival months of the sealants will be carried&#xD;
      out using the actuarial method (survival tables)&#xD;
