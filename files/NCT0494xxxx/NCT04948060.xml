    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among American Indians and Alaska&#xD;
      Natives (AI/AN), and AI/AN have worse lung cancer incidence rates, survival, and death&#xD;
      compared to the general population. Because lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose&#xD;
      computed tomography (LDCT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality by roughly 20%, the&#xD;
      United States Preventive Services Task Force now recommends LCS for men and women aged 55-80&#xD;
      years who meet specific eligibility criteria (grade-B evidence), and subsequently the Center&#xD;
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) opted to cover this test. However, the uptake of LCS&#xD;
      implementation has been slow in most healthcare systems, and LCS implementation among AI/AN&#xD;
      has never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this knowledge, we prose the &quot;Tribally Engaged Approaches to Lung Screening&#xD;
      (TEALS)&quot; study, which is a collaborative effort between the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, the&#xD;
      Stephenson Cancer Center, and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of 5 years, TEALS will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct focus groups and semi-structured interviews with CNHSA patients, clinicians, and&#xD;
           health administrators to elucidate individual- and system-level barriers and&#xD;
           facilitators that affect the implementation of LCS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop an LCS care coordination intervention that will identify eligible persons for&#xD;
           LCS, help these patients navigate the screening process, and link them with smoking&#xD;
           cessation services, when applicable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure the impact of the TEALS intervention on the receipt of screening and a set of&#xD;
           patient- and practice-level outcomes by conducting a cluster-randomized clinical trial&#xD;
           of LCS implementation; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Disseminate the TEALS program to other researchers and healthcare systems that serve&#xD;
           AI/AN patients. TEALS will bridge the gap between evidence and clinical practice for LCS&#xD;
           in a high-need, low-resource setting by intervening at the level of the healthcare&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      System-level interventions for guideline implementation tend to be understudied compared to&#xD;
      those evaluating individual-level, behavioral interventions. However, the careful development&#xD;
      and evaluation of an LCS screening program at the level of the healthcare system would be&#xD;
      critical to ensure that more patients can receive LCS. Our research will create a critically&#xD;
      needed platform from which future studies could be launched that will examine how to tailor&#xD;
      the application of the LCS guideline to the individual preferences of AI/AN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEALS will establish an effective LCS program in a tribal system and thus provide a direct&#xD;
      benefit to the Choctaw Nation by increasing LCS participation. TEALS will serve as a&#xD;
      blueprint for establishing a sustainable and accessible infrastructure for LCS in AI/AN and&#xD;
      other community health systems. By increasing screening for early stage lung cancer, TEALS&#xD;
      could ultimately reduce lung cancer mortality in AI/AN communities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces mortality from&#xD;
      lung cancer and it is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force&#xD;
      (USPSTF) based on grade-B evidence, 1 the same grade of evidence given by the USPSTF for&#xD;
      breast cancer screening with mammography. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death&#xD;
      among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN),2-4 who face persistent disparities in lung&#xD;
      cancer incidence, stage of diagnosis, stage-specific survival, and death compared to Whites,&#xD;
      particularly in the Plains states and Alaska.2,3,5-14 Early detection of lung cancer at less&#xD;
      lethal stages would have a significant impact on improving the health of Native Americans by&#xD;
      reducing their lung cancer mortality. In addition to detection and treatment, smoking&#xD;
      cessation is also pivotal to improving lung cancer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LCS implementation at the healthcare system level is complex15 and uptake has been slow for&#xD;
      the general population, particularly in community settings. System-level implementation may&#xD;
      be even more complex in AI/AN communities, which are often characterized by distinctive&#xD;
      community, cultural, and health system factors. Community-based participatory research,&#xD;
      founded on a partnership approach to research that involves community members, organizational&#xD;
      representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research process,16 has improved&#xD;
      research partnerships with AI/AN communities,17 including cancer related research.18-22&#xD;
      Moreover, dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) science23-25 has been highly effective in&#xD;
      redesigning care delivery systems to improve the uptake of preventive services,25 but has&#xD;
      received scant attention in LCS implementation or in AI/AN communities. Coupling the&#xD;
      principles of participatory research with D&amp;I science holds great promise for developing a&#xD;
      durable and novel LCS program that responds to the needs of patients, communities, and&#xD;
      healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Choctaw Nation, the third largest tribe in the nation by population, is located in rural&#xD;
      southeastern Oklahoma. The advent of the LCS guideline prompted the tribe to name LCS as a&#xD;
      top priority for its own, tribally operated healthcare system, the Choctaw Nation Health&#xD;
      Services Authority (CNHSA). An ensuing partnership-based consultation over the past several&#xD;
      years between CNHSA staff and university researchers with expertise in D&amp;I science, led to&#xD;
      the present study entitled &quot;Tribally Engaged Approaches to Lung Screening (TEALS)&quot;. The goal&#xD;
      of TEALS is to collaboratively co-develop, implement and evaluate a sustainable and&#xD;
      community-centered LCS implementation program that can be disseminated to other tribal health&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Identify individual, community, cultural, and health system barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      that affect LCS implementation in the Choctaw Nation. During Year 1, the investigators will&#xD;
      convene focus groups and administer semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (tribal&#xD;
      members receiving care through CNHSA, tribal community leaders, clinicians, and health&#xD;
      administrators) to elucidate individual, tribal, cultural and health system factors that may&#xD;
      critically affect the uptake of LCS. The investigators will incorporate our findings into the&#xD;
      TEALS intervention protocols and materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Use community-engagement processes to co-design a tailored TEALS intervention, which&#xD;
      features LCS care coordinators embedded within the CNHSA healthcare delivery system. In Year&#xD;
      2, informed by Aim 1 findings, the investigators will finalize the TEALS intervention, and&#xD;
      then pilot test, evaluate, and iteratively improve it in two CNHSA primary care practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Measure the impact of the improved LCS program in a cluster-randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      assessing implementation process outcomes at the individual and care delivery system level.&#xD;
      In Years 3 and 4, the investigators will conduct a pair-matched, cluster-randomized&#xD;
      implementation trial of the LCS program in three control and three intervention primary care&#xD;
      CNHSA practices. The investigators hypothesize that a significantly higher proportion of&#xD;
      LCS-eligible patients in the intervention group will receive LCS, and significantly more LCS&#xD;
      participants who smoke cigarettes in the intervention group will be referred for smoking&#xD;
      cessation advice, compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Disseminate the LCS program to other health systems serving AI/AN patients. In Year 5,&#xD;
      the investigators will work closely with Choctaw Nation and other AI/AN-serving health system&#xD;
      stakeholders in Oklahoma and other US locations to disseminate the TEALS program in order to&#xD;
      facilitate the replication of the program in other settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team shares the commitment to engage in research that is of direct benefit to AI/AN&#xD;
      communities. The national rate of LCS with low-dose CT was only 3.9% in 2015, 26 making this&#xD;
      project particularly timely and relevant. TEALS will provide immediate benefit in rates of&#xD;
      lung cancer screening for the Choctaw Nation, and has the ultimate goal of reducing lung&#xD;
      cancer mortality by widespread implementation of LCS in health systems serving AI/AN&#xD;
      communities. TEALS has the novel feature of combining participatory approaches with&#xD;
      implementation science to create one of the first systematically designed and tribally run&#xD;
      LCS programs in the country. Incorporating feedback from tribal community members and&#xD;
      patients as well as healthcare professionals will enable an iterative adaptation of the TEALS&#xD;
      intervention to the needs of healthcare systems serving Native people. Our participatory&#xD;
      approach to D&amp;I science will provide an exemplary means of optimizing dissemination and&#xD;
      implementation of LCS in other healthcare settings serving AI/AN patients.&#xD;
