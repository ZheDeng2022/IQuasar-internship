      the study aimed to evaluate the clinical and MRI finding of TMJ with disk perforation with&#xD;
      predication of the risk factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The retrospective study included patients seeking treatment for TMD at Al-Azhar University&#xD;
      Hospital and the outpatient clinic at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Al-Azahr University.&#xD;
      The sample originally included patients who provided consent to participate in this study and&#xD;
      who ultimately underwent treatment for TMJD between 2008 and 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Inclusion criteria: Patients were included if they were older than 18 years and&#xD;
      diagnosed with TMJD. criteria for this study included systemic diseases (the presence of&#xD;
      polyarthritis or other rheumatic diseases), contraindications for MRI (e.g., implanted metal&#xD;
      or medical devices, claustrophobia), the presence of neurologic disorders, head and neck&#xD;
      cancer, oral submucous ﬁbrosis, a history of TMJ surgery, a history of previous nonsurgical&#xD;
      treatment such as occlusal splints, and a history of joint injection with HA/PRP. Trauma&#xD;
      patients with subcondylar fracture and patients with congenital and developmental disorders&#xD;
      of the TMJ were also excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study included 2 groups group 1: normal TMJ patients group 2: patients with TMJ internal&#xD;
      derangement&#xD;
