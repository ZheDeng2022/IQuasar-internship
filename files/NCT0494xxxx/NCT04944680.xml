  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The injury and remodeling mechanism about upper extremity motor network after stroke is not&#xD;
      clear. There are few studies on the motor network covering cortex, white matter and blood&#xD;
      perfusion at the time. Some studies have shown that metal imagery activates the cortex&#xD;
      through active mental simulation. Our previous study has shown that passive application of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation causes subthreshold polarization and promotes the&#xD;
      effective integration of residual brain high-level network. This study proposes a hypothesis:&#xD;
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation + Motor Imagery combines active and passive&#xD;
      neuromodulation techniques to produce dual channel effect, which can synergistically excite&#xD;
      motor cortex, remodel the motor network and optimize cerebral perfusion. The research&#xD;
      contents include clarify the effect of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation + Motor&#xD;
      Imagery neuromodulation therapy through comprehensive randomized controlled trial study;&#xD;
      present the process of brain injury and secondary neural plasticity through the motor network&#xD;
      construction, functional connectivity strength and cerebral perfusion with Blood Oxygen Level&#xD;
      Dependent, Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Arterial Spin Labeling multimodal magnetic resonance&#xD;
      technology; calculate the correlation between motor score and brain functional network,&#xD;
      extract the key nodes that can promote the motor network remodeling. The research results are&#xD;
      expected to provide preliminary theoretical foundations for further research on the injury&#xD;
      and remodeling mechanism about upper extremity motor network after stroke.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Because of the different therapies, it is not possible to mask the participant. It was possible to mask the group allocation for routine rehabilitation therapist. However, the difference is obvious between Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and motor imagery. Outcome measure is conducted by a physician who is blinded to group assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation with two saline-soaked electrodes (5cm x 7cm) is applied by our occupational therapist. The anode is placed on the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (C3/C4). The cathode is placed on the contralesional shoulder. The current is 1.5 milliampere and lasts 20 minutes.</description>
