  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is the most common reproductive disease afflicting young women, often leading&#xD;
      to debilitating chronic pelvic pain and impaired quality of life. Safe, effective, and&#xD;
      convenient long-term treatments are lacking for adolescents and young adults. The&#xD;
      levonorgestrel-containing IUD (LNG-IUD) represents an attractive long-term drug delivery&#xD;
      system for the treatment of endometriosis during adolescence and young adulthood. However,&#xD;
      while the LNG-IUD has an acceptable safety profile, it is not associated with a favorable&#xD;
      bleeding profile and may not fully suppress endometriosis pain when used as monotherapy.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the addition of NETA will improve bleeding patterns, maximize&#xD;
      pain control, and improve continuation rates of the IUD when the two medications are used in&#xD;
      combination. This proposed prospective trial provides the ideal context in which to&#xD;
      investigate these clinical questions and advance research on the best treatments for&#xD;
      endometriosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a major source of morbidity for U.S. females, affecting ~49% of adolescents&#xD;
      with chronic pelvic pain and 10% of all women of reproductive age. This percentage translates&#xD;
      into approximately 176 million women worldwide who may suffer from endometriosis. Annual&#xD;
      health care costs are estimated to be over $22 billion in the US alone. Over 50% of adults&#xD;
      with endometriosis report onset of severe pelvic pain during their adolescence. Symptoms&#xD;
      result in decreased quality of life, negative socioeconomic consequences, impaired&#xD;
      reproductive potential, and diminished mental health. Endometriosis is a chronic disease that&#xD;
      progresses over time in more than half of patients. Endometriosis has no cure. For&#xD;
      adolescents in particular, this means that the impact of endometriosis and its symptoms can&#xD;
      last for decades. Appropriate management involves not only prompt initiation of therapy, but&#xD;
      also the maintenance of therapy for a protracted length of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical therapy for endometriosis typically includes oral progestins or contraceptive pills.&#xD;
      Though often effective, these options are associated with systemic side-effects which may&#xD;
      further affect compliance and preclude long-term use. Furthermore, the need for repeated or&#xD;
      regular administration compromises compliance and therefore efficacy. The&#xD;
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUD) has been evaluated as a promising&#xD;
      treatment for endometriosis in adult women. The LNG-IUD 52 mg (Mirena) delivers&#xD;
      levonorgestrel (LNG) to the uterine cavity at a steady rate of 20 µg/day over 5 to 6 years.&#xD;
      The LNG causes atrophy and pseudo decidualization of the uterine lining, along with apoptosis&#xD;
      of endometrial glands and stroma. As the LNG-IUD requires no further patient action following&#xD;
      insertion, patient compliance is excellent. While continuation of the device is generally&#xD;
      very good in adults, unfavorable uterine bleeding patterns are the most frequent reason for&#xD;
      early device removal, particularly within the first 6 months. Anecdotal clinical experience&#xD;
      suggests that combining use of the LNG-IUD with low-dose oral progestin therapy may maximize&#xD;
      effectiveness and continuation of the LNG-IUD device in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 80 adolescents for participation in a double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      trial of NETA (n=40) vs. placebo (control group, n=40) for adjunct treatment to the&#xD;
      levonorgestrel-containing IUD for pelvic pain due to endometriosis. It is believed that a&#xD;
      combination of the locally-acting LNG-IUD plus systemic NETA may be the optimal combination&#xD;
      to effectively treat endometriosis pain, minimize side effects, provide contraception, and&#xD;
      control bleeding for adolescents with endometriosis.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain-Physical functioning assessed by the BPI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months, 6 Months, 9 Months, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item self-report measure. The items in this scale can be grouped into those that assess physical functioning (general activity; walking ability; normal work, including both work outside the home and housework), those that assess emotional functioning (mood; relations with people; enjoyment of life), and a single item that assesses the extent to which pain interferes with sleep. Either the item asking about the &quot;worst pain&quot; or the arithmetic mean of the four severity items can be used as measures of pain severity; the arithmetic mean of the seven interference items can be used as a measure of pain interference. The BPI is anchored between a scale of zero (no pain/interference) to ten (maximum pain/interference). The magnitude of treatment-associated change in BPI Interference Scale scores in open-label and randomized clinical trials ranges from 1 to 3 points, depending on the specific pain conditions and treatments studied.</description>

    <measure>Change in Bone mineral density Z-scores by dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>DXA has been the most widely used tool for the assessment of bone mass in clinical practice. DXA measures bone in two dimensions, and allows for the calculation of aBMD. Although these measures do not capture the internal architecture of bone, they are highly correlated with bone strength. A DXA scan of the total body (less head), lumbar spine, and total hip will be obtained. Age-, race-, and gender-specific Z-scores will be calculated using appropriate reference software.</description>
