  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective real-world study. The diagnosis and treatment of patients,&#xD;
      disease management, and information collection are completely dependent on the daily medical&#xD;
      practice. In this study, we plan to select 5 to 8 hospitals nationwide to collect the&#xD;
      clinical data of LASCCHN patients who received chemoradiotherapy combined with or without&#xD;
      nimotuzumab from January 2015 to December 2018. Patients included in the study will be&#xD;
      followed up for survival. The main endpoint is 3-year overall survival (OS) rate; the&#xD;
      secondary endpoint are 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 3-year Local-regional&#xD;
      control (LRC) rate, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety.&#xD;

        Patients who were more than 18 years old, and were proved to be LASCCHN were included in&#xD;
        this study. Patients in the control group receive chemoradiotherapy, while patients in the&#xD;
        study group received nimotuzumab on the basis of chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
