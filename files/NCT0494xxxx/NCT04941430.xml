    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the use of 7-Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in&#xD;
      detecting melanoma that has spread to the brain (melanoma brain metastases). The standard MRI&#xD;
      brain imaging is done on 3T or similar MRI machine, but the 7T MRI machine has a larger&#xD;
      magnet which has been shown to have superior resolution of the brain and of non-cancerous&#xD;
      brain lesions. Diagnostic procedures such as 7T MRI may help find and diagnose melanoma brain&#xD;
      metastases earlier than standard 3T MRI.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the potential superiority of contrast-enhanced (CE) 7T MRI by comparing to standard&#xD;
      of care CE 3T MRI in detecting occult brain metastases lesion at time of diagnosis of new&#xD;
      brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the imaging characteristics of melanoma brain metastases on 7T MRI of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate incidence of diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease on CE 7T MRI brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 weeks of initial standard of care 3T MRI, patients undergo 7T MRI scan with and&#xD;
      without contrast over 1-2 hours.&#xD;

    <description>Any visualized brain metastases seen in this study on 3T will be evaluated using the criteria proposed by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM). As there are no consensus criteria for 7T MRI published at this time, we will apply the same RANO-BM criteria to the study 7T MRI exams.Will count the discordant lesions between 3T and 7T, i.e. lesion identified in 7T but not 3T (L71L30) versus (vs.) lesion identified in 3T but not 7T(L70L31). McNemar's test will be used to compare L71L30 vs. L70L31. Will report 95% Clopper Pearson exact confidence interval for L71L30 vs. L70L31 in incidence of diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may have previous brain metastases treated &gt;30 days prior with brain&#xD;
             radiation, either whole brain radiation or radiosurgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
