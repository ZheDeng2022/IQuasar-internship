  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to carry out a medico-economic evaluation of a new&#xD;
      platform for outpatient surgical care, by comparing the effectiveness, utility and benefits&#xD;
      of the deployment of this trajectory on patients and the health system to a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient surgery allows the patient to leave the hospital on the day of their surgery and&#xD;
      thus avoid complete hospitalization. There are many advantages to this practice. Patients can&#xD;
      remain in the comfort of their own home with the support of their family caregivers and the&#xD;
      healthcare system can avoid incurring additional hospital costs and redirect these savings to&#xD;
      other critical needs. However, despite the advantages of outpatient surgery, the tools and&#xD;
      measures currently in place to supervise the preparation before the operation and the&#xD;
      follow-up after the operation are suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, adverse events such as moderate to severe pain, nausea/vomiting, infection&#xD;
      and bleeding from the operative site are very rarely sought out and detected by healthcare&#xD;
      facilities. However, these are the main causes of readmissions or emergency consultations for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to optimize the care offer, the anesthesiology department, the innovation and&#xD;
      artificial intelligence center of the CHUM as well as the Quebec telecare platform LeoMed&#xD;
      have joined forces in order to offer, through a health application, follow-up and&#xD;
      personalized support for patients undergoing outpatient surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the integration of this platform in the course of care will&#xD;
      allow early diagnosis of the main postoperative complications and therefore, prevent calls to&#xD;
      the Health-Info line, emergency room returns, as well as readmissions or unscheduled&#xD;
      postoperative consultations.&#xD;

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L-VAS is a valid questionnaire including five dimensions, each describing a different aspect of health: MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT and ANXIETY / DEPRESSION.&#xD;
Each dimension has five response levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to /extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by checking the box next to the most appropriate response level for each of the five dimensions.&#xD;
The VAS portion of the questionnaire EQ-5D-5L-VAS is a scale where patients are asked to indicate their overall health on the day of questionnaire completion, 0 = the worst health you can imagine and 100 = the best health you can imagine.</description>

    <description>Installation of the complete LeoMed application on the participant's smartphone during a visit at the preoperative clinic. The day before surgery, participants will receive notifications encouraging them to use the platform to help prepare for their surgery. Safety instructions will also be sent. Postoperatively, notifications will be sent to the participants every day during the first 4 days and on the 14th day. These notifications will direct them to online forms that aim to assess their condition. On the 30th postoperative day, the platform will send a final follow-up form. The platform will collect this information and classify it for appropriate management of their condition.</description>

    <description>Installation of a partial version of the LeoMed application on the patient's smartphone during a visit to the preoperative clinic. Before surgery, participants will receive a phone call to be summoned to the hospital and to remind them of the safety instructions. Postoperatively, their follow-up will not be standardized and will vary depending on their surgeon. On the 30th postoperative day, the platform will send a final follow-up form. In the event of an emergency, they will receive the contact details of the Centre d'Optimisation des Flux Réseau (COFR) to ensure the continuity of their care.</description>
