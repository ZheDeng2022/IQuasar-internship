  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The regional health authorities of South-East Norway has commissioned Sørlandet Hospital&#xD;
      (SSHF), Norway to establish mechanical thrombectomy in large-vessel occlusion stroke. SSHF is&#xD;
      a limited volume stroke center, and introduction of thrombectomy may impose quality&#xD;
      challenges. Therefore the implementation will be guided by a simulation based quality&#xD;
      assurance program. In this study, we will monitor timelines, technical and clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      including adverse events.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In acute stroke, two million neurons are lost per minute. Thrombectomy is the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for large vessel occlusion stroke: Each minute saved from stroke onset to successful&#xD;
      thrombectomy on average extends the healthy life of young patients by a week. Also, more&#xD;
      patients may have a thrombectomy option with early treatment, as the time window for&#xD;
      thrombectomy is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, Sørlandet Hospital Kristiansand (SSK) established thrombectomy for stroke. This&#xD;
      spared SSK patients from an over 300 km transport to the comprehensive thrombectomy center in&#xD;
      Oslo. Avoiding delays due to long transports may lead to lower morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, SSK is a non-university hospital with a limited patient volume, which may contribute&#xD;
      to inferior results. To compensate for this, the implementation of thrombectomy at SSK is&#xD;
      guided by a national quality program, which includes systematic skill training, simulation&#xD;
      team training and continuous local guideline updates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this observational study is to find out if implementation of&#xD;
      thrombectomy at SSK, guided by the quality program, reduces patient morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long transfer times from smaller hospitals to comprehensive thrombectomy centers pose a major&#xD;
      problem for the global stroke community. Thus, our results could be generalizable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine potential changes in patient morbidity and mortality after introduction of&#xD;
      thrombectomy at SSK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe associated time periods based on stroke onset, hospital arrival,&#xD;
           thrombectomy start, end of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document technical outcomes of mechanical thrombectomies performed at SSK, i.e.&#xD;
           degree of reperfusion after thrombectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document complication rates during mechanical thrombectomies performed at SSK&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the implementation of the quality program at SSK&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document performance of simulator skill training over time&#xD;
