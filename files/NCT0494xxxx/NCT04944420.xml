  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health enSuite Caregivers is an e-health program designed to meet some of the most common&#xD;
      needs of caregivers of persons with dementia, including information about dementia and&#xD;
      dementia care, caregivers' emotional health, formal or informal help received from others. It&#xD;
      also recommends specific strategies to promote well-being and provides tools to help&#xD;
      caregivers implement these strategies in their everyday lives. Health enSuite Caregivers is&#xD;
      available online and as a smartphone app. Its development was informed by reviews of&#xD;
      caregivers' needs and existing commercially available apps. A systematic search of&#xD;
      commercially available smartphone applications for caregivers found that many apps did not&#xD;
      consider each caregiver's unique needs, and were limited to psychoeducational content (no&#xD;
      tools for self-management). Furthermore, most existing programs have not been rigorously&#xD;
      tested or lack evidence to support their effectiveness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As the Canadian population ages, the demand for informal caregivers is expected to increase.&#xD;
      Currently, an estimated 8 million Canadians provide unpaid assistance and ongoing care to&#xD;
      family members and friends in need of support due to physical, cognitive, or mental health&#xD;
      conditions. Challenges associated with being an informal caregiver vary based on a number of&#xD;
      factors including how much time is involved, the health of the person being cared for, and&#xD;
      the care needs. Although all caregivers may experience distress, caregivers of people with&#xD;
      dementia are at especially high risk for psychological distress and poor health outcomes.&#xD;
      Nearly half of the individuals who are providing care for someone with dementia experience&#xD;
      symptoms of distress. It is important to provide caregivers with information and support so&#xD;
      that they can manage these demands without compromising their own well-being. However,&#xD;
      existing programs for caregivers are relatively limited. Primary care providers play an&#xD;
      important role in supporting caregivers of people with dementia; however, there is a lack of&#xD;
      effective, easily accessible programs for primary healthcare providers to recommend to a&#xD;
      distressed caregiver of someone with dementia. The investigators developed Health enSuite&#xD;
      Caregivers as a potential solution to this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: On average participants assigned to the intervention group will report&#xD;
      greater wellbeing (emotional and relationship facets) over time compared to participants&#xD;
      assigned to the control group. At 3 and 6 months post-randomization emotional and relational&#xD;
      well-being is expected to be higher in the intervention group compared to the control group.&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: Participants assigned to the intervention group will have greater&#xD;
      well-being (each specific facet, total well-being) and greater self-efficacy at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months post-randomization compared to participants assigned to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group or a wait-list control&#xD;
      group. Participants in both groups will complete self-assessments, including key outcome&#xD;
      measures, at baseline, and 3, and 6 months post-randomization. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the full Health enSuite Caregivers program immediately after&#xD;
      being randomized to this group. It is designed to offer advice to caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      dementia based on an assessment of their specific needs. Topics are divided into five main&#xD;
      content areas, which are recommended based on an assessment of the caregivers current&#xD;
      challenges and sources of stress. Participants in the control group will be wait-listed and&#xD;
      receive only treatment as usual during the study. After their participation is the study has&#xD;
      ended, participants in the control group will be given access to the full Health enSuite&#xD;
      Caregivers program.&#xD;

The ratings to the CWS questions in the following sections: &quot;your role as a carer&quot;, &quot;your relationship with the person you care for&quot;, &quot;your relationship with family and friends&quot; and &quot;your emotional well-being&quot; will be aggregated to create a single composite score for each participant. This composite score will be the primary outcome measure.

        Determination of eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • If response to the question 1 is Yes, the application will consider the caregiver as&#xD;
        eligible. If response to the question 1 is No, then application displays this message to&#xD;
        the caregiver &quot;You are currently not eligible to participate in this study. This&#xD;
        application is designed to support caregivers who are 18 years and older.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If response to the question 2 is Yes, the application will consider the caregiver as&#xD;
             eligible. If response to the question 2 is No, then application displays this message&#xD;
             to the caregiver &quot;You are currently not eligible to participate in this study. To&#xD;
             access the Health enSuite Caregivers program you will need regular access to a device&#xD;
             with an internet connection.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If at least 1 option from question 3 or question 4 is selected, then person is&#xD;
             considered to be living with &quot;moderate&quot; dementia, and the application will consider&#xD;
             the caregiver as eligible. If no option from question 3 or question 4 is selected,&#xD;
             then the application will consider the caregiver as ineligible, and display the&#xD;
             following message to the caregiver &quot;You are currently not eligible to participate in&#xD;
             this study. You must be caring for a person with moderate dementia to be able to&#xD;
             participate in the Health enSuite Caregivers program.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If &quot;more than one hour per week&quot; is selected for question 5 then the application will&#xD;
             consider the caregiver as eligible. If &quot;less than one hour per week&quot; is selected, then&#xD;
             the application will consider the caregiver as ineligible, and display the following&#xD;
             message to the caregiver &quot;You are currently not eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
             You must be caring for a person with moderate dementia for more than 1 hour per week&#xD;
             to be able to participate in the Health enSuite Caregivers program.&quot;&#xD;
