  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system is thought to play a key role in the development of liver inflammation and&#xD;
      subsequent liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis, for example, numerous studies have&#xD;
      focused on the acquired antigen-specific immunity. However, the liver is the site of&#xD;
      increased occurrence of the components of the innate immune response (NK and NKT cells) and,&#xD;
      in contrast to T cells, these T cells, these do not require antigen presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study was designed to determine which cellular components of the (NK,&#xD;
      NKT, dendritic cells, macrophages) or the acquired immune response (CD4, CD8) or which&#xD;
      network of immune cells is involved in the immunopathogenesis of progressive liver&#xD;
      inflammation or the development of liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to identify lymphocyte populations that exhibit either prognostically favorable or&#xD;
      unfavorable characteristics. This should allow conclusions to be drawn for a more targeted&#xD;
      and individualized therapy of the respective chronic liver diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with acute liver inflammation (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis) or&#xD;
      chronic inflammation (e.g., ethyltoxic, viral hepatitis, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis,&#xD;
      colorectal liver metastases, HCC) or liver fibrosis, the cellular immune response will be&#xD;
      prospectively investigated and compared with liver healthy control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, patients with known or unknown liver disease will be tested during&#xD;
      inpatient stays or during a visit to the outpatient clinic after written consent has been&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood is then processed for further immunological cell analyses and finally frozen in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen. If a liver biopsy is taken from the patient as part of the clinical diagnostics&#xD;
      during an inpatient stay or if a liver biopsy or liver resection is performed during a&#xD;
      procedure in the OR, tissue that is not required for diagnostic purposes should be frozen for&#xD;
      further immunological cell analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients undergoing elective surgery in the abdominal cavity are suspected of having a&#xD;
      liver disease (e.g., altered liver parameters in the blood) and a wedge biopsy of the liver&#xD;
      will be performed intraoperatively for diagnostics, tissue that is not required for&#xD;
      diagnostic purposes should be prepared for further immunological cell analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a part of the liver tissue obtained should be preserved for later genetic&#xD;
      studies, e.g. in RNA-later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of acute liver disease, further blood samples should be taken 48 and 96 h later and&#xD;
      on weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12, and after 6 and 12 months, respectively (or at the respective&#xD;
      visits to the outpatient clinic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with chronic liver disease, blood should be re-collected during their regular&#xD;
      visits at the outpatient clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to patient history and medical information, the patients should also be regularly&#xD;
      examined during the entire duration of the study and medical information, that are regularly&#xD;
      collected during routine laboratory work ups (e.g. viral titers by quantitative PCR, liver&#xD;
      enzymes and liver function) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the immune responses, lymphocytes from patients without liver disease will be&#xD;
      examined. will be investigated. Furthermore, healthy blood donors will be used as an&#xD;
      additional control group.&#xD;
