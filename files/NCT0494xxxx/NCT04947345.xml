    <description>Patients should be given study drugs as soon as possible after entering the ICU. Syringe pump is used to administer medication. Loading dose of Remimazolam is 0.2 mg/kg, which is administered for less than 1 min initially. Maintaining dose is 0.2-1 mg/kg/h. Sedative target is RASS between 0 and -2 points. Excepts for fentanyl and Remimazolam, no analgesic or sedative could be used during the experimental time period.</description>

    <description>Patients should be given study drugs as soon as possible after entering the ICU. Syringe pump is used to administer medication. Loading dose of propofol is 0.2 mg/kg, which is administered for less than 1 min initially. Maintaining dose is 0.3-4.0 mg/kg/h. Sedative target is RASS between 0 and -2 points. Excepts for fentanyl and propofol, no analgesic or sedative could be used during the experimental time period.&#xD;
Rescue therapy for experimental group During the treatment of the experimental group, if the RASS cannot be maintained at 0 to -2 points at the maximum Remimazolam maintenance dose of 1 mg/kg/h, a loading dose of propofol (0.2 mg/kg) can be given intravenously. If RASS fails to satisfied after three loading doses of propofol, Remimazolam is discarded and 0.3-4.0 mg/kg/h of propofol are used as rescue therapy for experimental group.</description>
