      Objective: To verify the effectiveness of education in pain added to other treatment&#xD;
      modalities (manual therapy and exercises) in the outcomes of pain, functionality, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, stress, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy and strength.&#xD;

      Introduction: Shoulder pain is one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal complaints&#xD;
      found in primary care, with subacromial impact syndrome being the most common. Aging is one&#xD;
      of the risk factors for shoulder pain. While psychological factors, which include negative&#xD;
      beliefs about pain, catastrophization, kinesiophobia and low self-efficacy, all are related&#xD;
      to high levels of pain and disability in the shoulder, predisposing to failure in&#xD;
      conservative treatment. Objectives: To verify the effectiveness of pain education added to&#xD;
      other treatment modalities (manual therapy and exercises) in the outcomes of pain,&#xD;
      functionality, depression, anxiety, stress, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy and strength.&#xD;
      Methodology: Randomized controlled clinical trial, which will last for one month of&#xD;
      intervention and follow-up for three months. Primary Outcomes: Shoulder Pain and Disability&#xD;
      Index Questionnaire that evaluates (pain and disability), Pressure Algometer (pain to&#xD;
      pressure) and Visual Analogue Scale (pain). Secondary outcomes: Questionnaire (DASS-21),&#xD;
      which evaluates depression, anxiety and stress, Tampa Scale (kinesiophobia), Chronic Pain&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Scale (Self-efficacy) and manual dynamometer that evaluates strength. 74&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of subacromial pain, of both sexes, aged between 65 and 85 years&#xD;
      will be treated, who will be allocated into two groups: (37 patients for each group). Group&#xD;
      A: Manual Therapy + Exercises, individual assistance, twice a week lasting 40 min. (20 min.&#xD;
      For each therapy); Group B: Manual Therapy + Exercises + Pain Education, individual care,&#xD;
      twice a week lasting 60 min. (20 min. For each therapy. Statistical analysis: The normality&#xD;
      distribution will be through the Shapiro-Wilk test. For comparisons of means between and&#xD;
      within the groups of outcomes, they will be used using the Generalized Estimation Equations&#xD;
      and when necessary , multiple comparisons will be performed using the Bonferroni test,&#xD;
      calculated for comparisons between the final and initial moments and initial follow-up in&#xD;
      each group: difference in means, 95% confidence interval, effect size (d Cohen). statistical&#xD;
      significance adopted will be 5% and the analyzes will be carried out in the statistical&#xD;
      programs SPSS 22.0 and R 3.2.4.&#xD;
