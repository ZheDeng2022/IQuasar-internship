  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain has been recognized to be the most common and predictable side effect of medication&#xD;
      abortion, causing significant distress associated with the process. Yet there is little known&#xD;
      about the appropriate management of pain during this process, with no current evidence based&#xD;
      recommendations for optimal analgesic regimens during the first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral methadone for pain control during&#xD;
      medication abortion. The current medication regimen used to perform medication abortion is a&#xD;
      dose of mifepristone (antiprogesterone) orally, followed by a dose of misoprostol&#xD;
      (prostaglandin analogue) 24 to 72 hours later. Patients are prescribed a standard dose of&#xD;
      ibuprofen 600-800mg tabs for pain control during the process. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a non-randomized, pilot study with 25 patients evaluated at the Boston Medical Center family&#xD;
      planning clinic at 10 weeks of gestation or less for medication abortion.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this research study is to determine the feasibility of enrolling&#xD;
      patients in a study that requires the consumption of methadone for acute pain management for&#xD;
      medication abortion. Secondary objectives include the assessment of pain using: pain scores&#xD;
      at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours following misoprostol, use of supplementary analgesia, reported side&#xD;
      effects, and patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be instructed to take methadone 5 mg orally (1 tablet) simultaneously&#xD;
      with the consumption of misoprostol. The participants will be evaluated using an 11 point&#xD;
      numeric rating pain scale with 0 (no pain) and 10 (most severe pain). Patients will be given&#xD;
      a telephone number to which they will be asked to text study staff indicating that&#xD;
      misoprostol and methadone have been consumed. Study staff will phone the participants at 0,&#xD;
      4, 8 and 24 hours post misoprostol consumption to conduct a survey posing questions about&#xD;
      maximum pain scores, compliance with study medication and any adverse effects experienced.&#xD;
      Participants will also be contacted at 48 hours for further evaluation of any reported&#xD;
      adverse events and 1 week post misoprostol to assess ease of study design and instructions,&#xD;
      pain experience, perisomal view on consumption of methadone and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
