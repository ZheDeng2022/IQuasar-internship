  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a intervention study aims to investigate the effects of a multidomain intervention&#xD;
      program for older people with vascular and mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two equal groups, to receive either an intensive&#xD;
      multidomain intervention (intervention group) or regular health advice (control group). The&#xD;
      intervention will include physical and cognitive interventions, and management of metabolic&#xD;
      and vascular risk factors. The primary outcome is changes in cognitive function measured by&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) 13-item version, dementia severity&#xD;
      (Clinical Dementia Rating), and (alternative versions) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA),&#xD;
      memory (Recall test), executive function (Clock drawing from MOCA plus Trails B), attention&#xD;
      (digit span forward, Trials A and B test). We hypothesize that the multidomain intervention&#xD;
      will improve cognitive function, quality of life, behaviours, functional ability, sleep and&#xD;
      reduce falls, use of healthcare services, death in the study group compared to the control&#xD;
      group during the 12 months intervention period and after the 6 months extended follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After initial screening, participants and their caregivers will receive a complete&#xD;
      explanation of the purpose, risks, and procedures of the study and sign a written informed&#xD;
      consent if they show interest in participating. Those agreeing will be randomized into two&#xD;
      equal groups, to receive either an intensive multidomain intervention (intervention group) or&#xD;
      regular health advice (control group). The intervention will include physical and cognitive&#xD;
      interventions, and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intervention and the control group participants will be treated for dementia&#xD;
      according to the recommendations of the Viet Nam Alzheimer Disease and Neurocognitive&#xD;
      Disorders Association during their outpatient clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have outcomes measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 and 18 months.&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation of study patients will include a demographic questionnaire (age, gender,&#xD;
      marital status), health information questionnaire (medical history, current medications),&#xD;
      physical assessment measures, cognitive assessment measures, behavioral measures, depression&#xD;
      measures, fall, sleep problem, quality of life and blood tests (Cholesterol, HDL-&#xD;
      Cholesterol, Glucose, HbA1c if patients have diabetes). Baseline evaluation of caregivers&#xD;
      will include caregiver burden, quality of life and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each examination (3, 6, 9, 12 months), participants will underwent a physical examination,&#xD;
      anthropometry (weight, and hip and waist circumference), blood pressure determination, and&#xD;
      phlebotomy for metabolic and vascular risk factors. Blood pressure measurements will be made&#xD;
      on the left arm of the seated participants with a sphygmomanometer and an appropriately sized&#xD;
      cuff; the average of 2 physician-obtained measures constituted the examination blood&#xD;
      pressure. Serum total and HDL cholesterol levels were determined with standardized enzymatic&#xD;
      methods. Cigarette smoking status was ascertained by self-report. Diabetes was defined as&#xD;
      fasting glucose &gt; 7 mmo/l or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications. were determined&#xD;
      with HbA1C liquid chromatography if participants have diabetes. Antihypertensive medication&#xD;
      use was ascertained by the physician examiner and based on self-report. Results will be&#xD;
      provided to participants and their doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the month of 18 follow up, participants will underwent a physical assessment measures,&#xD;
      cognitive assessment measures, behavioral measures, depression measures, fall, sleep problem,&#xD;
      quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive three intervention components: (1) physical activity; (2) cognitive&#xD;
      stimulation; and (3) intensive monitoring and management of metabolic and vascular risk&#xD;
      factors. Physical activity and cognitive stimulation interventions will be performed on&#xD;
      separate days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity intervention Progressive resistance training (PRT) for the physical&#xD;
      intervention will be provided at the hospital for 45 minutes twice a week for the first 3&#xD;
      months, once a week for the next 3 months and once every 2 weeks for the remaining period.&#xD;
      The sessions will be organized in groups (10 patients/ group) and supervised by 2&#xD;
      physiotherapists. Within each small group (maximum 10) participants will follow the program&#xD;
      tailored to their individual functioning level, with constant oversight by trainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise program consists of progressive resistance training. Participants will progress&#xD;
      through the 12-month intervention, guided by daily ratings of perceived exertion (15-18) on&#xD;
      the Borg Scale. Caregivers will also be involved in physical activity with people with&#xD;
      dementia if they wish to participate People with dementia and their caregivers will be&#xD;
      instructed to follow the prescribed home-based PRT exercises for the rest of the week.&#xD;
      Subjects will be encouraged to exercise daily. Physiotherapists will determine progress&#xD;
      subjectively based on the ability of the person with dementia. Training volume (multiplying&#xD;
      the number of repetitions performed/day by the number of days) will be monitored using a&#xD;
      simple training diary with compliance assessed as a measure of practice ratio i.e. number of&#xD;
      days the subjects actually carried out the program multiplied by the program duration in days&#xD;
      Cognitive stimulation intervention The study subjects will receive cognitive intervention&#xD;
      based on Cognitive Stimulation Therapy with rehabilitation experts. The intervention involves&#xD;
      14 sessions of themed activities, which typically run twice weekly for the first 3 months,&#xD;
      once a week for the next 3 months and once every 2 weeks for the remaining period. The&#xD;
      sessions will be organized in groups (10 patients/ group) Each session lasts about 45&#xD;
      minutes. To make sure that there is continuity between the sessions they will follow the same&#xD;
      structure: introductions (l0 minutes), main activity (25 minutes) and conclusion (l0&#xD;
      minutes). A total set of 14 exercises have been selected including physical games, sounds,&#xD;
      childhood, food, current affairs, word associalion, being creative, categorising objects,&#xD;
      orientation, using money, number game, word games, team quiz. People with dementia and their&#xD;
      family members will be instructed on how to practice at home for the rest of the week based&#xD;
      on the Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (iCST), which consists of 75 structured&#xD;
      activity sessions with a variety of themes including life story, word games, quizzes, art,&#xD;
      reminiscence, discussion of current affairs and being creative. Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to practice daily. Training volume (multiplying the number of repetitions&#xD;
      performed/day by the number of days) will be monitored using a simple training diary&#xD;
      Metabolic and vascular risk factors Metabolic and vascular risk factors of the intervention&#xD;
      group will be evaluated by cardiologists and endocrinologists in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will be examined at the beginning of the study, at 3,&#xD;
      6, 9 and 12 months to measure the anthropometric indicators (weight, blood pressure, hips and&#xD;
      waist circumference), risks of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (smoking, drinking,&#xD;
      drinking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, diabetes) and&#xD;
      assess blood test results (as above).&#xD;
