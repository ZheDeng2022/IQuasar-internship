  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of artificial intelligence software in breast screening (Transpara®) makes it&#xD;
      possible to identify studies with a very low probability of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis raised in this work is that reading strategies based on artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (single or double reading only of cases with a score&gt; 7 with Transpara®), allow&#xD;
      reducing the workload of a screening program by more than 50 % with respect to the standard&#xD;
      reading of the program (double reading of all cases without Transpara®), without presenting&#xD;
      inferiority in terms of detection rates and recalls of the program, both with the use of 2D&#xD;
      digital mammography and with the use of tomosynthesis or 3D mammogram.&#xD;

    <description>In the women participating in the study, two strategies for reading mammograms will be carried out:&#xD;
Strategy 1: Standard reading of the program. Double independent and non-consensual reading of all cases, without any artificial intelligence system (standard strategy).&#xD;
Strategy 2: Reading strategy based on the global Score granted by Transpara® (strategy based on artificial intelligence):&#xD;
In studies with a Score &lt;8 (studies with a low probability of cancer): They will not be evaluated by any radiologist.&#xD;
In studies with a Score&gt; 7 (studies with a high probability of cancer): double reading will be carried out, assisted by Transpara®.</description>
