  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observation of a cohort of 400 patients with different types of lymphomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A database on 400 patients diagnosed with lymphomas was built up over 20 years at Nîmes&#xD;
      University Hospital. Biopsies were made on these tumours and all the samples were frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the heterogeneous nature of lymphomas, randomized clinical trials based on very&#xD;
      precise criteria for the inclusion or non-inclusion of patients are the gold standard for&#xD;
      studying the various sub-types of lymphomas by concentrating on homogeneous populations for&#xD;
      which a limited number of parameters are analyzed simultaneously. However, due to the&#xD;
      complexity of their medical situation, many patients may be excluded form these trials, thus&#xD;
      making it difficult to obtain reliable results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of a non-selected cohort has two main advantages: (1) to better understand the&#xD;
      diversity of patients with lymphomas for which the recommendations are constantly evolving&#xD;
      and (2) to analyze how, exactly, these are managed by integrating points which are currently&#xD;
      poorly evaluated such as comorbidities and accessibility to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to describe how these patients are managed and to demonstrate that&#xD;
      not all patients are able to benefit from the official management recommendations applicable&#xD;
      to their pathology.&#xD;
