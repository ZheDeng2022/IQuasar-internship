  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractionated stereotatic radiation therapy (FSRT) that very precisely delivers a high dose of&#xD;
      radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. The purpose of this study is to find out if FSRT is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic spinal tumors of breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible breast cancer patients with bone metastases will be treated with FSRT. 9-10 Gy x 3Fx&#xD;
      or 6-7 Gy x 5Fx image-guided fractionated stereotatic radiation therapy will be used.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of invasive breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Bone metastases (confirmed by MRI within 4 weeks of enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Paraosseous soft tissue ≤ 5cm. The tumour could involve the vertebral column, but did&#xD;
             not have to, nor did it need to enter the spinal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. KPS ≥ 40 or ECOG 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The tumor is at least 2 mm away from the spinal cord. If the tumor is closer than 2&#xD;
             mm, surgical resection is required prior to FSRT or the total prescription dose of&#xD;
             spinal cord is strictly limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Failure of previous conventional external beam radiotherapy or surgery, residual tumor&#xD;
             after surgery, medical inoperability, and refusal to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A maximum of three distinct noncontiguous spinal metastases per patient was allowed,&#xD;
             and each of the separate sites may have involvement of 2 contiguous vertebral bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients have sufficient bone marrow reserve and liver and kidney function: neutrophil&#xD;
             count ≥ 1500 cells / mm3; platelet count ≥ 70000 / mm3; hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8.0 g / dl;&#xD;
             if there is liver metastasis, AST and ALT &lt; 3x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The interval between systemic chemotherapy is more than 2 weeks, and the side effects&#xD;
             recovery from previous treatment ≤ grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients receiving bisphosphonates, endocrine or targeted therapy at the same time&#xD;
             were not included&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with mechanically unstable spine or epidural spinal cord compression were&#xD;
             excluded; however, patients with previously documented spinal cord compression that&#xD;
             had been decompressed and stabilized were eligible. Patients with &gt; 50% loss of&#xD;
             vertebral body height were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients in whom a delay in initiating treatment might have adversely affected&#xD;
             neurological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a pacemaker, unable to undergo MR imaging and unable to lie flat for at&#xD;
             least 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who had a history of previous radiotherapy to the spine at the current level&#xD;
             of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who had received prior external-beam irradiation to the spine within 3 months&#xD;
             of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who had received systemic radiotherapy (Strontium-89) within 30 days of&#xD;
             starting protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who had received chemotherapy within 2 weeks of starting protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who are unwilling or unable to receive regular follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patients judged by the researchers who could not be included in some special&#xD;
             cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Serious complications: cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, serious liver&#xD;
             disease, infection, et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnant women.&#xD;
