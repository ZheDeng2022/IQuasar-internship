  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rebirth active SCHOOL 2.0 is a physical activity intervention program and about to be&#xD;
      realised at 40 primary schools in Lower Saxony Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of all schools will be assigned to the intervention program or to wait for one year&#xD;
      before starting with the movement program. After one and two years, the follow up will take&#xD;
      place. After completing baseline examinations (i.e. physical and cognitive functions,&#xD;
      physical activity questionnaires) the intervention program will start for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program is going to be designed with the goal of implementing physical&#xD;
      activity of 60 minutes per day. For the main module of movement impulses, the pupils will&#xD;
      perform a 5-minute exercise in every lesson, realised by the teachers.&#xD;

    <measure>Peripheral blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 1 and 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>measured in a seated position after a resting period of 5 minutes. We will use the oscillometric Dinamap device (Dinamap v150; Fa. GE Medical Systems, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Three measurements will be taken on the right and on the left arm. Between each measurement will be a 1 minute resting period. The Median of the left and the right arm is used for further calculations. If the Median is above the 90th percentile three measurements will be taken again by the investigator using the auscultatory method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Central blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 1 and 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Central blood pressure will be measured in a spinal position using an oscillometric device, the Mobil-O-Graph (I.E.M. GmbH). The cuff size must be chosen accordingly to the arm size. After a resting period of 5 minutes 3 measurements will be taken on the right arm. Between each measurement will be 30 seconds. The mean of the 3 measurements will be used for further calculations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial pulse wave</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 1 and 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial pulse wave will be measured in a spinal position using the Vicorder. The patient should rest for 5 minutes before the start of the measurement. The thigh cuff will be placed around the patient's upper right thigh as high as possible. The cuff around the neck has to be placed over the right carotid artery. The investigator has to measure from the suprasternal notch vertically to the umbilicus and from the umbilicus diagonally to the mid of the thigh cuff. The length will be added up and the measurement from the suprasternal notch to the cuff around the neck will be subtracted. The length will be used for calculating the arterial pulse wave velocity. Three measurements will be taken with each having 10 consecutive waveforms with similar shape and size. The mean of the 3 measurements will be used for further calculations.</description>
