  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly risk of fall increases due to balance dysfunction, cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      low vision. In this research, the aim is to find the effects of Supervised BRACE (Balance,&#xD;
      Resistance, Aerobic, Cognitive Exercises) protocol on mobility to reduce the risk of fall in&#xD;
      the elderly. Randomized controlled trial 10-12 weeks follow-up. The sample size is 40. The&#xD;
      subjects are divided into two groups, 20 subjects in the control group and 20 in the&#xD;
      experimental group. The study duration is of 6 months. The sampling technique will be&#xD;
      purposive sampling and consecutive random assignment through the sealed envelope method.&#xD;
      Individuals of age 60-80, either gender with Berg balance score (BBS) 20-40 will be included.&#xD;
      Individuals with musculoskeletal conditions (fractures, severe arthritis), neurological&#xD;
      conditions like Epilepsy, Parkinson, Alzheimer's, Impaired cognition and other systemic&#xD;
      diseases or co-morbidities will be excluded. Assessments tools that will be used in the study&#xD;
      are Mini-Mental State Exam, Berg balance Scale, timed up and go test (TUG), elderly mobility&#xD;
      scale, Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale, Activities of Balance Confidence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In terms of morbidity and mortality fall is a major concern in older adults. Fall is defined&#xD;
      as unintentional contact with the ground. Tinetti in 1988 defined fall as &quot;an event in which&#xD;
      a person rest unintentionally on the ground or lower surface&quot;. There are many reasons for&#xD;
      fall which can be intrinsic or extrinsic. The risk factors of fall can be ageing (e.g.&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, poor balance or low vision), nutrition (vitamin D and calcium&#xD;
      deficiency), medication (sedatives, antidepressants etc), environmental factors (improper&#xD;
      shoes, poor lighting and unsafe stairs) and lack of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies considered age 60 and above in the geriatric population. The number of falls&#xD;
      increases day by day due to balance dysfunction which is the key impairment. Age 60 and above&#xD;
      along with any impairment or disease which makes a person weak can be included in the group&#xD;
      of geriatric population. The fact supported by previous researches that the person who&#xD;
      involved in rehabilitation therapies can decrease fall rate and fall associated problems.&#xD;
      Through these rehabilitation exercises Activity of Daily Living (ADLs) can be improved and&#xD;
      disabilities could be prevented. Wii Fit gaming system can be used to uplift lifestyle and&#xD;
      improve balance in the geriatric population.&#xD;

    <measure>Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>authentic tool to assess the balance. It is used for the assessment of static and dynamic balance. It is additionally utilized for assessment of functional balance and risk of fall in the elderly. It is a 14 Item scale, each item has a range of score from 0-4, where a high score (4) indicates a decrease in fall risk, good balance and perform task independently while a lower score (0) demonstrates poor balance, increased danger of fall and totally dependent. 56 are the highest score of berg balance</description>

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is used for the screening of cognitive impairment. There is no effective instrument for the early detection of mild cognitive changes. MoCA is a successful screening test Scores of MoCA ranges from 0-30. Interpretation of MoCA indicates that score of 26 and above normal, 18 - 25 score indicates mild cognitive impairment, 10 - 18 score considered moderate cognitive impairment while &lt;10 considered severe cognitive impairment exists for the screening of mild cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>The Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) is a basic, reasonable and cheap method that was created to assess the mobility and gait in the elderly. The TUG involves fundamental regular movements: stand up from a seat, walking a distance of 3 meters, pivot, move back, and take a seat once again. The result is the time taken to play out this arrangement of developments.&#xD;
The interpretation of TUG demonstrates that individuals with TUG score &lt;10 seconds are highly mobile, &lt;20 seconds are generally independent and &gt; 20 for mobility impairment</description>

    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale was produced to evaluate the confidence level in performing Score of ABC scale ranges from 0%-100%, 0% means (no confidence) and 100% means (absolutely good). The interpretation of ABC scale demonstrates &gt;80% shows good level of confidence in physical activity, 50-80% indicates a moderate level of confidence and &lt;50% shows a low level of confidence in physical working specific task without losing balance or getting to be unsteady.</description>

    <description>The Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) is a simple and quick tool used for the assessment of mobility and function in elderly. EMS is the 7-item scale with the total score of 20. The interpretation of EMS demonstrates , individuals with score &gt;14 are perform their ADLs independently with good mobility, score ranges between 10-13- these individuals are at borderline according to their safe mobility and independence while score &lt; 10 are generally dependent in performing ADLs and have poor mobility</description>

    <measure>FULLERTON ADVANCE BALANCE (FAB) SCALE</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) is a valid and reliable scale used for the assessment of balance in higher-working elderly. Both static and dynamic balance can be measured through FAB. The test was found to separate among members of fluctuating abilities of balance. FAB is 10-item scale consists of 5-point ranged (0-4) with total score of 0-40 points possible (higher scores are better). Items are scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (0-4).</description>

    <description>The home plan included Balance and Resistance exercises of BRACE protocol were provided to the control group but that was not supervised. Control group participants were also same assessed as the S-BRACE group. Before giving the training plan for home, it was elaborated in detail. For the convenience of participants, the BRACE protocol was also translated into Urdu and was given in the printed form. The data were collected at baseline, after 3 weeks, 6, 9 and then after 12 weeks of training</description>
