      The data will be obtained from 10 tertiary centers located in Poland (Cracow - coordinating&#xD;
      center, Warsaw - 3 centers, Sosnowiec, Szczecin, Bydgoszcz, Lublin, Gdansk, Poznan) and 5&#xD;
      foreign centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will include patients with rectal cancer operated on between 2013-2019. A&#xD;
      database in MS Excel is prepared that consists of following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of neoadjuvant treatment (if any)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time-interval between the end of neoadjuvant treatment and surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staging of rectal cancer i.e. (y)pTNM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of retrieved lymph nodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of lymph nodes with metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R classification (R0, R1, R2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative medications (metformin, statins, NSAIDs, anticoagulants)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence date and type (local, systemic, both diagnosed at the same time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of death or date of last follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establishing whether neoadjuvant treatment (PSCR or chemoradiotherapy) influences number&#xD;
           of retrieved lymph nodes in rectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishing whether time-interval between the end of PSCR and surgery influences lymph&#xD;
           node yield&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establishing the prognostic value of lymph node ratio - validation of the previously&#xD;
           calculated cutoff point at the level of 0.41&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determining independent prognostic factors in rectal cancer - in particular related to&#xD;
           medications taken before the operation, metformin and anti diabetic drugs in the first&#xD;
           place&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previously published studies showed that preoperative treatment of rectal cancer is&#xD;
      associated with a lower number of lymph nodes retrieved during resection that is often lower&#xD;
      than the recommended number of 12 nodes necessary for proper establishing of ypN category. A&#xD;
      few studies revealed that lymph node ratio (LNR) is a more precise prognostic factor than pN&#xD;
      category. The analysis conducted at the 1st Department of Surgery (Jagiellonian University,&#xD;
      Cracow, Poland) based on patients' data from 1999 - 2006 year indicated that the median&#xD;
      number of harvested lymph nodes after preoperative short course radiotherapy 5x5 Gy (PSCR)&#xD;
      was 16. Therefore, PSCR did not seem to influence the number of lymph nodes in the operative&#xD;
      specimen. Time-interval between radiotherapy and surgery (7-10 days versus 4-5 weeks) was not&#xD;
      associated with lymph node yield, either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication taken by the patients before operation may influence the treatment results as&#xD;
      well. In a couple of studies metformin was identified as inhibitor of carcinogenesis&#xD;
      according to antiangiogenic and antimetabolic effects and as a potential radiosensitizer. The&#xD;
      anticancer property of metformin is largely attributed to its capability in modulating&#xD;
      signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism. In the last&#xD;
      decade, mounting evidence supports the use of metformin in the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Moreover, the use of metformin as monotherapy or as an adjuvant in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients has led to further dose reduction and increased&#xD;
      radio-chemosensitivity which lead to minimal gastrointestinal side effects and reduced&#xD;
      toxicity. The use of metformin was associated with improved survival among colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to sulfonylureas and insulin. The effect of&#xD;
      metformin in nondiabetic patients has not been evaluated so far. Based on the aforementioned&#xD;
      results, it seems well-grounded to establish the influence of other medications (statins,&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants) on the results of combined treatment of&#xD;
      rectal cancer with the assessment whether they are independent prognostic factors in&#xD;
      comparison with such parameters as (y)pT, (y)pN or LNR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study initiation, a template of MS Excel database with manual will be sent to the&#xD;
      Principal Investigators in every participating center. After obtaining the filled sheets from&#xD;
      all participating centers, a central database will be prepared. No personal data of the&#xD;
      patients (name, surname, personal ID numbers) will be collected and data in the central&#xD;
      database will be anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of harvested lymph nodes will be compared in patients who underwent neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy, PSCR, or surgery alone. In addition, number of retrieved lymph nodes and&#xD;
      lymph node ratio will be compared in patients operated on after different time-intervals&#xD;
      between PSCR and surgery (&lt; 7 days and &gt; 4 weeks). Kaplan-Meier curves will be drawn to&#xD;
      established influence of number and ratio of harvested lymph nodes on overall survival and&#xD;
      disease-free survival. Local and systemic recurrence rate will be established and compared in&#xD;
      analysed patients. Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS 27 for Mac. Variables&#xD;
      without normal distribution will be compared by means of Mann Whitney U and Chi-square tests.&#xD;
      Cumulative proportions of surviving will be compared with the use of log-rank test.&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariate Cox regression will be performed to establish prognostic factors&#xD;
      in analysed population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is academic and non-commercial. The participating centers will not have to cover&#xD;
      any additional cost as the treatment options analysed constitute standard clinical practice.&#xD;
      No financial support is granted for investigators nor study participants.&#xD;
