    <textblock>
      DAMPs (damage associated molecular patterns) are endogenous molecules that are expressed by&#xD;
      cell stress or cell damage and play an important role in tissue (or host) defense and repair&#xD;
      by activating the innate immune system. This is not the case with infections or injuries.&#xD;
      Briefly, it starts when the immune system is activated by a receptor that recognizes a damage&#xD;
      pattern, and it is a generic term for continuous responses by endogenous molecules expressed&#xD;
      in this process. Recently, immuno-cancer drugs for cancer treatment by applying this immune&#xD;
      response are also emerging. In cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), there are&#xD;
      more deleterious effects and adverse effects caused by using CPB than the surgery itself.&#xD;
      There are several studies that have revealed the association of DAMPs and the degree of&#xD;
      complications by approaching them from the point of view of tissue damage caused by the use&#xD;
      of CPB. Therefore, we intend to investigate the relationship in more detail through&#xD;
      quantitative evaluation of DAMPs before and after CPB application and time after application,&#xD;
      and to seek ways to attenuate the degree of DAMPs according to CPB application in the future.&#xD;

      After standard anesthesia monitoring of the patient who is admitted to the operating room for&#xD;
      cardiac surgery, the anesthesiologist performed arterial cannulation on the radial artery&#xD;
      with small amount of local anesthetic (2% lidocaine 1ml) because unstable hemodynamics can be&#xD;
      expected during anesthesia induction. At this time, the blood is aspirated to remove air from&#xD;
      the conduit after cannulation, ans small amount of blood (1-2ml) is collected and placed in a&#xD;
      EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra acetic Acid di potassium) blood test bottle (Pre-ANE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia is performed by administering an intravenous anesthetic (propofol1-2mg/kg) and a&#xD;
      short-acting opioid analgesic, remifentanil (0.01-0.1mcg/kg/min). After that, anesthesia is&#xD;
      maintained using a neuromuscular blocker and an inhalation anesthetic (sevoflurane). The&#xD;
      anesthesia method is performed in the same way according to the &quot;cardiac anesthesia protocol&quot;&#xD;
      of the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After anesthesia, the activated clotting time (ACT) is measured to determine the patient's&#xD;
      basal clotting status before cardiopulmonary bypass is used. At this time, about 3 ml of&#xD;
      arterial blood sample is required, and additional 1-2 ml of blood is collected and stored in&#xD;
      an EDTA Bottle (Pre-CPB). After catheterization of artery and vein, when CPB is applied, ABGA&#xD;
      (Arterial blood gas analysis) is performed every 30 minutes to monitor the patient's&#xD;
      condition. At this time, the required blood volume is about 1ml, and additional 1-2ml of&#xD;
      blood is collected and stored in EDTA, and they are labeled with CPB-30min, CPB-60min,&#xD;
      CPB-90min, etc. When surgical correction is completed, CPB weaning is performed, and ACT and&#xD;
      ABGA are performed once more between CPB weaning and the end of anesthesia. At this time, an&#xD;
      additional 1-2 ml of arterial blood is collected and stored in an EDTA Bottle (Post-CPB).&#xD;
      When a patient admitted the intensive care unit after surgery, additional 1-2ml of blood is&#xD;
      collected and stored in the EDTA bottle (Post-OP) the next day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood collected by the above method is processed by centrifugation and low temperature&#xD;
      processing. After that, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and PMN (Polymorphonuclear) neutrophils&#xD;
      are isolated from plasma using QIAmp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown MD), and RNA&#xD;
      (ribonucleic acid) purification for getting cDNA (complementary DNA). Quantitative real time&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is used to investigate quantitative changes in DAMPs over&#xD;
      time through mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) and IL (interlukin)-6 gene expression.&#xD;
