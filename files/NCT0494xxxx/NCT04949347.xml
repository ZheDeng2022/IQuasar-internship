  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective, non-comparative study of 100 eyes of 100 consecutive glaucoma&#xD;
      patients who had undergone glaucoma drainage device implantation (Baerveldt shunt) during&#xD;
      January 2006 to December 2016. Glycerin-preserved, human-donor, corneoscleral tissue was used&#xD;
      as a patch graft to cover the tube portion of the GDD over the sclera. The patch graft&#xD;
      related complication was comparable to the previous reports using conventional sclera or&#xD;
      pericardium.&#xD;

      This retrospective, non-comparative study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology,&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. The medical&#xD;
      records of consecutive patients who had undergone glaucoma drainage device implantation&#xD;
      employing the fornix-based conjunctival flap technique and using a glycerin-preserved,&#xD;
      human-donor, corneoscleral graft. The procedures were carried out by, or under the&#xD;
      supervision of, one surgeon (NK) between January 2006 and December 2016 were reviewed. The&#xD;
      study protocol was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.&#xD;

    <description>Glaucoma drainage device implantation, a 350 mm2 Baerveldt (BG 101-350) GDD (Johnson and Johnson, Santa Ana, CA, USA) was performed using glycerin-preserved, human-donor, corneoscleral tissue ( the remaining from a heterologous, human-donor corneal button, obtained from the International Eye Bank of Thailand, after a clear corneal graft had been used for penetrating keratoplasty.) The tissue had been preserved in glycerin using the sterile technique and kept in a medical refrigerator for no longer than 6 months.</description>
