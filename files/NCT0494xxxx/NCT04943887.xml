    <textblock>
      Within-subject waitlist-control group design trial of eSupport health-coach moderated online&#xD;
      support group participation to address mental health needs in persons with multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (PwMS) from historically underrepresented groups (i.e., Black and Latinx patients).&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to see how well a new online eSupport Health Weekly Group&#xD;
      Sessions program addresses the needs and improves the mood of adults with MS. This study is&#xD;
      focusing on improving the online eSupport Weekly Group Session program for people with MS&#xD;
      while assessing the impact of the program, particularly for Black and Latinx individuals as&#xD;
      clinical research has often not included their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study is done remotely by computer, tablet, or smartphone with a web camera and&#xD;
      with a stable internet connection. Subjects will be enrolled into closed, private,&#xD;
      health-coach facilitated online support groups called eSupport Health Weekly Group Sessions.&#xD;
      These sessions are hosted on eSupport Health's proprietary Zoom-based secure HIPAA-compliant&#xD;
      telehealth platform. Each group is expected to have 10 participants and will meet weekly for&#xD;
      12 weeks. A licensed therapist (&quot;Study Coach&quot;) leads the group sessions. The company's Mutual&#xD;
      Respect &amp; Trust (MRT)-based coaching method is utilized.&#xD;
