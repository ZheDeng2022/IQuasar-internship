    <textblock>
      Treat to target (T2T) strategies have proved to be useful in several chronic disorders,&#xD;
      including Rheumatoid Arthritis. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), T2T strategy has been&#xD;
      proposed in order to control disease activity, improve health-related quality of life, and&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality. Remission would be the main target, but a low disease&#xD;
      activity state (LDAS) could be an acceptable alternative. However, due to SLE protean&#xD;
      manifestations, the operational definitions of both remission and LDAS are still in progress.&#xD;
      This clinical trial would like to assess the clinical value of T2T strategy in the treatment&#xD;
      of children with SLE, optimize the treatment of children with SLE, andimprove the prognosis.&#xD;

      This two-center study retrospectively analyzed the follow-up data of children with systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) in our center (the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical&#xD;
      University) and the Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, grouping the patients&#xD;
      into two observation groups-low disease activity status Group (LDAS group) and never reached&#xD;
      low disease activity group (Never LDAS group). We would analyze the risk factors of SLE that&#xD;
      patients cannot reach LDAS by comparing baseline data and treatment conditions of the two&#xD;
      groups. Meanwhile, we would evaluate the SLE clinical indicators, SLE disease activity, organ&#xD;
      damage, and disease remission state at the end of the follow-up of the LDAS group, in order&#xD;
      to assess the clinical value of T2T strategy in the treatment of children with SLE, optimize&#xD;
      the treatment of children with SLE, andimprove the prognosis.&#xD;
