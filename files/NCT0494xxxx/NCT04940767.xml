      Acne vulgaris is a common disease of both males and females, usually manifesting initially&#xD;
      during adolescence. The use of retinoic acid analogues such as adapalene, tazarotene and&#xD;
      isotretinoin are also commonly prescribed to treat inflammation; dysregulated sebum&#xD;

      concomitant use of both AMZEEQ® and oral isotretinoin compared to oral isotretinoin only use&#xD;
      and to explore sequence dosing of both products as part of a long-term management protocol&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a common disease of both males and females, usually manifesting initially&#xD;
      during adolescence. The primary pathologic events are initiated in the pilosebaceous units,&#xD;
      especially of sebaceous-gland-bearing areas of the face, chest, and back as a result of&#xD;
      increased androgen stimulation initiated at adrenarche or puberty. As a result of both&#xD;
      abnormal keratinization of the infra-infundibular portion of the pilosebaceous follicle and&#xD;
      increased sebum produced in the gland, a blockage of the duct results in the unapparent&#xD;
      clinical lesion of the microcomedone. Continued blockage, colonization of the follicle by&#xD;
      Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes), and generation of multiple chemoattractant and&#xD;
      proinflammatory moieties may result in non-inflammatory clinical lesions, comedones, and&#xD;
      inflammatory lesions: papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acne treatments vary widely and frequently involve therapy combination approaches to achieve&#xD;
      the objectives of initial disease control and long-term maintenance of effect. Antibiotics,&#xD;
      especially clindamycin, minocycline, and doxycycline, have been prescribed as acne treatments&#xD;
      for many years. These antibiotics effectively control the signs of inflammatory acne while&#xD;
      patients continue to use them. Equally, the use of retinoic acid analogues such as adapalene,&#xD;
      tazarotene and isotretinoin are also commonly prescribed to treat inflammation; dysregulated&#xD;
      sebum production and comedonal acne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMZEEQ® is a topical lipophilic foam containing 4% minocycline that was approved in the US&#xD;
      for the treatment of acne vulgaris in 2019 although minocycline containing products have been&#xD;
      available in the US since the early 1970s. Minocycline is a semi-synthetic, second-generation&#xD;
      tetracycline that imparts both a bacteriostatic and anti-inflammatory effect in the treatment&#xD;
      of inflammatory acne. In addition, AMZEEQ® has been previously shown in clinical studies to&#xD;
      positively impact comedonal acne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events relating to oral minocycline use include tissue depigmentation primarily&#xD;
      related to the ability of minocycline to complex with metals such as calcium and sequester&#xD;
      into a variety of tissues e.g. bone, teeth and skin; CNS effects affecting the vestibular&#xD;
      system e.g. dizziness, blurred vision and rare episodes of intracranial hypertension. Oral&#xD;
      minocycline has also been implicated in rare but serious reactions such as anaphylaxis,&#xD;
      erythema multiforme and DRESS syndrome. Interestingly, these findings do not appear to have&#xD;
      much applicability to topically applied minocycline (as AMZEEQ®), likely due to significantly&#xD;
      lower systemic exposure to minocycline when dosed by the topical route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin is a retinoic acid analogue (13-cis-retinoic acid) supplied as oral capsules.&#xD;
      and was approved in the US for the treatment of severe acne vulgaris in 1982 under the brand&#xD;
      name Accutane®. Isotretinoin is the only therapy that impacts on all of the major&#xD;
      aetiological factors implicated in acne. It achieves this by influencing cell-cycle&#xD;
      progression, cellular differentiation, cell survival and apoptosis which results in a&#xD;
      significant reduction in sebum production, influences comedogenesis, lowers surface and&#xD;
      ductal C. acnes and has anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although isotretinoin can ameliorate all four of the primary drivers of disease pathology,&#xD;
      resulting in impressive clinical outcomes for severe and/or recalcitrant patients, the safety&#xD;
      of isotretinoin continues to be a focal point for prescribers. As a teratogen, isotretinoin&#xD;
      impacts the function of Hox genes that disrupts genetic control of axial patterning during&#xD;
      embryo development. This can lead to developmental defects of the heart, spinal cord, palate,&#xD;
      mandible, and other skeletal and neurological disorders such as hydrocephalus, microcephaly,&#xD;
      and mental retardation. As such, careful monitoring of patients of both sexes via a risk&#xD;
      evaluation and mitigation program (REMS) such as iPledge is a prerequisite for the safe use&#xD;
      of the isotretinoin-containing products. Consequently, prescribers seek to discontinue oral&#xD;
      isotretinoin use when it is appropriate to do so and to introduce other products with the&#xD;
      goal of achieving a sustained long term clinical benefit for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of these two, well-characterized acne treatments with two separate&#xD;
      administration routes presents an intriguing, combined proposition of achieving rapid control&#xD;
      of disease coupled with long-term disease management possibilities. As such this study seeks&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concomitant use of both AMZEEQ® and oral isotretinoin&#xD;
      compared to oral isotretinoin only use and to explore sequence dosing of both products as&#xD;
      part of a long-term management protocol for acne vulgaris.&#xD;

             for at least 30 days following treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Is willing to minimize exposure of the treated skin to ultraviolet light (e.g. avoid&#xD;
