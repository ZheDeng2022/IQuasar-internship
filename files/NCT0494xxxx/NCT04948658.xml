      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Turner Syndrome, galactosemia, and premature ovarian insufficiency are all conditions that&#xD;
      may make it very hard or impossible for a person to become pregnant and have their own child.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about why this happens and if freezing ovarian tissue allows&#xD;
      for fertility preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out why females with certain conditions have can have premature ovarian insufficiency&#xD;
      (POI or early menopause) and trouble getting pregnant and if freezing the tissue from their&#xD;
      ovary will help them have their own child in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females aged 4-12 who have Turner Syndrome or galactosemia. Also, females aged 13 21 with&#xD;
      premature ovarian insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a physical exam and blood tests. Their body measurements may be taken.&#xD;
      These include weight, height, arm span, skin fold, and sitting height. They may fill out&#xD;
      surveys about their quality of life, body image, and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound. A probe will be placed on their&#xD;
      belly and will take pictures of the organs in the pelvis. They may have a transvaginal pelvic&#xD;
      ultrasound performed while asleep in the operating room if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have surgery to remove an ovary. The removed tissue will be frozen and&#xD;
      stored. The tissue will have to be stored for many years. NIH will pay to store the tissue&#xD;
      for 1 year. After that, participants will have to pay for storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A piece of the ovary (no more than 20%) will be used for research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Travel, lodging and meals for participants traveling greater than 50 miles will be reimbursed&#xD;
      based off the government rate. Local participants will not be reimbursed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a checkup 6 weeks after surgery one or more follow-up visits 6 18&#xD;
      months after surgery. They may have phone follow-up every 12 24 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last 30 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating ovarian tissue cryopreservation in female children with Turner&#xD;
      syndrome and galactosemia as well as post-menarcheal adolescents with recent premature&#xD;
      ovarian insufficiency. Given the great importance of fertility to patients and their parents&#xD;
      and the significant negative quality of life effects of infertility, there is strong interest&#xD;
      in ovarian tissue cryopreservation in early childhood in individuals affected by these&#xD;
      conditions. The benefits of gonadal tissue cryopreservation in these conditions is less well&#xD;
      understood than in those receiving gonadotoxic therapy with normal gonadal function. This&#xD;
      protocol has the potential to allow patients to have future biologic children through the&#xD;
      preservation of ovarian tissue before it is fully depleted of follicles.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prepubertal females with Turner Syndrome and galactosemia aged 4 years to 12 years who&#xD;
             have not yet demonstrated signs of puberty whose families seek to store ovarian tissue&#xD;
             for possible future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adolescent females up to age 21 years old, who have undergone menarche and are&#xD;
             subsequently diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency and their last menstrual&#xD;
             period occurred w ithin 2 years of presentation. Diagnosis of POI is based on 2&#xD;
             elevated FSH concentrations obtained over 1 month apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;

             care for the underlying condition and will not undergo oophorectomy for ovarian tissue&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Females whose underlying medical condition significantly increases their risk of&#xD;
