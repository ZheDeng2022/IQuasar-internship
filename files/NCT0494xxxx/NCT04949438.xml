  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare AZD4831 pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters between participants with&#xD;
      severe renal impairment and matched healthy volunteers following a single dose&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive a single oral dose of AZD4831 under fasted conditions and will&#xD;
      be involved in the study approximately 2 weeks after dosing and up to approximately 38 days&#xD;
      from screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10 participants will be enrolled into each of the 2 cohorts parallelly and&#xD;
      receive the study intervention to achieve 8 evaluable participants in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 10 participants with severe renal impairment (Estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
           rate [eGFR] of ≥15 to &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m^2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 10 matched healthy volunteers with normal renal function (eGFR of ≥90&#xD;
           mL/min/1.73m^2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of the following study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period (21 days): participants will be screened for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period (3 days): participants will be admitted to the study centre in the&#xD;
           evening of (Day -1) the day before administration of a single oral dose of AZD4831 (Day&#xD;
           1), and will be discharged after at least 24 h post-dose (Day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up period (13±2 days): participants will attend 5 visits at the study centre for&#xD;
           PK sampling and safety assessments on Days 3, 5, 8, 11 and 15.&#xD;
