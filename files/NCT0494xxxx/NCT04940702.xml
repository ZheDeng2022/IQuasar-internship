      Sarcopenia can occur or increase due to sedentary lifestyles, physical inactivity or chronic&#xD;
      endocrine and inflammatory disorders, this pathology is much more frequent in older people&#xD;
      due to the added risk factors and the fact that the physiological ageing process generates a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory situation and an alteration in the synthesis of hormones and myokines, it&#xD;
      has been observed that the loss of strength causes functional deterioration and a significant&#xD;
      increase in the person's dependence, reduces their functional status and quality of life, and&#xD;
      may increase the risk of falls, thereby increasing mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood flow restriction (BRR) and focal vibration (FV), which aim to achieve muscular&#xD;
      hypertrophy without the need to use high loads or intensities, VF or BFR brings improvements&#xD;
      to elderly people with sarcopnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hipotesis of this study is the addition of BFR or VF techniques to training results in&#xD;
      greater improvements in circulating myokine concentrations and functional tests than not&#xD;
      adding it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the objective to determinate whether biochemical markers in serology are able&#xD;
      to correlate with improvements in strength, also to study whether the plasma levels of&#xD;
      apelin, myomyostatin and lL6 are modified with entraining, to determine whether plasma levels&#xD;
      of apelin, myomyostatin and lL6 are further increased by training associated with VF and/or&#xD;
      BFR and evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions in improving functional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of the study is a single-blind, randomised, clinical trial will be conducted.&#xD;
      The study population is people over 65 years of age, sedentary, with functional independence&#xD;
      and with a state of health that allows them to carry out physical activity. The study is&#xD;
      planned as a pilot study and will consist of 30 subjects distributed in: 10 people in the&#xD;
      control group (CG), 10 in the experimental vibration group (GE-V) and 10 in the experimental&#xD;
      group with restriction (GE-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables to be measured are anthropometric variables, biochemical markers, variables of&#xD;
      neuromuscular function, information about fragility and independence, an functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be a training in the control group, the FV and BFR groups will be 3&#xD;
      times a week, with a warm-up, a main block with aerobic work, strength work and training and&#xD;
      coordination work, and finally a return to calm, in the experimental groups the strength work&#xD;
      will be carried out with these instruments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The normal ageing process is characterised by a progressive loss of muscle mass and function,&#xD;
      this physiological process is known as sarcopenia. As a result of this loss of muscle mass&#xD;
      and reduced efficiency of muscle enzymes, a reduction in overall strength and isometric&#xD;
      strength in particular is observed. Secondarily, sarcopenia can occur or increase due to&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyles, physical inactivity or chronic endocrine and inflammatory disorders.&#xD;
      This pathology is much more frequent in older people due to the added risk factors and the&#xD;
      fact that the physiological ageing process generates a pro-inflammatory situation and an&#xD;
      alteration in the synthesis of hormones and myokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different epidemiological studies show that maximum isometric voluntary contraction is&#xD;
      usually maintained up to 45 years of age but its effectiveness decreases with age (25% at 65&#xD;
      years of age and 35% at 70 years of age). When this loss of strength or muscle mass occurs in&#xD;
      the elderly with a baseline state of greater frailty or dependence, the clinical importance&#xD;
      of this reduction in strength and muscle mass is much more relevant. It has been observed&#xD;
      that the loss of strength causes functional deterioration and a significant increase in the&#xD;
      person's dependence, reduces their functional status and quality of life, and may increase&#xD;
      the risk of falls, thereby increasing mortality. For example, when hospital admissions occur,&#xD;
      muscle mass decreases rapidly and in patients with femur fractures and sarcopenia it has been&#xD;
      observed that between fracture and hospital discharge (10 days) the Barthel index decreases&#xD;
      between 54.7% and 59.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There does not seem to be a clear consensus on the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia.&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters such as Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (SMMI) (≤8.87 for men and ≤6.42&#xD;
      for women), functional tests such as gait speed (≤0.8 metres/second) or grip strength (&lt;30 or&#xD;
      20 kg for men and women respectively) are some of the most commonly used parameters in the&#xD;
      literature for both diagnosis and monitoring of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To a lesser extent, muscle cross-sectional area or contractile properties of muscle tissue&#xD;
      could also be related to this loss of strength. More recently, and with the aim of confirming&#xD;
      both the diagnosis and monitoring of sarcopenia, different biochemical markers have been&#xD;
      proposed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the treatment of sarcopenia, although there are pharmacological approaches to&#xD;
      increase or maintain strength and muscle mass, physical activity and nutrition remain the&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot;. Decreased physical activity level is a major aggravator of sarcopenia and&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyles have been shown to result in accelerated loss of muscle mass, strength&#xD;
      and functional capacity. Therefore, the American College of Sports Medicine, as well as&#xD;
      recent research, shows that strength work at moderate to high load intensity can stimulate&#xD;
      bone and muscle metabolism and improve overall strength, gait speed, quality of life, and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of falls and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the benefit of training at these loads, not all older people are able to perform&#xD;
      these activities. This is due to their bone or general fragility, as well as the mechanical&#xD;
      stress that this type of exercise produces in their joints or sedentary lifestyles. For these&#xD;
      reasons, different types of training have emerged in rehabilitation medicine, such as blood&#xD;
      flow restriction (BRR) and focal vibration (FV), which aim to achieve muscular hypertrophy&#xD;
      without the need to use high loads or intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BFR is training in which exercise is performed with minimal or no resistance while a pressure&#xD;
      cuff occludes the proximal part of the limb. This situation results in partial restriction of&#xD;
      arterial flow and more significantly venous flow in the muscles. Given the light or no load&#xD;
      applied and the muscle hypertrophy obtained, the BFR is an effective training tool. The BFR&#xD;
      avoids the high levels of joint stress and cardiovascular risks associated with high-load&#xD;
      training. In the field of sports, the effects of BFR have been extensively studied and,&#xD;
      although to a lesser extent, benefits have also been studied in the improvement of physical&#xD;
      fitness and rehabilitation of older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of general or focused vibration is not new in the rehabilitation or de-training&#xD;
      field. Vibration is intended to stimulate neuromuscular uses to produce involuntary and&#xD;
      additional contractions of muscle tissue, indirectly causing an increase in strength or&#xD;
      muscle mass, improving the prevention of falls. This type of equipment has been used both in&#xD;
      athletes and in patients with chronic diseases or in intensive care units. There are studies&#xD;
      that use vibration in critically ill patients as a safe and feasible intervention for&#xD;
      dependent patients. One of the advantages of FV is that it can be used for both unloading and&#xD;
      loading, which allows a wide range of adaptation to each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the observed efficacy of VF and BFR, evidence is scarce and no studies have been&#xD;
      found to demonstrate that these devices improve the benefits of a multicomponent programme in&#xD;
      elderly people with sarcopenia. Noeither have data been located on whether changes in&#xD;
      biochemical markers and viscoelastic parameters are sufficiently accurate in observing&#xD;
      increases in strength and improvements in muscle tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, the present investigation for objectify to determine whether the use&#xD;
      of VF or BFR brings improvements to elderly people with sarcopnoea. As well as, if the&#xD;
      biochemical and viscoelastic markers can objectify the improvements obtained by means of the&#xD;
      multicomponent exercise (with and without the use of BFR and VF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hipotesis of this study is the addition of BFR or VF techniques to training results in&#xD;
      greater improvements in circulating myokine concentrations and functional tests than not&#xD;
      adding it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the objective to determinate whether biochemical markers in serology are able&#xD;
      to correlate with improvements in strength, also to study whether the plasma levels of&#xD;
      apelin, myomyostatin and lL6 are modified with entraining, to determine whether plasma levels&#xD;
      of apelin, myomyostatin and lL6 are further increased by training associated with VF and/or&#xD;
      BFR and evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions in improving functional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of the study is a single-blind, randomised, clinical trial will be conducted.&#xD;
      Pilot study pre and post intervention with control group. Which will follow the CONSORT guide&#xD;
      for the implementation of this study and the TIDier guide for the implementation of the&#xD;
