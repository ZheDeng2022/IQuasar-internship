    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody&#xD;
      response in terms of seroconversion rate 28 days after vaccine administration of one dose of&#xD;
      yellow fever vaccine (vYF) compared to the antibody response after one dose of the YF-VAX&#xD;
      control vaccine in yellow fever naïve participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response to yellow fever in both vaccine groups before and after&#xD;
           vYF or YF-VAX administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of vYF vaccine in comparison to the safety profile of the&#xD;
           control YF-VAX.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the biosafety profile of vYF in comparison to the biosafety profile of the&#xD;
           control YF-VAX.&#xD;
