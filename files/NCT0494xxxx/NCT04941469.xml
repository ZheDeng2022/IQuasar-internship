  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As off-the-counter foot orthoses are readily available and have an economic advantage, they&#xD;
      are increasingly being used by healthcare professionals to treat mechanical foot pains in&#xD;
      place of custom foot orthosis. However, there is a lack of available evidence to determine if&#xD;
      a plain off-the-counter foot orthosis that aims to contours to the foot or a specifically&#xD;
      optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis utilizing the type of orthotic design proposed by&#xD;
      Abbasian and Pomeroy is more effective in the management of mechanical foot pains in the&#xD;
      Subtle Cavus foot type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposal seeks to fill the gap in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effectiveness of specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis&#xD;
      designed for the Subtle Cavus foot type in improving patient reported outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with mechanical foot pains when compared to plain off-the-counter foot orthosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in pain and functional scores reported by patients between&#xD;
      specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis and plain off-the-counter foot orthosis&#xD;
      in patients with mechanical foot pains at four, eight and twelve weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the Subtle Cavus foot refers to the flexible idiopathic forefoot-driven Pes&#xD;
      Cavus that can be clinically recognised with a positive &quot;Peek a Boo&quot; sign, inverted hindfoot&#xD;
      position in weight bearing stance and Positive Coleman Block Test as reported by Manoli and&#xD;
      Graham in 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, for our study, mechanical foot pains are limited to clinically diagnosed Plantar&#xD;
      Fasciitis, Achilles Tendinopathy, Peroneal Strain or Metatarsalgia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plantar Fasciitis is clinically diagnosed using the following history and physical&#xD;
      examination findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plantar medial heel pain /or pain along the plantar fascia: most noticeable with initial&#xD;
           steps after a period of inactivity but also worse following prolonged weight bearing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heel pain /or pain along the plantar fascia precipitated by a recent increase in&#xD;
           weightbearing activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain with palpation of the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia /or along the band&#xD;
           of plantar fascia structure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achilles Tendinopathy is clinically diagnosed using the following history and physical&#xD;
      examination findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported localized pain and perceived stiffness in the Achilles tendon following a&#xD;
           period of inactivity (eg, sleep, prolonged sitting) lessen with an acute bout of&#xD;
           activity and may increase after the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms are frequently accompanied by Achilles tendon tenderness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain located 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion that began gradually&#xD;
           and pain with palpation of the midportion of the tendon to diagnose midportion Achilles&#xD;
           tendinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported pain that is aggravated by activity and stiffness that is associated with&#xD;
           prolonged periods of rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain and tenderness with palpation within the distal 2 cm of the Achilles tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Redness and swelling over area of Achilles Tendon insertion over posterior heel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peroneal Strain is clinically diagnosed using the following history and physical examination&#xD;
      findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain and swelling posterior to the lateral malleolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain with active eversion and dorsiflexion against resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  May have a history of chronic lateral ankle pain and instability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain and tenderness with palpation along the course of the peroneal tendons&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metatarsalgia is clinically diagnosed using the following history and physical examination&#xD;
      findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported pain during the propulsive phase of gait. The pain is localized underneath&#xD;
           the prominent metatarsal heads&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The plantar soft tissue can be swollen and inflamed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of hyperkeratosis over tender areas may be present&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain and tenderness with palpation of plantar metatarsophalangeal joints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effectiveness of specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis&#xD;
      designed for the Subtle Cavus foot type in improving patient reported outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with mechanical foot pains pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in pain and functional scores reported by patients after introduction&#xD;
      of specifically optimized off-the counter foot orthosis pre- and post-intervention at initial&#xD;
      to four, initial to eight and initial to twelve weeks of intervention.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial designed to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis versus plain off-the-counter foot&#xD;
      orthosis in managing mechanical foot pains in the Subtle Cavus foot type. (See Figure 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects recruited will be randomly assigned to either the plain off-the-counter foot&#xD;
           orthosis group (Control Group) or the specifically optimized off-the-counter foot&#xD;
           orthosis group (Intervention Group) based on a pre-specified randomization list during&#xD;
           the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization was performed using the Randomized Permuted Block Randomization method&#xD;
           with blocks of six.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For participants with bilateral mechanical foot pains, the more symptomatic side will be&#xD;
           used as the reference for collection of participants reported outcome measures&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be an intervention period of 12 weeks, which is a common therapy window for&#xD;
           the associated symptoms of mechanical foot pains.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All other standard of care Podiatry management will be implemented for all subjects in&#xD;
           the two groups throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Podiatry management with stretching exercise regime refers to the following&#xD;
           protocols with official department stretching and strengthening brochure provided for&#xD;
           all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towel Stretch (To be introduced at Study Visit 1 (Week 0)):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sit down and extend both legs Pass a towel around the top of your foot Slowly pull the towel&#xD;
      towards your body Hold each stretch for a period of 20 seconds Switch sides and repeat Repeat&#xD;
      the stretch 10 times on both sides for each set Perform 2 sets a day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrocnemius Stretch (To be introduced at Study Visit 2 (Week 4)):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place both hands on a wall and stand an arm's length away from it Place one foot behind the&#xD;
      other Bend your front knee Ensure your back knee and back are straight Ensure both heels are&#xD;
      flat on the floor Do not rotate your hips Ensure both feet are parallel Hold each stretch for&#xD;
      a period of 20 seconds Switch legs and repeat Repeat the stretch 10 times on both sides for&#xD;
      each set Perform 2 sets a day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soleus Stretch (To be introduced at Study Visit 2 (Week 4)):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place both hands on a wall and stand an arm's length away from it Place one foot behind the&#xD;
      other Bend both knees Keep both heels flat on the floor Ensure your back is straight Do not&#xD;
      rotate your hips Ensure both feet are parallel Hold each stretch for a period of 20 seconds&#xD;
      Switch legs and repeat Repeat the stretch 10 times on both sides for each set Perform 2 sets&#xD;
      a day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double Leg Tip Toe (To be introduced at Study Visit 3 (Week 8)):&#xD;
&#xD;
      With both knees straight, go up on tiptoes on both feet (A) Gently lower both heels to the&#xD;
      ground (B) Repeat 10 times Perform 2 sets a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Podiatry management for foot orthosis troubleshooting refers to: Bilateral&#xD;
           Standard Arch Fill Reduction of foot orthoses if study participant complains of&#xD;
           discomfort / irritation from use of foot orthosis over the arches of the feet for both&#xD;
           plain off-the-counter foot orthosis or specifically optimised off-the-counter foot&#xD;
           orthosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects' pain and functional impairment perception will be measured pre- and&#xD;
           post-intervention at Study Visit 1 (Week 0), Study Visit 2 (Week 4), Study Visit 3 (Week&#xD;
           8) and the Study Visit 4 (Week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked regarding compliance towards the use of the foot&#xD;
           orthosis fitted and other standard podiatry management that has been started and Patient&#xD;
           Satisfaction Ratings with Podiatry Treatment introduced using a verbal compliance&#xD;
           ratings form administered by the investigators during Study Visit 2 (Week 4), Study&#xD;
           Visit 3 (Week 8) and Study Visit 4 (Week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome measures of the specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis group will&#xD;
           be compared against the plain off-the-counter foot orthosis group to achieve the primary&#xD;
           aim of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre and post intervention within group comparison of outcome measures will be conducted&#xD;
           for both groups independently to achieve the secondary aim of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Foot Function Index (FFI) total score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FFI is a self-reported measure of pain, function, and activity level associated with&#xD;
           foot dysfunction consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales. The scores range from&#xD;
           0 to 10, with the higher scores indicating more disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FFI has been validated and is recommended as a reliable measurement scale for use in&#xD;
           foot orthotic interventions study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation of the study device efficacy will be conducted with the main outcome&#xD;
           measure, the FFI, before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FFI sub-scale scores in the domain of pain, disability and activity limitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subscales of the FFI will be analysed separately as secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with the end-points &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain&#xD;
           possible&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is a reliable and valid measure of self-reported pain intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS is administered before and after intervention to evaluate acute pain levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Podiatry outpatient clinic at Foot Care and Limb Design Centre, Tan Tock Seng Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will be drawn from the patients referred to Podiatry Department, Foot Care&#xD;
      and Limb Design Centre, Tan Tock Seng Hospital for Biomechanics Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients with clinically diagnosed mechanical foot pains limited to Plantar&#xD;
           Fasciitis, Achilles Tendinopathy, Peroneal Strain or Metatarsalgia will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For participants with bilateral mechanical foot pains, the more symptomatic side will be&#xD;
           used as the reference for collection of participants reported outcome measures&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no subject restriction based on the race of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Podiatry clinical assessments and a full biomechanical assessment will be performed&#xD;
      to determine eligibility of potential study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical diagnoses of mechanical foot pains limited to Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles&#xD;
           Tendinopathy, Peroneal Strain or Metatarsalgia will be done through Physical / Clinical&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For participants with bilateral mechanical foot pains, the more symptomatic side will be&#xD;
           used as the reference for collection of participants reported outcome measures&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subtle cavus foot type will be identified through a full biomechanical assessment&#xD;
           including the &quot;Peek a boo&quot; sign and the Coleman Block Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inclusion and Exclusion criteria will be checked against when the above two conditions&#xD;
           are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On top of outcome measure questionnaires that will be administered, Study team will retrieve&#xD;
      data from participant's medical records including basic demographics, standard podiatry&#xD;
      assessments results and management measures and outcomes as well. These data will be recorded&#xD;
      into the study database document provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will not be any incidental findings arising in this research.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Standard Deviation in each group = 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required Sample size is estimated to be at least 16 or more in each group. Hence, target at&#xD;
      least 20 in each group taking into consideration drop-out and lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking a 9mm difference in 100mm VAS pain score as clinically significant / minimal important&#xD;
      difference:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alpha error = 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;

      Potential Benefits (direct as well as indirect) to research participants and to the society:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participant may reasonably expect to benefit from the trial's specifically optimized&#xD;
      off-the-counter foot orthosis or plain off-the-counter foot orthosis in the following way:&#xD;
      The study device providing optimal biomechanical control leading to reduce stress over&#xD;
      injured structures of the feet which typically translate to symptoms or pain reduction for&#xD;
      the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect shorter-term Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide evidence for or against the use of specifically optimized&#xD;
      off-the-counter foot orthosis in the management of mechanical foot pains in the Subtle Cavus&#xD;
      foot type. The findings of this study will help to build up knowledge in foot orthotic&#xD;
      therapy delivery. If specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis is proven more&#xD;
      effective than plain off-the-counter foot orthosis, this can provide evidence to support the&#xD;
      use of assessment directed foot orthosis prescription as in the case of utilising the Coleman&#xD;
      Block Test to differentiate between flexible forefoot-driven Subtle Cavus foot type from a&#xD;
      hindfoot driven Rigid Pes Cavus foot type compared to a &quot;generic&quot; foot orthosis that simply&#xD;
      contours to the arch of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the optimisations suggested are specific, this will help practitioners to confidently&#xD;
      apply wedging techniques and perform standard arch fill reduction that can be consistently&#xD;
      replicated. Furthermore, incidences of foot orthosis that are optimized wrongly will be&#xD;
      reduced with standardized optimizations leading to better standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis which is &quot;tailored&quot; to the presenting&#xD;
      Subtle Cavus foot type is cheaper than current custom solutions. If found to be effective&#xD;
      when compared to a generic plain off-the counter foot orthosis, further research can be&#xD;
      conducted to determine if a specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis is as&#xD;
      effective and non-inferior to a custom foot orthosis with the same specifications. As&#xD;
      optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis can be readily fitted, foot orthotic therapy can be&#xD;
      instituted without any delay. Improvement in treatment outcomes can be expected as patients&#xD;
      will receive timely foot orthotic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis is as effective and non-inferior to a&#xD;
      custom foot orthosis with the same specifications. It can provide an easily available,&#xD;
      cost-effective foot orthosis for patients as custom foot orthosis are at least three times&#xD;
      the cost of a specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis and require at least two&#xD;
      weeks for such a custom solution to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this project has the potential to make podiatry care delivery for patients with&#xD;
      painful Subtle Cavus foot type better, safer, faster and cheaper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect longer-term benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, foot orthosis construction for diabetic foot offloading in ulcer prevention is&#xD;
      also based on the principle of increasing contact area to reduce pressure at a particular&#xD;
      point. The findings of this study can potentially help to understand how offloading of the&#xD;
      diabetic foot in ulcer prevention can be relooked for the Subtle Cavus foot type. If&#xD;
      specifically optimized off-the-counter foot orthosis is proven to be more effective than&#xD;
      plain off-the-counter foot orthosis in managing mechanical foot pains in the Subtle Cavus&#xD;
      foot type, this can provide evidence to further investigate if specifically optimised&#xD;
      off-the-counter foot orthosis can perform better than a device that simply contours to the&#xD;
      foot in diabetic offloading for ulcer prevention. A cheaper and faster &quot;tailored&quot; solution&#xD;
      like specifically optimised off-the-counter foot orthosis can benefit patient care in the&#xD;
      long run in offloading the diabetic foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With emerging technology such as data analytics and machine learning, this project may&#xD;
      potentially lay the foundation to spur further research in the area of feet type recognition&#xD;
      for the Subtle Cavus foot type and the Pes Planus foot type using visual analytics&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring plan, i.e. frequency of review (e.g. daily, weekly, quarterly) and type of&#xD;
      data (e.g. adverse events/serious adverse events) will be monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of review: Monthly at every study visit on Study visit 1, Study visit 2, Study&#xD;
      visit 3 and the Final Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events or Serious adverse events will be monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard physical examination of the feet will be conducted at every study visit on Study&#xD;
      visit 1, Study visit 2, Study visit 3 and the Final Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of anticipated events including character and expected incidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study participant complaining of discomfort / irritation from use of foot orthosis over&#xD;
           plantar aspect of the feet (both conventional custom foot orthosis or specifically&#xD;
           optimised off-the-counter foot orthosis) Such incidences can happen and are expected in&#xD;
           routine and standard foot orthotic therapy in about 30% of users based on PI's clinical&#xD;
           experience. It is also expected that some people might need longer period of time to get&#xD;
           used to foot orthotic therapy. Simple trouble shooting of foot orthosis can resolve the&#xD;
           complaint most of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study participant complaining of intolerance to foot orthosis use and are not able to&#xD;
           continue wearing the device even after simple trouble shooting of foot orthosis has been&#xD;
           provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such incidence can happen and are expected in routine and standard foot orthotic therapy in&#xD;
      about less than 5% of users based on PI's clinical experience. Study participant will be&#xD;
      advised to stop foot orthotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3/4. Rarely, the use of foot orthosis can cause more mechanical pains or create friction&#xD;
      between the device and the sole of the feet resulting in blister formation. Symptoms of such&#xD;
      occurrences include: increased pain when using the device but has no issues when not using&#xD;
      the device, redness over the arch area or blister formation. If participants have any of&#xD;
      these symptoms, they will be advised to stop the use of the device immediately and to call&#xD;
      the Podiatrist or principal investigator at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for grading the seriousness of events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Discomfort / Irritation from foot orthosis use&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intolerance to foot orthosis use&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Friction between foot orthosis and plantar sole of foot resulting in rubbing and redness&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Friction between foot orthosis and plantar sole of foot resulting in blister formation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both 1 and 2 can be considered expected incidences in standard foot orthotic therapy and does&#xD;
      not amount to an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both 3 and 4 can be considered adverse events not amounting to serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for assessing the causal relationship of events to the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both 1 and 2, standard simple troubleshooting of foot orthosis will be rendered to assess&#xD;
      for causal relationship. If discomfort / irritation / intolerance is resolved, there is a&#xD;
      possible causal relationship between events 1 and 2 to the study device being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 3 and 4, study participant will be advised to stop the use of the study device until&#xD;
      redness or blister has resolved prior to restarting foot orthotic therapy again (with simple&#xD;
      trouble shooting of foot orthosis rendered). If redness or blister formation is resolved,&#xD;
      there is a possible causal relationship between events 3 or 4 to the study device being&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring will be done in accordance with ICH GCP by the PI on a quarterly basis to&#xD;
      ensure data integrity is assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Route of dissemination of any data and safety information to the study sites, as well as the&#xD;
      person/team responsible for doing so:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PI will conduct monthly face-to-face ad-hoc meetings to discuss and update data and safety&#xD;
      information with the study team.&#xD;
