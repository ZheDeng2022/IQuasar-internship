  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy, safety and mechanistic&#xD;
      underpinnings of a repeated dosing ketamine infusion paradigm compared to placebo in&#xD;
      individuals with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of participants in each arm will undergo baseline and post-treatment PET and fMRI&#xD;
      scans, to examine whether changes in synaptic density and reorganization of functional&#xD;
      networks underlie ketamine's putative antidepressant effects in PD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of ketamine for the treatment of depression in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD), in a parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial (RCT). Imaging will be used to examine the mechanistic effects of ketamine treatment.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will use positron emission tomography (PET) to measure&#xD;
      synaptic density and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure functional&#xD;
      connectivity. The investigators hypothesize that a course of ketamine treatment will result&#xD;
      in a significant reduction in depression severity compared to placebo. Mechanistically,&#xD;
      ketamine will result in a reorganization of functional networks and an increase in synaptic&#xD;
      density.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of depression severity post-treatment will be compared between groups using a linear mixed model with group (ketamine, placebo) included as a between-subjects factor and time (baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3) included as a within-subjects factor. The scale used to measure depression severity is called The Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60, higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female ages 40-70 years, inclusive&#xD;

             Yahr Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meet criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) as determined by the Structured&#xD;
             Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-575), and at least 15 on the MADRS, which has shown&#xD;
             maximum discrimination between depressed and non-depressed PD patients.&#xD;
