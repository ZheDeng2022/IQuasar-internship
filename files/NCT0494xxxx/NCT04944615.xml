    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the treatment of Chronic total occlusion (CTO) disease. Whether&#xD;
      Intravascular Ultrasonography (IVUS) guiding the implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES)&#xD;
      will provide better long-term clinical outcomes compared with conventional angiography&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, two-arm, 1:1 randomized controlled,&#xD;
      well-designed clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the sample size calculation, a total of 782 patients with primary CTO lesions&#xD;
      were required to participate in the study after the guide wire successfully passed through&#xD;
      the lesion (defined as: angiographic indication that the guide wire successfully passed&#xD;
      through the CTO lesion and reached the distal true lumen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at no more than 15 research centers. With competitive enrolment,&#xD;
      a maximum of 150 patients can be enrolled at each center or until the study is completed,&#xD;
      whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that each center enroll at least 10 patients.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were enrolled when the guide wire successfully passed through the CTO lesion (defined as: the guide wire successfully passed through the CTO lesion and reached the distal true lumen as confirmed by angiography).&#xD;
Once patients have signed the informed consent form and met all clinical and angiographic inclusion criteria and did not meet all clinical and angiographic exclusion criteria, and the guide wire has successfully passed the CTO lesion, they may be considered for participation in the study and randomized.&#xD;
The random grouping arrangement is computer generated using a quasi-random number generator.&#xD;
All randomized subjects will be assigned a unique identification number. Randomized replacement blocks will be used to ensure that the distribution of treatment within each layer is approximately balanced.&#xD;
The study also used the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Internet Response System (IWRS) to assign subjects to the study device treatment group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The patient will choose the appropriate length and diameter of the stent to be implanted by visual estimation. All commercially available drug-eluting stents (except first-generation DES, such as Taxus, Excel, Partner, Firebird, etc.) can be used. DES with high quality clinical evidence is strongly recommended. The type, diameter, and length of the stent are determined by the surgeon. The stent length should be selected to ensure complete coverage of the CTO lesion. If dissection is present, additional stents are implanted. Repeat angiograms were performed immediately after surgery in the same view as before surgery.</description>
