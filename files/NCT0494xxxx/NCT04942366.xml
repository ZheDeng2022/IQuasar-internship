  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT is aimed towards determining the effectiveness of exercises based intervention&#xD;
      strategy involving high intensity interval training exercises in improving serum testosterone&#xD;
      level, body fat composition and physical activity in hopes to provide a definitive exercise&#xD;
      regime for the ever common symptoms of pcos. It will be based on the theory that exercise&#xD;
      helps in decreasing testosterone level that in turn decrease high androgen levels in the&#xD;
      body, exercise further decreases body fat composition (obesity is a common cause or&#xD;
      manifestation of pcos).&#xD;

      High intensity interval training will be performed over the course of 12 weeks and will be&#xD;
      compared with the group performing strength training. Baseline assessments will be done&#xD;
      before the start of the first session and post-test assessment will be done after the last&#xD;
      session of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Envelope method is used for the purpose of randomization. 50 envelopes having a title of&#xD;
      group A and group B will be made and divided into two (25 in each group). Mutually exclusive&#xD;
      technique will be used and the envelope once picked will not be replaced within the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated by using a previous study conducted in 2015 titled as, 'Effects of&#xD;
      High Intensity Interval Training and Strength Training on Metabolic, Cardiovascular and&#xD;
      Hormonal Outcomes in Women with Poly cystic Ovary Syndrome: A Pilot Study' by taking a&#xD;
      confidence interval CI of 95%, power of test 80%, standard deviation of 6.3 and mean&#xD;
      difference of 5.2, a sample size of 50 is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the data MedCalc software version 19.0.5. will be used. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be performed for the purpose of demographic information and this data will be&#xD;
      presented in terms of frequency and percentage. Skewness and Kurtosis will be used in order&#xD;
      to determine the normality of data. If the data is normally distributed, then for within the&#xD;
      group analysis dependent T test will be performed. However, in case the data is not normally&#xD;
      distributed Wilcoxon Sign Rank test will be performed. Independent T test will be performed&#xD;
      for the comparison between the two groups.&#xD;
