      The present study aims to determine the clinical predictivity value of blood AnxA1 levels in&#xD;
      patients with mild and severe/critical pneumonia induced by COVID-19 and to reveal the&#xD;
      alterations of blood AnxA1 levels in patients with pneumonia compared to the control&#xD;
      group.The present study is a prospective case-control study, and the required ethics approval&#xD;
      was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Pamukkale University (Numbered:&#xD;
      E-60116787-020-15062). The study was conducted at Ankara Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      between 10.02.2021 and 15.03.2021. All procedures will carried out on patients were in&#xD;
      compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.Study groups were established according to the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients whose diagnoses were clinically confirmed as&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines using a positive&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test will be included in the study&#xD;
      (15). Individuals will be grouped in the moderate COVID-19 disease group (N=42),&#xD;
      severe/critical COVID-19 disease group (N=32), and the healthy control group (N=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy group will be included subjects who had no history or diagnosis of any disease, no&#xD;
      infection history within last two weeks, no history of any particular medication, who were&#xD;
      admitted to emergency department (ED) with complaints other than infectious issues, and who&#xD;
      gave their written consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood samples that will be taken when the patients were admitted to ED were withdrawn&#xD;
      into a dry test tube that did not contain anti-coagulant and were then centrifugated for 10&#xD;
      minutes at 4000 rpm. Serum samples will be obtained from centrifugation were collected for&#xD;
      laboratory analysis. Serum AnxA1 levels were analyzed using a commercially available AnxA1&#xD;
      ELISA Kit (Elabscience, E-EL-H5512, USA), per the manufacturer's protocol.&#xD;
