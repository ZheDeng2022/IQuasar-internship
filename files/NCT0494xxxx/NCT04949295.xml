  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We clinically observed that some hemodialysis patients had corneal epithelial dryness,&#xD;
      shedding, edema, and persistent epithelial nonunion after ocular surgery, which seriously&#xD;
      affected the effect of surgery, and it is necessary to study the ocular surface&#xD;
      characteristics of hemodialysis patients. In this study, we examined the ocular surface and&#xD;
      analyzed and investigated the characteristics of the ocular surface in hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      to provide a basis for ocular surface intervention or treatment in hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      before ocular surgery in clinical practice.&#xD;

      This study is a clinical case-control study. A total of 36 hemodialysis patients and 36&#xD;
      normal subjects were randomly selected from the Nephrology Department of the First Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Jinan University .All the subjects in the hemodialysis group (n = 36, 72 eyes)&#xD;
      and the normal group (n = 36, 72 eyes) were investigated with the OSDI scale, and then&#xD;
      bilateral ocular surface examinations were performed with Keratograph5M eye surface&#xD;
      comprehensive analyzer. Non-invasive tear meniscus height (NITMH), first tear film break-up&#xD;
      time (FTBUT), average tear film break-up time (ATBUT), dry eye severity grade, tear film&#xD;
      lipid layer analysis (distribution and color), tear film lipid layer thickness grade,&#xD;
      meibomian gland opening blocking site, meibomian gland opening blocking analysis, meibomian&#xD;
      gland opening secretion oil character score, eye redness index analysis (conjunctiva, ciliary&#xD;
      shape), and meibomian gland absence area score were recorded.&#xD;
