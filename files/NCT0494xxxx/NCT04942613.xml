      The aims of this study are to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a multicomponent&#xD;
      telerehabilitation program for medically complex older Veterans and to preliminarily assess&#xD;
      participant outcomes (physical activity, physical function, quality of life, loneliness) to&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      multicomponent telerehabilitation program and to preliminarily assess participant outcomes.&#xD;
      The multicomponent program/intervention consists of 3 core components: 1) high-intensity&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions, 2) biobehavioral interventions, and 3) social support. The&#xD;
      delivery of the program is supported by various technologies allowing for synchronous and&#xD;
      asynchronous care and monitoring. Synchronous telerehabilitation will occur individually and&#xD;
      in virtual groups. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed by Veteran adherence to&#xD;
      program components and validated surveys. Preliminary responsiveness will be assessed&#xD;
      primarily by change in 7-day average step count and secondarily by other physical function&#xD;
      tests and patient reported outcome measures. Study findings will have immediate clinical&#xD;
      impact as they will guide implementation of safe and effective telerehabilitation strategies&#xD;
      for medically complex older Veterans who lack access to standard in-person rehabilitation&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
