    <textblock>
      Investigators want to study to see if patients who participate in a physical activity&#xD;
      intervention involving increasing daily step counts will have better mini asthma quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire (Mini AQLQ) scores at the end of the study period compared to patients&#xD;
      that are in the control group and do not increase daily step counts. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into the two groups.&#xD;

      The Control group (usual care group) of 75 patients will not participate in the intervention&#xD;
      but will take an asthma control survey at baseline (point of enrollment into the study) and&#xD;
      about 4-6 weeks after.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire Score as a result of increased physical activity.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Any improvement in the score will be considered an improvement, since other than physical activity changes via step counts no other pharmacologic or lifestyle intervention will be made. Results will be compared to a control group who complete the survey without any intervention at two dates separated in time. Improvement in asthma symptoms can improve quality of life for participants. As noted by developers of the questionnaire being used in this study, &quot;the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire has been developed to measure the functional (physical, emotional, occupational and social) problems that are most troublesome to adults with asthma â€¦ the impact that asthma has on a patient's quality of life cannot be inferred from the clinical indices.&quot; Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables will be presented.</description>

    <description>Intervention group participants will be enrolled in a standardized step-based program to gradually increase their physical activity. Daily steps will be measured via a pedometer application on a smartphone or wearable device, with a gradual increase in the goal on a weekly basis, with a target intervention of around 4-6 weeks in total. The first week's step count will be used to calculate a baseline step count for the week. At the start of each week, the participants will be asked to increase their daily step counts by 1,000.</description>
