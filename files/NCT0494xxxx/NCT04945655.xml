  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness, efficiency and implementation of a&#xD;
      multicomponent intervention (components being applied in combination or alone) on the&#xD;
      acceptability of HPV vaccine among French adolescents (11-14 years old) through a cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome to measure acceptability is vaccine&#xD;
      coverage. The three components are: adolescents and parents' education and motivation at&#xD;
      school (component 1); general practitioners' training (component 2); and access to&#xD;
      vaccination at school (component 3). Ninety municipalities are included and randomized into&#xD;
      six groups of 15 municipalities, according an incomplete factorial plan.&#xD;

    <description>Each group participants' (adolescents, parents and general practitioners) knowledge and attitude towards HPV vaccination will be assessed for each of the &quot; 6-C &quot; components (Confidence, Complacency, Constraints, Calculation, Collective responsibility and social Conformism); a score of knowledge (from 0 - poor knowledge -- to 12 -- good knowledge) and a score of attitude (from 0 - unfavourable attitude -- to 24 - very favourable attitude) will then be calculated. Practices towards HPV vaccination (self-declared vaccination status / recommendation to patients) will be assessed using closed questions. Data will be collected using ad hoc self-administered online KABP-6C questionnaires.</description>

    <description>The component 1 includes first an information group session (duration: 1h30) on HPV infection and vaccination for parents. This session starts with a webconference delivered by two medical experts on HPV, using a standardized presentation. Then, a discussion is open for parents' questions and/or comments.&#xD;
Second, adolescents participate during the school time to two educational group sessions on HPV infections and vaccination, using a pedagogy based on active learning. These sessions (duration: 2h each) are delivered by the school staff (e.g., nurse, teacher in life sciences) using an educational package comprising: a guide that describes activities that should be implemented during each session; one video and a fact sheet developed by health students; a serious video game that promotes HPV vaccination and accessible on an internet website. Before the sessions, the school staff is encouraged to attend an e-learning training course (duration: 1 hour).</description>

    <description>The component 2 consists of an individual e-learning training session for general practitioners (GPs) that is accessible on computer and smartphone. Lasting 3 hours, GPs are able to access to the training whenever they want and then to progress at their own pace. The training includes three main parts: up-dated information on HPV infection and vaccination; an introduction to the use of motivational interviewing techniques in the field of vaccination; and a presentation of the decision aid tool developed as part of the intervention and explanation of how to use it during consultations. GPs may ask questions to the consortium team by using a dedicated chat.</description>

    <intervention_name>Access to vaccination at school (component 3)</intervention_name>
    <description>The component 3 aims at enhancing access to HPV vaccination for adolescents by offering them the first free-of-charge injection at school, without any medical prescription. For each concerned school, we organise a vaccination day inside the school premises where health professionals (one physician and one nurse) from the local vaccination centre initiate HPV vaccination with Gardasil-9® (in accordance with the French recommendations) for all eligible adolescents.</description>
