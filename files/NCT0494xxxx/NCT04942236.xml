  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CONNACT OA knee cohort is a prospective longitudinal cohort study where we aim to collect&#xD;
      sociodemographic, psychosocial, clinical, health utilization and cost data in order to better&#xD;
      understand the Asian OA knee cohort and investigate for prognostic variables that can&#xD;
      potentially influence a patients clinical outcome and treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the CONNACT OA knee cohort will form the basis for a cohort multiple randomized&#xD;
      control trial (cmRCT) study design where multiple interventions can be tested in a randomized&#xD;
      fashion. Each intervention is offered to a randomly selected sample of patients eligible for&#xD;
      that intervention, who are then compared with the rest of the eligible patients from the&#xD;
      cohort that are still being treated as usual.&#xD;

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Derived from the original 42-item Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), KOOS-12 reduces respondent burden by 70% from the original KOOS while providing scale scores for knee-specific Pain, Function and QOL, along with a summary measure of overall knee impact. The KOOS sub scales are scored using the method of summated ratings and transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problem. The KOOS-12 Summary knee impact score is calculated as the average of the KOOS-12 Pain, KOOS-12 Function and KOOS-12 QOL scale scores. It also ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 is the worst possible and 100 is the best possible score.</description>

    <description>The three subscales of KOOS-12 are scored separately: KOOS Pain (4 items); KOOS Function (4 items); KOOS QoL (4 items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the three scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) consists of 2 dimensions, the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by selecting the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS will be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome.</description>

    <description>This 8-items shortened version of the original 20-item instrument includes two items from the pain subscale, four items from the other symptoms subscale, and two new items that relate to preventing pain and fatigue from interfering with daily activities. The questionnaire measures patients' confidence on a scale of 1 (very uncertain) to 10 (very certain) in their ability to manage symptoms of arthritis. Responses were averaged to yield a score ranging from 1 to 10, the higher number being having greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>This 8-items shortened version of the original 20-item instrument includes two items from the pain subscale, four items from the other symptoms subscale, and two new items that relate to preventing pain and fatigue from interfering with daily activities. The questionnaire measures patients' confidence on a scale of 1 (very uncertain) to 10 (very certain) in their ability to manage symptoms of arthritis. Responses were averaged to yield a score ranging from 1 to 10, the higher number being having greater self-efficacy.</description>
