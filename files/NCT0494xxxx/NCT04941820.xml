  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the surgery ward are at risk of morbidity and mortality from various types of&#xD;
      treatment-related problems (TRPs). The primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of&#xD;
      the clinical pharmacist in the identification and management of TRPs in the surgery ward.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to intervention (n=50) and usual care (n=50) arms. The&#xD;
      clinical pharmacist assessed the types, frequencies, and clinical significance of TRPs for&#xD;
      all recruited patients at baseline. Patients and treating surgeons in the intervention arm&#xD;
      received recommendations concerning the identified TRPs, while the usual care arm did not.&#xD;
      The number of TRPs was reevaluated at follow-up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All patients were followed up prospectively for their length of hospital stay, and recommendations concerning each identified TRP were provided to the surgeons responsible for patients in the intervention group. Likewise, patient counseling and encouraging adherence to therapy were provided solely to patients in the intervention group. Patients in the control group received usual care by the surgical team without a coordinated contribution from the clinical pharmacist.</intervention_model_description>
