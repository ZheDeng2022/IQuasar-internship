  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is characterised by recurrence and&#xD;
      progression. We compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine hydrochloride and epirubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride, in combination with continuous saline irrigation, as an immediate single&#xD;
      intravesical instillation in the potential reduction of the disease recurrence as well as&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BLCa) is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the male population&#xD;
      worldwide, while it drops to tenth when both genders are considered. At diagnosis about 75%&#xD;
      of the patients suffer from non-muscle-invasive BLCa. The natural history of this disease is&#xD;
      characterised by recurrence and progression. In order to reduce the possibilities for&#xD;
      recurrence, and therefore progression, an immediate single intravesical instillation (ISIVI)&#xD;
      of a chemotherapeutic agent has been shown to act by destroying circulating tumour cells&#xD;
      after transurethral resection of urinary bladder tumors (TURB), and by an ablative effect on&#xD;
      residual tumour cells at the resection site and on small overlooked tumours. Several agents,&#xD;
      among them gemcitabine and epirubicin, have been used for the ISIVI so far. Moreover, four&#xD;
      large meta-analyses comprising 1,476 to 3,103 patients have consistently shown that after&#xD;
      TURB, ISIVI significantly reduces the recurrence rate compared to TURB alone. Furthermore,&#xD;
      two meta-analyses suggest efficacy of continuous saline irrigation (CSI) in the prevention of&#xD;
      early recurrences. The prevention of tumour cell implantation should be initiated within the&#xD;
      first few hours after TURB. After that, tumour cells are firmly implanted and are covered by&#xD;
      the extracellular matrix. In all ISIVI studies, the instillation was administered within 24&#xD;
      hours. Until today, no randomised comparisons of individual drugs, combined or not with CSI,&#xD;
      have been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial TURB, the patients will be treated with CSI for 24 hours. Then, they will&#xD;
      be randomised, either to gemcitabine or epirubicin, and within 6 hours after the TURB they&#xD;
      will receive an ISIVI with gemcitabine or epirubicin, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - GROUP A: Gemcitabine hydrochloride 2gr in 100ml 0.9% NaCl for 45-60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      - GROUP B: Epirubicin hydrochloride 50mg in 50ml 0.9% NaCl for 45-60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the ISIVI the CSI will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ISIVI will not be applied in the following cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active bleeding, which does not allow to interrupt the CSI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative fever &gt; 38°C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deep resection of the tumor, which could be associated with bladder perforation and&#xD;
           therefore potential extravasation of the administered drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy to gemcitabine or epirubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative follow-up for patients with disease stage pTis, Ta, T1 low grade (LG) /&#xD;
      high grade (HG), will be done according to the Guidelines of the European Association of&#xD;
      Urology (EAU) for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st and 2nd year: Cystoscopy &amp; cytological examination of urine every 3 months, CT&#xD;
           Urography every 12 months for HG patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3rd year: Cystoscopy &amp; cytological examination of urine every 6 months, CT Urography&#xD;
           every 12 months for HG patients&#xD;
