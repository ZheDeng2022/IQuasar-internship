      Aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of platelet rich fibrin&#xD;
      (PRF)+coronally advanced flap (CAF) technique in the treatment of multiple gingival&#xD;
      recessions in comparison with connective tissue graft (CTG)+CAF technique.12 patients with&#xD;
      bilateral Miller Class I multiple gingival recessions were treated with PRF+CAF (test group)&#xD;
      and CTG+CAF (control group) technique in a split-mouth study design. Probing depth, recession&#xD;
      depth (RD), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession width, position of gingival margin,&#xD;
      papilla width, keratinized tissue height (KTH), keratinized tissue thickness (KTT) were&#xD;
      measured at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Root coverage (RC) and complete&#xD;
      root coverage (CRC) ratios were evaluated post-operatively.&#xD;

    <description>CAF were used in treatment arms. Root planning was performed on the exposed part of roots to provide more biocompatible surface for re-attachment. Two 10 cc tubes with clot activator were used to collect blood from the patient; blood was centrifuged at 2700 rpm for 12 min. PRF box was used to form fibrin clots into membranes. PRF was positioned at the level of the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ), and sutured on the periosteum bed with 6/0 absorbable sutures. Gingival margins on the flap were placed at least 1 mm coronally of the CEJ and sutured with 5/0 absorbable sutures. Sutures were removed at 2nd week.</description>

    <description>Control sites were treated by coronally advanced flap (CAF) combined with connective tissue graft (CTG). CAF were used in both treatment arms. Root planning was performed on the exposed part of roots to provide more biocompatible surface for re-attachment. CTG was obtained with single incision method. CTG was positioned at the level of the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ), and sutured on the periosteum bed with 6/0 absorbable sutures. Gingival margins on the flap were placed at least 1 mm coronally of the CEJ and sutured with 5/0 absorbable sutures. Sutures were removed at 2nd week.</description>
