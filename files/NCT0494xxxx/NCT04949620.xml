  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of the study is to test an online platform for the prevention of&#xD;
      emotional disorders in children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project aims at implementing an integrated online therapeutic platform that will be&#xD;
      accessed by youth, parents and clinicians. The main original feature is the integration of&#xD;
      state of the art online/mobile and gaming technologies into a unique platform that allows&#xD;
      easy access to personalized, accessible and validated prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platform aims to allow access to attractive, easily accessible and evidence-based&#xD;
      prevention for youths. The system will be validated in the second step as an integrative,&#xD;
      multi-componential and adaptive platform for the prevention of emotional disorders in youth.&#xD;
      The platform includes tools that were separately tested in laboratory conditions and found to&#xD;
      be effective: the REThink therapeutic video game and the online REThink Parenting and&#xD;
      Rational Parent Coach mobile programs.&#xD;
