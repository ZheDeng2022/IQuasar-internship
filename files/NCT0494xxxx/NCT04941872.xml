  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2 positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions&#xD;
      in various types of cancer, compared with 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI-46 PET/CT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to enhance the tumor uptake and tumor retention time, we designed the dimer&#xD;
      structure of fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI), a novel imaging agent that&#xD;
      targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts expressed in various types of cancer,&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2. Subjects with various types of cancer underwent contemporaneous&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2 and 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI-46 PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for&#xD;
      recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value&#xD;
      (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive&#xD;
      value (NPV) and accuracy of 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI-46 and 68Ga-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2 PET/CT were calculated&#xD;
      and compared to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy.&#xD;

    <description>Mean absorbed radiation doses were estimated using the source and target organ framework. Five patients with different cancers underwent serial 68Ga-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2 PET/CT scans at three time points following radiotracer injection: 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 3 hours. The source organs consisted of the kidneys, bladder, liver, heart, spleen, bone marrow, uterus, and body remainder. OLINDA/EXM software was used to fit and integrate the kinetic organ activity data to yield total body and organ time-integrated activity coefficients/residence times and finally organ absorbed doses.</description>
