  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to characterize the effects of two exercise&#xD;
      interventions, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and continuous moderate-intensity&#xD;
      exercise (CME), on sleep and inflammation in older people living with HIV (PWH). This study&#xD;
      is a sub-study associated with The High Intensity Exercise Study to Attenuate Limitations and&#xD;
      Train Habits in Older Adults with HIV (HEALTH-HIV; NCT04550676). The investigators propose&#xD;
      the following aims: Aim 1. Compare the effectiveness of HIIT and CME exercise interventions&#xD;
      on sleep in older PWH. Aim 2. Quantify inflammation markers associated with sleep quality&#xD;
      (self-report surveys) in older PWH at baseline, between (week 8) and after exercise&#xD;
      interventions (HIIT and CME) (week 16). The investigators hypothesize HIIT will lead to&#xD;
      greater improvement in sleep quality (duration and quality) compared to CME and older PWH who&#xD;
      experience poor sleep quality and the CME intervention will have increased inflammation&#xD;
      markers compared to older PWH who experience better sleep quality and the HIIT intervention.&#xD;
      The intervention is being delivered by research personnel at the University of Washington&#xD;
      associated with the HEALTH-HIV study (NCT04550676). Data for this study will only be&#xD;
      collected at the University of Washington site of the HEALTH-HIV study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 50% of people living with HIV (PWH) in the United States are 50 years and older.&#xD;
      Although HIV antiretroviral therapy is effective, older PWH are diagnosed with comorbidities&#xD;
      at an earlier age, which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including poor sleep quality.&#xD;
      Sleep quality is a modifiable behavior in PWH. Higher levels of specific systemic&#xD;
      inflammation markers are associated with poor sleep quality in the general population as well&#xD;
      as PWH. Less physical activity is also associated with increased inflammation. The collective&#xD;
      or interacting impact of low levels of physical activity and inflammation on poor sleep&#xD;
      quality may be stronger than either independent factor; therefore, it is vital to examine the&#xD;
      potentially causal pathway between physical activity, sleep, and inflammation in order to&#xD;
      help mitigate poor sleep quality. HIIT is safe and has higher efficacy in improving health&#xD;
      outcomes compared to CME in those with chronic illness (i.e., coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      diabetes), yet little is known about the effects of HIIT on sleep in people living with HIV.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures include: change in sleep quality and patterns of sleep from week&#xD;
      0 to 16 of the intervention and change in inflammation markers from week 0 to 8 and week 0 to&#xD;
      16 of the intervention. Our primary sleep quality outcomes will be the sleep fragmentation&#xD;
      index, sleep efficiency, and mean sleep duration for sleep quantity. All three will be based&#xD;
      on actigraphy. The primary inflammation markers of interest are interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10,&#xD;
      IL-13, IFN-y, C reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α due to prior&#xD;
      association with sleep quality, other inflammation markers, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8 and&#xD;
      IL-12p70 will be exploratory to identify potential pathways of sleep impairments.&#xD;
