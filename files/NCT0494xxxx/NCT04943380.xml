      Prospective observational study to validate the performance characteristics and clinical&#xD;
      utility of Cxbladder tests in a Veterans Affairs cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Non-invasive, voided urine sample used for both Cxbladder molecular tests, voided urine&#xD;
      sample may be used for standard of care testing. Retrospective analysis of data after study&#xD;
      completion ensures a de-phasing of study sample analysis from clinical decision making;&#xD;
      patient treatment and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-site recruitment of patients in Veterans Affairs.Target number of participants up to&#xD;
      four sites is around 450 sequentially recruited patients presenting for assessment of&#xD;
      hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic) by cystoscopy.&#xD;

    <description>The Cxbladder test results will be compared to that of cystoscopy, which is the gold standard method for diagnosing urothelial cancer; the true positive and true negative rates will be measured, along with the false positive and false negative rates of the test.

    <description>Patients will be recruited from those presenting with hematuria and undergoing investigative cystoscopy for the determination of possible urothelial carcinoma. This includes patients referred via imaging or from other departments for assessment of hematuria. Microscopic hematuria is defined as &gt; 3 red blood cells per high-powered microscopy field for a properly collected urine sample.</description>

    <description>The Cxbladder Detect test, developed by Pacific Edge Ltd (O'Sullivan 2012; Holyoake 2008; National Health Committee 2015b) is a molecular diagnostic test, which consists of five mRNA transcripts measured in a small volume of urine.</description>
