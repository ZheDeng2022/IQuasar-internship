  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are 1) to explore the association between multi-dimension facial&#xD;
      characteristics and the increased risk of coronary artery diseases (CAD); 2) to evaluate the&#xD;
      diagnostic efficacy of multi-dimension appearance factors for coronary artery diseases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous study demonstrated the feasibility of using deep learning to detect coronary artery&#xD;
      disease based on facial photos. However, several limitations made the algorithm hard to be&#xD;
      utilized in clinical practice, including low specificity and lack of external validation.&#xD;
      Adding multi-dimension facial characteristics may further increase the algorithm effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators designed a single-center, cross-sectional study to explore the&#xD;
      association between multi-dimension facial characteristics and CAD and to evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive efficacy of multi-dimension appearance factors for CAD. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit patients undergoing coronary angiography or coronary computer tomography angiography.&#xD;
      Patients' baseline information and multi-dimension facial images will be collected. The&#xD;
      investigators will train and validate a deep learning algorithm based on multi-dimension&#xD;
      facial photos.&#xD;
