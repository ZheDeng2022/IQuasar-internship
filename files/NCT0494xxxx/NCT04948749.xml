  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the RCT trial is to evaluate whether implantation of drug-eluting stent (DES)&#xD;
      combined with aggressive medical treatment is more efficacious in prevention of composite&#xD;
      event of any stroke and death within 30 days after enrollment and ischemic stroke in the&#xD;
      territories of the responsible artery from 31 days to 1-year after enrollment than optimal&#xD;
      medical treatment for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, multi-center, 1:1 randomized using drug-eluting (Sirolimus)&#xD;
      stent combined with aggressive medical treatment versus optimal medical treatment to treat&#xD;
      intracranial stenosis of 70-99% degree. The primary endpoint is any stroke and death within&#xD;
      30 days after enrollment or after revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion during&#xD;
      follow-up, ischemic stroke in the territories of the responsible artery from 31 days to&#xD;
      1-year after enrollment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Any stroke or death within 30 days of enrollment or any revascularization procedure OR an ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery between 31 day to 1 year.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoints are composite event of (1) any stroke or death within 30 days after enrollment, (2) any stroke or death within 30 days after revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion during follow-up, and (3) ischemic stroke in the territory of the qualifying artery from 31 days to 1 year. Ischemic stroke is defined as a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset, that is associated with infarction lesion on CT or MRI. Ischemic strokes are classified as in or out of the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery. Symptomatic brain hemorrhage is defined asparenchymal, subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage detected by CT or MRI that isassociated with new neurological signs or symptoms (headache, change in level of consciousness, focal neurological symptoms) lasting ≥ 24 hours or a seizure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technique success rate in DES group</measure>
    <time_frame>During the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Technique success was defined as successful arrival of stent to the lesion and subsequent release of the stent delivery system with a residual stenosis of &lt;30%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In-stent restenosis (ISR) rate in DES group</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The ISR is defined as &gt;50% stenosis within or immediately adjacent (within 5 mm) of the implanted stent and &gt;20% absolute luminal loss.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disabling stroke within 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Disabling stroke was defined by any of the following: a modifiedRankin score of 4 or higher, on a scale of 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability; a score on the Barthel Index of 80 or less, on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating less disability;a score on the composite National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (which quantifies neurologic deficits) of 7 or more, on a scale of 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe deficits; a score on the NIHSS of 3 or more for motor examination of an arm or leg, on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe deficits; a score on the NIHSS of 2 or more for best language, on ascale of 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more severe deficits; and a score on the NIHSS of 3 for visual category (i.e., bilateral hemianopia, including cortical blindness), on a scale of 0 to 3, with higherscores indicating more severe deficits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Any stroke, death or myocardial infarction within 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Any stroke included ischemic stroke and symptomatic brain hemorrhage. Symptomatic brain hemorrhage refers to parenchymal, subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage that was associated with a seizure or with symptoms or signs lasting 24 hours or longer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Major non-stroke hemorrhage within 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>A major non-stroke-related hemorrhage was defined as any subdural or epidural hemorrhage or a systemic hemorrhage requiring hospitalization, blood transfusion, or surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional outcome at 1 year measured by the modified Rankin Scale and EQ-5D scale at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The range of modified Rankin Scale was from 0 to 6. 0-No symptoms;1-No significant disability;2-Slight disability;3-Moderate disability;4-Moderately severe disability;5-Severe disability;6 -Dead.A higher score indicates worse a outcome. EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypo-perfusion volume on cerebral blood perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Hypo-perfusion volume was defined as brain tissue volume of Tmax&lt;4s. The unit was ml. Tmax parameter is a bolus-shape-independent estimate of time-delay for blood delivery between a main feeding artery (e.g. middle cerebral artery) and tissue at a given spatial location.</description>
