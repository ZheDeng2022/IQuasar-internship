  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the head&#xD;
      and neck, accounting for 90% of head and neck malignancies, and 16% to 40% of systemic&#xD;
      malignancies. There are 60,000 new cases reported annually worldwide, and the incidence and&#xD;
      mortality are increasing year by year, however,the 5-year survival rate under standard&#xD;
      treatment is only 50%. 70%~80% of patients already developed into locally advanced status&#xD;
      (stage II-IVa) when they are first diagnosed. The treatment principle is mainly determined by&#xD;
      the clinical stage and location of the tumor, various factors affecting the prognosis and the&#xD;
      patient's tolerance. Locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has a higher&#xD;
      probability of local/regional failure and distant metastasis after treatment. Therefore, in&#xD;
      recent years, the use of neoadjuvant therapy (NAC) followed by surgery or radiotherapy has&#xD;
      been advocated. Surgical treatment is still one of the preferred treatments for local head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma. TPF (Docetaxel + Cisplatin + Fluorouracil) regimen is&#xD;
      considered as the standard regimen of induced chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (especially in laryngeal cancer), which can significantly reduce the patient's&#xD;
      distant metastasis rate and prolong overall survival ( OS). Nevertheless, the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of neoadjuvant therapy on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has reached a&#xD;
      bottleneck. In recent years, PD-1 inhibitors have achieved significant effects in the field&#xD;
      of tumor therapy and have been approved for the treatment of various tumors including head&#xD;
      and neck tumors. And a number of clinical trials have shown that PD-1 inhibitors can&#xD;
      significantly prolong the OS of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, the investigators launch an open-label, single-arm, phase Ib clinical trial of&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy in patients with resectable HNSCC to explore the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment. The study comprises two stages, run-in and case development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first phase, we would observe the initial six patients lasting 90 days from the first&#xD;
      day of treatment(or 30 days after surgery) to evaluate if the dose-limited- toxicity DLT&#xD;
      would occur in two of them or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3、If the dose-limited- toxicity would be recorded in no more than one patient, the trail&#xD;
      would continue until meeting the scheduled size of population, otherwise the trial would&#xD;
      stop. The further investigation would be launch to review the data thoroughly and modify the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
