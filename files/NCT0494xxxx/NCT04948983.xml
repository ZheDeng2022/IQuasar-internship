  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in Chile. National efforts focus on early&#xD;
      detection, offering universal access to breast cancer screening through mammography to women&#xD;
      at risk age. However, 30% of women do not undertake the exam due to a lack of knowledge and&#xD;
      anxiety when facing the decision. The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a decision aid (DA) for women facing breast cancer screening decision in the&#xD;
      country. Methods: following the Medical Research Council guidelines for the development and&#xD;
      implementation of a complex intervention in public health, the investigators have: 1)&#xD;
      culturally adapted the German DA for mammography; 2) conducted focus groups with experts to&#xD;
      further develop the DA; 3) pilot-tested the online DA with 20 women in primary care centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 3,269 women aged 50 to 69 years old are invited to join the study. The&#xD;
      intervention group accesses a webpage, answers a set of questionnaires at baseline, and then&#xD;
      the DA (developed according to the IPDAS recommendations). The Control group accesses a&#xD;
      webpage, answers a set of questionnaires at baseline, and then receives standardised&#xD;
      information given by the healthcare system. Both groups complete the questionnaires two weeks&#xD;
      later. The primary outcome measure is an adapted and validated version of Informed Choice.&#xD;
      Additionally, decisional conflict, anxiety, and screening undertake rate are measured.&#xD;
      Multiple lineal regression analysis will be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an alarming rise of breast cancer in developing countries, where early detection is&#xD;
      rare and the late findings build up an important mortality rate. In Chile, the mortality rate&#xD;
      is 15,5 per 100.000 women, where breast cancer is the first death caused by tumors.&#xD;
      Governmental efforts had focused on increase an opportune detection and had offered universal&#xD;
      and guaranteed access to breast cancer screening to women in at-risk age (50 to 59 years&#xD;
      old). Still, about 30% of the women of at-risk age choose to not do the mammogram. Anxiety&#xD;
      and lack of awareness are the principal reasons associated with the decision of rejecting or&#xD;
      postponing the exam. Women would have trouble in making an informed decision about the breast&#xD;
      cancer exam, resulting in possible negatives consequences for their wellbeing. Considering&#xD;
      that the health-related decision-making process depends importantly on the personal balance&#xD;
      of risk and benefits related to the decision, it is imperative to explore strategies that&#xD;
      support women in the decision-making progress for breast cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a decision aid (DA) for&#xD;
      women facing breast cancer screening decision in the country. Methods: following the Medical&#xD;
      Research Council guidelines for the development and implementation of a complex intervention&#xD;
      in public health, the investigators have: 1) culturally adapted the German DA for&#xD;
      mammography; 2) conducted focus groups with experts to further develop the DA; 3)&#xD;
      pilot-tested the online DA with 20 women in primary care centres; 4) A two-arm randomized&#xD;
      control trial will be conducted with a total of 3,269 women aged 50 to 69 years old in ten&#xD;
      primary care centres in Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will access a webpage, answers a set of questionnaires at baseline,&#xD;
      and then the DA (developed according to the IPDAS recommendations). The Control group will&#xD;
      access a webpage, answers a set of questionnaires at baseline, and then receives standardised&#xD;
      information given by the healthcare system. Both groups will complete the questionnaires two&#xD;
      weeks later. The primary outcome measure is an adapted and validated version of Informed&#xD;
      Choice. Additionally, decisional conflict, anxiety, and screening undertake rate will be&#xD;
      measure. Multiple lineal regression analysis will be conducted.&#xD;

The online DA for breast cancer screening is a web-based education material to inform women about the benefits and risks associated with the screening. The contents of the DA are: 1) Assessing breast cancer; 2) What is breast cancer screening?; 3) What will happen if I diagnosed with breast cancer?; 4) What is overdiagnosis?; 5) What is false positive?; 6) the statistics of breast cancer screening; 7) Now is my turn, do I want to take it?</description>
