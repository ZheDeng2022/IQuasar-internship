  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, two-armed, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate adjuvanted recombinant&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein subunit vaccine (SpikoGen) produced by CinnaGen Co. 400 adult&#xD;
      individuals receive either SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein (25 µg) with Advax-SM&#xD;
      adjuvant (15 mg) or saline placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The injection is given in two doses with a&#xD;
      21-day interval in the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. The randomization was&#xD;
      stratified by age (&lt;65 or ≥65) and health conditions of potential risk for severe COVID-19.&#xD;
      Participants will be visited at two weeks and will be followed up for six months after the&#xD;
      second dose of the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate is safe and tolerable in adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate induces strong immunogenicity against&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 in adult subjects.&#xD;
