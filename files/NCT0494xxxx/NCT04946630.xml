    <textblock>
      This is a single site, open label, 4-inhalation sessions, explorative clinical investigation&#xD;
      to investigate the ability of PreciseInhale to direct regional lung targeting and reduce the&#xD;
      degree of throat deposition and subsequent gastrointestinal absorption of test drug&#xD;
      substances in healthy volunteers after inhalation of test drug substances via the&#xD;
      PreciseInhale system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening visit, 8 consecutive treatment visits and a follow-up&#xD;
      telephone call 3-5 days after the last inhalation session. There will be a screening period&#xD;
      of up to 35 days and an at least 1-week washout between treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intended use The PreciseInhale system is a benchtop aerosol generation and dispensation&#xD;
      system set up for extracting aerosol from clinical inhalers. The PreciseInhale system is&#xD;
      classified as a Class IIa device according to MDD Annex IX, Rule 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PreciseInhale is intended to administer test drug substances in precise doses by producing&#xD;
      exact amounts of inhalable aerosols from a clinical inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extraction of the aerosol and exposure to humans must comply with operator and test subject&#xD;
      safety regulations and only conducted in accordance with permits from the Swedish Medical&#xD;
      Products Agency (MPA) and Swedish Ethical Review Authority (SERA) if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication PreciseInhale is not intended to treat any specific condition that requires&#xD;
      medical attention. The purpose of the clinical investigation is to prove that the principle&#xD;
      of operation of PreciseInhale is useful for administration of aerosols to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Screening (Visit 1) will take place from Day -35 to Day 1 and will include&#xD;
      general health assessments and an eligibility check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visits 2 to 9, subjects will be admitted to the research clinic on Day -1 and will remain&#xD;
      at the research clinic for PK and safety assessments until at least 12 hours after a single&#xD;
      dose fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/25 µg is administered on the morning of Day 1&#xD;
      (Visit 2, 4, 6 and 8). The subjects will be carefully monitored by clinical staff during and&#xD;
      after dosing. Vital signs and ECG will be checked at pre-determined timepoints. There is&#xD;
      immediate access to equipment and qualified staff in case of an emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol will be administered to each subject via the Evohaler or&#xD;
      the PreciseInhale system, in the morning of Day 1 of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 treatment periods will include these 4 inhalation sessions (up to 5 minutes/per&#xD;
      session):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Single dose inhalation of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250 µg/25 µg administered&#xD;
           via the Evohaler in accordance with instruction in the SmPC for Seretide Evohaler forte.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Single dose of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250 µg/25 µg administered via the&#xD;
           PreciseInhale system set up for whole lung exposure. The entire 300 mL aerosol volume&#xD;
           produced by the single dose from the inhaler will be inhaled at a flow rate in&#xD;
           accordance with instructions for the Evohaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A subdivided dose of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250 µg/25 µg administered via the&#xD;
           PreciseInhale system set up for six repetitive 70 mL Alveolar bolus/ Breath hold&#xD;
           exposures. Each 70 mL bolus will be extracted from a freshly generated volume of 300 mL&#xD;
           aerosol produced by actuation of a single dose from the inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A subdivided dose of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250 µg/25 µg administered via the&#xD;
           PreciseInhale system set up for six repetitive 70 mL Bronchial bolus/ Breath hold&#xD;
           exposures. Each 70 mL bolus will be extracted from a freshly generated volume of 300 mL&#xD;
           aerosol produced by actuation of a single dose from the inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhalations will be administered by trained study personnel and the subjects will receive&#xD;
      inhalation training before each inhalation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be served a light breakfast before each treatment administration. After 1 hour&#xD;
      post dose, the meal intake is unrestricted within the meal selection available at the&#xD;
      research clinic. Lunch, Snack, dinner and evening snack (optional) will be served&#xD;
      approximately 4, 6, 9 and 12 hours post-dose, respectively. Fluids will be restricted 1 hour&#xD;
      prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing. An optional breakfast may be served in the morning&#xD;
      of Day 2 before the subject leaves the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK samples will be collected at 17 time points in each treatment period: pre-dose, 2, 4, 6,&#xD;
      15, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be discharged from the research clinic in the evening of Day 1 (12 hours&#xD;
      post treatment) and return to the research clinic in the morning (Visits 3, 5, 7 and 9; 24&#xD;
      hours post treatment) of Day 2 for PK sampling (and follow up safety assessments on the last&#xD;
      Day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a wash-out period of at least 1 week between treatments. A follow-up telephone&#xD;
      call (Visit 10, end-of-study) will be made 3-5 days after the last inhalation to follow-up on&#xD;
      adverse events and device deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A device user experience questionnaire will be completed by the study subject and&#xD;
      PreciseInhale operator after all inhalation sessions with the PreciseInhale have been&#xD;
      completed, i.e after the fourth inhalation session.&#xD;
