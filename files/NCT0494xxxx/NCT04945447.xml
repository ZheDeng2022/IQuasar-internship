      Brief summary: The randomised controlled trial investigates the effect of a pharmacist&#xD;
      intervention targeting polypharmacy patient at two levels medical clinics and patient level.&#xD;
      The purpose is to gain more knowledge to patients and physicians about their medication and&#xD;
      to see changes in the patient's medication and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the randomised controlled trial is to investigate the clinical effects&#xD;
      of the roll-out of the systematic offer from Nord-KAP in the North Denmark Region at two&#xD;
      different levels (medical clinic and patient-level). The primary outcome is changes in the&#xD;
      participant's medicine from baseline to follow up and changes in healthcare usage Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include investigation of cost-effectiveness and changes in patients health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the regional intervention delivered by the pharmacists, from Nord-KAP,&#xD;
      can lead to a decrease in medical products compared with a control group between baseline and&#xD;
      at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will the use of a pharmacists intervention lead to a decrease in the number of&#xD;
           polypharmacy patients in medical clinics compared to a control group of medical clinics?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will the use of a pharmacist intervention lead to an increase in the polypharmacy&#xD;
           patients health-related quality of life compared to a control group?&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of two subgroups: Intervention pharmacist and intervention proposals. As the pharmacist conducts medication reviews of the polypharmacy patients in the medical clinic they can make a note to the physician about fx a specific medication the physician needs to pay attention to. These polypharmacy patients are enrolled in the group intervention proposals and are asked to complete questionaries at baseline and follow-up. Ultimately, it is up to the physician to react to the note in the polypharmacy patients medical record. Therefore the pharmacist only makes a note in the journal of the patient and does nothing else.&#xD;
The group intervention pharmacist is polypharmacy patients where the pharmacist conducts a medication review and develops suggested interventions proposals for each participant</description>
