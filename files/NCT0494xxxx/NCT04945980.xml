    <textblock>
      This study tested the hypothesis that ground beef high in monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and low&#xD;
      in saturated fat (SFA) would increase the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration&#xD;
      and low-density lipoprotein particle diameter. In a crossover dietary intervention, 27&#xD;
      free-living normocholesterolemic men completed treatments in which five 114-g ground beef&#xD;
      patties/week were consumed for 5 weeks with an intervening 4-week washout period. Patties&#xD;
      contained 24% total fat with a MUFA:SFA ratio of either 0.71 (low MUFA, from pasture-fed&#xD;
      cattle) or 1.10 (high MUFA, from grain-fed cattle).&#xD;

      Participants and study design Healthy, nonsmoking males between the ages of 23 and 60 years&#xD;
      were screened for eligibility. The 30 participants selected were not consuming restrictive&#xD;
      diets or medications. Family histories were obtained as part of a complete physical&#xD;
      examination that included a treadmill exercise test with an electrocardiogram. Baseline blood&#xD;
      chemistries were analyzed by a local laboratory and all blood chemistries were within normal&#xD;
      ranges as defined by the testing laboratory. All participants were free living and were&#xD;
      instructed to maintain routine activities and body weight (62.2 kg of entry weight). Exercise&#xD;
      and physical activities were not restricted, but participants were requested not to change&#xD;
      their habitual level of physical activity. Twenty-seven of the initial 30 participants&#xD;
      completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 3 non-completers, 1 had a re-occurrence of a previous illness, another relocated, and&#xD;
      data from the 3rd was omitted following baseline samples that showed high triglyceride&#xD;
      concentrations (.5 mmol/L). A 2-period, randomized cross-over design was used. Each&#xD;
      participant completed two 5-wk diet interventions in a randomly assigned order with a 4-wk&#xD;
      washout period between the test diet interventions. The men consumed 5 ground beef patties&#xD;
      per week for 5 wk during each dietary intervention (25 patties of each type for each ground&#xD;
      beef intervention). The 2 interventions were low-monounsaturated fat ground beef and&#xD;
      high-monounsaturated fat ground beef. To facilitate product distribution and blood sampling,&#xD;
      participants were assigned to 1 of 2 groups, which were balanced with regard to age, body&#xD;
      weight, and total cholesterol concentration at the initial screening. Group 1 began the study&#xD;
      2 wk before group 2. Both groups rotated through both test diets, but the pattern in which&#xD;
      they crossed over differed between groups. Therefore, crossovers included all possible&#xD;
      rotation sequences. Body weights were recorded weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and analysis of blood samples Prior to the initiation of the dietary treatments&#xD;
      and at the end of each diet phase and after 5 minutes of seated rest, blood was collected&#xD;
      from the participants into vacutainers from a vein in the antecubital fossa using standard&#xD;
      phlebotomy procedures. Plasma was harvested from the blood collected with EDTA and&#xD;
      lipoproteins preserved in plasma prior to lipoprotein separation using density gradient&#xD;
      ultracentrifugation employing human density intervals. Determination of LDL lipoprotein&#xD;
      diameters was by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Particle diameters were&#xD;
      determined by comparison with migration distances of standard proteins of known hydrated&#xD;
      diameter. Plasma total lipoproteins isolated as the d &lt; 1.2 kg/L fraction of plasma were&#xD;
      separated on the basis of diameter with a gel-filtration chromatographic system to determine&#xD;
      the relative distribution of plasma total cholesterol among very low-density lipoproteins&#xD;
      (VLDL), LDL, and HDL lipoprotein classes. Concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
      and glucose in plasma were determined by separate enzymatic assays. Concentrations of serum&#xD;
      insulin and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were assayed using commercially available ELISA&#xD;
      kits according to the manufacturers' instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis We compared nutrient and dietary exchange data and final plasma glucose,&#xD;
      lipids, insulin, CRP, and lipoprotein particle diameters to their corresponding baseline&#xD;
      values by paired t test. Data were tested for unequal variance by the Breusch-&#xD;
      Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test for heteroscedasticity to test the null hypothesis that the error&#xD;
      variances were all equal. Values for changes from baseline for the low- and high-MUFA&#xD;
      treatment groups were compared by 1-way analysis of variance, with ground beef type as the&#xD;
      treatment effect. Associations among plasma analytes were assessed using Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficients. P-values were considered significant at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
