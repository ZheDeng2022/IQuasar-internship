  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) techniques have revolutionised the approach to rectal cancer&#xD;
      surgery. With increasing experience, surgeons have began to utilise these platforms&#xD;
      increasingly in the context of pelvic exenteration (PE). This observational retrospective&#xD;
      review plans to assess the volume of PE being performed on a global basis and to assess the&#xD;
      comparative outcomes associated with each technique in order to assess the optimal approach&#xD;
      to radical pelvic surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic exenteration (extended pelvic multi-visceral resection) is a radical procedure that&#xD;
      offers potential long-term cure in appropriately selected cases of locally advanced and&#xD;
      recurrent pelvic cancers. It was first described by Alexander Brunschwig in 1948 as a viable&#xD;
      palliative option for advanced gynaecological cancer. However, over the last 70 years,&#xD;
      changes in surgical oncology practices have seen its role extended to include other advanced&#xD;
      non-gynaecological cancers (locally advanced colorectal, urological, and sarcomatous&#xD;
      neoplasms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these procedures pose a significant challenge for the operating surgeon, improved&#xD;
      surgical techniques, technology, and reconstructive options have facilitated more radical&#xD;
      resections. Despite improved surgical options, patients still have considerable&#xD;
      post-operative morbidity and negative impact to quality of life. However, non-surgical&#xD;
      management options result in poor prognosis with only 3% survival at five-years. Pelvic&#xD;
      exenteration in appropriately-selected patients offers the only hope of long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few decades with improved perioperative management and better surgical&#xD;
      techniques, more aggressive visceral, soft tissue and bony resections are performed. The&#xD;
      development of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) platforms has also evolved substantially,&#xD;
      especially regarding pelvic surgery. There are some recent sporadic (low-volume) reports&#xD;
      highlighting the potential role for MIS exenterative surgery, however many reports have been&#xD;
      heterogeneous and single-centre. The aim of this retrospective review is to compare the&#xD;
      volume, disease characteristics and surgical outcomes between open, laparoscopic and robotic&#xD;
      pelvic exenterations, and to assess the initial experience of MIS platforms in multiple&#xD;
      specialist centres worldwide.&#xD;
