  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) may induce bone loss according with the composition of the&#xD;
      gut microbiota (GM), and particularly, on the presence of intestinal bacterial that induce T&#xD;
      helper 17 differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate GM composition and evaluate how GM modulates immune system in patients&#xD;
      affected by PHPT with or without skeletal involvement. Furthermore, we will unravel the&#xD;
      causal relationship between GM composition and T cells activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon success, HYPOGEUM will show that GM sequencing is a screening tool to identify PHPT that&#xD;
      will lose bone, suggesting novel strategies with antimicrobial treatments to prevent bone&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOGEUM will yield essential data to understand and prevent skeletal complications&#xD;
      associated with PHPT.&#xD;

      Methods. The project will be organized in three working packages (WP). WP1. Determine if the&#xD;
      propensity of patients with PHPT to develop bone loss can be predicted by the composition of&#xD;
      stool microbiome (month 0-11). We will screen men and women age 30-80 years diagnosed with&#xD;
      PHPT and evaluated by 3-site DXA (lumbar spine, hip, and distal radius- both 1/3 and&#xD;
      ultra-distal), and bone turnover markers. Two groups with 45 patients each will be enrolled:&#xD;
      1) Subjects with normal BMD or mild osteopenia (distal radius T-score &gt; -1.5), no fragility&#xD;
      fractures and CTX levels that are associated with normal bone turnover (100-250 pg/ml) (not&#xD;
      bone looser). 2) Subjects with osteoporosis (distal radius T-score &lt; -2.5) with or without&#xD;
      one or more fragility fractures) and CTX levels that are associated with active disease (&gt;500&#xD;
      pg/ml) (bone looser). Blood samples and a faecal sample will be collected by each&#xD;
      participant. Stool samples will be stored immediately in a cooler with -20°C freezer packs&#xD;
      and stored at -80°C until shipped to COSMOSID for Metagenomic Shotgun sequencing and analysis&#xD;
      of the microbiome community structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomics Shotgun sequencing and analysis. The microbiome diversity and composition of&#xD;
      each stool sample will be determined by CosmosID Inc., Rockville, MD. Briefly, DNA from human&#xD;
      faecal samples will be isolated using the QIAGEN DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit. DNA libraries will&#xD;
      be prepared using the Illumina Nextera XT library preparation kit and Library quantity&#xD;
      assessed with Qubit (ThermoFisher). Libraries will be then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq&#xD;
      platform 2x150bp. Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing reads will be done by CosmosID&#xD;
      bioinformatics platform that uses high performance data mining algorithms and the highly&#xD;
      curated dynamic comparator database GenBook®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points and interpretation: We will determine if PHPT patients loosing bone have a higher&#xD;
      frequency of one or more Th17 cell-inducing-SFB equivalent bacteria as compared to control&#xD;
      PHPT patients. This analysis will therefore yield evidence pertaining to species and strains&#xD;
      that may exacerbate bone loss in PHPT. The DXA endpoints will be BMD, T-scores and Z-scores&#xD;
      of the distal and 1/3 radius, lumbar spine and hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation: Our analysis of the preliminary data set revealed that BL was abundant at&#xD;
      mean relative abundance of ~5.8% (SD 0.055). From these data we calculated that enrolling 45&#xD;
      per group will provide 80% statistical power of detecting a difference for BL if the mean&#xD;
      relative abundance of BL is &gt; 1.5-fold (8.7%) higher in PHPT patients with low bone density&#xD;
      as compared to control PHPT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP2. Evaluate how GM composition modulates immune system in humans (month 3-10). In order to&#xD;
      evaluate Th subsets, T cells will be analysed by real time RT-PCR measuring FOXP3, IL-17A,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha and IL-4 gene expression. Briefly, red cells will be lysed in peripheral blood&#xD;
      samples and total nucleated cells collected and frozen at -80°C until RNA extraction. RNA&#xD;
      will be isolated using TRIzol reagent, chloroform extraction, and subsequent isopropanol&#xD;
      precipitation according to standard procedure. Relative cytokine expression will be&#xD;
      determined using the 2-ΔΔCT method with normalization to β-Actin. In order to evaluate&#xD;
      inflammation we will measure IL-17A (the main species of IL-17 produced by Th17 cells), free&#xD;
      RANKL, OPG, TNF by ELISA technique. To assess bone turnover P1NP (a marker of bone&#xD;
      formation), CTX (a marker of bone resorption), 25OHvitamin D (25OHD) will be measured by&#xD;
      ELISA technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points and interpretation. The data will reveal the existence of correlations between&#xD;
      rate of bone resorption, Th cell subset and serum levels of IL-17 and other cytokines. Should&#xD;
      we find that the composition of the GM is reflective of the activity of the disease; the data&#xD;
      will serve as the foundation for future intervention studies to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      antibiotics or other interventions as, for example, with probiotics in mitigating the&#xD;
      skeletal complications of PHPT. We also expect that PHPT patients with skeletal disease will&#xD;
      have lower 25OHD levels than those without skeletal disease. Should we find a correlation&#xD;
      between 25OHD levels and bacterial species and strains that favours Th17 cell formation; the&#xD;
      data will provide novel mechanistic information on how 25OHD levels affect the propensity to&#xD;
      bone disease in PHPT. Should this be the case, a very attractive subject for a future&#xD;
      intervention study will be the proposition that vitamin D replacement will restore a&#xD;
      microbiota composition that is not associated with skeletal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk analyses and contingency plan. Oestrogen deficiency expands Th17 cells and their&#xD;
      production of IL-17 may contribute to postmenopausal bone loss in humans. This effect might&#xD;
      represent an important confounder, which may limit the assessment of the role of IL-17 in the&#xD;
      bone loss induced by PHPT in early postmenopausal women. If necessary, we will manage this&#xD;
      limitation by statistically adjusting for the effects of sex, age and menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP3. Evaluate the causal relationship between GM composition and T cells activation (month&#xD;
      6-10). In order to evaluate if Th cells are directly stimulated by proteins from SFB&#xD;
      equivalent bacteria we will test the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) directly&#xD;
      toward BL ATCC 15707 and evaluate the type of responding T cells by ELISPOT technique.&#xD;
      Briefly, PBMCs from 10 patients with increased Th17 cells in peripheral blood will be tested&#xD;
      against BL ATCC 15707 and the production of IL-17, TNF alpha and RANKL will be tested by&#xD;
      ELISPOT analyses for. These cytokines, within the PBMCs, are produced specifically by T cells&#xD;
      following their activation. ELISPOT technique allows testing multiple proteins in a single&#xD;
      experiment. TNF alpha and RANKL other than IL-17 have been selected as candidate cytokines as&#xD;
      the applicant and others have previously shown an increased level of these cytokines in T&#xD;
      cells from patients affected by post-menopausal osteoporosis. Should we find a direct&#xD;
      activation of T cells to BL ATCC 15707, the type of T cell is responsible for activation will&#xD;
      be further characterized thanks to the use of single-cell RNA sequencing technique&#xD;
      (scRNA-seq) with the the Fluidigm C1 system as it allows a more in-depth sequencing per cell&#xD;
      (about 200.000 readings). Briefly, PBMC cells from 5 responders patients will be challenged&#xD;
      with ATCC 15707 or with a control microbe (B. fragilis) for 6 hours. After incubation T cells&#xD;
      will be separated by total blood nucleated cells by negative immunomagnetic cell isolation&#xD;
      system, and evaluated with scRNA-seq. The use scRNA-seq will enable us to characterize&#xD;
      activated T- cells and their gene expression End points and interpretation. We will determine&#xD;
      if ATC C 15707 is able to directly activate T cells and further we will characterise the type&#xD;
      of responding T cell. This will allow us to confirm the association data obtained in the&#xD;
      first part of the study and provide a mechanistic insight into the relationship between GM,&#xD;
      immune activation and bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk analyses and contingency plan. If T cells from patients with increased number of Th17 in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood will not positively answer to immune challenge with ATCC 15707, we will&#xD;
      test T cells reactivity towards others microbes increased in the GM of PHPT bone losers. GM&#xD;
      strain able to stimulate Th17 cells will be chosen according to the results obtained in WP1.&#xD;
      In order to define a positive T cells activation we set a threshold of 70% of positive&#xD;
      results to immune challenge according with our preliminary data and with previous results&#xD;
      published by the PI.&#xD;
