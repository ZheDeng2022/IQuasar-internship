  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to allow continued adavosertib treatment of patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumours participating in the adavosertib clinical pharmacology studies and to&#xD;
      assess the continued safety and tolerability of adavosertib for patients enrolled in&#xD;
      adavosertib clinical pharmacology studies (hereafter referred to as the 'parent studies') who&#xD;
      continue to use the therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened within 14 days of Day 1 of the treatment period. During screening,&#xD;
      patients will undergo an appropriate washout period after the last dose of adavosertib in the&#xD;
      parent clinical pharmacology study before receiving the first dose of adavosertib in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive adavosertib as long as they are benefiting from treatment&#xD;
      in the investigator's opinion and do not meet any other discontinuation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients who enroll is dependent on the number of patients who complete the&#xD;
      parent studies, and who tolerate adavosertib in the parent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated total duration of the study is approximately 3 years.&#xD;
