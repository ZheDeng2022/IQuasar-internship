  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many drugs used during anesthesia can reduce alertness and therefore present potential risks&#xD;
      when driving a vehicle (risk of accident). Some scientific societies recommend not driving&#xD;
      for 12 to 24 hours after sedation or general anesthesia. However, there are conflicting data&#xD;
      in the literature showing that general anesthesia in healthy volunteers does not impair&#xD;
      driving ability as early as 2 hours after the end of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This need not to drive requires the outpatient to have an escort. Unfortunately, some&#xD;
      patients find it difficult to benefit from an adult escort, which can lead to last minute&#xD;
      cancellations, absences or the need for a classic overnight hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare with a simulator the driving performances of&#xD;
      patients who have benefited from deep sedation for an outpatient endoscopic digestive&#xD;
      procedure when they have met the discharge criteria to the performances of their escorts in&#xD;
      order to determine if the conditions are as safe to let them drive home.&#xD;
