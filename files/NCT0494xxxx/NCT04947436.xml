  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive one of three respiratory therapy interventions for airway clearance&#xD;
      assistance: 1) High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and mechanical&#xD;
      insufflation/exsufflation (MIE), 2) HFCWO or 3) MIE. The study period will be six months and&#xD;
      include three clinic visits, baseline and follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months, and 6 monthly&#xD;
      home visits by the respiratory therapist.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project includes both the HFCWO and MIE and will capitalize on the specific&#xD;
      goals of each therapy and address the problem as a whole rather than piece-meal. The HFCWO&#xD;
      aims to mobilize the secretions to the pharynx to allow the patient to expel the secretions.&#xD;
      However, many patients diagnosed with ALS are unable to expel the secretions due to atrophied&#xD;
      expiratory muscles. The HFCWO device uses a small air compressor with a vest that wraps&#xD;
      around the chest to induce airflows to pull secretions from the walls of the airways, thin&#xD;
      the secretions and move them up the airways towards the larger airways and pharynx. The MIE,&#xD;
      a noninvasive therapy, removes secretions in patients who have an ineffective cough because&#xD;
      the peak cough flows are less than 270 L/min. This device applies a positive pressure to the&#xD;
      airway and rapidly switches to a negative pressure applied to the airway. The rapid switch&#xD;
      between the two types of pressure simulates a natural cough, thus assisting with expulsion of&#xD;
      the secretions. Logically, the two mechanisms of action of these devices should work&#xD;
      synergistically to produce effective airway clearance to keep the lungs clear, healthy and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of infections from stagnant secretions. Respiratory infections are especially&#xD;
      serious for patients with ALS because the patient is not able to recuperate from infections&#xD;
      as quickly as a person without ALS. The objective is to determine if changing the use of&#xD;
      existing respiratory therapy devices can improve the physical and psychosocial health and&#xD;
      quality of life for patients diagnosed with ALS and caregivers.&#xD;

        <title>Respiratory Complications Severity</title>
        <description>A 9-item instrument will be used to record change from baseline to 6 months in respiratory complications. These are scored on a scale from best (no complications) to worst (death due to respiratory complications) throughout the study period. Scores range from 0-9 with a score of a 9 indicating no complications.</description>

        <population>Half (50%) of patients were randomized to the group with two devices, while 30% to only the HFCWO device and 20% to only the Mechanical Insufflation/exsufflation device.</population>

            <description>High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation: The HFCWO aims to mobilize the secretions to the pharynx to allow the patient to expel the secretions. However, many ALS patients are unable to expel their secretions due to atrophied expiratory muscles. The HFCWO device uses a small air compressor with a vest that wraps around the chest to induce airflows that pull secretions from the walls of the airways, thin the secretions and move them up the airways towards the larger airways and pharynx.</description>

            <description>Mechanical insufflation/exsufflation: A noninvasive therapy, removes secretions in patients who have an ineffective cough because their peak cough flows are less than 270 L/min. This device applies a positive pressure to the airway and rapidly switches to a negative pressure applied to the airway. The rapid switch between the two types of pressure simulates a natural cough, thus assisting with expulsion of the secretions.</description>
