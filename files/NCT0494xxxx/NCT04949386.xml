    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (1:1) , placebo-controlled phase II study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of S-1226 in Post-COVID-19 subjects (n≤48) with persistent&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms. Subjects will receive twice daily treatments of either Placebo or&#xD;
      S-1226 (8%) for 7 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II proof of concept study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of S-1226 in Post-COVID-19 subjects (n≤48) with persistent&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-1226 contains a potent, safe and well-tolerated bronchodilator gas (extrinsic carbon&#xD;
      dioxide or CO2) and perflubron (PFOB), a synthetic surfactant that facilitates restoration of&#xD;
      surfactant function and mucus clearance. The inhaled S-1226 combination of gas, vapor and&#xD;
      liquid aerosol penetrates obstructed airways, resulting in rapid bronchodilation, enhanced&#xD;
      blood oxygenation, improved mucus clearance and reduction of work of breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-1226 composed&#xD;
      of perflubron with 8% carbon dioxide in subjects with persistent post acute COVID-19&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms. The secondary objective is to establish proof of concept that S-1226 is&#xD;
      effective in normalizing lung symptoms, including cough, breathlessness and lung function in&#xD;
      subjects with persistent post-acute COVID-19 respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three parts: screening and randomization period, Treatment and&#xD;
      evaluation, follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening, and randomization: subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either receive&#xD;
           placebo or S-1226 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment and evaluation period: subjects will receive either placebo -medical grade air&#xD;
           with 3ml saline (0.9% NaCl) - or S-1226 (8% CO2) for 7 days twice daily. A single dose&#xD;
           of S1226 (8%) will be administered over 3-4 minutes at each visit. Subjects will have&#xD;
           the option to receive at home treatments once they been trained and verified as&#xD;
           competent in handling study equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A follow up period 7 days after final treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>16 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number and percent of treatment emergent adverse events will be monitored, recorded and graded for severity and assigned attribution. The severity will be assessed in the following manner:&#xD;
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but are easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type, causing no limitations of usual activities. Signs or symptoms may require minor action or additional therapy.&#xD;
Moderate: Discomfort severe enough to cause some limitations of usual activities and may require action or additional therapy.&#xD;
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to carry out usual activities and requires specific action and/or medical attention. Note: the term severe is not the same as &quot;serious&quot;, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.</description>
