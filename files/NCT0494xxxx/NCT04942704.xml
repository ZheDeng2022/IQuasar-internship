  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop new methods for image processing and enhancement of&#xD;
      MRI data. Different setting of acquisition parameters used in conventional clinical MRI&#xD;
      protocols will be defined, to create &quot;New Protocols&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this study is to assess and to improve the performance of our image&#xD;
      processing methods, by comparing diagnostic qualities of images obtained by conventional MRI&#xD;
      protocols with those obtained by corresponding New Protocols' and processed by our image&#xD;
      enhancement method.&#xD;
