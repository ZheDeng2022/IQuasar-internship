    <textblock>
      this is a voluntary, investigator-initiated, inactivated COVID-19 vaccine controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in adults aged 18&#xD;
      years and above which have immunized with two dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine at least 6&#xD;
      months ago.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 112 participants will be enrolled in the study. All the participants have&#xD;
      immunized with two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine at least 6 months ago. The 98&#xD;
      participants will be inoculated with one dose COVID-19 messenger ribonucleic acid(mRNA)&#xD;
      vaccine from Stemirna Therapeutics Co., Ltd and the others will be inoculated with one dose&#xD;
      inactivated COVID-19 vaccine from institute of medical biology, Chinese academy of medical&#xD;
      sciences(IMBCAMS). Before the inoculation, 14 days and 28 days after the immunization, blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken for determination of neutralizing antibody and immunoglobulin G(IgG)&#xD;
      antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) N protein and S&#xD;
      protein (enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay, ELISA method); and before the inoculation and 28&#xD;
      days after the immunization, blood samples will be taken for detecting specific T cells with&#xD;
      the enzyme-linked immunospot(ELISPOT) assay with an aim to evaluate immunogenicity. Safety&#xD;
      observations for all participants will be conducted from the inoculation to 28 days, and&#xD;
      follow-up of severe adverse events (SAEs) will also be conducted from inoculation to at least&#xD;
      12 months to evaluate the safety of the investigational vaccine.&#xD;
