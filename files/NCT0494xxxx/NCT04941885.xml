  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the important mechanisms for&#xD;
      suppressing tumors of Trastuzumab. Pre-clinical data suggest that the ADCC effect of&#xD;
      Inetetamab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody with a modified Fc segment, is 1.11 times that&#xD;
      of trastuzumab. Previous studies indicated that enhanced ADCC effects can be transformed into&#xD;
      clinical benefits. Immune induction through cyclophosphamide metronomic chemotherapy may&#xD;
      further enhance the ADCC effect of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, we conducted&#xD;
      this study to explore the efficacy and the safety of Inetetamab combined with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide metronomic chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitors(AI) in the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic HER2-positive and HR-positive breast cancer patients and to explore the possible&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

      Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated&#xD;
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of its important mechanisms for suppressing tumors. Pre-clinical&#xD;
      data suggest that the ADCC effect of Inetetamab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody with a&#xD;
      modified Fc segment, is 1.11 times that of trastuzumab. Previous studies indicated that&#xD;
      enhanced ADCC effects can be transformed into clinical benefits, but the absolute benefits&#xD;
      are still unsatisfactory. Further improvement of ADCC effects and monoclonal antibody-induced&#xD;
      immune responses may improve the clinical benefits. Immune induction through cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      metronomic chemotherapy may further enhance the ADCC effect of anti-HER2 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies. According to previous clinical studies, for HR-positive and HER2-positive&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer patients, metronomic chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy&#xD;
      and anti-HER2 targeted therapy may be one of the treatment options. Therefore, we conducted&#xD;
      this study to explore the efficacy and the safety of Inetetamab combined with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide metronomic chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitors(AI) in the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic HER2-positive and HR-positive breast cancer patients, and we further exploring the&#xD;
      possible mechanisms.&#xD;
