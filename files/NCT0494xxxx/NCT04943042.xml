      This is a multi-center, observational, Phase 4 study in patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      (ITP) designed to describe the real-world effectiveness of Doptelet and assess the patterns&#xD;
      of drug utilization to add to the knowledge base regarding the use of Doptelet in routine&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, observational, Phase 4 study in patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      (ITP) designed to describe the real-world effectiveness of Doptelet and assess the patterns&#xD;
      of drug utilization to add to the knowledge base regarding the use of Doptelet in routine&#xD;
      medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for participation will, as part of their routine medical care, be receiving&#xD;
      Doptelet for the treatment of ITP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of the study is to collect both retrospective and prospective data. The main part&#xD;
      of the study will be prospective collecting data on usage, effectiveness, safety, patient-&#xD;
      and clinician-reported outcomes and health economic parameters whereas the retrospective part&#xD;
      will consist of collection of information on previous treatments, reason for treatment switch&#xD;
      and healthcare resource use. The retrospective data collection will be based on the&#xD;
      information available in the patient's medical records. Data will be collected for up to 12&#xD;
      months prior to Doptelet treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective data will be collected at routine clinical visits throughout the study. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 12 (+6) months and will be enrolled until their first scheduled visit&#xD;
      after 12 months of enrollment, or until early termination, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized generic instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts - the EQ-5D descriptive profile which is mapped into a single index value for health status (utility value) and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.</description>

    <description>ITP-PAQ is a disease-specific self-administered tool which was developed and validated to assess health related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult patients with ITP using a 4-week recall period. It consists in 44 items distributed across 10 dimensions: Symptoms (6 items), Bother-Physical Health (3 items), Fatigue/Sleep (4 items), Activity (2 items), Fear (5 items), Psychological Health (5 items), Work (4 items), Social Activity (4 items), Women's Reproductive Health (6 items) and Overall QoL (5 items).

    <time_frame>Data will be collected for all routine visits completed during the study period which is at least 12 but not more than 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item scale developed to assess specifically quality of life concerns related to fatigue in patients with chronic diseases. The scale was initially developed to assess cancer-related fatigue, however it has been since then used and psychometrically validated in other chronic diseases, including ITP. The instrument includes items such as tiredness, weakness, listlessness, lack of energy, and the impact of these feelings on daily functioning over the past seven days. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from &quot;0-Not at all&quot; to &quot;4-Very much&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from enrollment in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected for all routine visits completed during the study period which is at least 12 but not more than 18 months.</time_frame>

    <description>WPAI for specific health problem, WPAI:SHP v2.0 questionnaire is a generic and standard instrument developed to measure the effect of specific health problems and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities during the past seven days. It contains six items which ascertain employment status and quantify absenteeism due to health problems, presenteeism and overall health-related impairment in both paid work and regular activities over the previous 7 days. The WPAI provides quantitative data at the item level compatible with economic modelling.</description>

    <ipd_description>According to Sobi's data sharing policy Sobi may share anonymized clinical study data with qualified researchers. Sobi commits to sharing clinical study data on participant level and summary data for medicines and indications approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and/or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Data access will be granted in response to qualified research requests. All requests are evaluated by a cross functional panel of experts within Sobi.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Evaluated on a case by case basis</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>A decision on data sharing will be based on the following:&#xD;
The scientific merit of the proposal - i.e. the proposal should be scientifically sound, ethical, and have the potential to contribute to the advancement of public health.&#xD;
The feasibility of the research proposal - i.e. the requesting research team must be scientifically qualified and have the resources to conduct the proposed project.&#xD;
Maintenance of personal integrity - i.e. Sobi will not consider sharing individual data if there is a risk of re-identification of individuals despite a proper anonymisation. Moreover, the patients' informed consent will always be respected. Sobi reserves the right to reject the proposal if the anonymisation process will render unusable data.&#xD;
Publication of results - the applicants should commit to submit their findings to a peer-reviewed scientific journal, alternatively to present the results at a congress (poster or similar), regardless of the research outcome.</ipd_access_criteria>
