    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to know the efficacy of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy on Positive&#xD;
      Health Outcomes of Chronic Heart Failure Patients with Depression. It is a Randomized Control&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) in which patients will be selected through purposive sampling techniques. Ages of&#xD;
      patients will be 18-60 years. Data will be collected at outpatient department (OPD) of&#xD;
      Ch.Pervaiz Elahi Institute of Cardiology Multan.Total measured sample size is 70 calculated&#xD;
      by using G*Power 3.1.9.4.Patients will be randomized into Interventional and Control group,&#xD;
      with 1:1 allocation, 35 patients in each group by virtual&#xD;
      randomization(www.randomization.com). Diagnosed patients of heart failure for 6 or more than&#xD;
      6 months duration, EF â‰¤ 40 % on Trans Thoracic Echocardiography, patients with NYHA Heart&#xD;
      Failure class II and III, patients with &quot;mild&quot; to &quot;severe&quot; level of depression based on PHQ-9&#xD;
      .Patients with other Psychiatric Disorders except depression, any substance dependence,&#xD;
      mentally retarded, having personality disorders, already have received any psychotherapy or&#xD;
      any psychiatric medication will be excluded. Patients will be assessed for functional&#xD;
      disability by WHODAS 2.0 and severity of Heart Failure will be assessed by a Cardiologist&#xD;
      using NYHA Heart Failure classification. Patients in experimental group will receive&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) and culturally adapted Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Patients in&#xD;
      control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU) by a Cardiologist .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this experimental study is to study the efficacy of culturally adapted Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy in patients with chronic heart failure with depression. To study the&#xD;
      above-mentioned phenomenon, following hypotheses are formulated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving culturally adapted Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy will show reduction in&#xD;
      their level of depression than patients not receiving intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will improve in NHYA heart failure class, by receiving CaCBT in experimental group&#xD;
      as compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will receive CaCBT will show less repeated Hospitalization in experimental group&#xD;
      as compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will show betterment in the functional disability from&#xD;
      pretest to post-test as compared to non- interventional group.&#xD;

    <description>change in scores of depression will be measured by Patients' Health Questionnaire 9. The PHQ-9 total score ranges from 0 to 27 (scores of 0- 4 are classified as none,5-9 mild depression; 10-14 as moderate depression; 15-19 as moderately severe depression; 20-27 as severe depression )from baseline to 2 and half months of intervention in control and experimental group.</description>

    <description>change in functional disability scores in control and experimental group by world health organization disability assessment schedule II version from baseline to 2 and half months of intervention in control and experimental group. It has 12 items for each item the patient has five choices; the score, depending on the choice, ranges from 0 (none) through to 4 (extreme). Therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 48 points, with higher scores indicating higher functional disability. The score is expressed in percentage (divided by 48 and multiplied by 100 ) .The severity of functional disability is based on the calculated percentage as follows: none (0-4%), mild (5-24%), moderate (25-49%), severe (50-95%), and complete (96-100%) .</description>
