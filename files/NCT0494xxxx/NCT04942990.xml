      Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of calisthenic exercise&#xD;
      training applied via video chat application on physical activity, physical fitness, quality&#xD;
      of life and sleep, and anxiety and depression levels in adolescents during distance&#xD;
      education. Material and methods: In our study, 38 adolescents were randomly divided into two&#xD;
      equal groups as exercise training group and control group. Calisthenic exercise training was&#xD;
      given to the exercise training group for eight weeks, three days a week, via video chat&#xD;
      application and under the supervision of a physiotherapist. The control group was evaluated&#xD;
      before and after the study period. Physical activity levels of individuals; International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Scale, quality of life; Children's Quality of Life Scale, anxiety&#xD;
      depression levels; Beck Anxiety Scale, Reynolds Depression Scale and sleep quality were&#xD;
      evaluated with Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index.&#xD;

    <description>International physical Activity Survey: The short form, which has improved Turkish validity and reliability, consists of 7 questions. It provides information about the time spent in severe, moderate walking and sitting activities over the past week. The total calculated energy is calculated as the met spent per minute.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) has been used to assess sleep quality. Applied at start-up and end of 8 weeks. PSQI allows him to identify disturbances in the last month of his sleep. It consists of 24 questions in total. Components are a test that evaluates sleep time, delays in sleep, frequency and severity of sleep-related problems and the impact of poor sleep on the individual's life activity</description>

    <description>Pediatric Quality of life Questionniare Short Form (PedsQL-SF) has been used to measure the quality of children's lives. Developed by Varni and his friends in 1999, Memik conducted a study of the validity and reliability of the scale in 2008. the scale of 23 points is scored in three areas. On the scale, scores and total points are calculated in the areas of emotional functionality, social functionality and school functionality. The scale is scored 0,25,50,75,100 points, equal to 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 respectively. Scale total score, physical health total score is calculated individually and bullet points are collected assessing emotional, social, school functionality, resulting in psychosocial health total score. The higher the points total, the better the quality of life is concluded</description>

    <description>The duration of the study was targeted as 8 weeks. Our trainings consist of 3 sessions per week, with an average of 45 minutes of calisthenic exercises per session. Exercises initially started with an average of 30 minutes, 10 repetitions, gradually increased difficulty once every two weeks, time increased to 45 minutes movements were modified for those who were forced to perform the exercise program. The program was completed with 5 minutes of warm-up and 5 minutes of cooling exercises before exercise training. All exercises were conducted on a video chat platform supervised by an experienced physiotherapist.</description>
