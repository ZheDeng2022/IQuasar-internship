    <textblock>
      80 complete denture (CD) wearers participated in the quasi-experimental study. Two outcomes&#xD;
      were: 1) oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) assessed using the Oral Impacts on&#xD;
      Daily Performances index, and 2) masticatory performance, determined by a peanut particle&#xD;
      size after 20-stroke mastication. Denture retention and stability were evaluated using the&#xD;
      Chulalongkorn University (CU)-modified Kapur method to classify the CD into acceptable or&#xD;
      unacceptable quality. Data were collected at 3-time points: 1) at baseline (T0), 2) after a&#xD;
      1-month trial of denture adhesive (DA) use (T1), at which time the participants decided&#xD;
      whether to continue using DA, and 3) 1-month after continued or discontinued using DA (T2).&#xD;

      Participants The eligible participants were CD wearers randomly recruited from patients who&#xD;
      visited the Prosthodontic clinic at the Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University from&#xD;
      2015 to 2019. The inclusion criteria were patients who had worn removable maxillary and&#xD;
      mandibular CDs for at least 6 months. The patients who wore a metal-based denture, had a&#xD;
      history of DA use, had difficulty in responding to the interview, or were unwilling to follow&#xD;
      the study protocol were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome was OHRQoL determined using the Thai-version of Oral Impacts on&#xD;
      Daily Performances index. The participants were interviewed whether they had difficulties in&#xD;
      performing the following 8 daily activities: eat, speak, clean denture and mouth, sleep,&#xD;
      smile, emotional stability, social contact, and carry out work or housework. The frequency&#xD;
      and severity of each impact were rated using a five-point Likert scale, and their&#xD;
      multiplication gave a condition-specific impact score. The overall oral impact score was the&#xD;
      sum of all 8 activity scores. The prevalence of an oral impact was categorized into absence&#xD;
      (score = 0) or presence of an oral impact (score &gt; 0). The changes in oral impact score from&#xD;
      T0 to T1 were categorized into 3 types: decreased (T0 score &gt; T1 score), increased (T0 score&#xD;
      &lt; T1 score), and remained absent (T0 score = T1 score = 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome was masticatory performance assessed using the multiple sieve method of&#xD;
      peanut mastication. The participants masticated 3 grams of roasted peanuts for 20 strokes in&#xD;
      triplicate with a 15-minute resting interval between each test. The comminuted peanut&#xD;
      particles were dried and sieved through 12 standard test sieves (Test sieve; Retcsh&#xD;
      Technology GmbH) on a vibrating sieve shaker. A simple linear regression was plotted between&#xD;
      the cumulative weight and diameter of each sieve test. The median peanut particle size (mm)&#xD;
      was the sieve diameter through which 50% of the comminuted peanut particles passed. A smaller&#xD;
      peanut particle size reflected a higher masticatory performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention An external prosthodontist provided a cream-type DA (Polident®, GlaxoSmithKline,&#xD;
      Ireland), and instructed the participants to use the DA cream once a day in the morning and&#xD;
      use it throughout the day. They applied the DA onto maxillary and mandibular dentures on the&#xD;
      tissue surface using a spot method. The participants had to remove the DA and clean the&#xD;
      denture every day after the last meal by soaking and brushing the CD with liquid soap and a&#xD;
      soft toothbrush under running tap water. Two gauze pads were used to remove DA from the&#xD;
      denture and oral mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OHRQoL, masticatory performance, and CD-quality were evaluated at 3-time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. T0, at baseline before using the DA. The baseline information regarding the outcomes was&#xD;
           evaluated. Then, the participants underwent a daily 1-month trial of DA use,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. T1 (T0 + 1 month), after the 1-month trial period of DA use. The outcomes were evaluated&#xD;
           with all participants using DA. The external prosthodontist asked the participants to&#xD;
           choose whether they wanted to continue or discontinue using DA, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. T2 (T0 + 2 months), at 1-month after continuing or discontinuing DA use. At this time,&#xD;
           some participants used DA during the outcome evaluations, while some did not, depending&#xD;
           on the patient's decision on DA use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-blind clinical trial protocol was created. One of the investigators (B.T.) performed&#xD;
      the outcome assessment who did not notice whether the participants continue using DA.&#xD;

    <description>The OHRQoL was assessed using the oral impacts on daily performances (OIDP) index.

The frequency and severity of each impact were rated using a five-point Likert scale, and their multiplication gave a condition-specific (CS) impact score. The overall oral impact score was the sum of all 8 activity scores.
