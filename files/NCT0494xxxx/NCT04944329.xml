  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture in the elderly is a worldwide public health issue and a medical challenge for&#xD;
      early postoperative rehabilitation. More than 2 million people are treated annually with an&#xD;
      annual incidence between 100 and 300/100,000 (USA, Europe, China), resulting in a cost of&#xD;
      billion dollars and a strain on most surgical facilities. In this context, an early surgical&#xD;
      management of patient with fracture within the first 24-48h has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      morbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Covid-19 pandemics, a higher risk of 30-day mortality has been reported in&#xD;
      patients with pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed 0-2 weeks, 3-4 weeks and 5-6 weeks&#xD;
      before surgery compared with patients who did not have a pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
      However, this risk seems to disappear in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 ≥ 7 weeks before&#xD;
      surgery. These findings led to propose delayed elective surgery when the benefit-risk ratio&#xD;
      was acceptable (cancer, cardiac surgeries). However, delaying surgery in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      (with high risk of immune and thrombotic disorders) with hip fracture could be questionable&#xD;
      as the risk related to COVID-19 could be counteracted by the risk delayed surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessing the mortality risk related to hip fracture surgery associated with COVID-19, we&#xD;
      decided to use the French national hospital discharge records database for comparing the&#xD;
      30-day postoperative mortality in patients with hip fracture and with or without an&#xD;
      hospitalization for SARS-COV-2 infection in the 30 previous days before surgery.&#xD;

        Patients with hip fracture, and with or without a SARS-COV-2 disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We included all patients older than 65 years with hip fracture hospitalization recorded&#xD;
        between March 1, 2020 and December 31, detected through ICD-10 diagnosis codes , and with a&#xD;
        DRG Codes (Diagnosis Related Group) indicating a surgical procedure. Patient with hip&#xD;
        fracture hospitalization without a care code indicating a surgical procedure were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Among these patients, we searched for hospitalizations with SARS-CoV2 diagnostic that&#xD;
        occurred within 30 days before the date of hospital admission for hip fracture.&#xD;
