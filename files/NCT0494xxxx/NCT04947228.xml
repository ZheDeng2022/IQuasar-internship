  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The individual restrictions of daily life for patients with PAD are more important than&#xD;
      statistical facts for mortality and morbidity. Intermittent claudication causes a progressive&#xD;
      reduction of the pain-free walking distance (PWD) as an expression of a worsening PAD. This&#xD;
      decrease in physical capability results in a decline of mental health and relevantly reduces&#xD;
      the patients' quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised exercise therapy (SET) is a cornerstone in the conservative management of&#xD;
      intermittent claudication and extends the PWD. Even though SET is easy to practice and highly&#xD;
      cost effective, the adherence to perform SET on a regular base is rather low. The underuse of&#xD;
      exercise can be partly explained by the lack of institutional resources, but also by both&#xD;
      patients' and physicians' lack of interest in exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile health (mHealth) technologies increase the incentives and provide digital support for&#xD;
      patients with PAD on several treatment levels. They might lead to a higher adherence to&#xD;
      exercise training and offer new scopes in patient-centered healthcare, but so far studies&#xD;
      show opposite results. Because app stores are flooded with health and fitness apps, specific&#xD;
      support tools are highly desired by patients with PAD and PAD-specific solutions are missing&#xD;
      so far. Based on this background, the investigators developed a smartphone app named TrackPAD&#xD;
      to provide PAD-specific support for SET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TrackPAD pilot study was designed as a 2-armed randomized controlled trial and included&#xD;
      patients with diagnosed and symptomatic PAD. Patients were randomized by the Center for&#xD;
      Clinical Studies in Essen using the TENALEA software into 2 groups. The control group&#xD;
      included participants with standard care and no further mobile intervention. The intervention&#xD;
      group included participants with standard care and additional mHealth-based self-tracking of&#xD;
      their physical activity using trackPAD.&#xD;
