  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma are the two most common causes of&#xD;
      primary liver cancer and HCC is the second highest cause of cancer death worldwide. It is&#xD;
      known that most of these cancers occur in patients who already have a liver condition.&#xD;
      Despite close monitoring of many patients who have liver disease with regular ultrasound&#xD;
      scans, HCC and cholangiocarcinoma are often discovered at a late stage. This is because they&#xD;
      rarely cause symptoms until they have reached an advanced stage. Early identification of&#xD;
      these cancers would enable more patients to have curative treatments such as surgery or liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to collect blood and urine samples as well as small samples of cells&#xD;
      directly from the liver. In some cases this will be done using a technique called liver fine&#xD;
      needle aspiration. This technique is low risk and has been successfully used in other&#xD;
      studies. The investigators will compare samples from patients with cancer to those of&#xD;
      patients with other diseases of the liver who are at risk of developing cancer in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to detect changes in the liver, blood, urine and/or bile of patients&#xD;
      who have liver conditions that could tell us their risk of a future cancer. These changes&#xD;
      could be in the types of white blood cells found within the liver, or, they may be in&#xD;
      products secreted by liver cells. In the latter case the liver cells may release small pieces&#xD;
      of their DNA that could be detected in the blood. When liver cells are dysfunctional, they&#xD;
      may also change the types of metabolic products that they produce, and the investigators may&#xD;
      be able to detect these changes in the urine or bile.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to perform a characterisation of the cancer predisposing 'field&#xD;
      effect' that is associated with hepatic &amp; hepato-biliary malignancy, and, to identify&#xD;
      minimally invasive biomarkers that may detect this field effect. This will be achieved&#xD;
      through collection of patient samples (Tissue/Blood/Urine/Bile). Comparisons will then be&#xD;
      made between patients with hepatic &amp; hepatobiliary cancer and patients with chronic liver&#xD;
      disease and also longitudinally in individual patients who either develop or are cured of&#xD;
      hepatic &amp; hepato-biliary malignancy during the study. The investigators hope to exploit this&#xD;
      knowledge to develop novel biomarker candidates that may ultimately form inputs to a&#xD;
      multi-parametric early cancer detection model. The study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a cohort of patients with HCC, cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastases and a&#xD;
           cohort of chronic liver disease patients representing all the commonly encountered&#xD;
           aetiologies (viral, metabolic, autoimmune and alcohol related liver disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect samples from directly within the non-cancerous liver (FNA&#xD;
           liver/biopsy/ablation/resection specimens), blood and urine in addition tumour tissue&#xD;
           (resection/biopsy/ablation), bile and bile duct brushings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Flow cytometric &amp; molecular biologic analysis of tissue and peripheral blood and bile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Transcriptomic analysis of cell populations in liver and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Genetic &amp; molecular biologic analysis of hepatic and immune cells and secreted products.&#xD;
