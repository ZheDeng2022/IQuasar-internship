  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) of JZP458 in participants with ALL/LBL who&#xD;
      are hypersensitive to an E.coli-derived asparaginase (allergic reaction or silent&#xD;
      inactivation) and unable to access alternative licensed treatment, to receive JZP458&#xD;
      treatment prior to potential Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and commercial&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JZP458 is a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase that utilizes a novel Pseudomonas fluorescent&#xD;
      technology expression platform to produce an enzyme with no immunologic cross-reactivity to&#xD;
      E.coli-derived asparaginases. JZP458 is currently being studied in an open-label,&#xD;
      multicenter, dose confirmation, and Pharmacokinetic (PK) study of JZP458 in patients (of any&#xD;
      age) with ALL/LBL who are hypersensitive to E. coli-derived asparaginases (allergic reaction&#xD;
      or silent inactivation). This study is designed to assess tolerability and efficacy by&#xD;
      measuring asparaginase activity. For the EAP, JZP458 will be provided free of charge by the&#xD;
      Sponsor for the duration of the program. In addition, JZP458 will continue to be provided to&#xD;
      eligible patients at referring sites until it becomes commercially available in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JZP458 will be administered per each patient's original treatment plan, as long as the&#xD;
      patient derives clinical benefit.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Adult and pediatric patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Lymphoblastic&#xD;
        Lymphoma (LBL) who are hypersensitive to E.coli-derived asparaginases (allergic reaction or&#xD;
        silent inactivation) and meet the criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (Initial Requests):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient (or parent/legally authorized representative thereof) is able to understand&#xD;
             and voluntarily give informed consent/assent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a diagnosis of ALL or LBL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient received appropriate standard treatment without success (or no standard&#xD;
             treatment exists for the patient's condition), and no satisfactory alternative drug is&#xD;
             available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient had a ≥ Grade 2 allergic reaction (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
             Events [CTCAE] v5.0) to a long-acting E. coli-derived asparaginase OR have silent&#xD;
             inactivation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient, in Investigators' opinion, has fully recovered from their prior allergic&#xD;
             reaction to E. coli-derived asparaginase Note: Patients must have completed&#xD;
             antihistamine, epinephrine, and/or corticosteroid treatment for the allergic reaction&#xD;
             ≥ 24 hours prior to JZP458 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has adequate liver function, defined as: direct (conjugated) bilirubin ≤ 3X&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN); serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)(alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase [ALT]), and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)(aspartate&#xD;
             transaminase [AST]) ≤ 5X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female patients of childbearing potential (i.e., fertile, following menarche) and&#xD;
             male patients who have female partners of childbearing potential:&#xD;
