    <textblock>
      A phase II, single-arm, open-label study that assesses feasibility, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitor in stage I-IIIB NSCLC&#xD;
      adult patients followed by adjuvant treatment for up to 1 year with PD-(L)1 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be&#xD;
      administered before surgery, followed by another one to two cycles of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitor and PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy for up&#xD;
      to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of neoadjuvant therapy and before surgery, a tumor assessment will be done.&#xD;
      Patients with stable disease or partial response may be considered for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The report imaging response and pathological response rate will be evaluated. Patients&#xD;
      eligible for the trial are those with a histological diagnosis or cytologically proven&#xD;
      operable and resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. The total number of patients to be&#xD;
      included will be 60 from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual period of 2 years or until the inclusion of the last patient necessary to achieve the&#xD;
      sample set in the protocol of 60 patients. After that all patients will be treated for up to&#xD;
      1 year with adjuvant immunotherapy and they will be followed during 3 years after adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
