  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned as a prospective quasi-experimental study with the control group to&#xD;
      determine the effect of structured pressure injury patient education (program on the&#xD;
      knowledge, participation, wound healing progress, and quality of life among patients with&#xD;
      limited mobility. We hypothesized that there would be a significant effect of structured&#xD;
      pressure injury patient education on patient's knowledge, participation, wound healing rate,&#xD;
      and quality of life between the control and intervention group over time.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with limited mobility and pressure injury are always at higher risk of having&#xD;
      multiple functional, social, psychological, and financial repercussions. Without intensive PI&#xD;
      management and prevention, these populations continue to suffer from prolonged pain,&#xD;
      infection, social isolation, and exacerbation of mental health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many preventive strategies and management are available to ease patient burden due to&#xD;
      pressure injury, involving patient to take part in their care make a huge difference in&#xD;
      patient outcome. In Malaysia, nurses play an important role in providing patient education on&#xD;
      pressure injury, usually delivered through informal routine care, by distributing information&#xD;
      leaflet or via digital resources on the Ministry of Health's website. However, the existing&#xD;
      pressure injury education content is too broad, only emphasizing pressure injury prevention&#xD;
      and no information on pressure injury care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few pieces of evidence reported on the effectiveness of patient education were able to&#xD;
      improve patient knowledge on PI, increase patient participation in PI care associate with&#xD;
      wound healing and improve the quality of life. However, there is a content gap in pressure&#xD;
      injury patient education, which is wound care. While there a lot of patient education on&#xD;
      pressure injury had been conducted extensively in the literature review, the components of&#xD;
      wound care in pressure injury patient education are still unclear. Thus the primary objective&#xD;
      of this study is to identify the effect of structured pressure injury patient education on&#xD;
      the knowledge, participation, wound healing progress, and quality of life among patients with&#xD;
      limited mobility. We hypothesized that there would be a significant effect of structured&#xD;
      pressure injury patient education compared to the standard patient education on patient's&#xD;
      knowledge, participation, wound healing rate, and quality of life between control and&#xD;
      intervention group over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this research objective, we opt to conduct a quasi-experimental study-calculation&#xD;
      of sample size is by using STATA 12.0 program. To calculate the sample size, power at 80%,&#xD;
      and alpha was pre-set at 0.05. Mean, and standard deviation (σ) were extracted from previous&#xD;
      researcher. Based on the calculation, a total of 116 eligible samples will be recruited with&#xD;
      58 samples each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be assigned to the experimental group (structured&#xD;
      pressure injury patient education) and control group (standard patient education). Eight&#xD;
      medical-surgical wards with a high prevalence of pressure injury were identified and invited&#xD;
      to participate. Four wards agreed (medical ward, two multidisciplinary wards, and orthopedic&#xD;
      ward), and the rest unable to participates because allocated as active COVID-19 ward. Thus,&#xD;
      potential participants for this study will be recruited in these four wards in this tertiary&#xD;
      hospital. Four wards were allocated into intervention or control using flipping coins&#xD;
      methods. Two wards allocate to intervention, and another two allocate for the intervention&#xD;
      group. Considering the limited availability of the target population set in the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria earlier, the researcher opts to use convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the implementation of the study, permission was obtained from the Medical Research&#xD;
      Ethical Committee of the Malaysian Ministry of Health. The patient included in the study&#xD;
      sample will be informed before the study that the study's purpose and participation are&#xD;
      voluntary, and the patient may withdraw at any time without penalties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools; In this study, a checklist and self-administered questionnaires will&#xD;
      be used to measure the four outcomes of this research which are 1) knowledge, 2)&#xD;
      participation, 3) wound healing progress, and 4) quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Information Checklist:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checklists consist of three parts: part I- patient health status, part II: Wound Healing&#xD;
      Progress (PUSH Tool 3.0), and part III- Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF). This checklist will&#xD;
      be filled up by the wound care nurse at baseline (T0), week-4 (T1), and week-8 (T2). The&#xD;
      wound care nurse will be given a briefing and manual on how to fill-up the form. The wound&#xD;
      care nurse responsible for filling up the required checklist is not aware of the study&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Patient health status - patient's registration ID, gender, ward, IC number, age,&#xD;
      comorbidities, PI categories, and PI site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Wound Healing Progress (PUSH Tools 3.0) - to measure PI healing progress. The total&#xD;
      score will be ranging between 0 to 17, lower PUSH tools 3.0 indicate better-wound healing&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Nutritional Status (MNA-SF) - to determine the patient's current nutritional status.&#xD;
      It is further be classified into three categories: normal nutritional status (12-14 points),&#xD;
      at risk of malnutrition (8-11 points), and malnourished (0 - 7 points). Measure once at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-administered questionnaires Part I: Sociodemographic - sociodemographic characteristics,&#xD;
      including seven components: age, socio-economic status, gender, level of education level,&#xD;
      ethnicity, occupation, and marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Knowledge on Prevention and Treatment on Pressure Injury - use to self-assess basic&#xD;
      knowledge of the prevention and treatment of pressure injury using Skin-Management Needs&#xD;
      Assessment Checklist. The total score is expressed as a percentage and interpreted as a&#xD;
      higher score reflecting better knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: Patient Participation - self-administered questionnaire by which patient will&#xD;
      self-rate their active participation based on the given items. The total score is expressed&#xD;
      as a percentage and interpreted as a higher score reflecting greater participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IV: Quality of Life - PU-QOL questionnaire is a PI-specific questionnaire that measuring&#xD;
      how much does the occurrence of PI bothers their life. Scale scores are generated by summing&#xD;
      items and then transforming them to a 0-100 scale. High scores indicate more excellent&#xD;
      patient bother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis The sociodemographic data of the patient will be described as&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages for categorical data; mean and standard deviation for continuous&#xD;
      data. Descriptive analysis was used to estimate the score of each outcome (patient's&#xD;
      knowledge, participation, wound healing progress, and quality of life). The Chi-square test&#xD;
      was used to test the crude associations for categorical data. Comparison between two groups&#xD;
      of continuous variables will be made using an independent t-test. All analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted at a 5% significant level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of efficacy The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed using repeated&#xD;
      measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), modeling the within-subject effects. Model fit will&#xD;
      be determined using residual plots and lack-of-fit tests. The effect sizes of the ANCOVA will&#xD;
      be interpreted according to Cohen (a partial η2 of .01 can be considered a small effect, a&#xD;
      partial η2 of .06 can be considered a medium effect, and a partial η2 of .14 can be&#xD;
      considered a significant effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risk, benefit, and patient's safety All potential participants will be ensured that&#xD;
      patient safety will be the priority upon conducting this study. Participation in this study&#xD;
      will not affect their treatment, and the risk is very minimal. They are free to decline to&#xD;
      answer any of the questions that they feel uncomfortable with. The benefit of the study may&#xD;
      vary, as reported in previous research. However, the information obtained from this study&#xD;
      will help the patient to gain more understanding on pressure injury, how to prevent pressure&#xD;
      injury in the future from getting worse, and knowledge on pressure injury care. A booklet on&#xD;
      pressure injury education as education material will also be provided to patients in both&#xD;
      control and intervention groups for future references.&#xD;
