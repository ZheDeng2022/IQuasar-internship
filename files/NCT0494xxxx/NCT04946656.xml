  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication is the most efficacious treatment of an opioid use disorder, including methadone,&#xD;
      buprenorphine, and naltrexone. However, many patients experience withdrawal symptoms, which&#xD;
      prevents them from being successfully inducted onto medication for opioid use disorder. This&#xD;
      study is a pilot study investigating whether blocking the SPG helps reduce withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms in OUD. This study does not involve treatment or induction onto medications. It is a&#xD;
      proof of principal study only. We will recruit non-treatment seeking subjects with OUD who&#xD;
      are admitted to the research unit for all procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is a collection of neurons involved in autonomic regulation&#xD;
      (which refers to bodily processes that are automatic like heart rate and blood pressure).&#xD;
      Blocking the SPG is used to treat disorders, such as migraines or cluster headaches (short,&#xD;
      severe headaches that occur together). The procedure will be performed by a doctor&#xD;
      (specialized in ear, nose throat surgery) and would first involve the application of numbing&#xD;
      nasal spray to both nostrils, which lasts about two hours and might reduce smell during that&#xD;
      time. This is followed by an injection of a stronger numbing agent (similar to the type used&#xD;
      by dentists) to the nerve bundles in the back of the nasal passages (one side at a time) via&#xD;
      a tool, known as an endoscope which is a rigid tube with a camera on the end. The procedure&#xD;
      is not painful. Previous studies have shown that clonidine, which inhibits the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system, is helpful for reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. However, the&#xD;
      dosing of clonidine is limited by side effects (lowered blood pressure and heart rate) and&#xD;
      compliance. Furthermore, withdrawal is among the most significant barriers to substance&#xD;
      treatment and ultimately overcoming a substance use disorder. Thus, we would like to explore&#xD;
      whether a more targeted intervention would improve rates of successful acute detoxification&#xD;
      while overcoming the aforementioned challenges of systemic side effects and compliance issues&#xD;
      observed with the use of oral agents.&#xD;
