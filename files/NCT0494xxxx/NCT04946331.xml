    <textblock>
      Our research uses the electrical impedance tomography system (EIT), which can use the applied&#xD;
      current and measurement voltage through the body surface electrode group, and use the&#xD;
      reconstruction algorithm to construct an image imaging system that exceeds the&#xD;
      cross-sectional, which can provide images of the internal physiological changes of the chest&#xD;
      contour, in order to quantify the changes in lung function caused by rib fractures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are one of the most common injuries following blunt trauma, occurring in&#xD;
      approximately 10% of all trauma patients. Rib fracture injuries extend across a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of severity from a single fractured rib which may be sustained in a fall or sporting&#xD;
      injury, to multiple fractured ribs resulting in a flail chest with paradoxical chest wall&#xD;
      movement and respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flail chest, which defines multiple adjacent ribs broken in multiple places, is the most&#xD;
      serious chest injury, and it damages the chest wall integrity and causes &quot;paradoxical motion&quot;&#xD;
      from the detachment of a segment from the rest of the chest wall. Surgical management of rib&#xD;
      fractures has received increasing attention in recent years with the development of new&#xD;
      fixation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality rate is 4% to 20%. Flail chest (FC), which defines multiple adjacent ribs&#xD;
      broken in multiple places, is the most serious chest injury, and it damages the chest wall&#xD;
      integrity and causes &quot;paradoxical motion&quot; from the detachment of a segment from the rest of&#xD;
      the chest wall. Pulmonary contusion (PC) is the most common chest injury. These conditions&#xD;
      frequently exist at the same time. Currently, a deeper understanding of FC pathophysiology&#xD;
      exists, and its management has evolved substantially over the past 6 decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The earliest treatment for FC was surgery. With the increasing technological advancements&#xD;
      available in the intensive care unit, conservative management, based on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation supplemented with intensive pain control, has become more common. Using positive&#xD;
      airway pressure to reduce the asynchronous movement of FC could avoid surgical risks and&#xD;
      postoperative complications. Conservative treatment has been administered frequently in&#xD;
      previous years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing number of researchers have found that surgery for FC could reduce the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, the ICU length of stay, the hospital length of stay, the incidence of&#xD;
      pneumonia and tracheostomy, and mortality. Additional benefits included decreased doses of&#xD;
      analgesic and sedative drugs and avoidance of thoracic deformity, and patients could return&#xD;
      to previous employment quicker than could those treated conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the improvement of lung function is a key indicator for the treatment of rib&#xD;
      fractures and thoracic trauma, because lung function is related to lung expansion, chest wall&#xD;
      stability, and thoracic deformation, which can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure,&#xD;
      difficult weaning, and prolong hospitalization. However, traditional pulmonary function&#xD;
      measurement is based on an Incentive Spirometry. This examination requires the cooperation of&#xD;
      the patient and also requires sufficient space and equipment. It is not suitable for acute&#xD;
      trauma patients in intensive care units. In addition, the induced spirometer can only measure&#xD;
      respiratory parameters such as vital capacity. It cannot locate and monitor the collapse part&#xD;
      of lung and the range of pulmonary atelectasis. It must rely heavily on computer tomography&#xD;
      and other imaging assistance, which is very unsatisfactory. Therefore, how to simultaneously&#xD;
      develop an effective monitoring method for lung function and lung expansion is the current&#xD;
      top priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reason, our research uses the electrical impedance tomography system (EIT), which&#xD;
      can use the applied current and measurement voltage through the body surface electrode group,&#xD;
      and use the reconstruction algorithm to construct an image imaging system that exceeds the&#xD;
      cross-sectional, which can provide images of the internal physiological changes of the chest&#xD;
      contour, in order to quantify the changes in lung function caused by rib fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a combine research project of patients from the Department of Traumatology of&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital and the Department of Traumatology of Far Eastern&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital. The study is expected to be collected from July 2021 to December 2022 for&#xD;
      one and a half years. Hospitalized patients with traumatic rib fractures were collected and&#xD;
      analyzed in a prospective study method, and the patients with internal rib fractures in Far&#xD;
      Eastern Memorial Hospital were collected and analyzed, and their lung function changes after&#xD;
      the operation will be tracked.&#xD;
