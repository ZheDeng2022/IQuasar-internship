      The objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the post-operative pain frequency after single visit root canal versus&#xD;
           multiple visit root canal treatment in patients with non-vital teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative pain is less frequent after single visit root canal than multiple visit&#xD;
           root canal treatment in patients with non-vital teeth.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY This Randomized control trial was done in Outdoor patients Department of&#xD;
      Operative Dentistry at Fatima Memorial Hospital. Informed written consent was taken from all&#xD;
      patients who were willing to participate in the study. Patients who were diagnosed with&#xD;
      non-vital teeth were considered for this study. Socio-demographic data and symptoms were&#xD;
      recorded, subjects were examined and relevant investigations (vitality tests and radiographs)&#xD;
      carried out. The patients were randomly divided into two groups through lottery method. Group&#xD;
      A the treatment was done in one visit while in group B treatment was completed in two visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard procedure for both groups at first visit was administration of local anesthesia&#xD;
      (1.8ml 2% Lignocaine with 1:10000 epinephrine), standard access cavity preparation followed&#xD;
      by rubber dam isolation and pulp extirpation. After the confirmation of canal patency and&#xD;
      working length radiograph, canals were prepared with the combination of hand files and&#xD;
      engine-driven rotary nickel-titanium files (DENTSPLY Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland)&#xD;
      following manufacturer's instructions. 17%Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA )gel was used&#xD;
      as a lubricant. Irrigation was performed with 2.5% NaOCl after each instrument in all cases.&#xD;
      At the first visit, all teeth were prepared to working length and dried with paper points.&#xD;
      Canals in Group A were filled with protaper universal gutta-percha (DENTSPLY Maillefer) and&#xD;
      calcium hydroxide based sealer and restored with permanent restorative material in the same&#xD;
      visit. In Group B after the canal preparation non-setting calcium hydroxide paste was placed&#xD;
      with a sterile dry cotton pellet in the canal and tooth was restored with a minimum of 3.0mm&#xD;
      Cavit. Patients in Group 2 were recalled after 1 week and the obturation technique same as&#xD;
      Group 1 was followed in the second visit. After obturation, the patients in both the groups&#xD;
      were recalled after 48 hours and assessed using visual analogue scale regarding presence and&#xD;
      absence of post-operative pain. A value of 0-1 on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale was&#xD;
      considered as absence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data was entered and analyzed in the SPSS-20. For descriptive analysis, mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation was reported for age. Percentage for male and female participants was presented for&#xD;
      gender distribution. The incidence of post-operative pain for single visit root canal and&#xD;
      multiple visit root canal was determined. A chi-square test was used to determine the&#xD;
      frequency of post-operative pain in both groups. A P value of 0.05 or less was taken as&#xD;
      significant. Data was stratified more scientific manner in Pakistani population. So, the&#xD;
      results of this study would add to the literature about the better, time saving and less&#xD;
      painful (ROOT CANAL TREATMENT)RCT strategy in term of post- operative pain management.&#xD;
