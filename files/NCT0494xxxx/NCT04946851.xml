      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health problem. In the U.S., 16 to 18 million&#xD;
      adults have an AUD. Researchers want to test an assessment tool called the ANA. It uses&#xD;
      self-report and behavioral measures to assess 3 neuroscience domains of addiction. They hope&#xD;
      to better understand, manage, prevent, and treat AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how people s brains function related to their drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 years and older who have enrolled in NIAAA natural history study 14-AA-0181.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys and tasks on a computer. The surveys and tasks assess a&#xD;
      range of aspects of thinking and making decisions. The surveys and tasks also assess&#xD;
      behaviors and feelings about alcohol and other rewards, and negative emotions. Participants&#xD;
      will spend 90 minutes on the computer. Then they will take a break. In total, they will spend&#xD;
      4 blocks of time on the computer. Each block will last 90 minutes. They will take a break in&#xD;
      between each block of time. They can take more breaks if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient participants and healthy volunteers will complete this study in 1 visit. It will&#xD;
      last about 6 hours. A second visit may be scheduled if needed. Outpatient participants will&#xD;
      take a breath alcohol test. If their test is positive, their visit may be rescheduled or they&#xD;
      may be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient participants will complete this study over several days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from participants in this study may be combined and analyzed with their data&#xD;
      from NIAAA study 14-AA-0181 and/or NIAAA imaging study 14-AA-0080.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a natural history protocol examining a battery of assessments designed to examine&#xD;
      three neurofunctional domains relevant to alcohol use disorder (AUD), negative emotionality,&#xD;
      incentive salience and executive function. The study will examine the relationships among the&#xD;
      three ANA domains with the goal of identifying sub-types of AUD based on variation in the ANA&#xD;
      domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two primary hypothesis (1) the ANA domains are distinct from one another; and (2) subtypes of&#xD;
      AUD will be informed by variation in the ANA domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the relationship between the three ANA domains (i.e. Negative Emotionality,&#xD;
           Incentive Salience, Executive Function).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the different subtypes of AUD based on variation in the ANA domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Latent factors of each of the ANA domains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative emotionality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentive Salience&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive Function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any individual with &gt;=18 years of age who expressed interest in participating in this study&#xD;

        The target population for this study includes adults across the spectrum of alcohol use who&#xD;
        have been screened under the NIAAA screening protocol (14-AA-0181). This sample includes&#xD;
        non-drinkers, light drinkers, non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers, and treatment-seeking&#xD;
        individuals with alcohol use disorder. Recruitment will be open to all participants from&#xD;
        the NIAAA screening protocol.&#xD;

        be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be tested at the time of consent and study procedures using an alcohol&#xD;
        breathlyzer, and individuals with a positive breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) will be&#xD;
        rescheduled or withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, individuals who are determined by the PI, AI, Clinician or Nurse Practitioner&#xD;
        to be uncooperative or unable to provide consent, will not be invited to participate in&#xD;
        this study.&#xD;
