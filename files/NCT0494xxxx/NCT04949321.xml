  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the optimal delay after Gadolinium injection to analysis inner ear structures as&#xD;
      measured by repeated MR 3D-FLAIR Weighted Imaging. We hypothesize that the endolymphatic&#xD;
      structures can be distinguished earlier than 4 hours after contrast media injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gadolinium contrast agents are now required to cross the blood-perilymph inner ear&#xD;
      barrier after an intravenous administration in order to assess the endolymphatic structures&#xD;
      in patients with vertigo or hearing loss, using MRI with delayed acquisition (at least 4&#xD;
      hours between injection and images acquisition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique relies on the glymphatic diffusion of the gadolinium agents (Naganawa et&#xD;
      al.,MRM Sci 2017) and has proved to be useful in patients with Meniere's Disease (Naganawa et&#xD;
      al., AJNR 2014, Attyé et al., Eur Radiol 2018), Recurrent Peripheral Vestibulopathy (Attye et&#xD;
      al., Eur Radiol 2015) or Otosclerosis (Mukaida et al., Otol Neurotol 2015), leading to&#xD;
      numerous scientific publications over the last decade. The inner ear perilymph enhancement is&#xD;
      particularly important to distinguish the saccule from the utricle, these inner ear&#xD;
      structures were recently used to classify with imaging Meniere's Disease patient (Attye et&#xD;
      al; European Radiology 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently demonstrated in patients (Eliezer et al., J Neuroradiol 2018), comparing the&#xD;
      effect of two macrocyclic contrast agents (Gd-DOTA, Dotarem® and Gd-DO3A-butrol, Gadovist®),&#xD;
      that the Gd-DO3A-butrol better enhanced inner ear structures that Gd-DOTA, both with&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative analysis, allowing to more accurately diagnose endolymphatic&#xD;
      hydrops in Meniere's Disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have speculated that the differences in the physiochemical properties of Gd-contrast&#xD;
      agents (concentration, relaxivity, osmalality) are determining factors to cross the&#xD;
      blood-perilymph barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These properties should allow scanning diseased patients earlier after contrast media&#xD;
      administration, the delay between the injection and MRI acquisition being actually a&#xD;
      limitation to expand this technique in the clinical setting, particularly with 1.5T magnets,&#xD;
      due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio using 3D-FLAIR sequences analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we want to conduct multi-centre prospective clinical and radiological study to&#xD;
      determine the optimal timing to explore Meniere's Disease patient after Gadobutrol injection&#xD;
      with single dose intravenous administration.&#xD;
