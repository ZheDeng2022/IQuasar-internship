  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the present study are to compare the survival rates and possible biological&#xD;
      and technical complications of metal-ceramic, and monolithic third-generation zirconia&#xD;
      posterior crowns. The null hypothesis is that no diﬀerences would be found between the&#xD;
      parameters studied for each type of restoration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy patients requiring at least one crown in the posterior region of the maxilla or&#xD;
      mandible were included in this study. All subjects were recruited from the Master in&#xD;
      Buccofacial Prostheses and Occlusion (Faculty of Odontology, University Complutense of&#xD;
      Madrid, Spain). Before treatment, patients were informed of the study objectives, clinical&#xD;
      procedures, materials used, advantages and possible risks of the ceramic material, and other&#xD;
      therapeutic alternatives. Prior to the study, participants were asked to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent. Seventy posterior crowns were produced and allocated in parallel and&#xD;
      randomly to either monolithic third-generation zirconia, or metal-ceramic (MC) restorations.&#xD;
      The clinical procedures were performed by two experienced clinicians. All participants&#xD;
      received oral hygiene instructions and a professional tooth cleaning prior to prosthetic&#xD;
      treatment. The abutment teeth were prepared with a 0.8- to 1-mm-wide circumferential chamfer,&#xD;
      an axial reduction of 1 mm and an occlusal reduction of 1- to 2.0-mm. A 10- to 15- degree&#xD;
      angle of convergence was achieved for the axial walls. Tooth preparations were scanned with&#xD;
      an intraoral scanner and the crowns were designed using speciﬁc software. The restorations&#xD;
      were then cemented using a resin self-adhesive cement. After cementation, occlusal contacts&#xD;
      were evaluated, and the adjusted surfaces were polished using a porcelain polishing kit. The&#xD;
      70 crowns were examined at 1week (baseline),1, 2 and 3 years by 2 researchers who were not&#xD;
      involved in the restorative treatment.&#xD;
