  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A digital tool, called ReferID has been developed to facilitate the review of asthma&#xD;
      patients. It aims to assist in the identification of patients with uncontrolled and/or severe&#xD;
      asthma and to ensure a timely referral to secondary care where appropriate. To validate the&#xD;
      tool, patients will be randomised to have a review with a healthcare professional using tool&#xD;
      to facilitate the review or to continue receiving usual care. Outcome measures including&#xD;
      exacerbation frequency and level of asthma control will be assessed at 12 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma control questionnaire completed on day 1 and at 12 months after initial consultation. Total score ranges from 0-6, with 0 = no impairment due to asthma, 6 = maximum impairment due to asthma.</description>

    <description>Change in quality of life score at day 1 and at 12 months (mAQLQ). Score for each question ranges from 0-7, with 0 = totally limited, 7 = not limited at all. The score is calculated as an average for each domain, with a clinically minimum difference of 0.5.</description>
