  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be conducted to compare the clinical performance of self adhesive&#xD;
      giomer containing flowable composite and putty nanohybrid resin composite in class V cavities&#xD;
      over one year follow-up&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be conducted in Department of Conservative Dentistry, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry,Cairo university outpatient clinic. The Operator in charge will be: Salma Mohamed&#xD;
      Monir (S.M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will bear ultimate responsibility for all activities associated with the&#xD;
      conduct of a research project including recruitment of patients, explaining and performing&#xD;
      the procedures to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of patients that come to the Conservative Dentistry Department Clinic seeking&#xD;
      dental care will continue until the target population is achieved. The patients will be&#xD;
      subjected to full examination and diagnosis using dental charts. Once the patients that are&#xD;
      potentially eligible for this study are identified, the patients will be contacted by the&#xD;
      research investigator (S.M) who will explain the study and ascertains the patient's interest.&#xD;
      If interested, more detailed evaluations and preparations are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done using simple randomization by (N.K) by generating numbers from&#xD;
      1:100 into two columns according to interventions/Control assessment methods. The allocation&#xD;
      sequence will be generated using (www.randomization.com) The randomization list will be kept&#xD;
      with (N.K) and will be kept secured away to ensure no tampering with the random list. Each&#xD;
      participant will choose a random number from an opaque sealed envelope. When the participant&#xD;
      chooses an envelope, it will be signed by the patient and the supervisor and the number on&#xD;
      the envelope will be recorded in the patient chart to ensure that the patient is assigned to&#xD;
      the randomized group The assessors, statistician and the patients will be blinded to&#xD;
      intervention/control assessment methods; Triple blinded study. Also, it will not be allowed&#xD;
      amongst the examiners to exchange any information throughout the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every patient medical and dental history will be taken. Examination charts will be filled&#xD;
      by the investigator S.M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending at the Department of Conservative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo&#xD;
      University will be screened. Those who meet the study inclusion criteria will be recruited,&#xD;
      will be informed with the study and an informed consent will be signed if the patients&#xD;
      approve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal treatment will be made and oral hygiene instructions will be enforced. Then, the&#xD;
      operator will start rubber-dam isolation and cavity preparation is done as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cavity preparation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given local anesthesia as required, and the teeth will be isolated. A No.&#xD;
      #330 bur (0.8 mm in diameter and 1.6 mm in length) in a high speed hand piece with air /water&#xD;
      coolant will be used to prepare class V cavity preparations. Any tooth that will suffer from&#xD;
      pulpal exposure will be excluded from the study. Remaining caries will be excavated by a&#xD;
      sharp excavator. A 1mm bevel will be prepared in enamel margins (Folwaczny et al., 2001).&#xD;
      According to the concealed envelope, the tooth will be assigned to one of both treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Selective enamel etching will be done and a universal adhesive (Prime&amp;Bond&#xD;
      universal™ ,Dentsply)will be applied to both enamel and dentin. After gentle dryness and&#xD;
      solvent evaporation the bonding agent will be cured for 20 seconds. Composite (Neo&#xD;
      Spectra™ST, Dentsply, Sirona, USA) will be placed incrementally and light cured for 20&#xD;
      seconds (Noé Orellana et al., 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Cleaning and gentle air blowing of the preparation. Then applying FIT SA&#xD;
      F03 (Low Flow), SHOFU, USA. Spread in a thin layer (≤0.5mm) on the prepared surface with&#xD;
      needle tip, microbrush and gently air-blow leave for 20 seconds then light cure for 5&#xD;
      seconds. Then, apply additional increments (≤2mm) of FIT SA and light cure each increment for&#xD;
      10 seconds then finish and polish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post curing will be done using glycerin to decrease the oxygen inhibited layer (Strnad et&#xD;
      al.,2015). Finishing will be done using yellow and white finishing stones. More finishing and&#xD;
      polishing will be done. Rubber-dam will be removed and patients will be recalled for&#xD;
      evaluation after 3, 6 and 12 months. A.R and Y.S will be blinded to both treatment groups. AR&#xD;
      and Y.S will give the restorations a score using Modified USPHS score.&#xD;
