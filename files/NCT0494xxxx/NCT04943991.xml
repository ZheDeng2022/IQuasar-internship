      This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of Fabry Disease (FD) among a cohort of high risk&#xD;
      patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) presenting at the University Hospital&#xD;
      Würzburg over the last 20 years. Fabry disease is a rare disease that is known to be&#xD;
      consistently underdiagnosed due to its largely variable symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that an early Fabry diagnosis is crucial for maximum benefit from therapies&#xD;
      available, screening for Fabry patients can contribute to preventing development and&#xD;
      worsening of symptoms in Fabry patients with LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a positive diagnosis in a family member opens the possibility to diagnose&#xD;
      further family members in an earlier stage of the disease, therefore allowing treatment of&#xD;
      symptoms and organ manifestations before they become irreversible.&#xD;

      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the prevalence of Fabry Disease (FD) among a cohort of high risk patients with&#xD;
      left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) presenting at the University Hospital Würzburg over the&#xD;
      last 10 years. Fabry disease is a rare disease that is known to be consistently&#xD;
      underdiagnosed due to its largely variable symptoms. Considering that an early Fabry&#xD;
      diagnosis is crucial for maximum benefit from therapies available, screening for Fabry&#xD;
      patients can contribute to preventing development and worsening of symptoms in Fabry patients&#xD;
      with LVH. In addition, a positive diagnosis in a family member opens the possibility to&#xD;
      diagnose further family members in an earlier stage of the disease, therefore allowing&#xD;
      treatment of symptoms and organ manifestations before they become irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked disease caused by enzyme α-Galactosidase A (αGAL)&#xD;
      deficiency resulting from mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme. Many patients present&#xD;
      with a &quot;private&quot; specific mutation found only in that particular family and, thus, several&#xD;
      hundreds of mutations are currently known. This multiplicity in mutations contributes to&#xD;
      large variations in residual enzyme activity and different clinical presentations (Baptista&#xD;
      A, 2015). Due to this variable phenotype, the disease is still largely underdiagnosed.&#xD;
      Therefore, the reports of a prevalence of ~1 per 40,000 / 100,000 persons in the general&#xD;
      population are probably an underestimation (Terryn W, 2013). Previous screening studies for&#xD;
      FD in high risk populations (left ventricular hypertrophy) report much higher frequencies,&#xD;
      highlighting the need of including this disease among the differential diagnoses of left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of unexplained origin (Terryn W, 2012; Baptista A, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), detected both by imaging techniques (echocardiography,&#xD;
      MRI) and by electrocardiography (ECG) is the predominant cardiac finding in Fabry patients&#xD;
      (Linhart A, 2006). In a cross sectional study of untreated FD patients, half of the men and&#xD;
      one third of the women were classified as having LVH (defined as LVMi of &gt;51 g/m2.7 for males&#xD;
      and &gt;48 g/m2.7 for females) (Kampmann C, 2008). In screening studies in patients with LVH,&#xD;
      the prevalence of FD is higher, including reports of a prevalence of up to 12% (Terryn W,&#xD;
      2012). Considering that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to significantly&#xD;
      reduce left ventricular mass and wall thickness, an early diagnosis and treatment of these&#xD;
      patients has the potential to modify the natural course of the disease and reduce morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. In addition, it offers the important possibility to diagnose family members in&#xD;
      an earlier stage of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In FD, myocardial hypertrophy is known to be progressive over time and occurs earlier in men&#xD;
      than in women. In female heterozygotes, suggested random X chromosome inactivation and the&#xD;
      inability of the cells expressing the wild type allele to cross correct the metabolic defects&#xD;
      lead to symptoms that are similar to those in hemizygous males (Linhard A, 2006). Due to the&#xD;
      heterozygous status in female patients, diagnosis is much more difficult with direct genetic&#xD;
      analysis representing the gold standard. Cardiovascular involvement substantially contributes&#xD;
      to disease-related morbidity and mortality in FD. Over the past decade, several studies have&#xD;
      suggested that FD can present regularly in patients with an echocardiographic phenotype of&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), defined by the presence of LVH in the absence of abnormal&#xD;
      loading conditions such as arterial hypertension (AHT) or aortic valve abnormalities. It was&#xD;
      supposed that these abnormal loading conditions generally explained LVH and therefore these&#xD;
      patients were excluded in screening studies for FD so far. As a considerable part of the&#xD;
      Fabry population has AHT and most of the patients with LVH followed by cardiologist in&#xD;
      everyday practice have hypertension or valvular disease, a screening for FD in patients with&#xD;
      LVH should include patients with hypertension and valvular disease, as will be the case in&#xD;
      this current proposal. Establishing the cause of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a&#xD;
      common challenge in clinical practice, given its high prevalence and the variety of diseases&#xD;
      it may be associated with. This is particularly relevant from the clinical standpoint because&#xD;
      of the therapeutic implications regarding the differential diagnoses. In this project we aim&#xD;
      to assess the prevalence of FD in the Würzburg cohort of patients with LVH presenting over&#xD;
      the last years. The results of this project will not only contribute to give the proper&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment to so far unidentified Fabry patients, but is also anticipated to&#xD;
      help highlighting the relevance of considering FD as a possible cause of LVH in general&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify FD patients in the Würzburg Cohort of patients with LVH of otherwise unexplained&#xD;
      origin.&#xD;
