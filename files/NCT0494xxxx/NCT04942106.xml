  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a within-subject cross-over trial that&#xD;
      will compare the efficacy of the two bottle-feeding positions on physiologic and behavioral&#xD;
      responses of preterm infants prior to, during, and after feeding. As an exploratory aim, the&#xD;
      investigators will also identify potential infant characteristics associated with the&#xD;
      intervention response by evaluating infant sex, maturity level, and/or comorbidity. The two&#xD;
      bottle-feeding positions will be the semi-elevated side-lying position (hereafter referred to&#xD;
      as side-lying position) and the semi-elevated supine position (hereafter referred to as&#xD;
      supine position), which is the traditional feeding position when preterm infants are&#xD;
      bottle-fed. The investigators hypothesize that compared to the supine position, the&#xD;
      side-lying position will be associated with greater physiologic stability in heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and/or autonomic nervous system regulation during and&#xD;
      after feeding. The investigators also hypothesize that compared to the supine position, the&#xD;
      side-lying position will be associated with more mature patterns of suck-breathe coordination&#xD;
      and/or greater feeding skills.&#xD;

    <description>Infants will be observed for two bottle feedings in a single day when they are receiving at least 30% and no more than 50% of feedings orally. In this arm, infants will be bottle-fed in the side-lying position first followed by the supine position. In the side-lying feeding position, the infant will be placed on the caregiver's lap with one ear and hip facing the ceiling at a 45 to 60 degree angle. In the supine feeding position, the infant will be placed facing the caregiver in a reclining position at a 45 to 60 degree angle. In both feeding positions, the infant's head, neck, and upper body will be supported by the caregiver to maintain a neutral straight alignment with the chin tilted down slightly without the neck being extended or in excessive flexion. The infant will also be loosely swaddled with a single blanket so their legs, shoulders, and elbows are supported in a flexed position but with the lower arms free to move.</description>
