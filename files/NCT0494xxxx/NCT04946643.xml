      Haemodynamic optimisation is a fundamental step and a daily issue in the management of&#xD;
      intensive care patients with acute circulatory failure. Failure to optimise haemodynamics is&#xD;
      recognised as a factor associated with morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the first line of treatment is often vascular filling, many studies have found that&#xD;
      excessive vascular filling alone is deleterious and leads to increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality due to pulmonary and interstitial oedema. The use of catecholamines avoids this&#xD;
      undue vascular filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the therapeutic strategy in acute circulatory failure is to perform a&#xD;
      personalised &quot;titrated&quot; vascular filling after assessing the need for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, predictive criteria for the need to continue vascular filling in order to&#xD;
      optimise cardiac output and tissue perfusion pressure, particularly by ultrasound, have been&#xD;
      developed, notably by transesophageal approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It also appeared to us that offering an alternative to the transesophageal approach would&#xD;
      reduce invasiveness on the one hand, but would also offer an alternative when the&#xD;
      transesophageal approach is contraindicated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute circulatory failure is encountered in shock, regardless of its origin, when&#xD;
      physiological compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. The initial tachycardia and reflex&#xD;
      vasoconstriction of shock aims to maintain sufficient arterial pressure and tissue perfusion&#xD;
      pressure. Beyond these mechanisms of compensation for relative and/or absolute hypovolaemia,&#xD;
      arterial hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion appear, expressed clinically by functional&#xD;
      signs (e.g. asthenia) and physical signs (arterial hypotension, consciousness disorders,&#xD;
      mottling, oliguria, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been observed that organ failure induced by circulatory insufficiency is associated&#xD;
      with a poor prognosis in septic shock. In daily clinical practice, acute circulatory failure&#xD;
      is most often characterised by haemodynamic failure as reflected by arterial hypotension&#xD;
      and/or tachycardia. Early treatment of acute circulatory failure is a recognised prognostic&#xD;
      factor in trauma patients and patients with septic shock (2,3), leading to a reduction in&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line of treatment for circulatory failure is usually early vascular filling due to&#xD;
      relative and absolute hypovolaemia. The choice of fluids depends on the clinical situation,&#xD;
      although for septic shock crystalloids are recommended as first-line therapy. Although early&#xD;
      vascular filling is the first line of treatment, overfilling, also known as &quot;induced&quot;&#xD;
      vascular filling, is alone recognised as a factor associated with excess mortality in various&#xD;
      situations of acute circulatory failure. It is now accepted that early administration of&#xD;
      inotropic and/or vasopressor agents, i.e. before the end of vascular filling, is necessary to&#xD;
      restore arterial pressure and therefore limit the consequences of tissue hypo perfusion. In&#xD;
      order to determine the choice between continued vascular filling and the administration of&#xD;
      vasopressor and/or inotropic agents, predictive indicators of vascular filling requirements&#xD;
      have been developed. These aim to determine whether or not vascular filling will increase&#xD;
      cardiac output or one of its surrogates such as the subaortic time velocity integral (SATI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous indicators have been described for more than 30 years in intensive care units.&#xD;
      Dynamic criteria are those that have the best predictive performance compared to static&#xD;
      indicators. Their time-consuming implementation requires an invasive approach for most of&#xD;
      these criteria due to their technical nature and the need to respect sometimes restrictive&#xD;
      validity criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technological development of ultrasound scanners has allowed their liberal use and the&#xD;
      validation of dynamic ultrasound criteria predictive of the response to vascular filling&#xD;
      (respiratory variations of the sub-aortic velocity time integral, S wave, index of&#xD;
      distensibility of the inferior vena cava, index of collapsibility of the superior vena cava,&#xD;
      central venous pressure). The mechanism underlying superior vena cava collapsibility is&#xD;
      complex, involving variations in intra-thoracic pressure as well as the inherent movements of&#xD;
      the lung parenchyma. These pathophysiological mechanisms have not yet been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study has demonstrated the interchangeability between delta PP and respiratory&#xD;
      variations in subclavian vein diameter in intensive care patients and in the operating&#xD;
      theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of the transthoracic ultrasound approach to assessing respiratory variations&#xD;
      in subclavian vein diameter are its rapidity of implementation, ease of use, non-invasive&#xD;
      nature and reproducibility.&#xD;
