  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the positive effects of the recently popular &quot;Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS)&quot;&#xD;
      approach are examined, it suggests that it may be a possible treatment option in geriatric&#xD;
      individuals with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CSNLP). Based on the principles of&#xD;
      developmental kinesiology, the DNS approach takes advantage of infants' motor development&#xD;
      curves in the treatment of motor disorders. The main focus is on regulating intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressure and the integrated spinal stabilizing system (ISSS) through specific functional&#xD;
      exercises based on the positions exhibited by a healthy infant. According to the DNS, every&#xD;
      developmental position is an exercise position, but every exercise must follow basic&#xD;
      principles. These principles are restoration of correct respiratory pattern and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure, respectively; ensuring correct support during dynamic activities of&#xD;
      the extremities and ensuring biomechanical alignment during movement. Considering the&#xD;
      principles of exercise, there appears to be a potential mechanism of action for anomalies in&#xD;
      geriatric individuals with CNSLBP. Therefore, in our study, we aimed to examine the effect of&#xD;
      DNS approach on functional movement patterns, balance, quality of life and exercise capacity&#xD;
      in geriatric individuals with CNSLBP. It is the first randomized controlled study in the&#xD;
      literature, and our hypothesis is that the DNS approach may be an effective therapeutic&#xD;
      approach on these parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that during isometric upper and lower extremity flexion exercises in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CSNLP), the mobility of the diaphragm&#xD;
      decreases, especially in the anterior-middle portions. The regulation of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressure is impaired due to insufficient mobility of the diaphragm and causes compressive&#xD;
      forces on the vertebrae due to the compensatory activity of the superficial spinal extensors.&#xD;
      Muscle imbalance between the upper and lower quadrants also results in an abnormal position&#xD;
      of the chest or rib cage, negatively affecting lung function and exercise capacity. When the&#xD;
      positive effects of the recently popular &quot;Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS)&quot; approach&#xD;
      are examined, it suggests that it may be a possible treatment option in geriatric individuals&#xD;
      with CSNLP. Based on the principles of developmental kinesiology, the DNS approach takes&#xD;
      advantage of infants' motor development curves in the treatment of motor disorders. The main&#xD;
      focus is on regulating intra-abdominal pressure and the integrated spinal stabilizing system&#xD;
      through specific functional exercises based on the positions exhibited by a healthy infant.&#xD;

      movement. Considering the principles of exercise, there appears to be a potential mechanism&#xD;

      aimed to examine the effect of DNS approach on functional movement patterns, balance, quality&#xD;
      of life and exercise capacity in geriatric individuals with CNSLBP. It is the first&#xD;
      randomized controlled study in the literature, and our hypothesis is that the DNS approach&#xD;
      may be an effective therapeutic approach on these parameters.&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Movement Screening (FMS) [Functional Movement Patterns)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FMS will be used to evaluate the quality of 7 functional movement patterns with the goal of identifying movement limitations and asymmetries. The FMS consists of 7 individual test items including the deep squat, in-line lunge, hurdle step, shoulder flexibility, push-up, straight leg raise, and rotary trunk stability assessment. Each of these 7 test items is graded on a scale of 0-3; thus, the lowest and highest possible overall FMS scores are 0 and 21, respectively.</description>

    <measure>6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) [Exercise Capacity]</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>6MWT is a submaximal exercise test that entails measurement of distance walked over a span of 6 minutes.It provides information regarding functional capacity, response to therapy and prognosis across a broad range of chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Main strengths of the 6MWT stem from its simplicity in concept and performance, low cost, ease of standardization, and acceptance by test subjects, including those who are deconditioned, elderly, or frail.</description>

    <measure>Timed-up and go Test (TUG) [Balance]</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TUG is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around 180 degrees, walk back to the chair, and sit down while turning 180 degrees. During the test, the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require. The TUG is used frequently in the elderly population, as it is easy to administer and can generally be completed by most older adults.</description>

    <description>It consists of 24 items assigned to 6 dimensions, the responses to which are determined by the five-level Likert scale. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will follow a DNS exercise protocol based on previous procedure for a whole period of 6 weeks (three 50-min sessions per week) in addition the conventional treatment. DNS group's protocol will involve 5 min warm-up, 40 min DNS movements (4 different parts, each part lasts for 10 min) accompanied with breathing exercises, and 5 min cool-down. DNS exercises will include diaphragmatic breathing, Baby Rock, Rolling, Side Lying, Oblique Sit, Tripod, Kneeling, Squat, Prone, and Czech Get Up (CGU). Week one specifically will involve training and practicing basic DNS exercises. The complexity of the exercises will increase gradually by adding a new task to an already practiced task every week. An increase in the complexity of a task will help the performer to automate performance. We will use the dual-task paradigm to examine if the task is automated or not (e.g. no new task should disturb the diaphragmatic breathing).</description>

    <description>Patients from both groups will receive a conventional 6-week treatment programme (18 treatment sessions, three a week, for 30-40min duration). All patients will also continue their usual activities and receive advices related to the daily living activites in the form of a leaflet. Participants will be asked to refrain from seeking any other types of rehabilitation treatments during the trial. The conventional physical therapy program for both groups includes: TENS therapy for the low back (15 min 3 days/week), with a frequency of 100 Hz and fixed pulse; ultrasound for 5 minutes, 1 Hz, continuous mode of application 1.5 w/cm2. The exercise programs will consist strengthening, stretching exercises for the abdominal, back, pelvic, and lower limb muscles.</description>
