      To verify the correlation between TMAO level and the pathogenesis and progression of ALS&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with rapid&#xD;
      progression, poor prognosis and unknown etiology. At present, there is no effective&#xD;
      treatment. In recent years, with the deepening of the research on the interaction between&#xD;
      intestinal flora and human health, many studies have found that intestinal flora is closely&#xD;
      related to neurodegenerative diseases. In the field of neuroscience, there are more and more&#xD;
      researches on the relationship between TMAO and its precursors (L-carnitine, etc.) and&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Although there is no direct study on the relationship between&#xD;
      TMAO and ALS, the relevant experiments suggest that intestinal flora, TMAO and its precursors&#xD;
      (L-carnitine, etc.) may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of ALS. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to verify the important role of TMAO, a metabolite of intestinal flora, in&#xD;
      ALS through human studies and animal model studies, and to obtain direct evidence that TMAO&#xD;
      participates in the disease process of ALS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ① ALS patients in outpatient or ward voluntarily participated in the study and signed&#xD;
             informed consent by themselves or their authorized family members; ② At the time of&#xD;
             enrollment, the diagnostic grade of ALS patients met the criteria of the World&#xD;
             Federation of Neurology (WFN) revised in 1998; ③ They were 18-75 years old; ④&#xD;
             Antibiotics, L-carnitine and intestinal flora regulation were not used within 3&#xD;
             months; ⑤ Can eat normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ① electromyography detection found motor nerve block, sensory nerve conduction&#xD;
             abnormalities, or imaging examination (CT or MRI) found lesions that could explain the&#xD;
             clinical manifestations of patients, which did not support the diagnosis of ALS; ② The&#xD;
             patients with dementia or mental disorder could not cooperate with the researchers; ③&#xD;
             Patients with severe heart, liver, kidney and other severe concomitant diseases; ④&#xD;
             Patients with gastrointestinal diseases or gastrointestinal surgery may affect&#xD;
             gastrointestinal absorption; ⑤ The patients who were treated with antibiotics,&#xD;
             L-carnitine and intestinal flora regulation in recent 3 months; ⑥ Breast feeding or&#xD;
             pregnancy; ⑦ Patients with dysphagia, inability to eat normal food, or indwelling&#xD;
             gastric tube or gastrostomy for enteral nutrition.&#xD;
