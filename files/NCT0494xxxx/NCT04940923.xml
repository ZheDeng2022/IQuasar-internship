  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whiplash describes an injury to the neck caused by a rapid movement of the head. It often&#xD;
      occurs during a motor vehicle collision, causing considerable pain and distress. Most&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed with whiplash associated disorder grade-2 (WAD2). Half of these&#xD;
      patients develop chronic pain. Current treatments for patients are ineffective. It is&#xD;
      difficult to predict which patients will develop chronic pain, and therefore how to manage&#xD;
      these patients. The characteristics of pain felt by many patients with WAD2 suggests that&#xD;
      symptoms are caused by an injury to the nerves in the neck and arm. However, on clinical&#xD;
      examination there is no indication that these nerves are significantly injured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work from the investigators' laboratory suggests that nerves may be inflamed. In this study,&#xD;
      the contribution of nerve inflammation to symptoms early following whiplash will be&#xD;
      established. It will determine whether clinical tests are able to identify those patients&#xD;
      with inflamed nerves. It will also determine whether the presence of nerve inflammation can&#xD;
      be used to identify patients who develop chronic pain. The study will recruit 115 patients&#xD;
      within one month following a whiplash injury and thirty-two healthy volunteers. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo a clinical assessment. A blood sample will be taken to look for inflammatory&#xD;
      proteins and magnetic resonance imaging will be used to identify nerve inflammation in the&#xD;
      neck and wrist. Questionnaires to establish neck disability, pain quality and psychological&#xD;
      distress will be completed. MRI findings will be compared to healthy controls. At six-months,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to repeat the questionnaires, which will be used to identify those&#xD;
      patients who have recovered. Twenty-five recovered and twenty-five non-recovered patients&#xD;
      will undergo a repeat MRI and clinical assessment. Although patients on this study will not&#xD;
      directly benefit, the findings will help with early diagnosis and could refocus treatment to&#xD;
      reduce chronic pain.&#xD;
