  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Advanced treatment regimens have reduced cardiovascular mortality resulting in an&#xD;
      increasingly older Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) population in need of cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      (CR) , the majority (74%) is above 60 years. The positive effect of CR is well established;&#xD;
      CR reduces cardiovascular mortality, lowers hospital admissions, and improves quality of life&#xD;
      among patients with IHD. These positive effects of CR has also been established among older&#xD;
      patients. The inherent problem lies in the low attendance rate, often below 50%. Several&#xD;
      studies, including studies from Denmark, have shown that low participation in CR is most&#xD;
      prevalent among older, vulnerable and female patients. The notion vulnerable covers patients&#xD;
      with low socioeconomic position (SEP), patients with non-western background and patients&#xD;
      living alone, as these groups have particularly low CR attendance. Effective interventions&#xD;
      aiming at increasing CR attendance among these low attending groups are thus warranted and&#xD;
      the current study will seek to address this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: To test the effect of a peer-mentor intervention among older vulnerable IHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHODS: The study is designed as a two arm RCT-study applying mixed methods.&#xD;
      Patients (n=140) are recruited by a dedicated research nurse before discharge from the&#xD;
      cardiology department at Nordsjællands Hospital and randomized to peer-mentor intervention&#xD;
      (n=70) or usual care (n=70). Data is collected through both qualitative and quantitative data&#xD;
      (mixed methods). Data is collected at three timepoints, baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. The&#xD;
      patients (mentees) are matched with peer-mentors. Peer-mentoring (i.e. mentoring by a person&#xD;
      with a similar life situation or health problem as one self) is a low-cost intervention that&#xD;
      holds the potential to improve CR attendance and improve physical and psychological outcomes&#xD;
      among older patients. Peer-mentors are role models who can guide and support patients&#xD;
      overcoming barriers of CR attendance. Peer-mentoring is unexplored in a CR setting among&#xD;
      older, female and vulnerable IHD patients; establishing the novelty of the current study.&#xD;
