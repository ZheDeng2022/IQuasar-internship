  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric cancer survivors have increased infection-related morbidity and mortality. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate immune dysfunction following cancer directed systemic therapy completion,&#xD;
      with attention to clinical relevance and infection rate in this population compared to&#xD;
      healthy siblings, when applicable. The investigators will also restart vaccinations at&#xD;
      earlier time points than previously studied, at 3 months post therapy, and will assess&#xD;
      whether boosters or revaccination schedules are superior for regaining immunity against&#xD;
      potentially serious infections in survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized trial. The target population is all patients between&#xD;
      the ages of 2 and 21 years of age who complete cancer directed systemic therapy for any&#xD;
      malignant diagnosis at the center over a 2 to 3-year time frame. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      in the various disease-specific off therapy and survivorship clinics of Levine Children's&#xD;
      Cancer and Blood Disorders. Patients will have lab evaluations for immune function at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post completion of treatment. At 3 months off therapy,&#xD;
      patients with abnormal vaccine antibody titers will be randomized to receive either single&#xD;
      booster vaccines or to begin a full revaccination series that models post-hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant vaccination strategies. Vaccines given will be directed against Haemophilus&#xD;
      influenza type B, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. Live vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella,&#xD;
      and varicella) will be given at 6 months from completion of cancer directed systemic therapy.&#xD;
      Repeat vaccine antibody titers will be assessed at follow up visits as above to determine if&#xD;
      there are differences in immediate or maintained immunity based on vaccine strategy used. For&#xD;
      subjects &lt;18 years of age, investigators will present health questionnaires to the patient's&#xD;
      caregiver to answer at each of the time points. Subjects â‰¥18 years of age will complete their&#xD;
      own health questionnaire. These questionnaires will assess frequency, type, and severity of&#xD;
      viral and bacterial infections requiring antibiotics in study patients and their closest&#xD;
      healthy sibling in age, when applicable.&#xD;
