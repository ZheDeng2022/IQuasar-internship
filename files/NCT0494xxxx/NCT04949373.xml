    <textblock>
      This research aims to investigate the effect of high-intensity laser therapy on pain,&#xD;
      function, nerve conduction studies and grip strength in patients with idiopathic carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy, and it causes numbness&#xD;
      and tingling in the hand, atrophy and muscle weakness in the later stages. Any condition that&#xD;
      increases the volume of the carpal tunnel and narrows the diameter of the tunnel may increase&#xD;
      the compression of the median nerve under the transverse carpal ligament and cause symptoms.&#xD;
      In majority of cases, no cause can be found and it is called &quot;idiopathic&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the diagnosis of CTS is made by the patient's history and physical examination methods,&#xD;
      the diagnosis is confirmed with use of electrophysiological examination. Physical therapy,&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, local steroid injection, hand-wrist rest splint,&#xD;
      nerve/tendon gliding exercises; Physiotherapy modalities such as therapeutic ultrasound and&#xD;
      laser are among the conservative treatment methods of CTS. Despite the effectiveness of&#xD;
      surgery in the treatment of severe CTS cases, as is known, surgical treatment is not without&#xD;
      risk. Therefore, mild to moderate CTS is treated conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser therapy is one of the physical therapy modalities, low-intensity laser therapy (LILT),&#xD;
      whose biological effects occur secondary to direct photochemical effect and are not the&#xD;
      result of thermal effects. High-intensity laser therapy (HILT), which has been widely used&#xD;
      recently, is frequently used since it has small and slow light absorption from chromophores.&#xD;
      HILT is not a concentrated light, but it diffuses in all directions (scattering phenomenon).&#xD;
      This supports the wider effectiveness of HILT. HILT also has effects such as increased&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxidative reactions, increased production of adenosine triphosphate, RNA and&#xD;
      DNA (photochemical effect), increased tissue stimulation (photobiological), and reduced pain&#xD;
      and inflammation. HILT, which has recently found many uses in musculoskeletal diseases, can&#xD;
      affect a wider and deeper area in the tissues compared to the widely used LILT. Although&#xD;
      there are many studies on the effectiveness of LILT therapy in CTS, there are few trials to&#xD;
      study the effectiveness of HILT on clinical and electrophysiological parameters in CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is designed as double-blind prospective sham controlled randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomized into 2 groups: 1) HILT + nerve/tendon gliding exercises + rest&#xD;
      splint and 2) Sham HILT+ nerve/tendon gliding exercises + rest splint&#xD;

    <time_frame>0(Baseline) and at 3rd and 12th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire determines CTS-specific symptom severity and functional outcome using a scale for each. Symptom severity subgroup is determined using 11 questions scored from 1 to 5 and one can get 55 points at most. The higher the score, the higher the symptom severity. The function subgroup questions the difficulty of 8 functional activities scored from 1 to 5 and one can get 40 points at most. The higher the score, the worse the functional capacity.</description>
