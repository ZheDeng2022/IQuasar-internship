      Investigate the compliance of oral anticoagulants in Chinese NVAF patients and find out the&#xD;
      causes, so as to provide basis for formulating effective measures to improve the compliance&#xD;
      of oral anticoagulants.&#xD;

      1. The general information about these patients was recorded such as gender, age, smoking&#xD;
           history, drinking history, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart&#xD;
           disease, stroke history, TIA history, peripheral vascular disease, etc. CHA2DS2-VASc&#xD;
           score and HAS-BLED score were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medication information and follow-up information was collected.For the patients included&#xD;
           in the study, the medication records of oral anticoagulants (outpatient, emergency,&#xD;
           hospitalization), adverse reactions, anticoagulant use history, drug withdrawal or&#xD;
           dressing change, disease changes, etc. within three years were recorded by referring to&#xD;
           the patient's medical records.&#xD;

    <measure>The long-term compliance of oral anticoagulants in NVAF patients was compared among warfarin group, dabigatran group and rivaroxaban group.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In this study, the eight item Morisky medication adherence scale (MMAS-8) was used to compare the long-term compliance of patients with warfarin, dabigatran axetil and rivaroxaban. The proportion of days covered (PDC) was used to compare the long-term compliance of patients with dabigatran and rivaroxaban.</description>
