    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label, plus expansion clinical trial evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of rHSC-DIPGVax in combination with BALSTILIMAB and ZALIFRELIMAB. rHSC-DIPGVax&#xD;
      is an off-the-shelf neo-antigen heat shock protein containing 16 peptides reflecting&#xD;
      neo-epitopes found in the majority of DIPG and DMG tumors. Newly diagnosed patients with DIPG&#xD;
      and DMG who have completed radiation six to ten weeks prior to enrollment are eligible.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label, plus expansion clinical trial evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of rHSC-DIPGVax in combination with BALSTILIMAB and ZALIFRELIMAB using a 3+3&#xD;
      design for subjects with newly diagnosed DIPG or DMG following completion of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Given this is a first in-human study of rHSC-DIPGVax, an initial study &quot;Lead In&quot;&#xD;
      will assess the tolerability of vaccine monotherapy first in older children (ages 12 to 18&#xD;
      years of age) followed by younger children (12 months to 18 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential Parts A and B of this study will also first enroll patients ages 12 to 18 years of&#xD;
      age before enrolling younger children. The rationale for the combination of vaccine and&#xD;
      anti-PD1 therapy includes evidence of a more profound intra-tumoral response with addition of&#xD;
      inhibition of negative co-regulatory pathways, such as, PD1/PDL1 and the need to overcome&#xD;
      potentially immunosuppressive or immune &quot;cold&quot; microenvironment of gliomas. Anti-CLTA4&#xD;
      therapy will also be combined with rHSC-DIPGVax in the dose escalation portion of this study&#xD;
      because of the ability of anti-CTLA4 therapy to induce T cell priming to promote T memory&#xD;
      formation. Given the lack of standard treatment options for DIPG and DMG patients, this&#xD;
      clinical trial will use combinatorial immunotherapy in upfront treatment of these patients in&#xD;
      hopes of maximizing potential efficacy in this at-risk population while still assessing&#xD;
      safety throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will evaluate rHSC-DIPGVax plus BALSTILIMAB. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BALSTILIMAB will&#xD;
      also be evaluated to assess exposure. If the rHSC-DIPGVax plus BALSTILIMAB is well tolerated&#xD;
      in Part A for 28-days, this study will then move to enrolling Part B to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of rHSC-DIPGVax and BALSTILIMAB in combination with ZALIFRELIMAB at two dose&#xD;
      levels for a total therapy duration of one year or twenty-seven cycles, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advancement from Part A to Part B and dose escalation in Part B will follow a conservative&#xD;
      3+3 design. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) monitoring period will last 28 days (2 cycles)&#xD;
      for Part A subjects and 42 days (1 cycle) for Part B. Subjects will be allowed to continue on&#xD;
      in Part A for twenty-seven 14-day cycles or nine 42-day cycles in Part B or 1 year of total&#xD;
      therapy, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the RP2D of ZALIFRELIMAB is determined, Part C, the expansion arm, will enroll further&#xD;
      subjects at this dose level to assess futility versus efficacy. All subjects in trial Part C&#xD;
      will be monitored for dose limiting toxicities for the duration of their participation in the&#xD;
      study to monitor for excess toxicity.&#xD;
