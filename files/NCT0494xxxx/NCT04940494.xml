  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetrical Anal Sphincter Injury is an identified risk factor for anal incontinence. The&#xD;
      mechanisms and the risk factors for anal incontinence in Obstetrical Anal Sphincter Injury&#xD;
      women are not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anal incontinence in such women is not well documented and probably underestimated. Cohort&#xD;
      studies estimated that up to 53% of Obstetrical Anal Sphincter Injury women are incontinent&#xD;
      but that most of them does not complain their doctor.&#xD;
