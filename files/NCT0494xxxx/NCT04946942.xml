    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to pilot test CHEC (Collaborative Healthcare Encounters with&#xD;
      Caregivers) in primary care. CHEC is brief intervention with two components: 1) a checklist&#xD;
      to identify the needs and concerns of unpaid/family caregivers who accompany older patients&#xD;
      (aged 65+) to their primary care visits and 2) accompanying Tip Sheet for clinicians.&#xD;
