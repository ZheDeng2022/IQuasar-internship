  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a challenging geriatric problem for health care professionals, especially in&#xD;
      patients with multiple comorbidities. In patients with inoperable hip fractures secondary to&#xD;
      severe comorbid conditions, the pain can lead to significant challenges in nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent anatomical study confirmed the innervation of the anterior hip by these 3 main&#xD;
      nerves but also found that the AON and FN play a greater role in the anterior hip innervation&#xD;
      than previously reported.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to help to target a suggested optimum landmark and determine the&#xD;
      volume of injectate that can cover the distribution of the anterior articular branches&#xD;
      supplying the hip joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anterior hip capsule is innervated by the ON, accessory obturator nerve (AON), and FN as&#xD;
      reported by previous anatomic studies. The anterior capsule is the most richly innervated&#xD;
      section of the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided technique for blockade of these articular branches to the hip, the PENG&#xD;
      (Pericapsular Nerve Group) block reported significantly reduced pain scores compared with&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current understanding of the complex innervations of the hip joint, it is difficult&#xD;
      to provide complete effective radiofrequency ablation to the articular branches supplying the&#xD;
      hip joint. Chemical hip denervation using ultrasound was reported by previous case reports or&#xD;
      series without mentioning a well-defined target point or an optimum injectate volume.&#xD;

    <description>with the patient in the supine position, ultrasound probe in a transverse plane over the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and then aligned with the pubic ramus. In this view, the ilio pubic eminence (IPE), the iliopsoas muscle and tendon will be observed. A spinal needle will be inserted from lateral to medial in an in-plane approach to place the tip between the psoas tendon and the pubic ramus. Fluoroscopic image will be taken to confirm the needle tip position in the target site. Following negative aspiration, 15 ml dye will be injected in 5-mL increments while observing for adequate spread using fluoroscopy followed by 15ml local anesthetic</description>
