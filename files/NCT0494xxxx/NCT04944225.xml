  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a major risk factor for chronic postoperative pain. Adequate perioperative pain&#xD;
      relief is an important metric for patient satisfaction and to achieve good recovery outcomes.&#xD;
      Opioids remain the primary systemic pharmacotherapy for intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia, particularly for moderate to severe pain. When used judiciously, opioids are&#xD;
      effective in reducing suffering and helping patients cope with postoperative pain. However,&#xD;
      there are challenges - a) side effects can result in harm, like respiratory depression; b)&#xD;
      over-reliance on opioids can increase drug dependency; c) over-prescription can encourage&#xD;
      addiction, overdose and death, leading to a human and financial burden from both, an&#xD;
      individual, and public health standpoint.1,2 Over-prescription of opioids for acute pain is&#xD;
      strongly linked to patient morbidity and mortality.3-9 For example, a new opioid prescription&#xD;
      raises the risk of lethal or non-lethal overdose, as well as the conversion from opioid-naive&#xD;
      to chronic user.10 Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI), and Public Health Agency&#xD;
      of Canada (PHAC) data emphasize the public health need to reduce reliance on opioids: &quot;From&#xD;
      January 2016 to June 2018, more than 9,000 Canadians died from apparent opioid related harms.&#xD;
      In 2017, an average of 17 Canadians were hospitalized for opioid poisonings each day - an&#xD;
      increase from 16 per day in 2016&quot;.11,12 Prescription opioid use appears to be an early driver&#xD;
      of the current crisis.13 Given the local and national severity of the opioid crisis, there is&#xD;
      need for a pragmatic, timely, and scalable intervention to reduce reliance on opioids as we&#xD;
      strive to improve healthcare for patients and alleviate the economic burden on the medical&#xD;
      system. Our proposal for a stepped-wedge randomized trial of a multi-faceted opioid-use&#xD;
      reduction strategy addresses key drivers of the opioid crisis and has the potential to reduce&#xD;
      patient exposure to opioids and, thereby, improve morbidity and mortality. Hospitals involved&#xD;
      in this study will all eventually participate in an opiod reduction strategy that will limit&#xD;
      the access and prescription of opiods to surgical patients and will incorporate various opiod&#xD;
      reductoin strategies at both a patient and hospital level.&#xD;

      Proposed Trial Design The proposed prospective randomized trial will employ a stepped-wedge&#xD;
      design, which is a variant of a cluster randomized trial. This is a pragmatic, two-armed,&#xD;
      parallel group registry based, cluster RCT. This SWAHN associated hospitals trial will be&#xD;
      embedded into routine care (new standard of care) with implementation of the intervention&#xD;
      delivered by perioperative personnel rather than research staff. Patient characteristics and&#xD;
      outcomes will be obtained from ICES administrative health care database. This pragmatic&#xD;
      design allows broad inclusion of the south west LHIN hospitals and a large representative&#xD;
      sample of perioperative patients that should yield highly generalizable findings. The&#xD;
      hospitals will be randomized (1:1) with concealed allocation methods and hospitals will be&#xD;
      notified of their group allocation by the study team 2 months before the intervention start&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of study design In this trial, the unit of randomization is the cluster (i,e each of&#xD;
      the hospital) and the unit of analysis is the patient. We chose a cluster randomized design&#xD;
      to enhance intervention uptake and adherence (logistical convenience) and to minimize&#xD;
      cross-group contamination. Perioperative patients typically receive all their intervention at&#xD;
      the same centre, making this population suitable for cluster-level interventions. Delivery of&#xD;
      the opioid reduction strategy intervention in this cluster trial follows what occurs in&#xD;
      routine care, where the perioperative team in each hospital will be trained to follow the&#xD;
      same protocol or policy for patients under their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will entail the roll out of the intervention in a randomized fashion and &quot;sequential&#xD;
      crossover of clusters from control to intervention until all clusters are exposed&quot;.14 This&#xD;
      type of trial is a pragmatic approach to investigate and implement a service delivery change,&#xD;
      given that the intervention will occur at the institutional level and individual patients&#xD;
      will not need to be randomized.14 This multi-centre, stepped-wedge cluster- RCT is designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the benefits of an opioid reduction strategy compared to standard practice as per&#xD;
      local hospital protocol, in patients undergoing elective surgical procedures, who are&#xD;
      prescribed opioids to control acute post- operative pain.15,16 In order to overcome data&#xD;
      collection challenges, we will collect the outcomes from all elective surgical patients (no&#xD;
      exclusions) from electronic databases ICES for the pre- and post-intervention. Following a&#xD;
      2-month baseline period in which all sites use their usual standard-of-care opioid&#xD;
      prescription, one of the randomly selected sites will begin implementing and following the&#xD;
      opioid reduction strategy; other sites will be randomly added to the intervention group every&#xD;
      two months until the strategy is in place at all the sites (total 12 months of data&#xD;
      collection; please see figure 1). One month before crossover to the phase of opioid reduction&#xD;
      strategy at each site, all anesthesia and research staff at the hospital site will be trained&#xD;
      by the study PI (Mahesh Nagappa) on the various intervention components, on implementing the&#xD;
      opioid reduction strategy, and on collection of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting Twelve hospitals within the Southwestern Ontario Academic Hospital Network&#xD;
      (SWAHN) will be invited to participate. London Health Sciences Centre and St. Joseph's&#xD;
      Healthcare London will be the lead sites. For this study, we have selected the perioperative&#xD;
      setting in which opioid analgesia prescribing is common during the hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Recruited patients will be those receiving postoperative analgesia at&#xD;
      participating study sites after undergoing an elective surgical procedure. Given that the&#xD;
      intervention will be implemented on an institutional-wide level (e.g. via changing hospital&#xD;
      order sets and protocols), there will be no need to randomize individual patients. Since the&#xD;
      intervention is focused on opioid use post-discharge, intraoperative and post-operative pain&#xD;
      management will not be specified in the opioid reduction strategy. In-hospital pain&#xD;
      management will be at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, as described&#xD;
      elsewhere in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned trial interventions Control group: Pain management during the standard of care phase&#xD;
      In the standard of care phase, anesthetic and surgical care will be as per standard practice&#xD;
      (according to local hospital protocol) for both the control and the intervention group.&#xD;
      Generally, this means patients will be maintained on a more liberal opioid regime than in the&#xD;
      opioid reduction strategy phase and will receive opioid and other medications for the acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain. The choice of opioids will be at the discretion of the managing team.&#xD;
      There will be a minimum 2-month baseline period before entry of the first randomized cluster&#xD;
      to the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Pain management in the opioid reduction strategy phase The opioid&#xD;
      reduction strategy, including the tools and locally contextualized approach to&#xD;
      implementation, will be co-designed by a multi-disciplinary team of surgeons,&#xD;
      anesthesiologists, pharmacists, and researchers with expertise in knowledge translation,&#xD;
      together with patient representatives. To ensure indigenous perspectives are integrated, one&#xD;
      of the patient representatives will be from the local indigenous community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will involve a multi-faceted 3 component (please see the supplementary file)&#xD;
      approach involving 1) opioid prescription caps (default maximum number of tablets for&#xD;
      discharge prescriptions, as defined by evidence-based guidelines, such as&#xD;
      https://michigan-open.org/prescribing-recommendations/ and&#xD;
      https://www.hqontario.ca/evidence-to-improve-care/quality-standards/view-all-quality-standard&#xD;
      s/opioid-prescribing-for-acute-pain, 2) patient education tools (e.g. What is a normal pain&#xD;
      trajectory? How to manage the pain? Benefits and potential harms of pharmacologic analgesia.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacologic analgesia management? What to do if pain is excessive?), 3) provider&#xD;
      education tools (e.g. including procedure-specific evidence-based recommendations for&#xD;
      multi-modal analgesia; comparison of local baseline prescribing patterns with exemplary&#xD;
      prescribing patterns; defining targeted reduction if baseline prescribing is at odds with&#xD;
      best evidence; review of best evidence about optimal analgesia perioperatively), and 4)&#xD;
      bi-weekly cumulative prescriber feedback on opioid prescribing patterns post-intervention and&#xD;
      until end-of-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategy for implementing each of these components will be contextualized in&#xD;
      collaboration with the multidisciplinary team from each hospital prior to entry to the active&#xD;
      intervention phase, through meetings with the SWAHN Opioid Choosing Wisely Committee, and&#xD;
      with local meetings intensified during the first weeks of the active intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical arrangements for allocating participants to trial groups Each hospital will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the crossover dates prior to the start of the study by a&#xD;
      statistician who is blinded to hospital identities, using a computer-generated list of random&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed methods for protecting against sources of bias It is not possible to blind&#xD;
      clinicians or study staff to hospital allocation because the appropriate pain/opioid&#xD;
      management must be transparently applied upon entry to the intervention phase of the study,&#xD;
      and therefore the unit of randomization is at the hospital level. Outcome adjudicators will&#xD;
      be blinded and patients will remain blinded. We anticipate low risk of selection bias at the&#xD;
      patient level because all eligible patients will be enrolled in the study. From our previous&#xD;
      experience, we expect few (&lt;5%) participants to refuse consent to use their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed duration of treatment period Clinicians will abide by the appropriate opioid&#xD;
      reduction strategy algorithms. The duration of the opioid reduction strategy phase will vary&#xD;
      at each hospital based on the randomization schedule, ranging from 4 to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed frequency and duration of follow up We will collect data on patients from PODs 1 (or&#xD;
      hospital discharge, whichever comes first), and POD 30 (or death, whichever comes first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculations As expected, we found that the sample size calculation is&#xD;
      very tricky for this prospective stepped wedge trial. We were originally aiming for sample&#xD;
      size calculations based on the Hussey &amp; Hughes approach, for analysis with fixed time effects&#xD;
      and random cluster effects. However, we settled on estimating the outcome based on the&#xD;
      available power, as the available sample size was very large (&gt;8,000 per month).17 We will&#xD;
      co-opt the ICES statistical team for the analysis, along with one of our local statistical&#xD;
      experts. This way we will navigate the layers of complexity to overcome our analysis plan.&#xD;
      The methods for adjusting for confounders has evolved significantly in recent years. If we&#xD;
      consider that there are multiple levels of potential confounders, uneven contamination over&#xD;
      time/cluster sizes, larger intracluster correlations, hospital level clustering, and&#xD;
      physician level clustering, then the large number of patients across 12 hospitals&#xD;
      (7000-8000/month), we will likely have greater than 90% power to detect a 25% reduction in&#xD;
      morphine equivalents, even with worst case scenario estimates for above mentioned clustering&#xD;
      and confounders. Using hospital statistics data, we estimate that &gt;8000 eligible patients&#xD;
      would be registered across 12 SWAHN hospitals over 4 weeks, with a 25% effect size in the&#xD;
      MME, and a between hospital coefficient of variation of 0.15. Assuming a constant case-load&#xD;
      during the pandemic, independent hospital effects and a 5% significance level, the trial&#xD;
      would have &gt;90% power to detect a 25% reduction in MME. If the assumption of independent&#xD;
      hospital effects was not met, and the 12 SWAHN hospital clusters functioned effectively as 12&#xD;
      large hospitals, power would be still &gt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Analyses will be carried out using intention-to-treat, based on the date&#xD;
      each hospital is assigned to cross over rather than the actual crossover date. With the&#xD;
      patient as the unit of analysis, we will determine the effect of the intervention on primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes. We will use generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with logit link&#xD;
      for the binary outcome and random intercept to account for the clustering of patients within&#xD;
      hospitals. The model will adjust for patient characteristics (e.g., age, obesity, OSA etc)&#xD;
      and for time (secular trends). A time by treatment interaction will be tested. The effect of&#xD;
      the intervention will be estimated by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in&#xD;
      the final model. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using GLMM for binary outcomes, linear&#xD;
      mixed model for continuous outcome (assuming normal distribution) and survival analysis for&#xD;
      length of hospital stay. Rate of missing data should be low (&lt;5%) as outcomes are routinely&#xD;
      collected to guide clinical care. Statistical significance will be defined as P&lt;0.05 or 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals that exclude the null effect. All analyses will be conducted using the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat approach. We will analyze the primary outcome (and all other continuous&#xD;
      variables) using mixed-effects linear regression, with the intervention and time as fixed&#xD;
      effects in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random intercept and slope for time defined at the cluster level will account for&#xD;
      within-period and between-period intracluster correlations. Considering the relatively small&#xD;
      number of clusters, we will use the Kenward-Roger correction to avoid a potentially inflated&#xD;
      type I error rate. The binary secondary outcomes will be analyzed using a similar approach,&#xD;
      but with mixed-effects logistic regression models. Outcomes will also be stratified according&#xD;
      major types of surgery. Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS and R statistical&#xD;
      package.&#xD;
