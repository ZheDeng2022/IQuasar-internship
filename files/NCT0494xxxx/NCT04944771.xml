      Part 1 of the study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods [Treatment A: Single oral dose of capivasertib in fasted state,&#xD;
           Treatment B:Single oral dose of capivasertib in fed state (high-fat, high-calorie&#xD;
           breakfast) and Treatment C:Twice daily oral doses of rabeprazole for 3 days and a single&#xD;
           dose on Day 1, and a single oral dose of capivasertib in fasted conditions] during which&#xD;
           subjects will be resident from the morning of Day -1 (Day -4 for subjects receiving&#xD;
           rabeprazole [Treatment C]) and discharged after the last pharmacokinetic (PK) sample&#xD;
           collection, 48 hours after dosing of capivasertib of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final visit 7 to 14 days after the last capivasertib PK sample in Treatment Period 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will only be initiated if the findings from Part 1 show an interaction or&#xD;
      are inconclusive. Part 2 of the study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of at least 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods [Any 3 treatments: Treatment D:Single oral dose of capivasertib&#xD;
           in fasted state, Treatment E: Single oral dose of capivasertib in fed state (low-fat,&#xD;
           low-calorie breakfast), Treatment F: Single oral dose of capivasertib in partially&#xD;
           fasted conditions (food restricted from 2 hours prior to dosing until 1 hour after&#xD;
           dosing), Treatment G: Single oral dose of capivasertib and single dose of famotidine in&#xD;
           fasted condition and Treatment H: Twice daily oral doses of rabeprazole for 3 days (Days&#xD;
           -3 to -1) and a single oral dose of capivasertib in fed state] during which subjects&#xD;
           will be resident from the morning of Day -1 (Day -4 for subjects receiving rabeprazole&#xD;
           [Treatment H]) and will be discharged after the last PK sample collection 48 hours after&#xD;
           dosing of capivasertib of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final visit 7 to 14 days after the last capivasertib PK sample in Treatment Period 3.&#xD;
