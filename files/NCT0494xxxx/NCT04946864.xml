  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study of APG-2575 as a single agent in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors or in combination with anti-cancer agents such as CDK 4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor palbociclib in patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who have&#xD;
      progressed or relapsed after first line therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase Ⅰb is dose escalation of APG-2575 as a single agent or in combination with&#xD;
      palbociclib. A standard 3+3 design will be used to determine the MTD of APG-2575 as single&#xD;
      agent in patients with solid tumors and MTD and RP2D of APG-2575 in combination with&#xD;
      palbociclib in patients with breast cancer (MTD-combo). The phase II portion is a signal&#xD;
      seeking expansion of APG-2575 at RP2D in combination with palbociclib in patients with&#xD;
      ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancers who have progressed during or relapsed after CDK&#xD;
      4/6inhibitor therapy. The phase Ⅱ portion will be conducted based on Simon's Minimax two&#xD;
      stage design.&#xD;
