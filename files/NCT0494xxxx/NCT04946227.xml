&#xD;
          1. Male participants or female participants who are pre or postmenopausal women and at&#xD;
             least 19 years of age on the day of signing informed consent with histologically or&#xD;
             cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IV hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&#xD;
             will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not&#xD;
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. a WOCBP must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this&#xD;
                  protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days, corresponding to&#xD;
                  time needed to eliminate any study treatments [e.g., 5 terminal half-lives for&#xD;
                  pembrolizumab and paclitaxel (52.7 hours)] after the last dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Lines of endocrine&#xD;
             or HER2-targeted therapy are not limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * No prior paclitaxel, except ≥12 months after last dose of chemotherapy for early&#xD;
             breast cancer (if chemotherapy given)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Criteria of hypermutation should be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Criteria of hypermutation: 70 nonsynonymous mutations per tumor per exome as the&#xD;
             presumptive starting cut-off for upper 20% of mutation burden. we will revise cut-off&#xD;
             after enrolling every 30 patients. That is, the criteria of hypermutation will be&#xD;
             altered every 30 cases.&#xD;

             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject who has biopsy-accessible tumor for WES. Biopsy on breast tumor or axillary&#xD;
             nodes is acceptable if locoregional recurrence after primary surgery occurs or de novo&#xD;
             stage IV breast cancer is diagnosed&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Documented disease progression on the most recent therapy. This is not applicable&#xD;

             allocation/randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have adequate organ function as defined in the following table(Table 2). Specimens&#xD;
             must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to allocation.&#xD;
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,&#xD;
             OX 40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents&#xD;
             within 4 weeks [could consider shorter interval for kinase inhibitors or other short&#xD;
             half-life drugs] prior to allocation.&#xD;

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational&#xD;
                  study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the&#xD;
                  previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, in situ cervical cancer,&#xD;
                  or other in-situ cancers&#xD;
&#xD;

             surgery or brain tumor removal) may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study intervention.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
