  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to perform a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the&#xD;
      BurtVision system. While the Burt robotic-arm assists the patient's upper-limb in their&#xD;
      movements, BurtVision will allow the patient to perform unimanual and bimanual activities&#xD;
      while leveraging augmented reality games. The investigators will compare clinical outcomes&#xD;
      when the BurtVisions ystem is used for training solely relying on unimanual tasks vs. when it&#xD;
      is used for training relying on both unimanual and bimanual tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      using the BurtVistion on motor gains after robot-assisted upper-limb. Study participants&#xD;
      (stroke survivors) will be recruited at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital - Boston.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two different groups: unimanual or unimanual&#xD;
      + bimanual arm therapy using a block-randomized allocation procedure to ensure important&#xD;
      covariates, such as baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) scores and&#xD;
      chronicity, are balanced between groups.&#xD;
