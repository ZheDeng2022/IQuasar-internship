  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of laparoscopy in gynecological and gyne-oncological surgery has dramatically&#xD;
      increased over the past decades. Although laparoscopic procedure has several advantages over&#xD;
      open surgery such as reduced blood loss, faster recovery earlier return to normal activities&#xD;
      and work, however, postoperative pain and some hemodynamic changes sometimes discomforts the&#xD;
      patients, lessening quality of life at postoperative period [1-3]. In clinical practice the&#xD;
      majority of laparoscopic procedures are performed using standard pressure pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      (SPP, 12-15 mmHg) [1-3]. These noticeable adverse effects are associated with of creation of&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide (CO2) but it is requisite in all laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      for adequate visualization and operative manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of pain after gynecologic laparoscopies has been reported to vary from 35% to&#xD;
      63% [4,5]. A randomized controlled trial has demonstrated that there may be more intense pain&#xD;
      and greater analgesia requirements in the immediate postoperative period after laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery than after laparotomy [6]. The origin of pain after laparoscopy is multifactorial and&#xD;
      complex. It can be differentiated into abdominal pain and shoulder pain [7]. The precise&#xD;
      causes for such pain are still obscure. Abdominal pain may be attributed to stretching of the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity, and peritoneal irritation due to entrapment of dissolved CO2 [1-7].&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal acidosis, mucosal ischemia and compression of the splanchnic nerve as a&#xD;
      consequence of the pneumoperitoneum may also be relevant factors [8,9]. On the other hand,&#xD;
      shoulder pain is related to phrenic nerve and diaphragm irrigation due to residual CO2 in the&#xD;
      subdiaphragmatic space [7-9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to pain, CO2 insufflation and a concomitant steep head-down (Trendelenburg, TP)&#xD;
      position in surgical procedure also cause an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, which&#xD;
      unfavorably affect patients homeostasis, inducing a significant change in the respiratory and&#xD;
      cardiovascular system, lessening perfusion in abdominal organs and blood flow in the inferior&#xD;
      vena cava, and posing an increased risk of thrombotic disease [10,11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (LPP, 7-10 mmHg) is recommended to minimize the adverse side&#xD;
      effects associated with SPP [12]. There are several reports on the safety of low CO2&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum pressure (LPP) in gynecological laparoscopic procedures however their trials&#xD;
      have some limitations due to the small sample size, performed in only short laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures, and inadequate to assess the surgical impression of visualization [13-16]. Thus,&#xD;
      further studies are still required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      LPP versus SPP on metabolic response, postoperative pain scores, surgical field&#xD;
      visualization.&#xD;

    <description>QoR-40 questionnaire scores. This questionnaire pertains to five dimensions of recovery: physical comfort (12 questions), emotional state (9 questions), physical independence (5 questions), psychological support (7 questions), and pain (7 questions). Each question carries 5 point Likert scale (none of the time, some of the time, usually, most of the time, and all of the time). The total score on the QoR-40 ranges from 40 (poorest possible recovery) to 200 (best possible recovery)</description>

    <time_frame>The pain score were measured every 6 hours for 48 hours after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Before starting the study, the participants will be instructed on how to assess their pain intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 cm = no pain, 10 cm = worst pain imaginable). To improve adherence to the protocol, participants will be asked to request analgesia without hesitation if the VAS pain score is &gt; 4.</description>
