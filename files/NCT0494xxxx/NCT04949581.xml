      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of bioelectric therapy on sternal&#xD;
      instability in patients with median sternotomy after heart valve surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Valvular heart disease constitutes a growing healthcare problem with a general prevalence of&#xD;
      2%-5% and a prevalence of 13% after the age of 75 years Heart valve surgery can be a&#xD;
      lifesaving procedure for patients with severe symptomatic heart valve disease. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      following the surgery, up to 27% of patients may require readmission within 30 days after&#xD;
      discharge. Following heart valve surgery, some patients report anxiety and worries related to&#xD;
      readmission and reoperations, postoperative complications, and deconditioning which may&#xD;
      prevent or delay return to work and limit activities of daily living.Over the past 30 years,&#xD;
      bone-growth stimulators have become a critical component in fracture care. They can be&#xD;
      classified into four categories: direct-current (DC) devices, inductive coupling, noninvasive&#xD;
      capacitive coupling, and low-intensity ultrasound. Microcurrent electrical stimulation ( MES)&#xD;
      is the therapeutic use of constant (DC) and pulsed (interrupted) currents, where the stimulus&#xD;
      amplitude is in the micro amperage (millionth of an ampere) range. MES is defined as those of&#xD;
      less than 1 mA or 1000 μ, (MES &lt; 1 mA). This form of electrical stimulation tends to be&#xD;
      applied at the suspensory or very low sensory level and they are not designed to stimulate&#xD;
      muscle contraction. Generators that produce MES were originally called microcurrent&#xD;
      electrical neuromuscular stimulators (MENS). However, the stimulation pathway is not the&#xD;
      usual neural pathway, and they are not designed to stimulate muscle contraction.&#xD;
      Consequently, this type of generator was subsequently referred to as a microcurrent&#xD;
      electrical stimulator (MES). The use of MES may be an adjunctive modality in the treatment of&#xD;
      fractures or injury sites, especially fractures prone to nonunion. Fracture healing may be&#xD;
      accelerated by passing a monophasic current through the fracture site. Getting the current&#xD;
      into the bony area without an invasive technique is difficult.forty subjects will be&#xD;
      allocated to two groups; one group will receive micro-current therapy and routine cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program both for four weeks and the control group will receive the cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program only for four weeks.&#xD;
