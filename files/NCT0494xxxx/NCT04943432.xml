  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has two aims: 1) To examine the feasibility and acceptability of administering a&#xD;
      telepsychology Behavioral Activation (BA) treatment for substance use among&#xD;
      non-treatment-seeking people who inject drugs (PWID); 2) To test the initial efficacy of the&#xD;
      treatment from pretreatment to a 1-month follow-up on substance-related problems, readiness&#xD;
      to change drug use, and BA. The intervention is hypothesized to be feasible and&#xD;
      well-accepted, and within-subject analyses are hypothesized to demonstrate decreases in&#xD;
      substance-related problems and increases in readiness to change drug use and BA from&#xD;
      pretreatment to a 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit N=25 non-treatment-seeking PWID from a syringe exchange program&#xD;
      (estimated treated sample n=15). Participants will receive 8 sessions of BA over 4 weeks, and&#xD;
      assessment of study outcome measures will occur at pretreatment, post-treatment, and a&#xD;
      one-month follow-up.&#xD;
