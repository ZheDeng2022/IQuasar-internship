    <textblock>
      Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS) are often performed for subgroups of&#xD;
      patients for whom procedural benefit has not been established in randomised trials and&#xD;
      despite evidence of serious procedural risk. In some places, the COVID-19 pandemic has made&#xD;
      it difficult or impossible to perform CEA and CAS in time. This study aims to measure the&#xD;
      rate of ipsilateral stroke and other complications in individuals with carotid stenosis, whom&#xD;
      for any reason are managed using current best medical intervention alone. The investigators&#xD;
      expect at least 50% lowering of the ipsilateral stroke rate compared to that seen with&#xD;
      medical intervention alone in past randomised trials.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS) are often performed for subgroups of&#xD;
      patients for whom procedural benefit has not been established in randomised trials and&#xD;
      despite evidence of serious procedural risk. Patients also receive best medical treatment&#xD;
      which is previously proven to reduce the risk of early recurrent neurological symptoms&#xD;
      especially within the first 14 days of symptom onset (6). Further, there is no current&#xD;
      evidence of procedural benefit compared to modern optimal medical intervention alone&#xD;
      (lifestyle coaching and medication) for any individuals with carotid arterial disease (4,5).&#xD;
      In some places the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult or impossible to perform CEA and&#xD;
      CAS. Current guidelines recommend rapid revascularisation of symptomatic carotid stenosis.&#xD;
      These guidelines are largely based on data from clinical trials performed at a time when best&#xD;
      medical therapy was potentially less effective than today (4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a minimum these invasive interventions must be better justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the rate of ipsilateral stroke, and other arterial disease complications in&#xD;
           individuals with advanced (50-99%) carotid stenosis who, for any reason, are managed&#xD;
           using current best medical intervention alone. Reasons for a nonprocedural approach may&#xD;
           include insufficient resources caused by the coronavirus pandemic, unproven procedural&#xD;
           benefit, anticipated procedural futility and/or net harm, or patient refusal. Hence, the&#xD;
           investigators will study patients for whom carotid procedures are not possible or&#xD;
           considered unethical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the CASCOM Pilot Study rate of ipsilateral stroke for symptomatic patients&#xD;
           with that reported in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial&#xD;
           (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods CASCOM Pilot Study is a prospective observational cohort study of current best&#xD;
      medical intervention alone for stroke prevention. It consists of a prospective cohort study&#xD;
      of current best medical intervention alone for stroke prevention. The investigators will&#xD;
      separate patients into those who would and would not have been eligible for past randomised&#xD;
      CEA trials. The investigators plan to study 120 symptomatic patients with 50-99% ipsilateral&#xD;
      stenosis using 'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data Capture) for case reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Findings and Significance In CASCOM Pilot Study the investigators expect at least&#xD;
      50% lowering of the ipsilateral stroke rate compared to that seen with medical intervention&#xD;
      alone in past randomised controlled trials with very similar inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If correct, CASCOM Pilot Study will provide new evidence that past randomised trials of CEA&#xD;
      and CAS are outdated. Furthermore, this study will improve standards for stroke prevention&#xD;
      and other arterial disease complications as well as to contribute to a necessary major&#xD;
      international, multi-specialty observation study.&#xD;
