      Investigators are interested to see whether patients who received a visit question prompt&#xD;
      list before the consultation ask more questions, feel more actively involved in their&#xD;
      healthcare, and think of their surgeon as being more empathetic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Visiting a doctor with a musculoskeletal problem can be quite a daunting experience for&#xD;
      patients. A visit question prompt list may help to empower patients and increase their role&#xD;
      in active decision-making. Previous studies have shown that patient activation is correlated&#xD;
      with a disability, pain intensity, and satisfaction with treatment. Perceived empathy is&#xD;
      strongly associated with satisfaction among people with arm problems. A list that prompts&#xD;
      patients to ask about things that matter to them, might improve their connection with the&#xD;
      surgeon and their perceived empathy. The investigators are interested to see whether patients&#xD;
      who received a visit question prompt list before the consultation ask more questions, feel&#xD;
      more actively involved in their healthcare, and think of their surgeon as being more&#xD;
      empathetic.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All new, adult (18+ years old) patients seeing an orthopedic surgeon for a consultation will be invited to enroll. Randomization will be done through an Excel random number generator. The patients in the intervention group will review a prompt list before their visit. The research assistant will shadow the surgeon to count the amount of questions they ask during their visit. Patients in both groups will fill out a survey entailing demographics, the Decisional Conflict Scale, the JSPPE, the PAM score and a satisfaction scale at the end of the visit.</intervention_model_description>
