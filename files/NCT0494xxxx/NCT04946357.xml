  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized prospective open-label phase 2 trial testes the safety and feasibility of a&#xD;
      hypofractionated accelerated neoadjuvant proton or carbon ion radiotherapy based on the rate&#xD;
      of wound healing disorders from beginning of radiotherapy to maximum 120 days after the&#xD;
      planned tumor resection or discontinuation of treatment due to any reason. The treatment is&#xD;
      of shorter duration (2-3 weeks vs. 5 weeks standard treatment), which should please most&#xD;
      patients and thus enhance quality of life. The treatment regimen furthermore promises a&#xD;
      reduced rate of late side effects and significant optimization of the current treatment&#xD;
      standards. A phase II trial is mandatory not only for obtaining the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      data, but also in order to prepare a concurrent phase III trial. Due to the low incidence of&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma, only a well prepared multicenter study has a chance to be successfully&#xD;
      completed based on previous experiences in trials for seldom tumor entities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oncologic complete local excision (wide resection) combined with radiotherapy forms the&#xD;
      standard treatment for patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Especially patients with G2/G3&#xD;
      sarcomas profit from the combination of radiotherapy and surgery. Well-differentiated&#xD;
      sarcomas (G1) after total resection (R0) receive no subsequent treatment besides surgery. The&#xD;
      sequence of surgery and radiation therapy is widely discussed by the radiation oncologists&#xD;
      and surgeons. The main advantages of neoadjuvant (pre-operative) radiotherapy are the smaller&#xD;
      treatment target volumes and reduced prescribed radiation doses of 50 Gy vs. 66 Gy&#xD;
      (postoperative) in 2 Gy single doses. Thus, due to these reductions in volumes and dose,&#xD;
      neoadjuvant radiotherapy is associated with a lower rate of radiotherapy-associated edema and&#xD;
      fibrosis. However, a randomized phase III study showed an increased rate of wound healing&#xD;
      complications in patients with neoadjuvant radiotherapy compared to adjuvant (post-operative)&#xD;
      radiotherapy (35% vs. 17%). For this reason, adjuvant radiotherapy in is currently preferred&#xD;
      in cases with good operability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particle therapy bears the chance to utilize the advantages of preoperative radiotherapy&#xD;
      without compromising wound healing. The advantages of tumor treatment by ion therapy are&#xD;
      based on their special biological and physical features. Protons and carbons ion lead to an&#xD;
      improved dose distribution compared to photons which allows an improved sparing of the&#xD;
      neighboring risk organs and at the same time an escalation of the dose prescribed to the&#xD;
      tumor. Carbon ions are furthermore superior to protons by biological advantages based on&#xD;
      their enhanced biological effectivity. In general, heavy ions are considered as a good&#xD;
      treatment option for tumors of low radiosensitivity as sarcomas. Superior survival and&#xD;
      decreased toxicity rates are expected from the use of protons and carbon ions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized prospective open-label phase 2 trial testes the safety and feasibility of a&#xD;
      hypofractionated accelerated neoadjuvant proton or carbon ion radiotherapy based on the rate&#xD;
      of wound healing disorders from beginning of radiotherapy to maximum 120 days after the&#xD;
