      PICO P: Population: patients' needs esthetic anterior veneers. I: Intervention: Multicolor&#xD;
      hybrid ceramic laminate veneers. C: Comparison: Multicolor feldspathic laminate veneers. O:&#xD;
      Outcome: primary: Marginal adaptation. secondary:1 Shade matching 2. Patient satisfaction. S:&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. T Time: One year. Research question Will&#xD;
      polychromatic hybrid ceramic laminate veneer improve the marginal adaptation, shade matching,&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction when compared to polychromatic feldspathic porcelain laminate&#xD;
      veneer? Statement of the problem Anterior all-ceramic restoration exhibits esthetic challenge&#xD;
      due to color gradient of the tooth nature from cervical to incisor, subsequently, the&#xD;
      monochromatic CAD/CAM blocks need external stains which require more time and effort moreover&#xD;
      it may leach out over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the feldspathic ceramic blocks display the highest translucent properties of all&#xD;
      ceramic blocks, which make it the first choice in the esthetic zone, on the other hand, it&#xD;
      has low strength properties that need careful handling before cementation consequently, the&#xD;
      hybrid ceramic overcomes the brittleness characteristic of felspathic ceramics with new&#xD;
      material that has comparable esthetic and translucency with polychromatic feature and&#xD;
      resilience properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-shaded blocks have recently been introducing to the market due to a lack of evidence in&#xD;
      clinical performance evaluating marginal adaptation and shade matching of the polychromatic&#xD;
      newly introduced blocks comparing their different color gradient. For that, the current study&#xD;
      will directly evaluate the shade matching of feldspathic polychromatic porcelain blocks&#xD;
      versus hybrid ceramic polychromatic blocks to enhance the multichromatic shade matching of&#xD;
      laminate veneers restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Decision-making for the treatment of esthetic areas performed to achieve highly&#xD;
      esthetic outcomes the primary factor for achieving this goal is the material used which,&#xD;
      should be of a high shade matching the nature color transition of the natural teeth from&#xD;
      cervical to incisal third. Probably the new Enovation of multicolor hybrid ceramic and&#xD;
      feldspathic porcelain will solve this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to evaluate the marginal adaptation, shade matching, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction of polychromatic feldspathic porcelain laminate veneer compared to hybrid&#xD;
      ceramic multi-color laminate veneer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no difference regarding the marginal integrity, shade matching, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction between multicolored feldspathic porcelain anterior laminate veneers and hybrid&#xD;
      ceramic multi-color anterior laminate veneers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methods A) Participants, interventions, and outcomes 9- Study setting: This study will&#xD;
      be carried out on patients enrolled from the outpatient clinic in fixed prosthodontics&#xD;
      clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University 10- Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.a.i. Examination and diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selection and examination of the patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
           proper scaling and polishing procedure will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary impressions will take to produce a study cast. The patients will instruct to&#xD;
           maintain good oral hygiene by using a toothbrush twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking a pre-operative professional photo. 10.a.ii. Tooth preparation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Recording the sulcus depth and gingival condition before preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Conservative tooth preparation will be prepared after local anesthesia has been&#xD;
                given as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Full coverage preparation will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. After tooth preparation, adequate 2ry Impression using nonaqueous elastomeric&#xD;
           impression materials and bite registration will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Fabrication of the temporary restoration using composite resin temporary material and&#xD;
           cemented using non-Eugenol Zinc Oxide temporary cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.a.iii. Fabrication and cementation of restoration: Bio-HPP will be supplied in the&#xD;
           form of discs to fabricate crown core by CAD/CAM technology then veneered with two&#xD;
           veneering techniques; the CAD/ CAM and the manual technique using the viologen system of&#xD;
           appropriate shade. The finished Bio HPP crown will cement with adhesive resin cement&#xD;
           according to manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.b. Criteria for discontinuing: Restoration will be removed when there are any signs&#xD;
           of leakage, fracture, or severe post-operative pain due to pulpal response and replaced&#xD;
           by a temporary restoration cemented with Ca (OH) cement to elevate pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.c. Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ''In the first visit, a Face to Face adherence session will hold for the patient to be&#xD;
           informed about the study steps and how to maintain oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further sessions will occur at the follow-up visits. Participant patients will ask about any&#xD;
      problems they are having. Patients will be recalled every three months for one year for&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.d. Permitted or prohibited interventions: Oral hygiene measures are permitted for enhanced&#xD;
      results while using hard toothbrushes or abrasive containing toothpaste after the&#xD;
      intervention is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11- Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The following assessment surveys (clinical evaluations) will be carried out for both&#xD;
      groups: T0 = Preoperative phase: clinical records, periapical radiograph, intraoral&#xD;
      photographs, and study casts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 = immediately after final restoration delivery: intraoral photographs. T2 =&#xD;
      postoperatively: assessment of the marginal adaptation, shade matching, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
