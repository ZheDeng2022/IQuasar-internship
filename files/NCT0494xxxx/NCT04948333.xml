  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to optimize the treatment of asciminib in patients with chronic&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) previously treated with 2 or more Tyrosine&#xD;
      Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). Patients for this study will be identified based on warning&#xD;
      criteria and resistance definition following European Leukemia Network (ELN) 2020&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will investigate the use of two different posologies. For this,&#xD;
      patients will receive asciminib 40 mg (twice-daily) BID or of 80 mg (once daily) once daily&#xD;
      (QD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an international, multi-center, non-comparative, phase IIIb, treatment&#xD;
      optimization study of daily 80 mg asciminib (as either as 40 mg BID of asciminib or as 80 mg&#xD;
      QD) in adult patients previously treated with 2 or more TKIs. Up to 30 patients who are&#xD;
      intolerant to ongoing TKI treatment but in major molecular response (MMR) will also be&#xD;
      allowed to enter the trial. Enrollment will be used to have a balance in the allocation of&#xD;
      treatment into either asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. or 80 mg q.d. Although this trial will not be&#xD;
      powered to compare both treatments, descriptive data from both treatment groups is expected&#xD;
      to provide additional insight into the optimal patient management In patients not achieving&#xD;
      MMR at 48 weeks or losing the response after the week 48 up to week 108, asciminib dose may&#xD;
      be escalated to 200 mg q.d. if in the investigator's opinion the patient may benefit from the&#xD;
      escalation. In addition, there must not be any grade 3 or 4 toxicity while on therapy, or&#xD;
      persistent grade 2 toxicity, possibly related to asciminib and unresponsive to optimal&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned duration of treatment is up to 144 weeks unless patient discontinue from&#xD;
      treatment due to unacceptable toxicity, disease progression and/or if treatment is&#xD;
      discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or the participant prior to week 144.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate patient reported outcomes and quality of life by using QoL scale. The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) is a 26 item self-administered questionnaire for adult CML patients. Twenty of the items measure the severity of disease-related symptoms (symptom burden) and are scored from 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine) and 6 items that measure symptom interference with daily life (interference) scored from 0 (did not interfere) to 10 (interfered completely). For symptom burden, total scores range from 0 to 200 and for interference range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicates high impact on severity of chronic myeloid leukemia-related symptoms and on impact of these symptoms on daily functioning for the patient.</description>
