  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast reduction mammoplasty (BRM) is among the most commonly performed procedures in plastic&#xD;
      surgery. However, postoperative hematoma is one of the most common complications following&#xD;
      BRM. Hematoma-related complications include unplanned surgery, need for blood transfusion,&#xD;
      wound healing issues, and unfavorable surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid has emerged in the literature as a promising agent that reduces perioperative&#xD;
      blood loss and need for transfusion. However, despite its consistently reported efficacy, low&#xD;
      cost, and favorable safety profile, tranexamic acid remains underutilized in plastic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled study of the&#xD;
      efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing hematoma development in patients undergoing reduction&#xD;
      mammoplasty. The investigators hope to contribute to the growing body of literature&#xD;
      supporting tranexamic acid to reduce unwanted surgical bleeding.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of perioperative blood loss is a chief consideration in plastic surgery. Breast&#xD;
      reduction mammoplasty (BRM) is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic&#xD;
      surgery, with over 100,000 performed in the United States in 2019 alone. Postoperative&#xD;
      hematomas are among the most frequent complications following BRM, with a reported incidence&#xD;
      between 0.3-7% in the literature. Many of these hematomas require blood transfusions and/or&#xD;
      urgent surgical evacuation to avoid the consequent wound healing issues arising from&#xD;
      increased tension on the closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) has emerged in the literature as a promising agent that reduces&#xD;
      perioperative blood loss and need for transfusion. TXA is an antifibrinolytic agent that acts&#xD;
      by stabilizing clot formation, and may be administered intravenously, orally, or topically.&#xD;
      Topical administration of TXA has been shown to be as efficacious as intravenous dosing,&#xD;
      though with substantially less systemic absorption. Multiple randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      have demonstrated that TXA significantly reduces intraoperative bleeding and need for&#xD;
      subsequent blood transfusion, without an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Moreover,&#xD;
      TXA has been shown to be cost-effective in the surgical setting, not only by reducing direct&#xD;
      hospital costs (drug and blood products), but also by decreasing subsequent costs by&#xD;
      shortening length of stay and lowering the incidence of complications. However, the use of&#xD;
      TXA in plastic surgery has not been well described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled study of the&#xD;
      efficacy of TXA in patients undergoing BRM. The primary outcome variable will be the rate of&#xD;
      hematoma development. The secondary outcome variables will be total drain output, rate of&#xD;
      blood transfusion, incidence of deep venous thrombosis, and rate of thromboembolic events.&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect a broad range of preoperative variables, surgical&#xD;
      details, and other characteristics that may impact the perioperative bleeding risk. All&#xD;
      patients eligible for reduction mammoplasty between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 will be&#xD;
      included in this study. The investigators hypothesize that use of TXA will decrease total&#xD;
      perioperative blood loss, hematoma formation, and transfusion rates following reduction&#xD;
      mammoplasty without increasing the incidence of thromboembolic events. Better understanding&#xD;
      of the effect of TXA in reduction mammoplasty may be of great utility to the field of plastic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
