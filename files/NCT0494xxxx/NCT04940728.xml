  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Creative thinking is a very important factor, especially due to recent developments in&#xD;
      technology and health. In order to adapt and contribute to these developments, creativity is&#xD;
      also very important for the nursing profession, which is a health discipline consisting of&#xD;
      science and art. Creative thinking skills need to be developed so that nurses can develop&#xD;
      healthy interpersonal relationships, find solutions to the problems they encounter in their&#xD;
      working and social life, approach the patient with a holistic perspective, use the knowledge&#xD;
      they have acquired in education life at an optimal level in the delivery of health services,&#xD;
      produce new information and gain a critical perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In today's information age, it is very important for professional development to develop the&#xD;
      teaching models used in nursing education based on the philosophy of lifelong learning, to be&#xD;
      revised frequently, to control the curriculum and to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      teaching techniques used at frequent intervals. The above-mentioned literature suggests that&#xD;
      nurses should use creativity in their problem-solving and communication skills. In this&#xD;
      context, it creates the need to use alternative creative thinking teaching techniques to&#xD;
      develop nursing students' problem solving and communication skills. For this reason, the&#xD;
      research was conducted to develop an intervention program based on creative thinking&#xD;
      techniques in nursing education and to evaluate the effect of this program based on creative&#xD;
      thinking techniques on problem solving and communication skills in nursing students. If a&#xD;
      meaningful relationship is found between these variables and creative thinking education as a&#xD;
      result of the research, the education program prepared on the subject will constitute a guide&#xD;
      for the nursing curriculum in gaining creative thinking, problem solving and communication&#xD;
      skills in nursing students.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thinking is a mental activity, one of the most important aspects of the learning process. The&#xD;
      most important feature of the thinking process is that it does not involve action and is an&#xD;
      action done before acting. In this context, the individual can evaluate the strategies he&#xD;
      will choose to reach his goals by using his mental processes and imagination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creative thinking, one of the types of thinking, takes place in the first stage of the&#xD;
      thinking process. At this stage, the person presents a new and original thought. In this&#xD;
      context, it includes the skills to think creatively, generate new ideas, seek and find&#xD;
      alternatives, adapt to a new approach, explore available options, and encourage assumptions.&#xD;
      Creative thinking can be defined as shaping solutions to a problem or possible explanations&#xD;
      of a phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creative thinking and problem solving actions are considered metacognitive processes within&#xD;
      the scope of cognitive science. Cognition; It is defined as the formation of meta or&#xD;
      meaningful knowledge from knowledge and thus the realization of learning. Metacognition is&#xD;
      the executive and guiding mechanism that controls the thinking process within the scope of&#xD;
      information processing. While the individual knows how he thinks and learns while using&#xD;
      metacognitive information, he can plan, monitor and evaluate this process with metacognitive&#xD;
      control. Therefore, metacognition has an important place in creative thinking skills. The&#xD;
      most important reason for this is that creativity is a new and valuable thought development&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creative thinking is accepted as one of the core competencies of the twenty-first century and&#xD;
      can be developed through education. Focusing on innovation draws attention to the need to&#xD;
      develop creative thinking skills both in education and in other sectors. In this direction,&#xD;
      the importance of developing creative thinking in nursing education emerges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creativity in nursing education is an important factor in teaching creative thinking,&#xD;
      awareness level, interpersonal relations and problem solving skills for skill acquisition.&#xD;
      The role of the education system is very important in the development of educational programs&#xD;
      that will help develop students' creativity. It is seen that there are theorists emphasizing&#xD;
      the importance of creativity directly or indirectly in nursing science. In this context,&#xD;
      creative thinking can be beneficial in raising the individual's awareness level, developing&#xD;
      healthy interpersonal relationships, finding a solution to a problem in relationships, and&#xD;
      using the knowledge acquired during undergraduate education at an optimal level in the&#xD;
      delivery of health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning communication skills, which is an important factor especially in psychiatric&#xD;
      nursing, takes place primarily during undergraduate education. In this process, it is aimed&#xD;
      to develop students personally and professionally both in theoretical courses and in&#xD;
      practical training (clinical/field). When the studies on creative thinking are examined, it&#xD;
      is seen that there are studies showing that creativity can be developed through education.&#xD;
      Since the intervention program developed based on creative thinking techniques is thought to&#xD;
      have an effect on the problem solving and communication skills of nursing students, the study&#xD;
      was planned for this purpose.&#xD;

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>In this study, the sample groups (experimental and control) were determined by an instructor other than the researchers, and the researchers were blinded while the sample was being created. The researchers and participants did not know who was in the experiment and who was in the control group during the assignment process until the study started. This method is a control method in which the participants in the study are blinded. After the assignment process took place, it was ensured that the students included in the research and the statistician evaluating the data did not know the experimental and control groups. In this context, two-way blinding method was used.</masking_description>

    <measure>Communication Skills Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Four Months</time_frame>
    <description>Communication Skills Inventory is a 5-point Likert-type Scale consisting of 45 items prepared in order to determine the communication skills levels of individuals. The items are (1) always, (2) usually, (3) sometimes, (4) rarely, and (5) never.&#xD;
The lowest score that can be obtained from the inventory is 45, and the highest score is 225. Each of the sub-dimensions consists of 15 items, including mental (Z) (1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 26, 28, 33, 37 and 45), emotional (D) (5, 9, 11, 27, 29, 31, 34, 35, 36, 38-40 and 42-44), and behavioral (T) (2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 13) , 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 25, 30, 32 and 41) measures communication skills. The higher the participant's sub-dimension score, the better his or her skill in that sub-dimension is interpreted. The high overall score is interpreted as being high in direct proportion to the communication skill.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Problem Solving Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Four Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Problem Solving Scale was developed in 1982 to determine how an individual perceives himself/herself regarding problem-solving behaviors and stages. It consists of 35 items: (1) always, (2) often, (3) often, (4) occasionally. , (5) rarely, (2) I never act like this is a 6-point Likert-type inventory.&#xD;
In the problem solving inventory, each question is given a score between 1 and 6. Inventory items consist of positive and negative judgments about problem solving and are arranged randomly. In scoring, negative items are evaluated with the reverse scoring method. Items 9, 22, 29 are not scored, and questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 25, 26, 30 and 34 are evaluated with the reverse scoring method. In the scoring of the inventory, the lowest 32 and the highest 192 points can be obtained. The high total scores obtained from the scale mean that the individual perceives himself as inadequate in terms of problem solving skills.</description>
