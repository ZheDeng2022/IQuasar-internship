  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      disturbances in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that the body composition of children born prematurely is different&#xD;
      from that of children born under term with a deficit in fat free mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can thus be wondered if this excessive adiposity does or does not predict the risk of&#xD;
      insulin resistance in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children born prematurely, with a body composition measurement performed at discharge from&#xD;
      neonatal hospitalization as part of the EPIPOD protocol, and now aged between 8 and 14 years,&#xD;
      will be included in the INFANTPOD protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of body composition, insulin resistance, renal function, pulse wave velocity, eating&#xD;
      behaviour and of neuropsychological development will be performed.&#xD;
