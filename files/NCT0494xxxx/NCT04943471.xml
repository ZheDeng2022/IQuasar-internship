      This study aims to assess if certain personality traits are move prevalent in patients&#xD;
      seeking consultation for treatment of floaters, despite good visual acuity and no other&#xD;
      ocular pathology compared to the normal population. A questionnaire utilising a validated&#xD;
      personality trait assessment the 'Big Five Inventory' will collect information patients who&#xD;
      have sought a consultation (or already had treatment in the form of vitrectomy) for floaters.&#xD;
      We will also assess whether these patients are suffering from any degree of depression or&#xD;
      anxiety using two validated screening questionnaires; the patient health questionnaire-9 to&#xD;
      screen for depression, and the generalised anxiety disorder - 7 questionnaire to screen for&#xD;
      anxiety. Identifying personality traits of patients who seek further help and potential&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention, could help clinicians identify the individual factors that lead to&#xD;
      this debilitating condition in some patients, despite having a healthy eye and may help&#xD;
      determine future non-surgical minimally-interventional therapeutic approaches in the future&#xD;

    <description>Patients will complete a big five inventory questionnaire. This assesses five personality traits using a likert scale. There are 44 statements. The degree to which patients agree with each statement calculates their score, with certain statements being reversed scored. Patients indicate agreement by stating they either disagree strongly, disagree a little, neither agree nor disagree, agree a little or strongly agree. In items scored normally disagree strongly will give the minimum score of 1, with strongly agreeing giving a score of 5. For items which are reversed scored disagree strongly will give a score of 5, and strongly agreeing will give a score of 1.</description>

    <description>The patient health questionnaire -9 and generalised anxiety disorder questionnaire will be given to patients. These are commonly used tools to screen/assess depression and anxiety. With both questionnaires the higher the score, the greater the degree of anxiety or depression. The frequency of depression and anxiety within the patient group will be assessed and multivariate regression analysis will be done to see if there is an association with any of the personality traits.</description>
