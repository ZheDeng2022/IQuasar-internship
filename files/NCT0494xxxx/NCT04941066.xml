  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of real-time fMRI&#xD;
      neurofeedback for rumination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroimaging MRI techniques for measuring brain structure, tissue composition, and Blood&#xD;
      Oxygenation Level Dependent functional Magnetic Resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) will be used to&#xD;
      measure task-dependent and task-independent brain hemodynamic and electrophysiological&#xD;
      changes in human subjects with major depressive disorders (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all participants giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo one session of the cognitive process-based fMRI neurofeedback&#xD;
      (CNF) targeting the rumination-related brain functional connectivity, and a one-week&#xD;
      follow-up. Participants will be randomized in a double-blind manner (participant and&#xD;
      investigator) in a 1:1 ratio to Active (receiving feedback from their own brain activity) or&#xD;
      Sham (receiving artificially generated feedback).&#xD;
