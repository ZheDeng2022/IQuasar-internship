      Dermatomyositis is a heterogeneous disease characterized by involvement of the proximal&#xD;
      muscles of the extremities. Some patients have treatment failure or intolerance to the above&#xD;
      treatment regimens, which is called refractory dermatomyositis. Abatacept has been approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for the treatment of three types of rheumatoid immune diseases, and the&#xD;
      international consensus of experts recommends abacepil as a second-line regimen for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory dermatomyositis based on the evidence of case reports.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dermatomyositis is a heterogeneous disease characterized by involvement of the proximal&#xD;
      muscles of the extremities. Some patients have skin, lung and other systems involved. The&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis are varied and vary from person to person, so the&#xD;
      treatment should follow the principle of individualization. At present, glucocorticoid&#xD;
      combined with immunosuppressants (including methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine,&#xD;
      tacrolimus, mycophoranate, cyclophosphamide, etc.) is the first choice for the treatment of&#xD;
      dermatomyositis. Some patients have treatment failure or intolerance to the above treatment&#xD;
      regimens, which is called refractory dermatomyositis. There has not been a large-scale study&#xD;
      to explore the treatment regimens. Abatacept is a CTLA-4 fusion protein that inhibits T cell&#xD;
      activation by competitively binding to CD80/CD86 and blocking the second signal. To date,&#xD;
      Abatacept has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of three types of rheumatoid immune&#xD;
      diseases (refractory rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and active&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis). The international consensus of experts recommends abacepil as a&#xD;
      second-line regimen for the treatment of refractory dermatomyositis based on the evidence of&#xD;
      case reports. However, to date, there is no relevant report or clinical study registration&#xD;
      information of Abatacept in the treatment of dermatomyositis. The purpose of this study was&#xD;
      to prospectively observe the efficacy and safety of Abatacept in the treatment of refractory&#xD;
      dermatomyositis through a controlled before and after study.&#xD;
