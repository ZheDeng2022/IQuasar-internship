  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Natural Killer cell activity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Natural Killer cell activity was measured in study baseline and 8 week. A ratio of effector cell and target cell was 2.5:1, 5:1, 10:1.&#xD;
(Experimental - Effector Spontaneous - Target Spontaneous) / (Target Maximum - Target Spontaneous) × 100</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Interleukin-2, Interleukin-12, Interferon-Gamma and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For blood Interleukin-2, Interleukin-12, Interferon-Gamma and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha analysis, collect 3 ml of blood in one serum separate tube for 5 ml, leave at room temperature for 30 minutes for clotting, after then centrifuge at 3000 rpm (or 2000 xg) for 10 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21(WURSS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 will investigate on the day of visit (1st, 2nd and 3rd visits).&#xD;
The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 consists of seven stages, including individual symptoms, functional quality of life, and overall improvement. Find the total score of symptoms by obtaining the sum of symptom questions, and the total score of quality of life by obtaining the sum of life questions. Additionally, the sum of the total points of symptoms and quality of life is obtained.&#xD;
All items of symptom score rank on a seven-point scale(1=very mild and 7=severe), where a higher score means higher severity. The symptom score ranges from 0(Do not have this symptom) to 70.&#xD;
All items of quality of life score rank on a seven-point scale(1=very mildly and 7=severely), where a higher score means higher severity. The quality of life score ranges from 0(Not at all) to 63.&#xD;
Therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 133.</description>
