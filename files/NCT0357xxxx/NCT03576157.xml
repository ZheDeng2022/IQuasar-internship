  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Media Action is presently implementing two large scale&#xD;
      mobile health (mHealth) initiatives in India: Kilkari and Mobile Academy. Kilkari is an&#xD;
      outbound service that delivers weekly, time-appropriate audio messages about pregnancy,&#xD;
      childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones, starting from the&#xD;
      second trimester of pregnancy until the child is one-year-old. Mobile Academy (MA) is an&#xD;
      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) in-service audio training course for Accredited social&#xD;
      health activists (ASHAs) in India designed to refresh their knowledge of life-saving&#xD;
      preventative health behaviors and improve their interpersonal communications skills. Both&#xD;
      programs were initiated in Bihar in 2012, and have been scaled widely in a number of states&#xD;
      with support from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) at the national level,&#xD;
      National Health Missions (NHM) at the state level, and an alliance of donors (Gates&#xD;
      Foundation, USAID, Barr Foundation, and UK Department for International Development (UKAid)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Oxford Policy Management, and University of Cape&#xD;
      Town are supporting BBC Media Action and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW)&#xD;
      are conducting an external evaluation of both Kilkari and Mobile Academy (MA). The evaluation&#xD;
      spans through April 2020.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Johns Hopkins Global mHealth Initiative, Oxford Policy Management, and University of Cape&#xD;
      Town proposes supporting BBC Media Action and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare&#xD;
      (MOHFW) to conduct an external evaluation of Mobile Academy (MA) and Kilkari. In the below&#xD;
      text, we outline 6 proposed activities which comprise the evaluation, which are planned from&#xD;
      mid 2018 to April 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will help inform program modification and scale-up plans, and will help better&#xD;
      understand the effects of maternal mobile messaging in India and globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Secondary analysis of cross-site trends in key performance indicators (Duration:&#xD;
           throughout study):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mobile Academy (MA): We will use system generated data to estimate the proportion of&#xD;
           ASHAs who have completed MA training across 12 states. We will additionally aim to&#xD;
           understand linkages between ASHA's exposure to the MA training content and performance&#xD;
           on MA knowledge assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Kilkari: We estimate that Kilkari users will have differing levels of exposure to the&#xD;
           program. For example, some women may not be present when the Kilkari calls come and thus&#xD;
           miss out on key content. Analyses of system generated data will aim to measure exposure&#xD;
           to Kilkari messages by content area (e.g. nutrition, family planning, etc) across 12&#xD;
           states where implementation has occurred to date. As part of this analysis we'll seek to&#xD;
           understand reasons why calls are not received, including phones being out of network,&#xD;
           changes in SIM cards, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Summative evaluation of Kilkari (Period: April 2018 to December 2019) Objective: To&#xD;
           determine the effectiveness of mobile maternal health information messages on key health&#xD;
           outcomes in 4 districts of Madhya Pradesh (MP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This objective will be carried out through an individually randomized controlled trial&#xD;
           initiated in early 2018. We propose conducting household surveys in all 4 study&#xD;
           districts among the cohort of women identified during conception, starting in March&#xD;
           2018. Women identified within the 5-7 month of their pregnancy, who have access to a&#xD;
           mobile phone, and consent to participate will be interviewed as part of baseline survey&#xD;
           and recruited for participation into Kilkari by 8 months of conception (this is intended&#xD;
           to mirror timings observed in Kilkari outreach in other states). Among individuals not&#xD;
           randomized to receive messages, we would propose delaying implementation for Kilkari for&#xD;
           a 12-month window to allow for evaluation activities to take place and additionally&#xD;
           glean information which is anticipated to improve the efficiency of implementation /&#xD;
           rollout in other areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ASHA Survey Objective: Identify factors underpinning differences Reproductive Maternal&#xD;
           Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) knowledge and motivation among frontline health&#xD;
           workers, including exposure to the Mobile Academy training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the baseline surveys described under activity 2 in MP, we will conduct face&#xD;
           to face interviews with all ASHAs (n=1,200) across the four study districts in MP. A&#xD;
           sub-sample will also be contacted for a follow-on phone survey a week later, to pilot&#xD;
           modules and validate a phone survey tool on knowledge and motivation, which can then be&#xD;
           applied to other ASHAs to measure key outcomes as part of MA deployments in other&#xD;
           states, including Rajasthan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-natal care phone survey Objective: Measure respectful maternity care (RMC) during&#xD;
           childbirth, essential newborn care, and infant feeding practices within 0-3 months&#xD;
           postpartum As part of baseline survey activities in MP, we propose additionally&#xD;
           identifying women in 1-2 districts who are 0 to 3 months postpartum (n=880). Face to&#xD;
           face interviews with postpartum women will provide a forum to measure key infant feeding&#xD;
           and essential newborn care outcomes. Phone surveys, a week later, with a subset will&#xD;
           help develop a validated phone survey tool for their measurement amongst individuals&#xD;
           enrolled into Kilkari.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Qualitative interviews of both Kilkari and MA in MP and Rajasthan&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mobile Academy&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Understand stakeholder (ASHA, ASHA supervisor and beneficiary) perceptions of MA,&#xD;
           including barriers / facilitators underpinning uptake and completion of MA training and&#xD;
           enacting its content, and how it affects interpersonal communication between&#xD;
           stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Kilkari&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Understand stakeholder (ASHA, ASHA supervisor and beneficiary) perceptions of&#xD;
                Kilkari, including different message content areas, barriers / facilitators to the&#xD;
                adoption of Kilkari's recommended RMNCH practices and careseeking behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identify barriers / facilitators for pregnancy and birth registration&#xD;
&#xD;
           The qualitative research component will complement the summative evaluation and&#xD;
           secondary data analysis components. Qualitative research will include in-depth&#xD;
           interviews and focus group discussions in both MP and Rajasthan. Differentials in uptake&#xD;
           of MA across these settings provides a unique opportunity to understand the&#xD;
           characteristics of ASHAs and the larger health systems environment which contribute to&#xD;
           MA completion. Among Kilkari beneficiaries, qualitative research can help better&#xD;
           understand user perception of content, the extent and mechanism of impact of the&#xD;
           messages on health-related knowledge, behavior and relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Economic evaluation of Kilkari Objective: To determine the incremental&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness of Kilkari as compared to a null scenario of no messages To estimate&#xD;
           the value for money of Kilkari, we will estimate the costs of program to all key&#xD;
           stakeholders involved-including BBC Media Action, MOHFW, and end-users. To estimate the&#xD;
           effects of the program on health outcomes, we will draw from household survey data at&#xD;
           baseline and endline amongst individuals exposed and not exposed to messages. Data on&#xD;
           changes in careseeking for antenatal care as well the adoption of practices around&#xD;
           breastfeeding and family planning will be inputted into the Lives Saved Tool to generate&#xD;
           a measure of lives saved associated with program activities. Lives saved will be used to&#xD;
           yield an estimate of the incremental Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) averted and&#xD;
           ultimately a cost per DALY averted.&#xD;
