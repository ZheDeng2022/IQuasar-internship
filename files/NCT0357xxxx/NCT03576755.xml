  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or fat-related liver inflammation and scarring is&#xD;
      projected to be the leading cause of cirrhosis in the United States (U.S.) within the next&#xD;
      few years. Women are at disproportionate risk for NASH, with approximately 15 million U.S.&#xD;
      women affected. There is an urgent need to understand risk factors for NASH and its&#xD;
      progression in women, and sex hormones may provide a missing link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's preliminary data support a detrimental role of androgens, or &quot;male sex&#xD;
      hormones&quot; on fatty liver in women but no studies have evaluated whether androgens are&#xD;
      associated with liver inflammation and/or scarring from fatty liver (aka NASH). To better&#xD;
      understand the mechanism by which androgens might promote NASH and/or metabolic co-factors&#xD;
      that contribute to NASH, the investigators are conducting a pilot clinical trial to primarily&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of using an androgen blocking medication, spironolactone, in women&#xD;
      with NASH. Spironolactone was selected because it is has been commonly prescribed for decades&#xD;
      with good safety profile and tolerability to treat symptoms of high androgens, like acne and&#xD;
      hirsutism in young women. Though primarily a feasibility-focused study, the investigators&#xD;
      also aim to explore the pathways by which blocking testosterone receptors might alter the&#xD;
      biologic processes that promote NASH and its associated metabolic co-morbidities in women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, (2:1) parallel group&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial of spironolactone in women with biopsy-proven NASH receiving 6 or 12&#xD;
      months of spironolactone or placebo. 30 women are targeted for enrollment. Each participant&#xD;
      will be administered a single dose of spironolactone or placebo once daily for a total of 6&#xD;
      or 12 months. In person evaluations will take place at Month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. There will&#xD;
      be a telephone follow up visit within 3 months of end of treatment (up to Month 9 or 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot clinical trial that is largely feasibility focused. Study outcomes will&#xD;
      include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in liver stiffness on Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in hepatic steatosis by Magnetic Resonance Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in NASH histology as assessed by the continuous NAFLD activity score (NAS), which&#xD;
           measures different components of NASH on liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical endpoints: serum lipids &amp; HOMA-IR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility outcomes including Rates (and reasons) for the following: a) % women that&#xD;
           decline/women contacted for study inclusion (i.e. need for a second liver biopsy,&#xD;
           concern regarding randomization to placebo) b) % women enrolled/women screened (i.e.&#xD;
           exclusion criteria too narrow), c) study dropout (i.e. medication side effects, too&#xD;
           frequent study visits, and/or phlebotomy)&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to the objectives of the study, the identity of test and control treatments will not be known to investigators, research staff, or patients. The following study procedures will be in place to ensure double-blind administration of study treatments Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled. A color and size-matched placebo capsule that looks identical to the spironolactone capsule will be used.&#xD;
Packaging and labeling of test and control treatments will be identical to maintain the blind.&#xD;
The study blind will be broken on completion of the clinical study, after all study endpoints have been ascertained by blinded study coordinators and after the study database has been locked.&#xD;
During the study, the blind may be broken only in emergencies when knowledge of the patient's treatment group is necessary for further patient management. The UCSF investigational pharmacy would then be notified and responsible for unblinding.</masking_description>
