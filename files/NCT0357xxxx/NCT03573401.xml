  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with&#xD;
      the medication Ameluz® performed with the PDT-lamp BF-RhodoLED® in comparison to the&#xD;
      respective placebo treatment for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as randomized, double blind and vehicle-controlled ( 4:1 ratio of&#xD;
      verum (BF-200 ALA; Ameluz®) to vehicle (placebo)) clinical trial at 15 sites in the United&#xD;
      States of America (US). Each site should randomize between 10 and 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will complete a clinical observation period that will last for up to 7 months&#xD;
      (up to 4 weeks screening and pre-randomization period, and up to 6 months clinical&#xD;
      observation period) followed by a 5-year follow-up (FU) period after the completion of the&#xD;
      first PDT cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of superficial BCC lesion(s) comprises of up to two PDT cycles each with two&#xD;
      PDT sessions one to two weeks apart of each other. 12 weeks after the first PDT of the first&#xD;
      cycle lesion(s) will be assessed clinically and only subjects with remaining BCC lesion(s)&#xD;
      will be retreated in the second PDT cycle starting the same day. For clinically completely&#xD;
      cleared subjects the clinical observation period of the study will end and these subjects&#xD;
      will enter the FU part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject a Main Target Lesion will be defined that will be excised either 12 weeks&#xD;
      after the first PDT of the first cycle, if clinically cleared, or at the end of the clinical&#xD;
      observation period in order to histologically confirm the clinical assessment. Additional&#xD;
      Target Lesions will be assessed clinically, only. Randomization will be stratified by the&#xD;
      number of lesions (1 vs ≥2 Lesion(s)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of complete responders comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete response of the Main Target Lesion which is assessed 12 weeks after the start&#xD;
           of the last PDT cycle that included treatment of the Main Target Lesion and is defined&#xD;
           as a Main Target Lesion that is completely clinically and histologically cleared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In general, clinically complete responders are categorized 12 weeks after the start of&#xD;
           the last PDT cycle according to clinical assessment only and are defined as subjects&#xD;
           with all lesions (Main plus Additional Target Lesions) clinically cleared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verum and vehicle are indistinguishable. However, treatment is accompanied with typical&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs). In order to guarantee the blind status of the investigator assessing&#xD;
      efficacy after each PDT cycle, a second investigator or delegated person will perform drug&#xD;
      application and light treatment as well as all safety evaluations at visits where PDT is&#xD;
      applied and during the phone call 1 week after each PDT cycle, respectively. Both&#xD;
      investigators (delegated person(s)) are not entitled to exchange information about the study&#xD;
      outcome and side effects.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to sign the informed consent form and Health Insurance&#xD;
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) form. A study-specific informed consent&#xD;
             form and a HIPAA form must be obtained in writing for all subjects prior to starting&#xD;
             any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of ≥1 naïve sBCC lesion in the treatment areas face/forehead, bald scalp,&#xD;
             extremities and/or neck/trunk, all of which are, according to the clinical judgement&#xD;
             of the investigator, likely to be histologically confirmed as sBCCs. Lesions should&#xD;
             not be within the embryonic fusion planes (H-zone), especially within 2 cm of the hair&#xD;
             zone or on the ears. In case of multiple lesions, one lesion is defined as Main Target&#xD;
             Lesion which will be excised at the end of the clinical observation period. Only&#xD;
             eligible naïve sBCCs, confirmed by histology taken at screening, are allowed to be&#xD;
             included in the study as Main or Additional Target Lesions. Thus, eligible sBCCs must&#xD;
             lack any histological evidence of aggressive growth patterns (e.g. severe squamous&#xD;
             metaplasia, infiltrative/desmoplastic features or basosquamous features). BCCs&#xD;
             assessed as non-naïve (e.g. previously treated or recurrent) or non-eligible by biopsy&#xD;
             taken at screening (and in a distance &gt;5 cm from the next lesion included in the&#xD;
             study) should be excised by surgery or removed by cryotherapy in a timely manner.&#xD;
             Other treatments for these lesions are not allowed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diameter of each eligible lesion should be ≥ 0.6 cm, and the entire treatment&#xD;
             field must not exceed ~20 cm². The treatment field is defined as the field to which&#xD;
             IMP is applied, usually including the target lesions and margins surrounding the&#xD;
             lesions of up to 1 cm. For the Main Target Lesion, the maximal lesion size should be&#xD;
             such that surgical excision without a skin transplant is feasible according to the&#xD;
             investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target BCC lesions must be discrete and located within 1-2 illumination areas (the&#xD;
             illumination area is defined by the effective illumination area of the BF-RhodoLED®&#xD;
             device with approximately 6 x 16 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to receive up to 4 PDTs within 3.5 months and excision of the Main Target&#xD;
             Lesion either at Visit 5, if clinically cleared, or at the end of the clinical&#xD;
             observation period 12 weeks after the start of the last PDT cycle (Visit 8),&#xD;
             irrespective of whether the treated Main Target Lesion was clinically cleared or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Free of significant physical abnormalities (e.g. tattoos, dermatoses) within the&#xD;
             potential treatment field plus a 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s) as they&#xD;
             may interfere with examination or final evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to stop the use of moisturizers and any other cosmetics within the&#xD;
             treatment field plus a 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s) 48 hours prior to&#xD;
             an office visit and 48 hours after each PDT session. Sunscreen will be allowed, but&#xD;
             should not be applied to the treatment field plus the 5 cm radius surrounding the&#xD;
             target lesion(s) within approximately 24 h prior to a clinical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptance to abstain from extensive sunbathing and the use of a solarium during the&#xD;
             clinical observation period. Subjects with sunburn within treatment areas cannot be&#xD;
             included until fully recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects and subjects with clinically stable medical conditions, including,&#xD;
             but not limited to controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II,&#xD;
             hypercholesterolemia, and osteoarthritis, will be permitted to be included in the&#xD;
             study if their medication is not prohibited by this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential are permitted to participate in this study only if&#xD;
             they have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and are willing to use a highly&#xD;
             effective method of contraception during the clinical observation period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to 5-ALA or any ingredient of BF-200 ALA which includes&#xD;
             soybean phosphatidylcholine.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically significant (CS) unstable medical conditions, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic tumor or tumor with high probability of metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiovascular disease class III, IV (New York Heart Association [NYHA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunosuppressive condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematologic, hepatic, renal, neurologic, or endocrine condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Collagen-vascular condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gastrointestinal condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, endocrine, or other&#xD;
             major systemic diseases that complicate implementation of the protocol or&#xD;
             interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gorlin Syndrome or Xeroderma pigmentosum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence and/or physical treatment of skin tumors other than (naïve) sBCC (e.g.&#xD;
             malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen's disease, aggressive BCC or&#xD;
             nBCC diagnosed at the screening visit by clinical assessment) within a distance of ≤ 5&#xD;
             cm from the nearest target lesion within 4 weeks prior to PDT (Visit 2) until the end&#xD;
             of the clinical observation period. However, biopsied lesion(s) that were not&#xD;
             confirmed eligible at screening and which are located at a distance of &gt; 5 cm from any&#xD;
             lesion(s) that will be included in the study can be surgically removed. Treatment by&#xD;
             PDT or topical medication during the course of the clinical observation period of the&#xD;
             study triggers exclusion of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If lesion(s) are assessed as non-eligible by biopsy during initial screening and these&#xD;
             lesions are localized within a distance of 5 cm from an otherwise suitable lesion,&#xD;
             this suitable lesion must be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other topical medical treatment of the skin 12 weeks prior to Visit 2 (PDT-1)&#xD;
             until the end of the clinical observation period, with the exception of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Topical treatments with corticosteroids (allowed throughout the clinical&#xD;
                  observation period of the study).&#xD;
