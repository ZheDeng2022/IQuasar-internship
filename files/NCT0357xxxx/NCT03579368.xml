  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in cataract surgery and premium IOLs have allowed the ophthalmologist and&#xD;
      optometrist to embrace the fact, as with Lasik patients, that refractive cataract surgery can&#xD;
      allow their patients to be potentially free or less dependent on glasses. However, fewer than&#xD;
      13% of all patients undergoing cataract surgery today choose a premium IOL and of these&#xD;
      approximately 5% are presbyopic IOLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for greater optometric involvement in cataract surgery is necessary as demand for&#xD;
      cataract surgery increases with the population ageing. According to a recent American&#xD;
      Optometric Association survey, optometrists diagnose, on average, 13 cases of cataracts per&#xD;
      month and refer or co-manage about half of them that are sent for surgery. Since patients&#xD;
      base their decision and selection primarily on doctor recommendations, it is incumbent on the&#xD;
      optometric community to be well informed on the benefits of the Advanced Technology IOLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no data that has been collected comparing Advanced Technology IOLs and&#xD;
      their clinical outcome and acceptance rate among patients co-managed with optometrists. This&#xD;
      pilot study will study the subjective visual symptoms, spectacle independence at various&#xD;
      distances and patient satisfaction after bilateral implantation of the Tecnis Symfony&#xD;
      Extended Range of Vision Advanced Technology IOL in this co-managed care environment. The&#xD;
      primary assessment tool will be a Non-directed Patient Satisfaction and Symptoms&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Initial questions would include; &quot;How satisfied are you with your&#xD;
      spectacle-free vision at distance/intermediate/near?&quot;, &quot;Would you choose the same lens&#xD;
      again?&quot; and &quot;Would you recommend the same lens to your relatives and friends&quot;. Similarly,&#xD;
      with regard to Photic phenomena / visual symptoms, we would ask &quot;Do you experience any&#xD;
      problems with your vision?&quot; and only follow up with specific questions on severity once the&#xD;
      patient volunteers a specific symptom..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery form will include a question determining the surgeon's satisfaction with the&#xD;
      individual Symfony lens implantation. At last visit the optometric investigator will be asked&#xD;
      about his satisfaction with the performance of the Symfony lens. This will allow monitoring&#xD;
      of any progression of satisfaction as more experience with the lens is obtained.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Symfony Extended Range of Vision IOL was approved by the FDA for commercial use in the United&#xD;
      States in August 2016 demonstrating reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness (PMA #&#xD;
      P980040 S065). The Symfony IOL diffracts light in a way that allows an extended range of&#xD;
      focus, rather than focusing light at distinct points. Monofocal IOLs have one distinct focus,&#xD;
      which can be set by the surgeon for distance, intermediate, or near. Multifocal IOLs have two&#xD;
      distinct foci for light, at distance and intermediate or near. The proposed optics of the&#xD;
      Symfony are geared toward elongating the eye's focus, rather than producing two distinct&#xD;
      focal points. This elongated focus allows a more continuous spectrum of sharp vision from&#xD;
      distance through intermediate and to near points. Additionally, because light is not focused&#xD;
      at two distinct points, glare and halos should not be as noticeable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Symfony IOL offers many advantages to patients, including the absence of a blurry zone of&#xD;
      vision between two distinct focal points. With this comes the possibility of reduced glare&#xD;
      and halos. Additionally, the extended depth of focus, which is more consistent with&#xD;
      accommodating lenses, is not dependent on postoperative movement of the IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important consideration when selecting this lens is the patient's desired quality of near&#xD;
      vision. The defocus curve of the Symfony lens shows vision between 20/15 and 20/20 from&#xD;
      distance to approximately 66 cm (2 ft). Vision ranges from 20/20 to 20/30 in the intermediate&#xD;
      range of vision until about 50 cm (19 in) and then drops to 20/40 at 40 cm (1 ft). For&#xD;
      patients looking for crisp vision for close reading, this lens may not meet expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will simply involve following patients who are implanted with the Tecnis Symfony&#xD;
      Extended Range of Vision IOL. No clinical testing will be performed on the patients other&#xD;
      than those routinely performed by the examining clinician. The only non-routine aspect to the&#xD;
      study is the administration of questionnaires to evaluate symptoms and satisfaction. Thus it&#xD;
      appears that this study introduces no extra risk to the patient over and above that of the&#xD;
      underlying cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this single surgical site clinical study are to study the subjective visual&#xD;
      symptoms, spectacle independence at various distances and patient satisfaction after&#xD;
      bilateral implantation of the Tecnis Symfony Extended Range of Vision IOL in a co-managed&#xD;
      care environment (Ophthalmologists and Optometrists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population for this clinical study will be 200 bilaterally implanted Symfony IOL&#xD;
      patients from 10 optometric practices who fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study&#xD;
      determined at 1 month postoperatively and were referred to a single surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective clinical investigation. The study endpoint will be at 3&#xD;
      months postoperatively. Subjects will be recruited from the referring optometrist's current&#xD;
      patient population. Subjects will be enrolled into the study in a sequential manner only&#xD;
      after it has been determined that they are qualified according to the Clinical Protocol&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study will involve a single surgical site (Principal&#xD;
      Investigator and Surgeon Co-Investigator) and 10 co-managing optometric referring sites&#xD;
      (Co-Investigators). Informed consent, testing study subject questionnaire administration will&#xD;
      be conducted at the co-managing optometric sites. Surgery will be performed at the single&#xD;
      surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of subjective visual symptoms, spectacle independence at various distances and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction will be tabulated for each center and for the population as a whole&#xD;
