    <textblock>
      Fractures related to skeleton fragility (i.e. osteoporotic fractures) represent a growing&#xD;
      health problem, as the life expectancy and thus the number of frail elderly subjects is&#xD;
      increasing. These fractures are associated with individual and societal consequences. The&#xD;
      fractures are responsible for increased disability, chronic pain, and loss of independency.&#xD;
      The annual cost of either prevalent or incident osteoporotic-related fractures exceeds the&#xD;
      same ratio calculation for many other serious chronic diseases. Mortality risk is increased&#xD;
      following osteoporotic fractures. Several classes of osteoporosis therapies are proven to&#xD;
      reduce fracture risk, based on placebo controlled trials of 3-5 years duration, including in&#xD;
      elderly patients. These data are the rationale for screening of patients at risk of fracture,&#xD;
      recognizing that the optimal approach is to identify subjects at risk for major fractures .&#xD;
      Bone fragility is related to the decrease of both the quality and the quantity of bone. Bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) is a surrogate of bone fragility, with the advantage of being&#xD;
      non-invasively measurable, at relevant sites, such as vertebrae and upper extremity of the&#xD;
      femur. A low BMD, age, and prevalent fractures are the 3 main determinants of the risk of&#xD;
      sustaining a fracture. A low BMD has also been reported as a determinant of all cause&#xD;
      mortality risk in the general population. So far, screening of low BMD by QCT has not been&#xD;
      recommended because of low availability of the devices, irradiation, and cost. However, a&#xD;
      huge number of QCT are performed daily for various medical indications. These thoracic and&#xD;
      abdominal QCT carry potential information about vertebral BMD. These data are already&#xD;
      available, with no additional cost, patient time, nor radiation exposure. They can be&#xD;
      retrospectively (in our study) or prospectively (in the future context of care) analyzed, and&#xD;
      are the basis of an opportunistic screening for osteoporosis: this denotes the use of&#xD;
      diagnostic QCT scans made for other medical indication to screen for patients at high&#xD;
      fracture risk. There is no study of this QCT based measurement as an opportunistic screening&#xD;
      for patients at short-term risk for fracture. Opportunistic screening of osteoporosis, by&#xD;
      diagnosis of low BMD on abdominal QCT performed for various medical indications, is able to&#xD;
      detect subjects at short-term (i.e. over 3 years) risk of fracture (necessitating an&#xD;
      hospitalization).&#xD;

      Primary objective: Assessment of the performance of an automatic measurement of vertebral&#xD;
      bone mineral density (BMD) on routine abdominal scans for the prediction of fractures&#xD;
      (necessitating hospitalization) over 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the performance of an automatic measurement of lumbar vertebral bone&#xD;
           density on routine abdominal scans (performed for other medical indications) for the&#xD;
           prediction of fractures (necessitating hospitalization) over 3 years according to the&#xD;
           location of fracture (spine, hip, non- spine-non-hip).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the performance of an automatic measurement of lumbar vertebral bone&#xD;
           density on routine abdominal scans (performed for other medical indications) for the&#xD;
           prediction of fractures (necessitating hospitalization) over 3 years according to age&#xD;
           (&gt;= 75 vs &lt; 75) and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the impact of a preventive treatment of patients at high risk of fracture&#xD;
           in terms of number of avoided fractures (simulation study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on the patients of the Paris University Hospitals / Assistance Publique -&#xD;
      Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the largest hospital entity in Europe, who had, whatever the&#xD;
      medical indication, an abdominal CT; the images are stored in the PACS workstation (available&#xD;
      since 20076). After legal authorizations, data from the PACS will be merged with data from&#xD;
      the national Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information (PMSI) database, which&#xD;
      records all discharge summaries of public and private hospitals in France. Each summary&#xD;
      contains the age and sex of the patient, the motive of admission, described through the&#xD;
      diagnosis codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision&#xD;
      (ICD-10) and secondary diagnosis, allowing to identify fractures and, among them, neoplastic&#xD;
      (on bone metastasis or primary bone cancer) will not be considered as event of interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All legible abdominal scans performed between 20076 and 20132 at AP-HP in subjects of 60&#xD;
           years and older (i.e. those at a priori higher risk of fragility fractures) during an&#xD;
           hospital stay and stored on PACS workstation will be used. If a subject performed&#xD;
           several abdominal scans, only the first one will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vertebral BMD will be calculated automatically with a validated algorithm (in Hounsfield&#xD;
           Unit - HU), with the lower attenuation (lower HU) representing less dense bone (i.e.&#xD;
           more fragile), at each vertebra from L1 to L4. The algorithm automatically segments the&#xD;
           L1-L4 vertebrae, and extracts their overall density based on a number of features&#xD;
           extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical data of APHP patients (included vertebral BMD) will be transferred into the&#xD;
           AP-HP Clinical Data Repository (CDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incident fractures will be identified in the national PMSI database (20076-20156). An&#xD;
           event will be defined by the occurrence of an incident fracture (excluding polytraumatic&#xD;
           fractures and neoplastic fractures) necessitating hospitalization, within 3 years after&#xD;
           the abdominal scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prediction of the occurrence of fracture by vertebral BMD will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source population will be patients 60 years and older (i.e. those at a priori higher risk&#xD;
      of fragility fractures because of age) who had abdominal QCT with images stored centrally in&#xD;
      the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) of our institution (Assistance Publique&#xD;
      Hôpitaux de Paris, AP-HP). AP-HP is the largest university hospital entity in Europe (Greater&#xD;
      Paris University Hospitals, 39 hospitals, 23 of which are for acute care, 20,700 beds&#xD;
      including 11700 beds for acute care, more than 7 million patients treated and 1.2 million&#xD;
      hospitalizations each year in acute care). The PACS has been implemented in 20076, and stores&#xD;
      all the images acquired in the AP-HP institution.&#xD;
