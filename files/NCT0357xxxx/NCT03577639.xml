      Background In the most recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), of the 97 body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, more than half of the&#xD;
      SNPs were highly enriched for expression in the central nervous system (CNS), which is the&#xD;
      key site of central appetite regulation 1. Significant interaction between consumption of&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages and genetic score in relation to BMI has been found 2. However, it&#xD;
      is not known whether diet quality could modify the genetic association with BMI. Moreover,&#xD;
      identification of subgroup of established SNPs whose association with BMI could be most&#xD;
      significantly modified by diet will provide evidence to individualized obesity prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SNPs enriched in the CNS (CNS SNPs) were more likely to be associated with food and&#xD;
           nutrient intakes featured in alternative healthy eating index (AHEI) in comparison to&#xD;
           SNPs enriched in other tissues (non-CNS SNPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher diet quality was related with less pronounced association between genetic score&#xD;
           and BMI, particularly the score of CNS SNPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5,730 women in the Nurses Health Study (NHS) and 3,434 men in the Health Professional&#xD;
           Follow-up Study (HPFS) who were sampled as controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  21,740 women in the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) Exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary quality will be measured by AHEI-2010, alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED), and&#xD;
           the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet scores. Diet was measured&#xD;
           repeatedly in the NHS (1984, 1986, 1990, 1994) and the HPFS (1986, 1990, 1994), and was&#xD;
           measured at baseline in the WGHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on the most recent GWAS 1, we will classify the 97 BMI-associated SNPs into CNS&#xD;
           SNP (54 SNPs) and non-CNS SNP (43 SNPs). Total, CNS, and non-CNS SNP scores will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome BMI measured after diet assessment with 2-year lag in the NHS and the HPFS and 3-year&#xD;
      lag in the WGHS Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The associations of individual SNP with AHEI components at baseline will be examined&#xD;
           using linear regression and the results will be presented in Heatmap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The interactions between diet quality scores and genetic scores in relation to BMI will&#xD;
           be examined using generalized linear model in the NHS and the HPFS and using linear&#xD;
           regression in the WGHS. The genetic scores will include total SNP score, CNS SNP score,&#xD;
           and non-CNS SNP score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Two-way stratification analysis will be conducted: the association of diet quality score&#xD;
           with BMI will be stratified by genetic score; the association of genetic score with BMI&#xD;
           will be stratified by diet quality score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The interactions between AHEI components and genetic scores in relation to BMI will be&#xD;
           examined using generalized linear model in the NHS and the HPFS and using linear&#xD;
           regression in the WGHS.&#xD;
