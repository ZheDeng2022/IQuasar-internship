    <textblock>
      The need for assisted-technology at home reflects some of the most serious health-related&#xD;
      conditions faced by children with physical and developmental disabilities.&#xD;
      'Technology-dependent' is often used in the literature to describe children &quot;who need both a&#xD;
      medical device to compensate for the loss of a vital body function and substantial and&#xD;
      ongoing nursing care to avert death or further disability&quot;. Parenting a child is stressful&#xD;
      and challenging, and even under ideal circumstances the care of a child with complex needs&#xD;
      requires greater than normal parenting skills. Studies have showed that parents of children&#xD;
      whose illness require assisted-technology experience significant emotional stress, potential&#xD;
      gaps in social support, and social isolation leading to lower quality of life, unhealthy&#xD;
      family functioning, and negative psychological consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a tele-psychotherapy (Tele-P)&#xD;
      intervention as a way to promote the emotional functioning of parents and to help increase&#xD;
      the quality of life of children that are technology-dependent in the Greater Boston Area. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that parents who adhere to psychotherapy sessions via videoconferencing&#xD;
      (Tele-P) will demonstrate significant reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      social isolation. Children of parents in the (Tele-P) condition will show significantly&#xD;
      greater improvements in their quality of life including their physical health, mental health,&#xD;
      family life, free time, and general life enjoyment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial is proposed in order to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy&#xD;
      of a tele-psychotherapy intervention for parents of technology-dependent children at the&#xD;
      Critical Care, Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) program in Boston Children's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as model for social workers to perform an intervention for parent's&#xD;
      raising technology-dependent children. This study proposes that tele-psychotherapy be a means&#xD;
      of advocating for this underserved population.&#xD;

      Efficacy and Feasibility of a tele-psychotherapy intervention to support parents caring for a&#xD;
      technology-dependent child at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caring for a technology-dependent child at home is a challenging experience for parents.&#xD;
      Global family functioning, lifestyles changes and vocational decisions are affected. Parents&#xD;
      of children whose chronic illness require assisted-technology experience significant&#xD;
      emotional stress, potential gaps in social support, and social isolation leading to lower&#xD;
      quality of life, unhealthy family functioning, and negative psychological consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to evaluate a tele-psychotherapy (Tele-P) intervention as a way to promote&#xD;
      the emotional functioning of parents and secondarily increase the quality of life of children&#xD;
      that are home technology-dependent in the Greater Boston Area. The sample will consist of&#xD;
      parents of children that are technology-dependent in the Critical Care, Anesthesia and&#xD;
      Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at Boston Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1) To assess the feasibility of delivering a cognitive behavioral Tele-P&#xD;
      intervention for parents of children that are technology-dependent in the Critical Care,&#xD;
      Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at Boston Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Parents and therapist will adhere to 8 psychotherapy sessions via&#xD;
      videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Cost analysis evaluation will validate the feasibility of the intervention vs.&#xD;
      usual care (UC) and standard face-to-face therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2) To evaluate the efficacy of a Tele-P intervention relative to UC in&#xD;
      management of mental health conditions amongst parents of children with chronic respiratory&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Relative to parents assigned to the UC condition, those in the (Tele-P)&#xD;
      condition will: a) demonstrate significant reductions in symptoms of depression, b)&#xD;
      significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and c) significantly less social isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Improvement in mental health symptoms will be sustained for the duration of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3) To assess whether a Tele-P intervention increases the quality of life of&#xD;
      children in the Critical Care, Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at&#xD;
      Boston Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Children of parents participating in Tele-P will show significantly greater&#xD;
      improvements in their quality of life relative to their UC counterparts on outcomes of a)&#xD;
      physical health, b) mental health (happiness, wellbeing), c) family life, d) free time, and&#xD;
      e) general life enjoyment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Technology-dependent' is often used in the literature to describe children &quot;who need both a&#xD;
      medical device to compensate for the loss of a vital body function and substantial and&#xD;
      ongoing nursing care to avert death or further disability&quot;. Approximately 1.2 million&#xD;
      children and adolescents in the United States require durable medical equipment to survive.&#xD;
      In the early 1990's, surveys estimated that over 2,200 children in Massachusetts were&#xD;
      dependent upon some degree of assisted medical technology. The number of ventilator-dependent&#xD;
      children in the Boston community had since increased threefold, representing increased&#xD;
      survival of low birth weight infants and those with chronic life-limiting illnesses. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that technology-dependent children comprise 20% of all pediatric patients&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital to home, yet they account for 61% of all healthcare resources&#xD;
      used by children. While advances in medical care have brought children with chronic health&#xD;
      conditions life-saving and sustaining advances, healthcare systems are inadequately&#xD;
      structured to meet their ongoing comprehensive needs. Most of these children are cared for at&#xD;
      home by parents and have substantial functional limitations including: self-care,&#xD;
      self-direction, capacity for independent living and economic self-sufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for assisted technology at home reflects some of the most serious health-related&#xD;
      conditions faced by children with physical and developmental disabilities and their parents.&#xD;
      Parenting a child is stressful and challenging, and even under ideal circumstances the care&#xD;
      of a child with complex needs requires greater than normal parenting skills. Parents assume&#xD;
      an altered parental role, serving as parent, care coordinator, respiratory therapist, nurse,&#xD;
      and any other function that is required for 24 hour a day care. The cost of medical care,&#xD;
      prescriptions, and durable medical equipment effects families independent of their employment&#xD;
      and insurance states. This causes an even greater burden on these already financially,&#xD;
      emotionally, and physically stressed parents. Prospects of independence, self-care,&#xD;
      self-direction with growth are not viable for some of these children, contributing to an&#xD;
      indeterminate need for parental effort. Cumulative toll impacts all members of the family and&#xD;
      may also impact medical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators previous work showed that the parents of children whose chronic illness&#xD;
      require assisted-technology experience significant emotional stress, potential gaps in social&#xD;
      support, and social isolation leading to lower quality of life, unhealthy family functioning,&#xD;
      and negative psychological consequences. Approximately 36-45% of mothers caring for&#xD;
      technology dependent children have an escalated risk for clinical depression. Sleep&#xD;
      deprivation due to anxiety about a child's condition, false monitor alarms, and the need to&#xD;
      remain vigilant over the child during the night is a common theme for parents of technology&#xD;
      dependent children. Data suggests sleep disruption places family caregivers at risk for poor&#xD;
      health and related outcomes that may impair their daytime function and long term capacity for&#xD;
      caregiving. Raising a technology-dependent child significantly impacts family functioning and&#xD;
      hence the quality of life outcomes for the family. Depression and anxiety in parents&#xD;
      negatively affects the quality of care a parent can provide their child. Young children&#xD;
      exposed to depressed parents run a risk for delay in language, personal social gross motor,&#xD;
      and fine motor development. Increase perceived parental burden and consequent family impact&#xD;
      may result in negative implications on their own and their children's health related quality&#xD;
      of life. Support for parents is crucial not only for the course of the disease of the child&#xD;
      but also for the parents' health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Greater Boston area there are limited specialized mental health resources and it is&#xD;
      increasingly difficult for parents of children that are technology-dependent to obtain&#xD;
      appropriate mental health treatment. Social workers currently have few evidence-based&#xD;
      inventions tested on families with chronically ill children. Immediate action is necessary to&#xD;
      provide resources to parents to help them feel motivated, confident and capable of caring for&#xD;
      a child. These children are extremely vulnerable and it is imperative to their quality of&#xD;
      life that their parents are capable of providing appropriate care. This proposal intends to&#xD;
      address this gap in parental care through Tele-P, a unique therapy via video conference, to&#xD;
      help parents cope with these daily stressors. As feelings of depression, anxiety and social&#xD;
      isolation decrease, parents should feel more confident and capable of caring for their child.&#xD;
      Technology dependent children fully rely on their caregivers in order to not only improve&#xD;
      their health but to survive. As Tele-P improves the mental health of the parent, the child's&#xD;
      care and quality of life will also greatly improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tele-P can be successfully used in several therapeutic formats, has similar outcomes as face&#xD;
      to face treatment, and is considered satisfactory by most patients and therapist. There are&#xD;
      proven to be a number of benefits to home based tele-mental health including better adherence&#xD;
      to appointments, overcoming social isolation, access to contextual information such as the&#xD;
      patient's home situation, improved patient and practitioner safety and removal of fears and&#xD;
      stigma attached to attending a mental health clinic. Providing therapy through&#xD;
      videoconferencing relieves the parents from the stress of traveling with their technology&#xD;
      dependent children, which often requires time, resources, (such as an ambulance) and money.&#xD;
      For some technology-dependent children it is also dangerous for them to travel due to their&#xD;
      severe diagnosis. Tele-P allows for the parents to be at home with their child, but at the&#xD;
      same time be part of a social interaction. Studies have shown that &quot;facing a high burden of&#xD;
      care but still being able to have sufficient social and familial contacts seems to be&#xD;
      somewhat protective regarding the mental health of these parents, pointing even stronger&#xD;
      towards the importance of social integration&quot;. Tele-P is a unique acceptable and sustainable&#xD;
      approach to address the gap in access to services for underserved populations. Feasibility&#xD;
      remains a question. The investigators experience with survey completion in this population&#xD;
      suggests that time and care demands may be a limiting factor. Given the option of electronic&#xD;
      paper survey in a previous study, the majority completed the latter despite computer access.&#xD;
      Paper was easier to interrupt and resume if the child's care was needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need for support of parents with technology-dependent children. Although&#xD;
      researchers have identified a plethora of risks, stressors, and needs of the families with&#xD;
      chronically ill child, there is a scarcity of evidence based interventions that address the&#xD;
      mental health needs of parents or caregivers of children with developmental disabilities.&#xD;
      Providing Tele-P is a well-suited approach for these parents and caregivers, who may be&#xD;
      overwhelmed by their children's situation, anticipating future challenges and reliving past&#xD;
      traumas. The results of the Tele-P sessions could also be a valuable tool to guide&#xD;
      intervention with policies, resources and services that may improve family quality of life&#xD;
      and outcomes for families who are raising children with developmental disabilities.&#xD;
