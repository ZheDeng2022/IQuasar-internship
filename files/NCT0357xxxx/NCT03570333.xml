    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to isolate, investigate and compare the regenerative&#xD;
      and differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC's) in the gingival (gum) tissue&#xD;
      harvested from two different locations from the roof of the mouth (palate), that is from the&#xD;
      front part(premolar)and back part(molar). MSC's are known for their capacity to form&#xD;
      different kinds of hard and soft tissue including bone, fibers for periodontal ligaments,&#xD;
      cementum and dentin, thus this study can help in optimizing their clinical application and&#xD;
      transplantation approaches in tissue regeneration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various types of stem cells, specifically Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been thoroughly&#xD;
      investigated for their role in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and regeneration of&#xD;
      the attachment apparatus (bone, cementum, periodontal ligament) of the tooth (that is lost&#xD;
      due to periodontal disease) through multidisciplinary integration of research and clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently population of progenitor/stromal cells have been isolated form gingival connective&#xD;
      tissue that shows stem cell nature and is known as Gingival Mesenchymal Stem Cells (GMSCs).&#xD;
      GMSCs have shown to have higher rate of successive culture and proliferation compared to&#xD;
      other sources of stem cells, and have demonstrated multi-lineage differentiation in&#xD;
      osteoblastic, adipocytic, chondrocytic, endothelial and neural directions, however most of&#xD;
      our present understanding and elucidation models stem from in vitro cell culture and in vivo&#xD;
      animal models, which do not entirely translate to human clinical situations. To bridge our&#xD;
      current knowledge gaps of tissue development processes, deeper understanding of biological&#xD;
      processes is required, before reliable biologically based regenerative therapies become a&#xD;
      clinical reality. Palatal gingival connective tissue, which can be a great source of GMSCs,&#xD;
      is harvested primarily for treating gingival recession around teeth or dental implants. There&#xD;
      is very little studied on the histological, cellular make up and the soft and hard tissue&#xD;
      regenerative potential of this tissue owing to the presence of GMSCs. Also, the clinical&#xD;
      decision as to where to harvest the tissue from relies on the amount of available tissue,&#xD;
      indication of the treatment, and the clinical preference of the operator rather than based on&#xD;
      progenitor potential and regenerative capabilities of the underlying cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence aim of this study is to investigate the progenitor potential of palatal GMSCs as well&#xD;
      as characterizing and observing the functionality of isolated MSCs at two different palatal&#xD;
      sites within the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will retrieve human soft tissue (gum tissue) samples from the roof of the mouth&#xD;
      (palate) that are collected during soft tissue (gum) grafting surgical procedures routinely&#xD;
      performed and are standard of care for treating gum recession in the School of Dentistry's&#xD;
      Periodontology Clinic. For research purposes an additional 4mm of soft tissue samples will be&#xD;
      obtained from two sites that is 2mm from front site (premolar) and 2mm from back site (molar)&#xD;
      from the roof of the mouth (palate). The samples will be placed in sterile vials in the&#xD;
      carrier medium and will be immediately transferred to the laboratory for the analysis. The&#xD;
      remaining soft tissue (gum) graft will be used to cover the gum recession defects in that&#xD;
      patient's mouth. A plastic guard will be placed on the roof of the mouth (palate) after the&#xD;
      procedure to reduce post-op discomfort.&#xD;
