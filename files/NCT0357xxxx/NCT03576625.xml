      The effect of Buglossoides oil emulsion on the intensity of recent chronic knee and hip pain,&#xD;
      on plasma and mononuclear blood cells fatty acid profiles and on whole blood Eicosapentaenoic&#xD;
      acid production will be investigated.&#xD;

      This study will document the impact of an emulsion of Buglossoides oil on the intensity of&#xD;
      recent chronic knee and hip pain. Secondly, the impact of consuming Buglossoides oil on&#xD;
      plasma and leukocyte fatty acid profiles will be investigated, thus providing clinical&#xD;
      evidence on the efficacy of an emulsion of Buglossoides oil in increasing EPA content.&#xD;
      Lastly, a comprehensive analysis of whole blood eicosanoid production following&#xD;
      supplementation will provide data on the potential for Buglossoides oil to modulate immune&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
