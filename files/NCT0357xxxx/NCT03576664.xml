      The project is aimed at identifying how the adrenergic antagonist 'carvedilol' modulates the&#xD;
      effects of sleep deprivation in healthy volunteers. The study is a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Investigators will include 20 healthy volunteers who&#xD;
      will undergo three functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging sessions, one at baseline,&#xD;
      and two after sleep deprivation (one night without sleep). The two sleep-deprivation scans&#xD;
      are performed in a randomized order where subjects receive placebo or carvedilol, in a&#xD;
      within-subject, cross-over study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following domains will be described: 1) fMRI imaging of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      pulsations (glymphatic flow) in the human brain, performed by a combination of fMRI protocols&#xD;
      that includes structural (T1, T2, diffusion weighted) and functional (multiband/fast imaging,&#xD;
      spectroscopy) imaging. 2) fMRI imaging during wakefulness and sleep are determined by&#xD;
      simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. 3) The effects of sleep deprivation on&#xD;
      the fMRI derived glymphatic flow signal. 4) The effects of the adrenergic antagonist&#xD;
      carvedilol on fMRI measurements and sleep intensity. 5) Quantification of cognitive&#xD;
      performance before and after a nap in the MRI. Cognitive testing includes: assessments of&#xD;
      visual attention, reaction time, paired-associative memory, working memory, emotional&#xD;
      recognition and subjective ratings of sleepiness and mood.&#xD;

      Aims and background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep is a universal biological process. Lack of, or insufficient sleep, has been associated&#xD;
      with a range of diseases including obesity, cardiovascular disease, reduced cognition,&#xD;
      impaired learning, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. Sleep is also associated&#xD;
      with neuromolecular alterations in the brain, including reduced firing of arousal maintaining&#xD;
      epinephrine and norepinephrine neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel molecular function of sleep known as the glymphatic system has recently been&#xD;
      described in rodents. This system is specifically activated during non-rapid eye movement&#xD;
      (NREM) sleep, and glymphatic flow appear strongly enhanced during sleep when compared to&#xD;
      wakefulness. Moreover, it has been shown that adrenergic antagonists enhance glymphatic&#xD;
      clearance and flow in rodents. This study aims at applying newly developed functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocols to investigate the extent of the glymphatic&#xD;
      system non-invasively in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for us to quantify the change in glymphatic clearance between sleep and wakefulness,&#xD;
      it is necessary to measure the glymphatic process in both vigilance states, requiring that&#xD;
      volunteers nap in the MRI scanner. Moreover, to clarify causal relationships, this study will&#xD;
      challenge the glymphatic system via adrenergic inhibition. To do so, the investigators will&#xD;
      administer the adrenergic antagonist Carvedilol, which can cross the blood-brain barrier. The&#xD;
      drug will be perorally administered before a nap in the MRI, in a double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled manner. To assess sleep quality and function, cognitive testing will be performed&#xD;
      before and after the nap in the MRI scanner. Moreover, to distinguish sleep and wakefulness,&#xD;
      electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings will be performed during magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR)-imaging. Because sleep is a strong homeostatic regulated process, sleep quality,&#xD;
      duration and timing will be controlled by EEG monitoring, immediately prior to and during the&#xD;
      study to ensure that data is intra- and inter-individually comparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesis that the fMRI data collected awake and during a nap will be altered&#xD;
      by the adrenergic treatment. Specifically, investigator propose the following hypotheses: 1.&#xD;
      Sleep promotes cerebrospinal fluid pulsations (glymphatic flow) in the human brain, as&#xD;
      measured with fMRI. 2. Challenging the sleep-homeostat by sleep deprivation promotes the fMRI&#xD;
      glymphatic flow signal further. 3. The rate of glymphatic flow is expected to be proportional&#xD;
      to simultaneously measured non-rapid eye movement EEG slow wave activity. 4: The adrenergic&#xD;
      antagonist carvedilol will enhance glymphatic clearance and sleep intensity. 5. The fMRI&#xD;
      determined glymphatic flow is associated with improved cognitive performance following sleep.&#xD;
      6. Enhanced glymphatic flow is correlated with enhanced cognitive performance, including:&#xD;
      assessments of visual attention, reaction time, paired-associative memory, working memory,&#xD;
      emotional recognition and subjective ratings of sleepiness and mood.&#xD;
