  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre clustered open label clinical trial testing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      adding Gastrografin to standard non-surgical management of small bowel obstruction.&#xD;
      Gastrografin is a radiopaque contract agent that exhibits a mild laxative effective due to&#xD;
      its high osmolarity and ability to pull water into the intestines and bowels as a lubricant.&#xD;
      Small bowel obstruction is a mechanical or function obstruction that prevents normal bowel&#xD;
      function. The standard treatment for small bowel obstruction is non-surgical and includes&#xD;
      decompressing the abdomen, fluid resuscitation, nothing by mouth, and time. In some cases if&#xD;
      non-surgical management is not effective in resolving the obstruction, surgical intervention&#xD;
      is required. Gastrografin in addition to standard non-surgical management has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce the rate of surgery, length of hospital stay, and time to resolution in similar&#xD;
      clinical scenarios, such as meconium ileus and meconium plug syndrome. However, it has never&#xD;
      been tested in children with small bowel obstruction. This study is a clustered open label&#xD;
      study, meaning that each participating centre will select the type of treatment they will&#xD;
      offer at their centre. The treatment options are either the Gastrografin arm (a single dose&#xD;
      of Gastrografin plus non-surgical management) or the Control arm (a single dose of saline&#xD;
      solution plus non-surgical management). After each group receives saline or Gastrografin they&#xD;
      will continue with the same non-surgical treatment that patients not participating in the&#xD;
      trial would receive. Participating in the study does not preclude the need for urgent or&#xD;
      emergent surgical intervention and at any point in the study, if the patient requires surgery&#xD;
      for their small bowel obstruction they will undergo surgical intervention. The outcomes of&#xD;
      this study are the rate of surgical intervention, length of stay, time to first and full&#xD;
      feeds, and rate of complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 2-year multi-centre clustered open-label clinical trial examining the&#xD;
      therapeutic use of a drug called Gastrografin in reducing the length of hospital stay, time&#xD;
      to feeding, and rate of surgery in children with a small bowel obstruction. Each&#xD;
      participating centre will select which of the two treatment options they will offer to&#xD;
      patients at their centre. The patients at each centre will be aware of the treatment offered&#xD;
      at thier centre before making the decision whether to participate in the study. The two arms&#xD;
      of the study are: Gastrografin or Control (saline solution). If a patient declines&#xD;
      participation in the arm offered at their centre they will not be enrolled in the study. The&#xD;
      investigators have chosen an open-label cluster study design instead of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) because it is common for RCTs to be stopped early due to poor&#xD;
      recruitment rates within paediatric surgery. A 2018 systematic review reported that of the&#xD;
      137 eligible RCTs within paediatric general surgery only 19% successfully achieved the&#xD;
      projected recruitment number and further, only 53% of studies that provided an expected&#xD;
      completion date achieved the target. Based on the power calculation for this study, the&#xD;
      investigators require a total of 146 patients (73 in each group) to achieve 80% power.&#xD;
      Therefore if a RCT design is used, estimating a typically recruitment rate of 40-50%, it&#xD;
      would take over 8 years to reach the required sample size between the participating centres.&#xD;
      With a prospective, open-label design, the investigators anticipate the total number of&#xD;
      possible patients that can be approached to participate in the study across all centres to be&#xD;
      between 152-160 patients over the two years. The investigators estimate large centres will on&#xD;
      average recruit between 10-12 patients per year, medium centres 6-8 patients per year, and&#xD;
      small centres 2-4 patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent/Assent will be obtained from the parents/caregivers prior to participation in the&#xD;
      study. Assent, in addition to parental/caregiver consent, will be used for patients between&#xD;
      the ages of 7 and 11. Prior to the patient participating in any study-related activities,&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. Patients will be included in this study if they are between the&#xD;
      ages of 6 months and 18 years of age, are diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction, and have&#xD;
      undergone 24 hours of monitoring and non-surgical management. Patients will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study if they have thyroid stimulating hormone or thyroxine levels outside of the normal&#xD;
      range, are taking any thyroid replacement medication, have previously had thyroid surgery,&#xD;
      have an allergy to the medical or non-medical ingredients in Gastrografin, and weigh less&#xD;
      than 10kg at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will begin following a positive diagnosis of a small bowel obstruction secondary&#xD;
      to previous surgery, assessment by the surgical team, and after the patient has been admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital for a twenty-four hour period of non-surgical management, which includes&#xD;
      nasogastric (NG) decompression, fluid resuscitation, and maintenance. The patients will be&#xD;
      assessed by the surgical team on a regular basis during this time as part of standard care&#xD;
      and enrollment in the study does not preclude urgent or emergent surgical intervention. After&#xD;
      24 hours of admission, the patient will be approached to participate in the study. The study&#xD;
      will be explained to the patient and their parents/caregivers by the research team. The&#xD;
      patient and their family will be given as much time as required to talk among themselves&#xD;
      about the study and ask any questions about the study to the research team. Depending on&#xD;
      which study arm is offered at their hospital, they will either receive one dose of saline&#xD;
      solution via their NG tube plus non-surgical management (Control arm) or one dose of&#xD;
      Gastrografin via their NG tube plus non-surgical management (Gastrografin arm). At any point&#xD;
      during the study if the patient's clinical condition changes and the surgical team thinks the&#xD;
      patient needs an operation then it will occur regardless of enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the patient receiving Gastrografin or saline solution, the investigators will&#xD;
      confirm that the patient does not have an allergy to iodine, as Gastrografin contains high&#xD;
      levels of iodine, and that they have normal thyroid hormone levels. The investigators will&#xD;
      test the patient's levels of thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by blood&#xD;
      draw, as excessive iodine exposure can block thyroid hormone synthesis in young children. The&#xD;
      investigators will be able to test thyroid hormone levels from the patients initial blood&#xD;
      work at admission, which occurs as part of the patient's standard care. This way there will&#xD;
      be no delay in the treatment of the small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to waiting for lab&#xD;
      results and the patient can receive either treatment at 24 hours post admission. Thyroid&#xD;
      hormone levels will be tested throughout the study for the Gastrografin group from routine&#xD;
      blood draws that are part of standard care when a patient is NPO. Therefore no additional&#xD;
      blood draws will be required as part of the study. If the patient's thyroid hormone levels&#xD;
      are normal they can be enrolled in the study. If not, they will not be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four hours following admission and consent, patients will either receive Gastrografin&#xD;
      or an equivalent volume of saline (Control arm) via the NG tube, depending on the arm offered&#xD;
      at their centre. In both cases, the NG tube will be clamped for 30 minutes to one hour. Doses&#xD;
      of Gastrografin will be proportional to the patient's age and will be based on the&#xD;
      recommendations from the manufacturer (i.e., product monograph) and published studies.&#xD;
      Dosages will range from 30ml for children up to 5 year of age to 60ml for children between&#xD;
      5-18 years and will not be diluted. The manufacturer only recommends diluting Gastrografin if&#xD;
      the patient is of low-birth weight or is considered debilitated. Since none of the patient&#xD;
      recruited for this study will meet these criteria, Gastrografin will not be diluted. Patients&#xD;
      who do not receive Gastrografin will receive an equivalent volume of saline solution via the&#xD;
      NG tube in addition to non-surgical management, which includes NG tube decompression, NPO,&#xD;
      and IV fluids. At this time (24 hours post admission) an x-ray will be completed for both&#xD;
      study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient receives Gastrografin or saline solution they will continue to be monitored&#xD;
      for the duration of the study. The patients in both groups will receive an abdominal x-ray at&#xD;
      12 hours after they have been given Gastrografin or saline (36 hours since admission). If&#xD;
      Gastrografin is present in the cecum, feeding will be initiated and the patient will be&#xD;
      observed closely to monitor the success of Gastrografin administration. If not viewed at 12&#xD;
      hours post administration, non-surgical management will be maintained until resolution of the&#xD;
      bowel obstruction or surgical intervention. Standard procedure for initiating feeds will be&#xD;
      used on all children included in the study. The initiation of feeding is up to the discretion&#xD;
      of the attending paediatric surgeon and is typically determined based on resolution of the&#xD;
      bowel obstruction, decrease in NG tube drainage, the degree of abdominal distension, and the&#xD;
      passage of stool. Patients given saline via the NG tube as part of the Control arm will also&#xD;
      receive an x-ray at 12 hours post saline solution and will continue to receive non-surgical&#xD;
      management until resolution or surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection period is from admission to discharge; there will be no data collection&#xD;
      at any follow-up appointment. Patients will be seen in clinic for follow-up post SBO at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending surgeon and this will not differ based on study group&#xD;
      (Gastrografin vs. Control). The majority of the information will be collected from the&#xD;
      patient's chart and will not require directly consulting with the patient or their&#xD;
      parents/caregivers. In order to have an equal number of patients in each group, the&#xD;
      investigators will set a cap of 73 patients per group. Once one of the study arms reaches 73&#xD;
      patients, the investigators will stop enrolling into that arm of the study and only offer the&#xD;
      other arm to potential patients. This will help to ensure that the expected sample is&#xD;
      achieved in each group and that groups are not uneven. Enrollment rate are expected to be&#xD;
      fairly even between study arms, as the treatment arm is non-invasive, has a strong body of&#xD;
      evidence around its effectiveness in other conditions, and has a very low complication rate.&#xD;
      Additionally, the fact that it is being used outside of the study at the participating&#xD;
      centres at the discretion of the paediatric surgeons may provide an added level of&#xD;
      reassurance for the patient and their family.&#xD;
