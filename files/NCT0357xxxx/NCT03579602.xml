  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly&#xD;
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for&#xD;
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have&#xD;
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced&#xD;
      patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. Tozuleristide is a&#xD;
      drug that is thought to attach to tumor tissue and then fluoresces (glows) when a special&#xD;
      light from the Canvas is shined on it. It is hypothesized that tozuleristide, when imaged&#xD;
      with the Canvas, will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges&#xD;
      of the tumor or other ambiguous tissue in real-time as they operate. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate how well tozuleristide imaged with Canvas work at helping to distinguish&#xD;
      between tumor and normal tissue during surgery in pediatric primary central nervous system&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent, or have it provided by their legally&#xD;
      acceptable representative, will be screened for eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical excision will occur at least 1 hour and no more than 36 hours after tozuleristide&#xD;
      administration. Surgery will be performed by a neurosurgeon and the Canvas will be operated&#xD;
      by a designated Imaging Operator. Fluorescence of tumor and ambiguous tissue during surgery&#xD;
      will be assessed and scored. Biopsy samples of these tumor and ambiguous tissues will be&#xD;
      collected for pathology analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be monitored for safety during their participation in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Immunotherapy: at least 42 days after completion of any cellular immunotherapy,&#xD;
                  such as CAR-T cell therapy&#xD;

             prior to the conduct of study activities. Routine clinical tests, e.g., MRI, clinical&#xD;
             laboratory studies, may be used for screening requirements. Assent, when appropriate,&#xD;
             will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The risks of treatment with tozuleristide during pregnancy have not been evaluated.&#xD;

          2. Subjects with on-going serious medical conditions (poorly controlled asthma, diabetes,&#xD;
             heart disease) such that participation in the study could put the subject at increased&#xD;
             risk of worsening their condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects planned to undergo only a diagnostic biopsy procedure, without intent to&#xD;
