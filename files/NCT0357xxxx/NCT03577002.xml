    <textblock>
      This project compares two models of the Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) in primary care:&#xD;
      clinician-focused SICP and team-based SICP. Discussion and planning for serious illness care&#xD;
      can help patients identify what is most important to them and assure they receive care that&#xD;
      best matches their goals and values, such as spending more time at home or not being in pain.&#xD;

      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people die after living with chronic conditions that have a broadly predictable course.&#xD;
      This should give patients and families the opportunity to consider what is most important to&#xD;
      them and plan for the care they wish to receive in their final months and at the end of life.&#xD;
      However, in many cases health care defaults to more testing and treatments, creating a&#xD;
      potential mismatch between healthcare services and what patients and families want.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious illness care planning occurs once a patient with advanced illness reaches a life&#xD;
      expectancy of one to two years. Patients face a wide range of choices that can profoundly&#xD;
      affect their quality of life. Planning for the last months and days may improve quality of&#xD;
      life, by assuring health care supports patient goals and that preferences for life-sustaining&#xD;
      interventions honored. For many patients, this planning should occur in the primary care&#xD;
      setting, but primary care practices are over-extended, clinicians and staff are often&#xD;
      uncomfortable discussing prognosis, and patients and families often do not ask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) provides a comprehensive implementation strategy,&#xD;
      training modules, and a structured conversation guide to promote realistic and compassionate&#xD;
      discussions with seriously ill patients in any health care setting. SICP is widely used,&#xD;
      having trained hundreds of clinicians and used with thousands of patients. It contributes to&#xD;
      the quadruple aims of optimizing healthcare performance through improving patient experience&#xD;
      and appropriate utilization of resources, increasing population health, and improving the&#xD;
      work life of clinicians. The challenge is that it is unclear whether whether targeting&#xD;
      clinicians or entire teams is more efficient and effective when implementing SICP in primary&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will fill this critical gap by comparing two models of SICP in primary care:&#xD;
      clinician-focused SICP and team-based SICP. In the clinician-focused model, a patient's&#xD;
      primary care clinician is responsible for serious illness care planning, while in the&#xD;
      team-based model, tasks are purposefully shared across roles. This cluster-randomized trial&#xD;
      has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIM 1. Assess the comparative effectiveness in primary care of team-based vs. primary&#xD;
           clinician-focused SICP to achieve the long-term outcomes of concordance of care with&#xD;
           patient goals and more time at home for patients with prognoses of two years of life or&#xD;
           less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIM 2. Assess the comparative effectiveness in primary care of a team-based SICP vs.&#xD;
           clinician-focused SICP on place of death and family bereavement in cases where the&#xD;
           patient dies during the study period, as well as additional secondary short term and&#xD;
           intermediate outcomes including patient, family and clinician satisfaction with&#xD;
           communication and decisions and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIM 3. Identify determinants of successful implementation of the two different models of&#xD;
           SICP across varying settings, with a focus on the comparison of practices in the U.S.&#xD;
           and Canada and on practice-level characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design A cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) conducted in primary care&#xD;
      practices recruited from seven practice-based research networks (PBRNs) in the U.S. and&#xD;
      Canada. The practices will be randomly assigned to implement either the primary care&#xD;
      clinician-focused model or the team-based model. A cRCT is proposed because the two models&#xD;
      cannot be implemented simultaneously in the same practice. SICP requires changes in work flow&#xD;
      and different training is required for the clinician-focused and team-based models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main components of the intervention and comparators The clinician-focused model provides&#xD;
      training and standard infrastructure support within the practice, similar to what would be&#xD;
      provided for any primary care clinician activity. The team-based model splits the serious&#xD;
      illness care conversation and planning into its components and these are shared across team&#xD;
      members and may be spread over time. The composition of the teams and how they divide their&#xD;
      tasks will be allowed to vary across practices and patients; this is necessary and realistic&#xD;
      as staffing patterns and resources vary across practices and ACP should be customized to&#xD;
      patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The target population is adults living in the community with serious&#xD;
      illnesses and their families. The study will be conducted in a minimum of 36 primary care&#xD;
      practices in seven primary care PBRNs (five in the U.S., two in Canada). Each PBRN will&#xD;
      recruit a minimum of six practices to enroll 130 patients for a total of 1260 enrolled, so&#xD;
      that with attrition, over 750 will be available for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcomes are patient-centered. These are: a) care&#xD;
      that corresponds to patient goals and b) time spent at home. Assuring goal-concordant care is&#xD;
      the overarching purpose of the SICP. Patient outcomes will be measured at enrollment, six&#xD;
      months, and one year of follow-up. If the patient dies during the study period, place of&#xD;
      death will be recorded and a family member contacted to complete a bereavement survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will also include intermediate and proximal or short-term outcomes for&#xD;
      patients and families including patient and caregiver quality of life, depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, satisfaction with communication, decision quality, engagement and acceptability of&#xD;
      the SICP program and model to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic methods Analytic models will be refined with the input of the Research Project&#xD;
      Partnership (Steering Committee), including patient and clinician stakeholder representatives&#xD;
      as well as experts in biostatistics. Analysis will be conducted under an intention to treat&#xD;
      assumption with multiple imputation procedures and selection models for missing data.&#xD;
      Multilevel modeling will be used to account for clustering at the practice (cluster) and&#xD;
      individual level, and interaction terms will be included in the analysis to identify&#xD;
      potential heterogeneity of treatment effects.&#xD;
