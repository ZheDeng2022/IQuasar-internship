    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an integral part of cardiovascular disease management&#xD;
      incorporating aspects of scientifically constructed appropriate physical exercise. CR has&#xD;
      been repeatedly shown to significantly improve functional capacity, depression and wellbeing,&#xD;
      even following short term interventions. Functional capacity is closely related to frailty, a&#xD;
      key prognostic factor in subjects undergoing cardiac surgery. We intend to enroll 50 stable&#xD;
      subjects with valvular heart disease scheduled for surgical intervention. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the Prehab group will improve their functional capacity to a greater degree than the&#xD;
      usual care group, possibly associated with better clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an integral part of cardiovascular disease management&#xD;
      incorporating aspects of scientifically constructed appropriate physical exercise, dietary&#xD;
      intervention, secondary prevention by pharmacotherapy, and psychological intervention. CR has&#xD;
      been repeatedly shown to significantly improve functional capacity, depression and wellbeing,&#xD;
      even following short term interventions (6-8 weeks in accordance with the date of surgery&#xD;
      determined for the patient.) Functional capacity is closely related to frailty, a key&#xD;
      prognostic factor in subjects undergoing cardiac surgery. Small studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      possible benefits of pre-habilitation - a multidisciplinary intervention aimed at improving&#xD;
      frailty in the weeks prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to enroll 50 stable subjects with valvular heart disease scheduled for surgical&#xD;
      intervention. Following a comprehensive clinical and physiological evaluation subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized (1:1) to a Prehab arm (PHB) vs. usual care (UC). Subjects in the prehab arm&#xD;
      will receive a hybrid institution and home-based exercise prescription, nutritional and&#xD;
      psychological intervention and periodic calls. Adherence will be assessed and encouraged by&#xD;
      smartwatch and matching smartphone software. In the usual care arm subjects will receive&#xD;
      general recommendations following the baseline stress test performed by both groups (prehab&#xD;
      is not standard of care or guideline based). Another stress test will be performed days prior&#xD;
      to valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the Prehab group will improve their functional capacity to a greater&#xD;
      degree than the usual care group, possibly associated with better clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy outcome will be exercise capacity (assessed by symptom limited stress&#xD;
      test - estimated METS) change from baseline (enrollment) to pre-surgery evaluation visit&#xD;
      (pre-op test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the 2 study arms in regard to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Length of ICU and hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perioperative adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 30-day mortality or re-hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. QOL and satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient / Group numbers: A total of 50 patients with established valvular disease will be&#xD;
      enrolled to PHB or UC after eligibility verification by cardiothoracic surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hardware: Standard off the shelf Polar sports watch (M430) with matching smartphone software.&#xD;
      No clinical or identifiable data will be inputted into these systems (coded subject ID only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data and the entire program will be managed through the hospital electronic medical&#xD;
      record (EMR). All clinical decisions \ recommendations and events will be recorded in the&#xD;
      EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to pre-operative usual care or rehabilitation&#xD;
      program comprising of on-site (Sheba MC) and off-site training sessions. Adherence to the&#xD;
      rehab program will be assessed and a structured motivational program and follow-up will be&#xD;
      provided in order to maximize goal completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the standard rehabilitation intake process (stress test, physician visit, nurse&#xD;
      intake), the subjects in the prehab arm will receive physiologic consultation based on&#xD;
      clinical stress tests and clinical data passed from the physician. Subjects in the prehab arm&#xD;
      will receive an exercise prescription and execution will be assessed and periodically&#xD;
      adjusted in accordance to data received from the wearable device. Intensity and type of&#xD;
      exercise will be moderate and will comply with exercise recommendations provided by ESC&#xD;
      guidelines. A dedicated application will be installed on the mobile phone for patients in the&#xD;
      research group and they will receive a smart sports watch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic encouragements and consultations will be provided by exercise trainer, physiologist&#xD;
      and nurse from the cardiac rehabilitation center. A physician will be available for&#xD;
      consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to monitored physical activity, patients will receive nutritional and&#xD;
      psychological counseling. This is part of a multi-professional rehabilitation program&#xD;
      accepted by the rehabilitation center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive recommendations for a healthy and active lifestyle and&#xD;
      physician follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a stress test at baseline post enrollment and again prior to&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
