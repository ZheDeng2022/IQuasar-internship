  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OBI-888 as&#xD;
      monotherapy. And to characterize the safety and preliminary clinical activity profile of the&#xD;
      MTD dose of OBI-888 administered as monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
