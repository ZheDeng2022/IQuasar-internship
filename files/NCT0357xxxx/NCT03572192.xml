      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer therapies have significantly improved over the last decades, allowing cancer&#xD;
      specialists to keep cancer under control for longer than ever before. However, metastatic&#xD;
      cancer still develops in a large number of patients and drug resistance occurs in the&#xD;
      majority of them after an initial period of response and leads to cancer progression and&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the mechanisms which allow cancer cells to spread through the body to form&#xD;
      metastases and to become resistant even to the most powerful treatments are poorly&#xD;
      understood. Our aim is to collect cancer specimens and normal tissue specimens such as blood&#xD;
      from patients with solid tumours and to analyse these samples with some of the latest&#xD;
      molecular profiling technologies in the research laboratory. This comprehensive analysis&#xD;
      should reveal what molecular defects fuel the growth of cancer cells adn what allows them to&#xD;
      spread through the body and then develop resistance to cancer therapies. Such insights could&#xD;
      subsequently lead to the development of better more improved treatments which prevent drug&#xD;
      resistance, to novel molecular tests which can also predict which treatment is most likely to&#xD;
      be effective and tolerable in individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, we aim to collect multiple samples from consenting patients starting from&#xD;
      the diagnosis of a tumour to the time drug resistance develops more. Importantly, this study&#xD;
      will collect tissues from interventional procedures which are performed as part of routine&#xD;
      patient management of patients seen at Barts Health NHS trust. We will then apply molecular&#xD;
      tests such as proteomics and DNA sequencing to these samples. Tissues which are left over&#xD;
      after these tests have been applied will be stored in a licensed tissue bank to allow future&#xD;
      research with novel technologies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 320,000 patients are diagnosed with some form cancer in the UK each year.&#xD;
      Despite improved therapies, half of these patients still die of their disease, usually after&#xD;
      the failure of anticancer drug treatment. To date, mechanisms of drug resistance and also&#xD;
      determinants of treatment toxicity which varies significantly between individual patients are&#xD;
      poorly understood. Recent advances in molecular profiling techniques allow the comprehensive&#xD;
      interrogation of large numbers of genes, transcripts and proteins which may be altered and&#xD;
      contribute to progression and drug resistance in tumour tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These technologies, including genome wide RNA expression and methylation profiling and DNA&#xD;
      sequencing can be used to analyse the causes of cancer drug resistance in detail and this&#xD;
      information can subsequently be used to develop better cancer drugs which prevent or overcome&#xD;
      resistance and prolong patient survival. Furthermore, molecular studies can help to&#xD;
      understand why some patients develop excessive toxicities during treatment with drugs which&#xD;
      are well tolerated by most patients. This could help to develop tests that predict which&#xD;
      individual patients will not tolerate a specific drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, we recently demonstrated that individual human tumours can contain highly&#xD;
      heterogeneous cancer cell populations, for example good and poor prognosis cancer cells&#xD;
      within the same tumour. This intratumour heterogeneity may have hampered the identification&#xD;
      of markers of drug sensitivity or tumour aggressiveness in the past as single tumour biopsies&#xD;
      are unlikely to reveal this complexity. Thus, our project uses our established sample&#xD;
      collection protocols to comprehensively sample surgical specimens. This will allow the&#xD;
      analysis of intratumour heterogeneity and its impact on outcome which is an urgent clinical&#xD;
      need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour tissues can also change their molecular characteristics over time, for example during&#xD;
      treatment, which mandates the longitudinal collection of tissue and blood specimens in order&#xD;
      to understand how treatment resistance develops. We and others have recently shown that blood&#xD;
      samples can be used to obtain information about tumour progression without the need for&#xD;
      rebiopsies (Gerlinger, unpublished results and Forshew et al. Sci Transl Med 2012,&#xD;
      4:136ra68). Our aim is to regularly collect blood specimens from which tumour DNA and tumour&#xD;
      cells can be extracted and studies as a surrogate of the tumour lesions. Taken together,&#xD;
      multiregion sampling of tumours at surgery and longitudinal monitoring of molecular&#xD;
      alterations over time should provide crucial insights into tumour heterogeneity and tumour&#xD;
      evolution critical for progression and drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The understanding of mechanisms of tumour progression also requires the use of cancer model&#xD;
      systems in the laboratory and established cancer cell lines are generally used for this&#xD;
      purpose. Such cell lines have often adapted to the laboratory tissue culture environment&#xD;
      which changed their characteristics over time. Thus, they frequently behave differently from&#xD;
      cells isolated directly from fresh tumour specimens, hindering their use for the&#xD;
      identification of drug targets and resistance mechanisms. To circumvent this limitation, we&#xD;
      will also use the collected tissues to isolate primary tumour and stromal cells and to&#xD;
      maintain them in the laboratory for a limited period of time. This will provide the&#xD;
      opportunity to study tumour characteristics in greater detail and will prevent false&#xD;
      conclusions which can arise from artifacts which cannot be avoided in long term tissue&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together, these efforts should improve our understanding of tumour evolution over time and&#xD;
      reveal some of the mechanisms whih allow tumours to spread through the body and to develop&#xD;
      cancer drug resistance. This will be a major improvement over traditional approaches which&#xD;
      have most likely failed to identify mechanisms of cancer progression and treatment failure&#xD;
      because they relied on single biopsies, missing heterogeneous changes in individual tumours&#xD;
      and changes occurring over time (for further information: see Gerlinger et al (NEJM, March&#xD;
      2012) and Yap et al (Sci Transl Med, March 2012).&#xD;
