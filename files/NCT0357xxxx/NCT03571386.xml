      Mindfulness-based Interventions (MBIs) are a family of standardized cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      therapies that focus on cultivating mindfulness-related skills for improving maladaptive&#xD;
      cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. MBIs have been developed for a wide range of&#xD;
      problems, disorders, and populations and are increasingly available in a variety of health&#xD;
      settings. This mixed methods study proposes to investigate proposed neurobiological,&#xD;
      physiological, psycho-social-behavioral, and cognitive mechanisms by which MBIs may improve&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The state of mindfulness can be described as a form of meta-awareness in which attention is&#xD;
      allocated to the present moment of external and internal sensory or mental experience,&#xD;
      without reactivity, and without dwelling on any particular sensory or mental object with&#xD;
      judgement or evaluation. Mindfulness-based Interventions (MBIs) are a family of standardized&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral therapies that focus on cultivating mindfulness-related skills for&#xD;
      improving maladaptive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBIs have been developed for a wide range of problems, disorders, and populations and are&#xD;
      increasingly available in a variety of health settings. Empirically supported MBIs include&#xD;
      acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999), dialectical&#xD;
      behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal,&#xD;
      Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2002), and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1982,&#xD;
      1990). Variations on these approaches, including integration of mindfulness training into&#xD;
      individual psychotherapy from diverse perspectives, also have been described (Germer, Siegel,&#xD;
      &amp; Fulton, 2005). As the empirical evidence for the efficacy of these interventions continues&#xD;
      to grow, the importance of investigating the mechanisms or processes by which they lead to&#xD;
      beneficial outcomes is increasingly recognized. This mixed methods study proposes to&#xD;
      investigate proposed neurobiological, physiological, psycho-social-behavioral, and cognitive&#xD;
      mechanisms by which MBIs may improve health outcomes. Target (mechanism) engagement is&#xD;
      expected to facilitate identification of individuals who are most likely to benefit (or not)&#xD;
      from MBIs and further develop targeted interventions for optimization of delivery. Although&#xD;
      there are very specific aims and hypotheses to be tested, this preliminary exploratory&#xD;
      investigation will provide feasibility data and allow for refining existing hypotheses for&#xD;
      larger research proposals to be submitted for extramural grant support.&#xD;

      Whole blood assays (WBA) will be used in conjunction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated&#xD;
      whole blood cell cultures for detecting reliable cytokine responsivity. Introducing LPS as an&#xD;
      in vitro stimulus to study the potential variable effect on cytokines such as TNFα gene&#xD;
      expression in fresh whole blood as compared to fresh PBMCs or frozen PBMCs has demonstrated&#xD;
      to be successful and with less variability than peripheral markers. The WBA uses a small&#xD;
      sample volume (approximately 1-2 ml).&#xD;
