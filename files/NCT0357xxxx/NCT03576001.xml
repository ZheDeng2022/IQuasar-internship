      with cervical or thoracic SCI, AIS grade A, B, C, or D, 6 months or later after injury. The&#xD;

      Study Description: The proposed phase 2 trial a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group trial in persons with cervical or thoracic SCI, AIS grade A, B, C, or D, 6 months or&#xD;
      later after injury. The trial will test the hypothesis that a Home-Based Multimodality&#xD;
      Functional Recovery and Metabolic Health Enhancement Program that addresses multiple&#xD;
      pathophysiologic factors in SCI and includes functional electrical stimulation during leg&#xD;
      cycling (FES-LC) plus arm ergometry and an androgen will be more efficacious than functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation during leg cycling (FES-LC) plus arm ergometry plus placebo in&#xD;
      improving aerobic capacity, function, metabolism, bone health, and wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine whether the multimodality intervention is more efficacious in improving peak&#xD;
      aerobic capacity, and muscle mass and strength than placebo plus functional electrical&#xD;
      stimulation during leg cycling (FES-LC) plus arm ergometry alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the multimodality intervention is more efficacious than placebo&#xD;
           plus functional electrical stimulation during leg cycling (FES-LC) plus arm ergometry in&#xD;
           improving metabolic health, as reflected in fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity, fat mass and distribution, plasma lipids, and inflammation markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the multimodality intervention is more efficacious than placebo&#xD;
           plus functional electrical stimulation during leg cycling (FES-LC) plus arm ergometry in&#xD;
           improving volumetric and areal bone density, bone microarchitecture, and bone strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of the multimodality intervention in improving self-reported&#xD;
      physical function (using SCI-FI AT and wellbeing (mood, anxiety, pain, loneliness and life&#xD;
      satisfaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess safety by structured monitoring of adverse events, and determining the proportion&#xD;
      of participants experiencing injury, erythrocytosis, or other androgen-related or&#xD;
      exercise-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome is peak aerobic capacity because it is an excellent marker of overall&#xD;
      health, physical function, and mortality. Aerobic capacity is closely related to metabolic&#xD;
      health, insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular outcomes. It can be measured accurately in SCI&#xD;
      patients and would be expected to improve with the proposed interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints. Whole body skeletal muscle and fat mass and intraabdominal fat will be&#xD;
      assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using the Dixon method for separation of water/&#xD;
      fat signals. Body composition will also be measured by DEXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal voluntary strength and muscle fatigability in the upper extremity will be assessed&#xD;
      using the 1-repetition maximum in chest press.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total, trabecular and cortical volumetric bone density; trabecular and cortical&#xD;
      microarchitecture, both measured using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed&#xD;
      tomography (HR-pQCT) at the ultradistal tibia, proximal tibia, and ultradistal radius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated bone strength of the ultradistal tibia and radius, assessed using microfinite&#xD;
      element analysis of the HR-pQCT data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Areal bone mineral density of the hip and lumbar spine using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DEXA). (aBMD will be measured because DEXA is a clinically used and accepted measure of bone&#xD;
      density, and aBMD is predictive of fracture risk.) Serum bone turnover markers, including&#xD;
      markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), (PINP) and&#xD;
      bone resorption (CTX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal Cord Injury - Functional Index (SCI-FI) will be used to assess self-reported function&#xD;
      and mobility. SCI-FI is specific for persons with SCI that assesses functional capacity in&#xD;
      basic mobility, ambulation, self-care, and fine motor function, and wheelchair ambulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of Metabolism: Fasting glucose, A1C; insulin sensitivity using HOMA-IR; IL-6 and&#xD;
      hsCRP as inflammation markers; and plasma lipids, apolipoproteins B, C and A, and lipoprotein&#xD;
      particles as markers of atherogenicity - all measured in the Brigham Research Assay&#xD;
      Laboratory. Visceral fat will be assessed using Dixon MRI technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wellbeing: We will assess mood, anxiety, pain, and life satisfaction as measures of&#xD;
      wellbeing. Mood will be assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a 9-item scale&#xD;
      that assesses mood and depressive symptoms. We will assess anxiety using GAD-7. Modified&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), a validated measure of pain in SCI, assesses pain intensity&#xD;
      (sensory dimension) and interference with function (reactive dimension). Satisfaction with&#xD;
      Life Scale is a 5-item scale that assesses happiness with life. Loneliness will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Three-Item Loneliness Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: This proof-of-concept trial will enroll 88 community dwelling men and women&#xD;
      with SCI, 19 to 70 years of age, motor C7-T12 cervical and thoracic, AIS A, B, C, or D, 6&#xD;
      months or later after a SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial plans to randomize 88 eligible subjects at a single trial site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: This is a single site study that will&#xD;
      take place at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention: The Home-Based Multimodality Functional Recovery and&#xD;
      Metabolic Health Enhancement Program includes training at home consisting of FES-LC plus arm&#xD;
      ergometry plus testosterone undecanoate. Testosterone injections will be administered by&#xD;
      study staff in the research clinic or by a visiting nurse in the participant's home. The&#xD;
      control group will receive FES-LC plus arm ergometry plus placebo injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Approximately 54 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: Approximately 33 weeks (14 weeks for screening, baseline studies, and&#xD;
      Day 1, 16 weeks of intervention, and up to 3 weeks of end of study assessments)&#xD;
