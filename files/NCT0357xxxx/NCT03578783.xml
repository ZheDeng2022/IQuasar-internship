  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the effect of PSD502 (the study medication) compared to&#xD;
      placebo in subjects with premature ejaculation. PSD502 is a topical (applied to skin)&#xD;
      anesthetic spray containing a mixture of two drugs called lidocaine and prilocaine that will&#xD;
      be applied to the penis. Half of the subjects will receive PSD502 and half will receive&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess whether the bothersome symptoms of premature ejaculation (PE) are&#xD;
      helped when treated with PSD502 by answering questionnaires such as the 'Premature&#xD;
      Ejaculation Bothersome Evaluation Questionnaire' (PEBEQ) and 'Index of Premature Ejaculation©&#xD;
      (IPE) and some additional questions about premature ejaculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also measure the effect of PSD502 on the Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time&#xD;
      (IELT). This is the time between when the penis enters the vagina and when the subject starts&#xD;
      to ejaculate in the vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are stratified based on whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised and within&#xD;
      each stratified group subjects are randomized to PSD502 (lidocaine prilocaine spray) or&#xD;
      placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
