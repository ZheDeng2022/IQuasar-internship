    <textblock>
      This study will investigate a Clostridium difficile vaccine in healthy adults 65 to 85 years&#xD;
      of age, who will each receive 3 doses of vaccine. The study will assess the lot consistency,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of the vaccine, and also look at the subjects' immune response to&#xD;
      the vaccine.&#xD;
