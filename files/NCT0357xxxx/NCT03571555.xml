  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents/young adults with perinatally acquired HIV (PAH) face a number of antiretroviral&#xD;
      (ART) adherence and well-being challenges. Two psychosocial interventions that have been&#xD;
      developed to address a range of needs of this population (and their caregivers) are&#xD;
      residential interventions (camps) and support groups (clubs). There has been little&#xD;
      quantitative evaluation of the effects of attending camps for young people and clubs (for&#xD;
      children or caregivers), globally. This study aims to investigate whether a package of&#xD;
      psychosocial support (camps and clubs) offered to young people living with HIV and their&#xD;
      caregivers in Botswana by the Sentebale organisation, is associated with improvements in&#xD;
      psychological, behavioural and clinical outcomes from first attendance to one year follow-up.&#xD;
      In addition, the study will explore how the psychosocial programme is experienced by young&#xD;
      people and their caregivers, and what the perceived impact is. The project as a whole will&#xD;
      take place over three years. There will be an initial six month preparatory phase that will&#xD;
      include the adaptation of self-report measures for the study context. Subsequently, two&#xD;
      studies will be undertaken. The main study will involve a single group within-participants&#xD;
      prospective cohort design with two time points (baseline and one year follow-up) with young&#xD;
      people and caregivers. The sub-study will involve a qualitative cross sectional design&#xD;
      involving semi-structured interviews with young people and caregivers. Young people will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate if they are aged 10 to 19 years at the time of study enrolment, are&#xD;
      living with HIV and aware of HIV-positive status, have recently started attending the&#xD;
      Sentebale programme, and are able to give informed assent/consent. We will aim to retain 175&#xD;
      young people (of 253 recruited) . We will also aim to retain 178 caregivers (of 263&#xD;
      recruited). The sample size for the sub-study will consist of ten young people and ten&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately two million young people between 10 and 19 years, living with HIV&#xD;
      (UNAIDS, 2013). Many of this population have been living with HIV since birth.&#xD;
      Adolescents/young adults with perinatally acquired HIV (PAH) face a number of antiretroviral&#xD;
      (ART) adherence and well-being challenges. They often have long histories of ART use with&#xD;
      suboptimal regimens (Sohn &amp; Hazra, 2013) and rates of viral suppression are variable, often&#xD;
      associated with poor ART adherence (Kim, Gerver, Fidler, &amp; Ward, 2014). Challenges to&#xD;
      positive well-being in young people with PAH include some experiencing multiple caretaking&#xD;
      transitions, loss due to parental illness or death, and other stressors associated with&#xD;
      living with a chronic and stigmatised illness (e.g., hospitalisations, missed school and&#xD;
      social opportunities, HIV disclosure challenges and pain). There is evidence of lower levels&#xD;
      of wellbeing in young people living with PAH compared to their HIV unaffected peers (Mellins&#xD;
      &amp; Malee, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offering psychosocial interventions for young people living with HIV has the potential for&#xD;
      enhancing well-being, HIV adjustment, ART adherence, self-esteem and increasing HIV knowledge&#xD;
      and HIV disclosure. There are a small number of quantitative studies evaluating interventions&#xD;
      to enhance antiretroviral adherence in young people with HIV (Shaw &amp; Amico, 2016) but few&#xD;
      robust quantitative evaluations of psychosocial interventions to enhance well-being in this&#xD;
      population (King, De Silva, Stein, &amp; Patel, 2009). There are no interventions on enhancing&#xD;
      onward HIV disclosure in adolescents living with HIV (Evangeli &amp; Foster, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two psychosocial interventions that have been developed to address a range of needs of this&#xD;
      population (and their caregivers) are residential interventions and support groups. Regarding&#xD;
      residential interventions, there is quantitative evidence in other chronic conditions of&#xD;
      increased youth self-esteem after attendance (Odar, Canter, &amp; Roberts, 2013). There is also&#xD;
      some qualitative literature on evaluating residential interventions (support camps) for young&#xD;
      people living with HIV in the US (Gillard &amp; Allsop, 2016; Gillard, Witt, &amp; Watts, 2011;&#xD;
      Pearson, Johnson, Simpson, &amp; Gallagher, 1997). Interviews with Camp attendees have revealed&#xD;
      that this intervention can elicit a sense of belonging, enjoyment, escape, personal growth,&#xD;
      being oneself, and caring connections, as well as increasing HIV knowledge, attitudes and&#xD;
      skills. A recent quantitative evaluation of a residential intervention in the UK showed&#xD;
      evidence for increases in HIV knowledge and pro-HIV disclosure attitudes and cognitions that&#xD;
      were maintained at six month follow-up (Evangeli, Lut, &amp; Ely, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also some global evidence of positive benefits of support groups for children living&#xD;
      with HIV, who report that groups provide a sense of belonging, normality, confidence and&#xD;
      safety; supportive relationships; and a place to learn about treatment adherence and living&#xD;
      healthily (Brothers, Harper, Fernandez, Hosek, &amp; Adolescent Trials Network for, 2014;&#xD;
      Funck-Brentano et al., 2005; Midtbo, Shirima, Skovdal, &amp; Daniel, 2012; Mupambireyi, Bernays,&#xD;
      Bwakura-Dangarembizi, &amp; Cowan, 2014; Muskat, Salter, Shindler, Porter, &amp; Bitnum, 2016). There&#xD;
      has been little quantitative evaluation of the effects of attending support groups (for&#xD;
      children or caregivers), although one pilot study using non-random allocation, showed some&#xD;
      evidence of decreased worry about illness, less negative perception about treatment and&#xD;
      greater rates of viral suppression in adolescents living with HIV (Funck-Brentano et al.,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentebale is an organisation that has been providing residential interventions (camps) to&#xD;
      adolescents living with HIV, and follow up support groups (clubs) for these adolescents and&#xD;
      their caregivers, amongst other psychosocial interventions, in Lesotho for a number of years.&#xD;
      Sentebale is now offering a similar package of psychosocial services to young people and&#xD;
      caregivers in Botswana, partnering with Serious Fun Children's Network. The aims of Sentebale&#xD;
      are to provide support that will enable young people to living healthy and hopeful lives,&#xD;
      increase confidence, improve educational and occupational functioning, increase care and&#xD;
      support, enhance HIV communication, increase caregiver support, reduce onward transmission,&#xD;
      and increase remembering to take medication. We will evaluate the above psychosocial&#xD;
      programme, given the need to investigate the psychosocial, behavioural and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of this type of intervention in high HIV prevalence contexts. Botswana has an estimated HIV&#xD;
      prevalence of 6.6% in 15-19 year olds, and an estimated adult prevalence rate of 18.5%, and&#xD;
      despite high levels of ART adherence, psychological difficulties in this population are&#xD;
      common (Gupta et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This three year study aims to answer the following questions in a population of adolescents&#xD;
      living with HIV and their caregivers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the package of support offered by Sentebale (camps for young people, clubs for young&#xD;
           people and caregivers) associated with improvements in psychological, behavioural and&#xD;
           clinical outcomes from first attendance to one year follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How is the package of support experienced by young people and their caregivers, and what&#xD;
           is the perceived impact for young people and their caregivers?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main study - single group within-participants prospective cohort design with two time&#xD;
           points (baseline and one year follow-up) with 175 young people and 178 caregivers&#xD;
           retained in the study (Study Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sub-study - qualitative cross sectional design involving semi-structured interviews with&#xD;
           10 young people and 10 caregivers (Study Aim 2).&#xD;
