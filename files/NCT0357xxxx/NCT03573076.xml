      This study investigates a non-ablative fractional thulium laser and a radio-frequency&#xD;
      microneedling device as pre-treatment for combination photodynamic therapy in treatment of&#xD;
      photoaged skin and actinic keratoses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photoaging of skin and actinic keratoses Photoaging of the skin is the result of UV radiation&#xD;
      in chronic sun exposure and its deleterious effects. Photoaging includes fine and coarse&#xD;
      wrinkles, roughness, laxity, mottled pigmentation, coarseness, sallowness, telangiectasia,&#xD;
      solar lentigines and dysplastic actinic keratoses. The process can be of both cosmetic and&#xD;
      medical importance. Actinic keratoses (AK) are common dysplastic pre-malignant lesions that&#xD;
      may develop into a malign invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). SCCs have metastatic&#xD;
      potential at up to 3%. The risk of malign transformation from AK to SCC is highest in chronic&#xD;
      sun-damaged skin with confluent field-cancerization from multiple AK. National guidelines&#xD;
      recommend treatment of the entire field of sun damaged skin with photodynamic therapy and&#xD;
      several topical drugs, e.g. imiquimod, diclofenac, ingenol mebutate, and 5-fluoruracil.&#xD;
      Repeat treatments are usually necessary to achieve the desired results in patients with&#xD;
      chronic sun damaged skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photochemical treatment with photodynamic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment that uses a photosensitizer drug activated in the&#xD;
      skin by light in the visible spectrum. Methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) is a photosensitizing&#xD;
      agent with great affinity for dysplastic cells, and transforms into the light-sensitive&#xD;
      Protoporphyrin PpIX. When exposed to light, photoactivated PpIX catalyzes a reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species reaction, which leads to irreversible cell apoptosis of the dysplastic or neoplastic&#xD;
      tissue. PDT can be used as treatment of a wide range of photoaging skin defects including&#xD;
      actinic keratoses, and is exceedingly well suited for treatment of larger skin areas. PDT&#xD;
      produces cosmetically pleasing results in extension of the excellent AK clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical intervention with fractional laser and light-based interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional laser and light-based treatments with lasers and microneedles are approaches that&#xD;
      can be applied very precisely, and can be used to rejuvenate photodamaged skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser-treatment for rejuvenation of skin can be achieved using a non-ablative 1927 nm&#xD;
      fractionated thulium laser (NAFL), good results have been reported for many aspects of&#xD;
      photoaging, and specifically for actinic keratoses with good results. The thulium laser works&#xD;
      by creating vertical thermal laser-channels in the skin without the ablative effect to the&#xD;
      epidermis. Laser-treatment with the thulium laser may be combined with other treatments like&#xD;
      PDT to produce synergistic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microneedling (MN) is a treatment option in which the skin epidermis is penetrated by closely&#xD;
      arranged multiple microneedles. This can induce collagen production and stimulate the release&#xD;
      of growth factors, and collagen synthesis and remodeling, producing the effects of&#xD;
      rejuvenation. Radio-frequency (RF) microneedling (MN), also known as RF-MN, adds RF making it&#xD;
      possible for insulated needles to emit heat at the needle-heads when the epidermis is fully&#xD;
      punctured, possibly enhancing the described effects even further. Good results have been&#xD;
      reported using MN as skin rejuvenation, and can the treatment be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delicate skin of the décolleté is subject to a high amount of accumulated life-time sun&#xD;
      exposure, and is thus highly susceptible to photoaging effects. A mild and effective&#xD;
      treatment of photodamaged skin for this particular area is highly desirable, and may be&#xD;
      achieved by developing new combination strategies, in which the thulium laser or a&#xD;
      microneedling device can be used as effective pre-treatment for PDT. To our knowledge, no&#xD;
      previous randomized study has compared the use of the non-ablative thulium laser or&#xD;
      microneedling in combination with photodynamic treatment (PDT).&#xD;

    The second study arm including radio-frequency microneedling was withdrawn due to availability&#xD;
