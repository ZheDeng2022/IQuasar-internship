      This is a single-center, non-randomized, non-blinded feasibility study to evaluate the&#xD;
      performance, safety and tolerability of the Percutaneous Ultrasound Gastrostomy (PUG)&#xD;
      procedure that utilizes a novel device in conjunction with widely available ultrasound&#xD;
      technology. The procedure will be performed in up to 25 eligible subjects. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 2 days following performance of PUG to assess for potential complications. If&#xD;
      the patient remains hospitalized they will be assessed at date of discharge or Day 30&#xD;
      (whichever is earlier) for potential complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrostomy feeding is an established means of delivering adequate nutrition to patients with&#xD;
      an inability to meet their metabolic requirements due to inadequate oral intake.&#xD;
      Additionally, the gastrostomy tube can be utilized for medication administration in patients&#xD;
      unable to otherwise tolerate oral intake. Traditionally, placement of gastrostomy tubes has&#xD;
      been performed endoscopically, radiologically or by either laparoscopic or open surgical&#xD;
      techniques. More than 200,000 gastrostomy tubes are placed each year in the United States,&#xD;
      and that number is expected to increase as the proportion of the population that is elderly&#xD;
      grows (Roche et al 2003, Goldberg et al 2005, Lynch et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have failed to identify a clearly superior technique for placement of&#xD;
      feeding tubes (Bravo 2016, Yuan 2016). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was first&#xD;
      described by Gauderer et al. in 1980 in a case series of 12 children as an alternative to&#xD;
      laparotomy in high-risk patients (Gauderer 1980). There is a high overall success rate of PEG&#xD;
      placement at 95-100% (Itkin 2011). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become the&#xD;
      most common method for placement of a gastrostomy tube. This requires the use of specialized&#xD;
      equipment and the availability of physicians specifically trained in this procedure. The&#xD;
      number of procedures performed yearly to place feeding tubes is expected to rise as the&#xD;
      population ages and as some treatments have resulted in some diseases become chronic states&#xD;
      rather than invariably fatal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenges to performance of gastrostomy tube placement include the requirement for&#xD;
      specialized equipment, specialized areas designated to have this procedure performed as well&#xD;
      as the need for proceduralists who are specifically trained in this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoapTech device was developed in an effort to reduce the complicated requirements&#xD;
      associated with other techniques of gastrostomy placement so that when clinically indicated&#xD;
      the procedure can be performed in a safe and timely manner by a wide range of clinicians with&#xD;
      various training backgrounds.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Study recruitment began Oct 2018 and concluded Apr 2020. Patients referred to Interventional Radiology for gastrostomy tube placement were approached for consent at least 24hrs pre-procedure in clinic or in hospital. When patients lacked capacity to consent, a surrogate decision maker was approached or reached remotely for telephone consent.</recruitment_details>
