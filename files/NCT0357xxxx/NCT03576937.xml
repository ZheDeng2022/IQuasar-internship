  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines in non-small cell lung cancer recommend genomic assessment for mutations&#xD;
      in EGFR and BRAF, gene rearrangements in ALK and ROS1, and resistance mutations such as T790M&#xD;
      upon progression during EGFR inhibitor therapy. However, obtaining sufficient tumour tissue&#xD;
      to test for these molecular alterations, as well as those with emerging targeted therapies,&#xD;
      is challenging in lung cancer. A promising method to improve molecular diagnostic testing in&#xD;
      lung and other cancers is the use of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from blood&#xD;
      samples or liquid biopsies. This multi-centre prospective study will compare blood-based&#xD;
      profiling (using the GUARDANT360 assay) to standard of care tissue-based profiling within the&#xD;
      Canadian system.&#xD;
