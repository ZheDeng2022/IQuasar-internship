  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial exploring&#xD;
      cellular therapy to facilitate immunosuppression withdrawal in liver transplant recipients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study plan to enroll 9 participants who will receive at least the&#xD;
      target Treg product (arTreg-CSB) dose of 2.5 x 10^6 cells. Participants who receive at least&#xD;
      1 x 10^6 cells but &lt; 2.5 x 10^6 cells as a result of low cell yield will be included in&#xD;
      intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who successfully withdraw from all immunosuppression will undergo a research&#xD;
      biopsy at 52 weeks following drug discontinuation to determine whether they meet the primary&#xD;
      efficacy outcome of operational tolerance. Participants determined to be operationally&#xD;
      tolerant will be followed until 104 weeks following drug discontinuation and have a research&#xD;
      biopsy at that time to confirm that they remain operationally tolerant. Participants who fail&#xD;
      drug withdrawal after 52 weeks but before 104 weeks will be followed until week 104 or 12&#xD;
      weeks after resuming immunosuppression, whichever is longer. The research biopsy at week 104&#xD;
      will be optional for these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not successfully withdraw from all immunosuppression will complete 104&#xD;
      weeks of High Intensity Safety Follow-up after failing immunosuppression withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the&#xD;
      Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed,&#xD;
      controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can&#xD;
      result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare&#xD;
      circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.&#xD;

At the start of conversion from tacrolimus (TAC) to EVR IS:EVR will be started at 1.5 mg taken by mouth BID, with dose adjusted to achieve a trough blood level of 5-8 ng/mL. Once an EVR trough level of ≥ 5 ng/mL is achieved, baseline TAC dose will be reduced to achieve a trough level of 3-5 ng/mL.&#xD;
When target EVR and TAC levels are achieved/ maintained over two consecutive measurements, and liver function tests, ALT and GGT, are ≤50 U/L, participants will be considered successfully converted to EVR-based IS regimen. EVR doses will be administered, monitored and adjusted over time, per protocol.</description>
