    <measure>Overall Change From Baseline in Abdominal Score (Abdominal Bloating, Abdominal Discomfort, and Abdominal Pain) Throughout the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization), Treatment Period (Weeks 1-12)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant's daily abdominal score was calculated as the average of daily e-diary abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores, each based on an 11-point scale of 0 (none) and 10 (worst possible). Baseline abdominal score was derived from the eDiary data collected daily in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization. The participant's abdominal score was averaged on a weekly basis, and each weekly change from baseline was calculated for the treatment period and used as the dependent variable in the mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) model. MMRM results are based on a model with treatment, analysis week, region and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model intra-subject correlation with subjects as a random effect.</description>

    <description>A participant's daily abdominal score was calculated as the average of daily e-diary abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores, each based on an 11-point scale of 0 (none) and 10 (worst possible). Baseline abdominal score was derived from the eDiary data collected daily in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization. The 12-week abdominal score was the average of the non-missing abdominal scores reported over the course of the treatment period. Change from baseline (BL) was calculated as the 12-week score minus the baseline score. The table presents the percentage of participants whose 12-week change from baseline was less than or equal to the threshold value of the score change (cumulative distribution of change).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of 6/12 Week Abdominal Score Responders (Responder Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization), Treatment Period (Weeks 1-12)</time_frame>
    <description>A 6/12 week abdominal score responder is a participant who meets the weekly abdominal score responder criteria for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. For each week in the Treatment Period, a weekly abdominal score responder is a participant who has an improvement from baseline of at least 2 points (ie, a -2 point change from baseline) in the respective weekly abdominal score. If a participant did not have at least 4 completed eDiary entries for a particular Treatment Period week, the participant was not considered a responder for that week.&#xD;

          <description>A participant's daily abdominal score was calculated as the average of daily electronic diary (e-diary) abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores, each based on an 11-point scale of 0 (none) and 10 (very severe). Baseline abdominal score was derived from the eDiary data collected daily in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization.</description>

        <title>Overall Change From Baseline in Abdominal Score (Abdominal Bloating, Abdominal Discomfort, and Abdominal Pain) Throughout the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>A participant's daily abdominal score was calculated as the average of daily e-diary abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores, each based on an 11-point scale of 0 (none) and 10 (worst possible). Baseline abdominal score was derived from the eDiary data collected daily in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization. The participant's abdominal score was averaged on a weekly basis, and each weekly change from baseline was calculated for the treatment period and used as the dependent variable in the mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) model. MMRM results are based on a model with treatment, analysis week, region and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model intra-subject correlation with subjects as a random effect.</description>

        <description>A participant's daily abdominal score was calculated as the average of daily e-diary abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores, each based on an 11-point scale of 0 (none) and 10 (worst possible). Baseline abdominal score was derived from the eDiary data collected daily in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization. The 12-week abdominal score was the average of the non-missing abdominal scores reported over the course of the treatment period. Change from baseline (BL) was calculated as the 12-week score minus the baseline score. The table presents the percentage of participants whose 12-week change from baseline was less than or equal to the threshold value of the score change (cumulative distribution of change).</description>

        <description>A 6/12 week abdominal score responder is a participant who meets the weekly abdominal score responder criteria for at least 6 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. For each week in the Treatment Period, a weekly abdominal score responder is a participant who has an improvement from baseline of at least 2 points (ie, a -2 point change from baseline) in the respective weekly abdominal score. If a participant did not have at least 4 completed eDiary entries for a particular Treatment Period week, the participant was not considered a responder for that week.&#xD;
A participant's daily abdominal score was calculated as the average of daily e-diary abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores, each based on an 11-point scale of 0 (none) and 10 (worst possible). The participant's abdominal score was averaged on a weekly basis, and each weekly change from baseline was calculated for the treatment period.</description>

            <groups_desc>The overall family-wise Type I error rate for the primary and secondary outcome measures were controlled at the α=0.05 level by employing a fixed-sequence testing procedure. Outcome measures were tested using 10 hypotheses, each comparing linaclotide versus placebo, in the sequence of presentation of statistical analyses in this record. If the hypothesis comparing the 2 groups was statistically significant (α=0.05), then the next hypothesis was to be tested; otherwise, testing would stop.</groups_desc>

        <title>Overall Change From Baseline in Abdominal Score (Abdominal Bloating, Abdominal Discomfort, and Abdominal Pain) Over Time in the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>A participant's daily abdominal score was calculated as the average of daily e-diary abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores, each based on an 11-point scale of 0 (none) and 10 (worst possible). Baseline abdominal score was derived from the eDiary data collected daily in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization. The participant's abdominal score was averaged on a weekly basis, and each weekly change from baseline was calculated for the treatment period and used as the dependent variable in the mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) model. MMRM results are based on a model with treatment, analysis week, region and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model intra-subject correlation with subjects as a random effect.</description>

The overall family-wise Type I error rate for primary and secondary outcome measures were controlled at the α=0.05 level by employing a fixed-sequence testing procedure. Outcome measures were tested using 10 hypotheses, each comparing linaclotide versus placebo, in the sequence of presentation of statistical analyses in this record. If the hypothesis comparing the 2 groups was statistically significant (α=0.05), then the next hypothesis was to be tested; otherwise, testing would stop.</groups_desc>
