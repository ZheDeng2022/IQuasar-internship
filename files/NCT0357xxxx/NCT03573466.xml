  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and initial compensatory reinnervation is the&#xD;
      earliest pathological event in various motor neuron disease models, occurring far before&#xD;
      motor symptom onset. In patients harboring genetic mutations responsible for Amyotrophic&#xD;
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), identification of early, pre-symptomatic, NMJ pathological events&#xD;
      and compensatory mechanisms could lead to the development of new treatments to prevent motor&#xD;
      functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of our study are thus:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate and characterize early, presymptomatic, defects of NMJ morphology in&#xD;
           pre-manifest C9ORF72 or SOD1 mutation carriers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate and quantify reinnervation at the level of NMJs in these subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify muscle molecular dysregulated pathways involved in the development of NMJ&#xD;
           alterations and the development / maintenance of compensatory collateral reinnervation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where the axon terminal connects the motor endplate of the&#xD;
      muscle fiber, is the first structure affected in various Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)&#xD;
      rodent models. In these models, NMJ denervation and initial compensatory reinnervation are&#xD;
      the earliest pathological event. These NMJ morphological defects occur far before changes can&#xD;
      be seen at the level of motor neuron cell bodies and motor symptom onset. In these rodent&#xD;
      models, there is thus a &quot;latency phase&quot; of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ALS patients, the onset of symptoms is believed to occur when approximately 50 to 80% of&#xD;
      motor neurons are lost and it has been suggested that the disease may have a prolonged&#xD;
      preclinical period. After clinical onset of the disease, the existence of striking NMJ&#xD;
      morphological defects and compensatory reinnervation of endplates has been shown in muscle of&#xD;
      ALS patients, but their occurrence at the presymptomatic stage has never been investigated.&#xD;
      As in animal models, at the subclinical onset of the disease, efficient reinnervation of NMJs&#xD;
      could compensate for the loss of motor neurons and subjects would remain free of any motor&#xD;
      symptom. As the destruction of NMJs progresses, compensation would become ineffective,&#xD;
      leading to progressive muscle weakness and clinical onset of the disease. Identification of&#xD;
      early, pre-symptomatic, NMJ pathological events and compensatory mechanisms could thus lead&#xD;
      to the development of new treatment strategies to prevent motor functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human, the &quot;latency phase&quot; of the disease can be investigated in pre-manifest ALS mutation&#xD;
      carriers. Indeed, in a population of asymptomatic carriers of C9ORF72 or SOD1 mutations (two&#xD;
      of the main genes associated with familial ALS), a dysregulation of circulating microRNAs has&#xD;
      been found long before the estimated time window of disease symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the PRE-ALS study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to investigate and characterize early, preclinical defects of NMJ&#xD;
      morphology in muscle specimens from pre-manifest C9ORF72 or SOD1 mutation carriers;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate and quantify reinnervation at the level of NMJs in these subjects; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify muscle dysregulated pathways involved in the development of NMJ alterations&#xD;
           and the development / maintenance of compensatory collateral reinnervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, ten subjects with mutations in one of two major ALS-associated genes -&#xD;
      C9ORF72 and SOD1- free from any motor symptom, will be included in the study. These subjects,&#xD;
      diagnosed on the basis of presymptomatic DNA tests performed in the context of familial ALS&#xD;
      or familial frontotemporal dementia linked to C9ORF72 expansion (C9-FTD), will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Paris ALS center (Dr Salachas) and the Reference Centre for Rare Dementias (Dr Le&#xD;
      Ber). Subjects harboring mutations in the C9ORF72 gene with only moderate cognitive&#xD;
      impairment may also be included if they are free of motor involvement after neurological&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be clinically and neurophysiologically followed-up during 18 months after&#xD;
      inclusion in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength will be measured by manual muscle testing according to the grading&#xD;
           system of the Medical Research Council;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional motor impairment will be assessed using the widely used revised ALS&#xD;
           Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), a 12-item scale that rates the performance of&#xD;
           activities of daily living;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor neuron loss will be evaluated using Motor Unit Number Index (MUNIX), a validated&#xD;
           method to assess number and size of motor units in ALS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A muscle biopsy will be performed to investigate potential morphological defects at the level&#xD;
      of NMJs. The morphology of NMJs will be analyzed using confocal microscopy after&#xD;
      immunostaining and collateral reinnervation will be quantified for each subject. Dysregulated&#xD;
      intracellular signaling pathways potentially implicated in preclinical structural defects of&#xD;
      NMJs and / or reinnervation will be investigated in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the PRE-ALS study will be the first to investigate preclinical changes of NMJs in&#xD;
      presymptomatic ALS mutation carriers and to identify muscle compensatory mechanisms allowing&#xD;
      preservation of motor function. This work should pave the way to identification of new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies in order to prevent the occurrence of strength loss in ALS mutations&#xD;
      carriers and limit muscle wasting in sporadic ALS patients.&#xD;
