      Thyroid cancer is a common neck malignancy. Currently, total thyroidectomy or subtotal&#xD;
      thyroidectomy is the main method for the treatment of thyroid cancer patients. However, some&#xD;
      thyroid cancer may still have residual thyroid tissue after operation. Therefore, in the&#xD;
      differentiated thyroid In the treatment of cancer, iodine 131 treatment is mainly used&#xD;
      because iodine 131 can emit high-energy beta rays, destroying the residual tissue of thyroid&#xD;
      cancer and achieving good therapeutic goals. However, in the treatment of iodine-131, certain&#xD;
      salivary glands are inevitably damaged, and the patient will have dry mouth symptoms. After&#xD;
      the same treatment with iodine-131, some patients will experience gastrointestinal reactions&#xD;
      such as nausea and vomiting. The therapeutic efficacy of iodine-131 depends on the lesion's&#xD;
      uptake of iodine-131, which requires an increase in serum TSH levels. All patients in this&#xD;
      study had stopped taking thyroid hormone for 3-4 weeks before iodine 131 treatment, making&#xD;
      serum The TSH level is greater than 30 mU/L. At this time, the patient is in hypothyroidism.&#xD;
      People with hypothyroidism experience dry mouth, dry skin, constipation, pain, cold, poor&#xD;
      memory, depression, and weight gain. Many studies have pointed out that some cancer&#xD;
      treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, also have an impact on the microbial&#xD;
      flora. However, studies on the relationship between microecology, hypothyroidism and&#xD;
      iodine-131 treatment, probiotics in the prevention of hypothyroidism and iodine-131 treatment&#xD;
      The link between the effects of side effects remains unclear. Therefore, the team will&#xD;
      conduct a correlation study between microbes and hypothyroidism, iodine-131 treatment.&#xD;

      Thyroid cancer is a common neck malignancy and it mainly affects thyroid follicular cells or&#xD;
      parafollicular cells. Thyroid cancer in various tumors in the body, the ratio can reach 1.2%&#xD;
      to 2.3%. Thyroid cancer can be divided into differentiated thyroid cancer, squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and medullary carcinoma, among which the incidence of&#xD;
      differentiated thyroid carcinoma is more than 90%. At present, total thyroidectomy or&#xD;
      subtotal thyroidectomy is the main method for the treatment of thyroid cancer patients, but&#xD;
      some thyroid cancer may still have residual thyroid tissue after operation. Therefore, in the&#xD;
      treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer, iodine 131 is mainly used. Treatment, because&#xD;
      iodine 131 can emit high-energy beta rays, destroying the residual tissue of thyroid cancer,&#xD;
      to achieve good therapeutic purposes. However, due to the presence of sodium iodine symporter&#xD;
      in salivary glands and thyroid, it is inevitable that certain salivary glands will be damaged&#xD;
      in the treatment of iodine 131, and patients will have dry mouth symptoms. Some patients with&#xD;
      nausea 131 will also experience nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal reaction. Iodine 131&#xD;
      treatment is divided into two steps: 1 removal of residual thyroid tissue; 2 removal of&#xD;
      cancer lesions and metastases. The curative effect of 131I depends on the lesion's uptake of&#xD;
      iodine-131, which requires an increase in serum TSH levels. All patients in this study had&#xD;
      stopped taking thyroid hormone for 3 to 4 weeks before iodine-131 treatment. The TSH level is&#xD;
      greater than 30 mU/L. At this time, the patient is in hypothyroidism. People with&#xD;
      hypothyroidism experience dry mouth, dry skin, constipation, pain, cold, poor memory,&#xD;
      depression, and weight gain. Many studies have pointed out that some cancer treatments, such&#xD;
      as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, also have an impact on the microbial flora. However,&#xD;
      studies on the relationship between microecology, hypothyroidism and iodine-131 treatment,&#xD;
      probiotics in the prevention of hypothyroidism and iodine-131 treatment The link between the&#xD;
      effects of side effects remains unclear. Therefore, the team will conduct a correlation study&#xD;
      between microbes and hypothyroidism, iodine-131 treatment.&#xD;
