  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The circadian timing of Energy Intake (EI) has emerged as a key factor in the regulation of&#xD;
      body weight. Studies have suggested that eating later in the evening or at night when the&#xD;
      circadian system is promoting sleep adversely influences weight loss. In contrast,&#xD;
      restricting EI to a short window during waking hours and extending the length of the&#xD;
      overnight fast (i.e., time restricted feeding, TRF) may be a practical and useful weight loss&#xD;
      strategy. The overall objective of this proposal is to provide a foundation to inform the&#xD;
      design of a future large-scale trial to evaluate the efficacy of TRF in generating weight&#xD;
      loss. The investigators aims are to: 1) Assess processes critical for the success of a&#xD;
      large-scale trial comparing the efficacy of a reduced calorie diet with time restricted&#xD;
      feeding (RCD+TRF) versus standard RCD on weight loss; 2) Develop methodology to assess&#xD;
      compliance to the RCD+TRF versus standard RCD program and collect preliminary data on whether&#xD;
      the programs have differential effects on free-living behaviors (EI, appetite, physical&#xD;
      activity, and sedentary behavior); and 3) Measure metabolic responses to RCD+TRF versus&#xD;
      standard RCD to determine candidate mechanisms related to weight loss at 12wks and weight&#xD;
      maintenance at 6mo post-intervention. The investigators primary hypothesis is that weight&#xD;
      loss will be greater in the TRF group compared to the RCD group.&#xD;

      The circadian timing of energy intake (EI) has emerged as a key factor in the regulation of&#xD;
      body weight. Studies have suggested that eating meals later in the evening or during the&#xD;
      biological night when the circadian system is promoting sleep adversely influences the&#xD;
      success of weight loss therapy. In contrast, restricting EI to a short window during waking&#xD;
      hours and extending the length of the overnight fast (i.e., time restricted feeding, TRF) may&#xD;
      be a practical and useful strategy for promoting weight loss and weight maintenance. However,&#xD;
      potential benefits of adding TRF to a weight loss program have yet to be evaluated in a&#xD;
      well-controlled clinical study. The overall objective of this proposal is to provide a&#xD;
      foundation to inform the design of a future large-scale trial to evaluate the efficacy of TRF&#xD;
      in generating weight loss. The investigators overall hypothesis is that feasibility,&#xD;
      adherence, and acceptability of a weight loss intervention using TRF in the setting of a&#xD;
      reduced calorie diet (RCD) - RCD+TRF - will be similar to compliance with an intervention&#xD;
      using a reduced calorie diet alone (RCD), suggesting acceptability for a future large-scale&#xD;
      trial. In this 12-week pilot and feasibility study, 30 overweight and obese individuals will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to RCD+TRF (EI restricted to a 10-hour window starting 1 hour from habitual&#xD;
      waking time) or standard RCD (no restriction on feeding duration). Additional follow-up will&#xD;
      occur at 6 months to collect pilot data on weight maintenance. Measures include feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and adherence to the interventions, body weight, body composition (Dual-energy&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)), EI (smart phone application), physical activity (PA,&#xD;
      accelerometery), glucose variability (continuous glucose monitoring, CGM), sleep&#xD;
      (questionnaires and polysomnography), and nocturnal substrate metabolism (room calorimetry).&#xD;
      The specific aims (SA) are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1a. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week TRF intervention&#xD;
      compared to a standard dietary weight loss intervention (i.e. RCD). Feasibility of enrollment&#xD;
      and retention, and acceptability of the intervention will be assessed in adults with obesity&#xD;
      meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria proposed for the future large-scale trial. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess adherence to the weight loss programs, as measured objectively with&#xD;
      a novel smartphone application and verified with CGM data, and subjectively with the use of&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1b. To assess the efficacy of RCD+TRF compared to RCD alone in producing weight&#xD;
      loss at 12 weeks and reducing the risk of weight regain after 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
