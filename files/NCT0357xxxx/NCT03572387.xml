  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, cross-over, pilot study of reprogramming&#xD;
      therapy in patients with recurrent PCa based on rising PSA only. The primary objectives are&#xD;
      to compare the disease progression-free rate at the end of 12 weeks between 5-AZA+ATRA and no&#xD;
      therapy and to assess safety of the 5-AZA and ATRA combination. All study enrollees will&#xD;
      receive Lupron. After one month, they will be assigned in a 1:1 randomization to either the&#xD;
      '5-AZA+ATRA' group or the 'no therapy' group. Patients in the '5-AZA + ATRA' group will&#xD;
      receive treatment on a 28-day cycle, in the absence of prohibitive toxicities, for 3 cycles.&#xD;
      Patients will initially be observed for 3 cycles under either no therapy or combination&#xD;
      therapy, before crossing over to receive the opposite treatment for another 3 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of prohibitive toxicities. After the treatment period, all patients will be followed&#xD;
      for a total of 24 months from the start of the study or until the events leading to&#xD;
      discontinuation are observed.&#xD;
