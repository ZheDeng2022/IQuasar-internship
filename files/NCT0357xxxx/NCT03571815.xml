      Fluoride varnish application is universally accepted as a dental caries prevention method.&#xD;
      This study was aimed in assessment of clinical outcome and cost effectiveness in using that&#xD;
      method in Sri Lankan school children&#xD;

      Background Dental caries remains a significant public health problem with multiple factors&#xD;
      such as socioeconomic, dietary and microbiological playing a major role as risk factors in&#xD;
      initiation and continuation of the disease. It is considered the most common cause of&#xD;
      toothache and hospital admissions in young children. Dental caries in school children not&#xD;
      only causes pain, but also affects school attendance, parents' work hours, children's ability&#xD;
      to eat, play, rest and sleep. Therefore, dental caries when present significantly reduces the&#xD;
      health related quality of life of a child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving oral health has been considered as an objective in preventive dental care for&#xD;
      children. Therefore the measures taken to prevent dental caries should include bacterial bio&#xD;
      film control, dietary counseling, use of fluoride products such as toothpastes, mouth rinses,&#xD;
      varnishes, gels and foams, and Casein phosphopeptide (CPP) - amorphous calcium phosphate&#xD;
      (ACP) cream and gums and placing resin-based/glass ionomer pit and fissure sealants.)&#xD;
      Professional fluoride varnish application has become popular among all methods as variety of&#xD;
      studies has discussed its effect in reducing dental caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluoride varnish use in the U.S. has increased markedly since it was approved by the FDA in&#xD;
      1994. Fluoride varnish's effectiveness in caries prevention, ease of application, and safety&#xD;
      give it an advantage over other types of topical fluoride treatments (such as gels and&#xD;
      rinses) or other caries management methods. As a result, it is regarded as one of the&#xD;
      superior topical fluoride agents for young children. Fluoride varnish also prolongs the&#xD;
      contact time between fluoride and tooth surface to reduce caries. Its active ingredient is&#xD;
      usually 5% sodium fluoride, or 22,600 ppm fluoride. It also has recently gained much&#xD;
      attention in dentistry because the risk of dental fluorosis is found to be minimal.The&#xD;
      simplicity of its application makes it very suitable and practical for use in different&#xD;
      places and groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification Despite the availability of free health dental service in Sri Lanka, the&#xD;
      prevalence and severity of dental caries among six and seven years old school children stand&#xD;
      at a very high level according to the results of national oral health survey as 78% (83/84),&#xD;
      76.4% (94/95) and 65.5% (2002/2003) whereas the dmft is 4.4, 4.1 and 3.6.9 The simplicity of&#xD;
      fluoride varnish application makes it very suitable and practical for use in dental clinics&#xD;
      and outreach dental services, especially in young children and in other special needs groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to date to our knowledge, there was no other study carried out on cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      fluoride varnish application on teeth in Sri Lankan population. Therefore, the results of the&#xD;
      study will be beneficial in implementation and identification of advantages of fluoride&#xD;
      varnish application on teeth in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The main objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of six monthly&#xD;
      application of sodium fluoride varnish in prevention of dental caries in deciduous teeth,&#xD;
      permanent incisors and molars in children between six and seven years in Sri Lanka.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective is&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To find out the association between dental caries and the social status of the child (e.g.&#xD;
      mother's education, father's education, monthly family income etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study Type: Interventional This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. A&#xD;
      sample of school children (6-7 years) were randomized into varnish and control groups. All&#xD;
      the children received routine caries preventive measures of oral hygiene instructions,&#xD;
      dietary advice and professional cleaning. Children in fluoride varnish application group&#xD;
      received fluoride varnish professionally applied after prophylaxis every 6 months combined&#xD;
      with counseling on maintenance of oral hygiene and diet for a period of 2 years. Clinical&#xD;
      examinations of all children were performed at the beginning of the study and 1 year and 2&#xD;
      years later. All the caries at the dentinal level of both groups were stabilized with&#xD;
      temporary restorations at the beginning. For evaluation and comparison, all the collected&#xD;
      data was subjected to statistical analysis. Both varnish and control groups were subjected to&#xD;
      use of fluoride tooth paste of 1000ppm. The control group was subjected to counseling on&#xD;
      maintenance of oral hygiene and diet. During this period, the team visited each school four&#xD;
      times at six months interval for recruitment, dental examinations, and fluoride varnish&#xD;
      applications. Recruited children were randomly assigned to either a treatment (5% Sodium&#xD;
      Fluoride varnish) or a control group. Trained interviewers collected data on oral health&#xD;
      habits and sociodemographic characteristics of the children. Information on the child's diet&#xD;
      was collected through a 4-day food frequency diary. Caries examinations were conducted using&#xD;
      the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). The cost for the dental&#xD;
      team's school visits; cost involved in the treatment of dental caries throughout the course&#xD;
      of the study in both groups were evaluated and compared at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated as 160 each arm to detect 5% caries change with 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The effect of intervention was measured in terms of number of caries prevented. The&#xD;
      number of new caries in the usual care and intervention group was calculated after the&#xD;
      completion of the study. The demographic and socioeconomic data of the intervention and usual&#xD;
      care group were collected. The costs for intervention were estimated. The cost of treatment&#xD;
      for caries was estimated for intervention and non-Intervention groups. The costs for the&#xD;
      dental material, time for human resources and indirect costs were also calculated. The&#xD;
      results were presented as cost per caries prevented.&#xD;
