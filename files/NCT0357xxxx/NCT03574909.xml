      To investigate the effect of aspirin therapy initiated in the first trimester of pregnancy in&#xD;
      women with pregestational type I or type II diabetes on a composite clinical measure of&#xD;
      placental dysfunction (preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, birthweight below the&#xD;
      10th centile or perinatal mortality).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregestational diabetes represents a high-risk for evolution of preeclampsia (PET), with&#xD;
      rates of PET within this group at approximately 20%. The combination of diabetes and&#xD;
      preeclampsia places the pregnancy at heightened risk for hypoxia and stillbirth. Placental&#xD;
      dysfunction, due to disordered early placental development, is central to the disease&#xD;
      process. Early placental disease is followed months later by clinical manifestations of PET,&#xD;
      which reflect widespread endothelial dysfunction resulting in vasoconstriction, ischaemia and&#xD;
      increased vascular permeability. While not all adverse perinatal outcomes in diabetes are&#xD;
      attributed to placental dysfunction, any therapy that offers the potential to optimise&#xD;
      placentation in this group deserves close attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of aspirin used in randomized trials ranges from 50mg to 150mg. For some women,&#xD;
      particularly those with type 2 diabetes-related obesity, the commonly-used 60mg dose may be&#xD;
      too low to exert a full effect on thromboxane production. Recent work by one of the&#xD;
      collaborators for this submission indicates that 20% of patients in Ireland with established&#xD;
      coronary artery disease are inadequately 'protected' by aspirin, as evidenced by a&#xD;
      thromboxane B2 level of &gt;2.2 (indicating platelet aggregation of greater than 20%). Age,&#xD;
      hypertension and weight were identified as risk factors for an inadequate aspirin response.&#xD;
      Furthermore, randomized trials of this nature are potentially compromised by an inability to&#xD;
      confidently ensure patient compliance. The use of platelet function assays for a sub-group of&#xD;
      the participants in this proposed work offers the potential both to determine whether body&#xD;
      mass index and gestational age influence the ability to achieve an optimal biologic drug&#xD;
      effect and also to confirm patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-pregnancy nephropathy places a woman at particularly high risk for superimposed&#xD;
      preeclampsia and for fetal growth restriction. Microalbuminuria is known to be the forerunner&#xD;
      for diabetic nephropathy. Indeed, microalbuminuria is considered to be a marker of&#xD;
      generalized endothelial dysfunction. Whether sub-threshold degrees of microvascular disease,&#xD;
      as evidenced by microalbuminuria in early gestation, may confer a heightened risk of&#xD;
      preeclampsia, is unclear. Furthermore, whether aspirin therapy may benefit this subgroup with&#xD;
      microalbuminuria has not been studied. The largest study to date to investigate the&#xD;
      prevalence of microalbuminuria was conducted in Denmark, on a cohort of 1,200 pregnant women&#xD;
      with type I diabetes and documented a fourfold increase in risk of developing preeclampsia&#xD;
      among microalbuminuric women compared to normoalbuminuric diabetic women. A secondary&#xD;
      analysis of the MFMU aspirin study documented no increased risk of preeclampsia among women&#xD;
      with diabetes who had proteinuria &lt;499mg/24h in early pregnancy. A randomized trial of&#xD;
      aspirin therapy for the prevention of placental dysfunction in the setting of pregestational&#xD;
      diabetes may clarify whether aspirin therapy confers particular benefit among&#xD;
      microalbuminuric women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, although NICE has issued guidance on the prevention of hypertension in pregnancy&#xD;
      that includes a recommendation that women deemed to be at high risk for hypertension in&#xD;
      pregnancy be considered for low-dose aspirin after 12 weeks' gestational age, and&#xD;
      pregestational diabetes is listed as an example of 'high risk', this recommendation is not&#xD;
      supported by randomized-trial evidence demonstrating a benefit to aspirin therapy in women&#xD;
      with diabetes. Furthermore, this guidance is at variance with international guidelines on the&#xD;
      management of diabetes in pregnancy, none of which includes a recommendation that aspirin is&#xD;
      prescribed to this group. This reflects the dearth of studies that have been done on this&#xD;
      high-risk subgroup and the paucity of evidence gleaned from meta analyses in favour of&#xD;
      aspirin therapy in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine prescription of aspirin therapy for women with pre-existing diabetes does not&#xD;
      represent standard care in Ireland. The Mother and Baby CTN is well placed to answer the&#xD;
      clinical question here, centred on whether low-dose antiplatelet therapy in pregnancy may&#xD;
      carry the potential to optimise pregnancy outcome in this high-risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Preclinical data Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic&#xD;
      and antipyretic effects. Aspirin also inhibits cyclo-oxygenase isoforms 1 and 2 (COX1/COX2)&#xD;
      by irreversible acetylation, thus inhibiting the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and&#xD;
      thromboxanes from arachadonic acid. Aspirin's antiplatelet effects relate to its inhibition&#xD;
      of the production of platelet thromboxane A2, a prothrombotic vasoconstrictor. This&#xD;
      inhibitory effect is cumulative on repeat dosing, with complete suppression of platelet&#xD;
      thromboxane synthesis estimated to occur within a few days after daily dosing of 20 to 50mg&#xD;
      and more rapid suppression occurring with larger doses of 150-300mg. Much higher doses are&#xD;
      required for anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects (3.6-4g daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies showed that at very large dose levels, aspirin is teratogenic in rodents, with&#xD;
      cranial defects, neural tube defects, and cardiac defects among the most consistent findings.&#xD;
      Offspring of food-restricted rats that also received aspirin 250 mg/kg/day had more than&#xD;
      twice the incidence of malformations as those that received aspirin without food restriction.&#xD;
      The most notable malformations were rib and limb defects and umbilical hernias. At higher&#xD;
      dose levels, aspirin produced similar embryotoxicity in rhesus monkeys. The anomalies&#xD;
      observed included neural tube defects, skeletal malformations, and facial clefts. A 2003&#xD;
      review of the experimental animal literature noted diaphragmatic hernia, ventricular septal&#xD;
      defect, or midline defects associated with aspirin or other NSAIDs. This analysis noted that&#xD;
      the general quality of available reports was poor, but work in rats, with bolus&#xD;
      administration of the maximum tolerable dose of aspirin, as well as some reversible COX-1&#xD;
      inhibitors, consistently produced midline and cardiac defects. In rabbits, because of&#xD;
      maternal toxicity, aspirin cannot be administered at high enough dose levels to produce&#xD;
      developmental defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Clinical data Low-dose aspirin has been investigated for the prevention of preeclampsia&#xD;
      owing to its negative effect on thromboxane production. An imbalance between prostacyclin and&#xD;
      thromboxane plays a key role in the development of PET and is believed to result from shallow&#xD;
      placental invasion and ischaemia that occur shortly after implantation, very early in the&#xD;
      first trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on the role of aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk women have&#xD;
      yielded conflicting results. Initial studies suggested a protective effect. Subsequently,&#xD;
      some larger studies failed to identify a benefit to aspirin therapy although CLASP did&#xD;
      demonstrate a benefit in women affected by early-onset severe preeclampsia in a prior&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A metaanalysis, based on 27 trials on 31,678 women, concluded that aspirin is effective in&#xD;
      preventing preeclampsia, although the effect, a 10% reduction in PET incidence, was too&#xD;
      modest to warrant routine use in all women. The authors concluded that 'Despite a very large&#xD;
      dataset, the evidence base for particular groups of high risk women remains limited '.&#xD;
      Pre-existing diabetes was identified in 905 randomized women in this metaanalysis and the&#xD;
      authors calculated a relative risk for PET of 0.76 (CI 0.56 to 1.04), thus failing to&#xD;
      demonstrate a statistically significant effect. No information is provided on gestational age&#xD;
      at recruitment for this subanalysis, but very few studies were included that recruited women&#xD;
      &lt;16 weeks. Two thirds of the overall dataset were recruited after 20 weeks' gestational age.&#xD;
      However, if started early in pregnancy the treatment may be effective, although studies are&#xD;
      few and results are inconsistent, demonstrated a 17% reduction in the incidence of PET when&#xD;
      combining studies of different design. These authors stratified patients according to&#xD;
      risk-status for PET and concluded that aspirin may confer a 25% reduction in preeclampsia for&#xD;
      women deemed to be at high risk for developing the disease. Pre-pregnancy diabetes&#xD;
      constituted a high risk factor in this analysis. However, any benefit of aspirin therapy in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of PET in this group was not demonstrated by the Askie metaanalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies investigate the role of aspirin in preventing preeclampsia specifically in women&#xD;
      with diabetes. Only two randomized trials have recruited women with pregestational diabetes&#xD;
      without chronic hypertension or established renal disease. A large multicenter MFMU Network&#xD;
      study investigated the role of aspirin in prevention of PET for high-risk women, which&#xD;
      included a subgroup of 471 women with pregestational diabetes. Although this study did not&#xD;
      demonstrate a difference in the incidence of PET between aspirin and placebo groups, women&#xD;
      were recruited in the 2nd trimester (mean GA at recruitment 18 weeks +/- 4 weeks). It is&#xD;
      plausible that any effect of aspirin on placentation may only be observed if therapy is&#xD;
      initiated in the first trimester. Indeed, a recent metaanalysis investigating the role of&#xD;
      aspirin in prevention of perinatal death concludes that low-dose aspirin has potential to&#xD;
      reduce perinatal mortality when initiated prior to 16 weeks compared to later treatment.&#xD;
      Therefore, if aspirin is to be used for the prevention of placental dysfunction, it must be&#xD;
      initiated before the second active phase of trophoblast invasion, which takes place from 14&#xD;
      weeks' gestation onwards. No randomized trials investigating the role of aspirin in&#xD;
      prevention of preeclampsia have initiated treatment in the first trimester, the gestational&#xD;
      period at which it is most likely to exert an effect on placentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Rationale and risks/benefits The investigational medicinal product to be used in this&#xD;
      trial: Tromalyt® 150mg prolong release capsule for oral ingestion. The gelatine capsule&#xD;
      contains 150mg of anti-platelet agent acetylsalicylic acid, maize starch and Sucrose 20:80. .&#xD;
      Tromalyt® is trademark of Meda Pharma SL (Reg 59.210).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo hard gelatin capsules (Sanitatis®) will be used for patients randomized to the&#xD;
      placebo arm. These capsules are externally identical to Tromalyt capsule. The capsules&#xD;
      contain 198mg microcrystalline cellulose and 2mg of magnesium stearate (Sanitatis®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The antiplatelet properties of aspirin may confer a beneficial effect on placental&#xD;
      function, owing to the putative imbalance between thromboxane and prostacyclin that are&#xD;
      thought to result in shallow placental invasion in the first trimester. The ability of&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin to potentially optimize placental architecture early in&#xD;
      pregnancy may lead to a greater prospect of a low-resistance placental circulation being&#xD;
      established early in pregnancy in this cohort of women with microangiopathic disease relating&#xD;
      to pre-pregnancy diabetes. Therefore, the study hypothesis is that initiation of low-dose&#xD;
      aspirin in the first trimester of pregnancy may lead to a reduction in placental&#xD;
      dysfunction-mediated adverse perinatal outcome (namely, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth&#xD;
      restriction, preterm birth or perinatal death).&#xD;
