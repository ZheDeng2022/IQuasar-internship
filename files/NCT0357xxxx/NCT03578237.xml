    <textblock>
      The ultimate objective of the proposed line of research is to determine if cryoanalgesia is&#xD;
      an effective adjunctive treatment for pain in the period immediately following various&#xD;
      painful surgical procedures; and, if this analgesic modality decreases the risk of persistent&#xD;
      postoperative pain, or &quot;chronic&quot; pain. The objective of the proposed pilot study is to&#xD;
      optimize the protocol and collect data to power subsequent, definitive clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition&#xD;
      of cryoanalgesia decreases the incidence and severity of post-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a (primary): The severity of surgically-related pain will be significantly&#xD;
      decreased on postoperative day 2 with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients&#xD;
      receiving solely standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: The incidence of chronic pain will be significantly decreased one year&#xD;
      following surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving&#xD;
      solely standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1c: The severity of chronic pain will be significantly decreased one year&#xD;
      following surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving&#xD;
      solely standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition&#xD;
      of cryoanalgesia improves postoperative functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: Following primary unilateral knee and shoulder arthroplasty as well as rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair, joint range of motion will be significantly increased within the year following&#xD;
      surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving solely&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: Following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, inspiratory spirometry will be&#xD;
      improved within the month following surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared&#xD;
      with patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be individuals undergoing unilateral or bilateral mastectomy; upper or lower&#xD;
      limb amputation; primary, unilateral total knee or shoulder arthroplasty; primary, unilateral&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair; video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; and burn-related skin grafting of&#xD;
      the lateral thigh. Those who consent to participate in this study will have standard&#xD;
      preoperative peripheral nerve blocks administered and catheters inserted: paravertebral&#xD;
      blocks or a fascial plane block (e.g., erector spinae plane block) for mastectomy,&#xD;
      femoral/sciatic for lower limb amputation, and brachial plexus (or terminal nerves) for upper&#xD;
      limb amputation; femoral or adductor canal for total knee arthroplasty; interscalene for&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair; thoracic epidural for video-assisted&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery (VATS); and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve for skin grafting of the&#xD;
      lateral thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group assignment (randomization). Subjects with successfully-administered&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks (defined by sensory changes in the appropriate nerve distribution)&#xD;
      will be allocated to one of two possible treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cryoneurolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sham cryoneurolysis (placebo control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by surgery type (e.g., mastectomy, upper limb amputation,&#xD;
      and lower limb amputation). Computer-generated randomization lists will be used to create&#xD;
      sealed, opaque randomization envelopes with the treatment group assignment enclosed in each&#xD;
      envelope labeled with the randomization number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific nerves targeted will depend on the surgical site: intercostal nervesblocks (4&#xD;
      levels depending on the specific surgical approach) for mastectomy; femoral/sciatic for lower&#xD;
      limb amputation, and brachial plexus (or terminal nerves) for upper limb amputation;&#xD;
      infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve for knee arthroplasty; suprascapular nerve for&#xD;
      shoulder surgery; intercostal nerves for VATS procedures, and the lateral femoral cutaneous&#xD;
      nerve for skin grafting of the lateral thigh. The cryoneurolysis sites will be cleansed with&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol. Using the optimal ultrasound transducer for&#xD;
      the specific anatomic location and subject anatomy (linear vs curvilinear array), the target&#xD;
      nerves will be identified in a transverse cross-sectional (short axis) view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We initially used a hand-held cryoneurolysis machine (Iovera, Myoscience, Redwood City, CA;&#xD;
      prior to merger with Pacira Pharmaceuticals). For subjects randomized to sham, we inserted&#xD;
      the angiocatheters just through the skin and subsequently place the probe through the&#xD;
      angiocatheter, but not deeper than immediately subcutaneous (lidocaine 2% will be&#xD;
      administered, as needed, to anesthetize the angiocatheter track). We simulated a cryo&#xD;
      treatment but did not actually deliver gas to the probe. Therefore, there was no temperature&#xD;
      change. However, since all subjects had a paravertebral block in place, and intercostal&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis approach was via the subjects' back outside of their line of vision, subjects&#xD;
      were unable to sense much besides the pressure of the angiocatheter insertion and remained&#xD;
      masked to treatment group. For subjects randomized to receive cryoneurolysis, the same&#xD;
      procedure was used, only the angiocatheters inserted deeper towards the intercostal nerves,&#xD;
      the probes situated adjacent to the intercostal nerves, and active gas passed through the&#xD;
      probe resulting in cryoneurolysis of the target nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it became available, the hand-held device was replaced by a console cryoneurolysis&#xD;
      device. Cryoneurolysis probes are available for a console neurolysis device (PainBlocker,&#xD;
      Epimed, Farmers Branch, Texas) that either (1) pass nitrous oxide to the tip inducing&#xD;
      freezing temperatures; or, (2) vent the nitrous oxide at the base of the probe so that no gas&#xD;
      reaches the probe tip, resulting in no temperature change. Importantly, these probes are&#xD;
      indistinguishable in appearance, and therefore treating physicians, subjects, and all&#xD;
      clinical staff will be masked to treatment group assignment [only the treating&#xD;
      physician/investigator performing the cryoneurolysis with be unmasked]. An&#xD;
      angiocatheter/introducer may be inserted beneath the ultrasound transducer and directed until&#xD;
      the probe tip is immediately adjacent to the target nerve (lidocaine 2% will be administered,&#xD;
      as needed, to anesthetize the angiocatheter track). The angiocatheter needle will be removed,&#xD;
      leaving the angiocatheter through which the appropriate Epimed probe will be inserted until&#xD;
      it is adjacent to the target nerve. The cryoneurolysis device will be triggered using 3&#xD;
      cycles of 2-minute gas activation (active or sham) separated by 1-minute defrost periods. For&#xD;
      active probes, the nitrous oxide will be deployed to the tip where a drop in temperature to&#xD;
      -70Â°C will result in cryoneurolysis. For the sham probes, the nitrous oxide will be vented&#xD;
      prior to reaching the probe shaft, resulting in a lack of perineural temperature change. The&#xD;
      process will be repeated with the same treatment probe for any additional nerves (e.g., all&#xD;
      nerves will receive either active cryoneurolysis or sham/placebo, and not a mix of the two&#xD;
      possible treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. The limb amputation, total knee and shoulder arthroplasty, rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair, VATS, and skin grafting subjects will be included in pilot studies to help power a&#xD;
      future clinical trials, so the investigators will enroll a convenience sample and not have a&#xD;
      pre-determined primary endpoint or statistical plan. However, the end points of most interest&#xD;
      will be average pain score on postoperative day 2 for shoulder arthroplasty and skin grafting&#xD;
      subjects, range-of-motion at 6 weeks for the rotator cuff repairs, range-of-motion for knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty, and FEV1 for the VATS procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the subjects having mastectomy, the investigators will power this study for an acute pain&#xD;
      end point which will provide conclusive results for that end point; but, the data will also&#xD;
      be used to help power a subsequent large, multicenter clinical trial for a chronic&#xD;
      pain-related end point (which will require far more subjects than the investigators will&#xD;
      enroll for the current study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the mastectomy subjects, sample size calculations are centered around the hypothesis that&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis decreases the incidence and severity of post-mastectomy pain in the week&#xD;
      following surgery. To this end, the primary outcome is the average NRS (as administered as&#xD;
      part of the Brief Pain Inventory) queried on the afternoon of postoperative day 2. The&#xD;
      difference in the distribution of NRS between groups will be assessed using the Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test. The investigators approximate power using the two-sample t-test. Assuming a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 2.25 NRS points, and minimum clinically meaningful difference of 2 NRS points,&#xD;
      n=30 patients per group provide 86% power with two-sided alpha=5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The t-test approximation was confirmed by simulating integer valued NRS scores in the range 0&#xD;
      to 10. One group was simulated by rounding normally distributed data with mean 1.5 and&#xD;
      standard deviation 2.5 (resulting in median of 2 and interquartile range 0 to 3); and the&#xD;
      other with mean 3.5 and standard deviation 2.5 (resulting in median of 4 and interquartile&#xD;
      range 1 to 5). Note these resulting summary statistics are consistent with Ilfeld et al&#xD;
      (2014). When 10,000 trials were simulated under these assumptions, the Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      provided 89.5% power, and Type I error was maintained at 4.85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between groups in demographic variables and secondary endpoints will be assessed&#xD;
      with the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous or ordinal data, and Fisher's Exact test for&#xD;
      categorical data. Box-and-whisker plots will be used to visualize distributions by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      R version 3.4.4 (R-project.org) was used for sample size calculations and simulations; and&#xD;
      the most recent version of R will be used at the time of analysis.&#xD;

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory SF is designed to assess pain and its impact on physical and emotional functioning. It has established reliability and validity, with minimal inter-rater discordance, and is recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) consensus statement. The Brief Pain Inventory is comprised of three domains: (1) pain, with four questions involving &quot;worst&quot;, &quot;average&quot;, &quot;least&quot;, and &quot;current&quot; pain levels using a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale; (2) percentage of relief provided by pain treatments with one question (reported score is the percentage divided by 10 and then subtracted from 10: 0 = complete relief, 10 = no relief); and, (3) interference with 7 questions involving physical and emotional functioning using a 0-10 Likert scale (0 = none; 10 = complete).</description>
