      &lt;Research Hypothesis&gt; The dynamics of immune systems by Olaparib and its changes by&#xD;
      combination with immune-oncology agents will be uncovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Olaparib with Durvalumab with paclitaxel is tolerable and efficacious in&#xD;
      gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Objectives&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of Durvalumab in combination with olaparib and paclitaxel on DCR&#xD;
      (Disease control rate) in gastric cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Disease control rate (based on RECIST v1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: overall response rate (RECIST 1.1, ir response), progression-free survival,&#xD;

           1 year, EORTC QLQ-C30,&#xD;
