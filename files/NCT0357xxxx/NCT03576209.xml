      Medical condition or disease under investigation : Quantitative and qualitative aspects of&#xD;
      sleep, quality of life, functional ability and well-being in older adults (&gt;55years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of clinical trial : To study the prospective effects of a healthy lifestyle program&#xD;
      on quantitative and qualitative aspects of sleep, quality of life, functional ability and&#xD;
      well-being in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;

      This trial will consist of 3 visits : Pretest and posttest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pretest measurements (week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Accelerometry : a subsample of participants form intervention and control groups&#xD;
           (n=400) will be asked to wear an accelerometer (type GT3X) during 7 entire days prior to&#xD;
           baseline measurements. (Timing : July 2018-July 2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Baseline measurements : during the start up moment of the program all participants&#xD;
           from intervention and control groups will be asked : (Timing : July 2018-July 2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To fill out the self-reported questionnaire (survey) : the survey is composed of&#xD;
                existing validated scales : IPAQ, PSQI, SF-12, WEMWBS, HAQ-DI. (references of&#xD;
                validated scales are provided in the 'outcome measures' section)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To perform a walk test over 20 meters in order to determine the individual stride&#xD;
                length&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To perform a 6 minute walking test in order to self-report perceived exertion and&#xD;
                physical fitness (by Borg Scale) and to determine the individual entry level of the&#xD;
                program (entry levels vary between 1-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To wear the Pedometer (Omron® Walking Style one 2.0) on a daily basis and register&#xD;
                the amount of daily steps in their personal registration forms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posttest measurements (week 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Accelerometry : a subsample of participants form intervention and control groups&#xD;
                (n=400) will be asked to wear an accelerometer (type GT3X®) during 7 days prior to&#xD;
                posttest measurements. (Timing : September 2018 - December 2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Posttest measurements : at the end of the program all participants will be asked :&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Timing : September 2018 - December 2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To fill out the self-reported questionnaire (survey). In addition to the pretest&#xD;
           questionnaire, the validated scales ILI, Mael and Ashford (1992) and BREQ-3 will be&#xD;
           added and will be filled out only by participants of the intervention groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a 6 minute walking test in order to self-report perceived exertion and&#xD;
           physical fitness (by Borg Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To inform the investigators on the amount of daily steps (measured with pedometer type :&#xD;
           Omron® Walking Style one 2.0) during the 12 week program o Focus groups : a subsample&#xD;
           will be invited to take part in focus groups. During these focus groups, participants&#xD;
           will be encouraged to discuss the program and possible effects in small groups (5&#xD;
           participants per group). A semi-structured interview guide will be used to guide the&#xD;
           discussions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The described trial is a controlled before-and-after study. In this study, observations are made before and after the implementation of the intervention during 12 weeks, both in groups participating in the program (intervention group) and in groups who are not participating in the program (control groups).&#xD;
Observations are made in intervention and control groups. Participants of the intervention group are registered for participation in this health promotion program 'Lekker Actief' prior to the start of this trial. The control groups are composed of participants who are not participating in the program (not receiving any intervention) or the controls are waitlist controls.</intervention_model_description>
