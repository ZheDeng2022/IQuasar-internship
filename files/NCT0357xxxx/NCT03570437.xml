      The COPELIA trial is evaluating two new tablet medications in endometrial cancer for the&#xD;
      first time. It will include 129 women aged 16 years or older with advanced endometrial cancer&#xD;
      whose cancer has worsened after their initial chemotherapy treatment. Participants will be&#xD;
      allocated at random to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first group (Arm 1) will receive a standard (routine) treatment for patients with&#xD;
           endometrial cancer known as paclitaxel. This is a chemotherapy drug that is routinely&#xD;
           used to treat patients with different cancers including ovarian, breast, lung and&#xD;
           endometrial cancer. Paclitaxel works by stopping the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second group (Arm 2) will receive the standard paclitaxel treatment once a week in&#xD;
           addition to a new drug called cediranib. Cediranib is a tablet medication and works by&#xD;
           blocking new blood vessel formation. Cediranib has been tested in women with endometrial&#xD;
           cancer before but not alongside chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third group (Arm 3) will receive two new tablet medications, cediranib and olaparib.&#xD;
           Olaparib works by preventing cancer cells repairing DNA effectively. The use of olaparib&#xD;
           and cediranib together has been shown to be effective in a common type of ovarian cancer&#xD;
           but has not been evaluated as a treatment for endometrial cancer before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the COPELIA trial are to work out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether the two new treatments, cediranib-paclitaxel (Arm 2) and cediranib-olaparib (Arm&#xD;
           3) are more effective at controlling endometrial cancer than standard paclitaxel&#xD;
           chemotherapy (Arm 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the two new treatments cause more or fewer side-effects than standard&#xD;
           chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How each of these treatments impact on the daily life of women receiving the treatment&#xD;
           by asking trial participants to regularly complete quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether we can learn how these treatments work in women with endometrial cancer by&#xD;
           taking some additional blood tests for research. In women allocated to Arm 3 (and only&#xD;
           at participating hospitals), we will ask permission to take a small biopsy from an area&#xD;
           of cancer before they start treatment to see if we can predict which women may benefit&#xD;
           from olaparib.&#xD;

      COPELIA is a phase II, randomised, three-arm open-label trial which will recruit 129 women&#xD;
      aged 16 years or older, with advanced endometrial cancer who require further treatment after&#xD;
      their initial chemotherapy treatment. Potential participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated to one of the following three trial arms on a 1:1:1 basis&#xD;
      using centralised internet randomisation, stratified for prognostic factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: (Control Arm): Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
      for up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Cediranib 20 mg once daily for 28 days given with weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2&#xD;
      administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Participants with&#xD;
      stable disease, partial response or complete response at 6 months as determined by RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1 will be eligible to continue treatment with single agent cediranib once daily until&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Cediranib 20 mg once daily with olaparib 300 mg twice daily, continuously on a 28 day&#xD;
      cycle for up to 6 cycles. Participants with stable disease, partial response or complete&#xD;
      response at 6 months as determined by RECIST v1.1 will be eligible to continue treatment with&#xD;
      both olaparib and cediranib until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be balanced for histological subtype and the number of chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to the trial is expected to take 30 months. The total duration of the trial is&#xD;
      expected to be 55 months. Participants will receive initial trial treatments for up to six&#xD;
      months as long as they remain progression free. As mentioned above, participants in the&#xD;
      experimental arms may continue treatment with cediranib/olaparib beyond the six months, and&#xD;
      beyond the end of the trial, if they remain progression free. The trial will end once all&#xD;
      participants have met at least one of the criteria: completed 12 months' follow-up (including&#xD;
      treatment), withdrawn from follow-up, been lost to follow-up, experienced disease&#xD;
      progression, or died. Participants consent for their medical notes to be reviewed at later&#xD;
      dates if required to obtain data such as overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has a multi-arm-multi-stage (MAMS) design. The appropriate sample size was&#xD;
      calculated for this MAMS design, which allows one (or both) ineffective experimental arms to&#xD;
      be dropped following a planned interim analysis after 60 participants have been assessed at&#xD;
      three months.&#xD;
