  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well levorphanol works as a second line opioid in&#xD;
      reducing pain in patients with cancer that may have spread to other places in the body.&#xD;
      Levorphanol may work better in controlling cancer pain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of successful opioid rotation (OR) from morphine equivalent&#xD;
      daily dose (MEDD) to levorphanol at the primary end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the median opioid rotation ratio (ORR) in patients undergoing successful&#xD;
      opioid rotations from morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) to levorphanol in the Supportive&#xD;
      Care Center (SCC) or Pain Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of levorphanol on cancer pain (as measured by change in Edmonton&#xD;
      Symptom Assessment System's [ESAS] pain item from baseline) in cancer outpatients undergoing&#xD;
      opioid rotation to levorphanol at the primary end point of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the association between the opioid rotation ratio from MEDD to levorphanol&#xD;
      and baseline MEDD prior to opioid rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure levorphanol related side effects using the opioid side effect scale at day 10 +/-&#xD;
      1 of starting levorphanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine what percentage of patients rotated to levorphanol achieve their personalized&#xD;
      pain goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the predictors of successful opioid rotation from other opioids to levorphanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive levorphanol orally (PO) every 8 or 12 hours for 30 days. Patients may&#xD;
      receive opioid regimen including hydrocodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and&#xD;
      oxymorphone for breakthrough pain. Patients may continue levorphanol for an additional 6-8&#xD;
      months if it is determined by the Principal Investigator the patient can continue.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 10 or any day after 2 days of rotation to levorphanol</time_frame>
    <description>Bayesian methodology developed by Peter Thall will be used to monitor the study. This method decides whether levorphanol is promising relative to the standard medicine. Will estimate the proportion of successful opioid rotation along with a 95% confidence interval. Association between successful opioid rotation and demographic/clinical characteristics will be examined by Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Logistic regression model will be employed to assess the effect of demographic/clinical characteristics on the presence of successful opioid rotation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid rotation ratio (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Will be calculated by levorphanol mg (day 10 +/- 1) over MEDD (day 0). ORR will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied to examine the difference on ORR between/among patients' characteristics groups.</description>

    <measure>Change of Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to day 10 or any day after 2 days of rotation to levorphanol</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score change will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied to examine the difference on pain score change between/among patients' characteristics groups. Since ESAS pain score will be measured daily from day 0 to day 10 +/- 1 and on day 30 +/- 3, mixed model will be applied to examine the differential changes over time for ESAS pain score, adjusting for other covariates of interest. ORR and baseline MEDD will be presented by scatter plots. Correlation will be assessed between levorphanol dose on day 10 +/- 1, ORR and baseline MEDD suing Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient when appropriate. Linear regression models will be applied to estimate the linear association between levorphanoal dose on day 10 +/- 1, ORR and baseline MEDD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of levorphanol related side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Will be rated using the Opioid Side Effect Scale on xerostmia, nauseas, constipation, drowsiness and confusion daily from day 0 to day 10 +/-1 and on day 30 +/- 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personalized pain goal (PPG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>PPG will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. Mixed model will be applied to examine the differential changes over time for opioid side effect scale, adjusting for other covariates of interest. The goal is not achieved if the PPG is lower than the ESAS pain score. Frequency and proportion of achieved goal will be summarized.</description>
