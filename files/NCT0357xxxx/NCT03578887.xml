  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients and clinicians need better options to prevent the weight regain that almost&#xD;
      universally follows a weight loss intervention. In lay terms, a new, higher &quot;set point&quot; seems&#xD;
      to occur after people gain weight. Evidence from some research studies reinforces these&#xD;
      observations, showing that processes of energy homeostasis vigorously defend the higher level&#xD;
      of adiposity for years, if not permanently. Only bariatric surgery appears to &quot;re-set&quot; to a&#xD;
      lower level of adiposity. No clear mechanism has been elucidated to date that explains these&#xD;
      phenomena. The current proposal endeavors to address this crucial scientific gap by&#xD;
      translating preclinical data into human studies testing novel mechanistic hypotheses. Prior&#xD;
      studies in rodents show that a high-fat diet causes inflammation and a cellular response,&#xD;
      known as gliosis, within hypothalamic regions regulating energy balance and glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis. Evidence further suggests that gliosis might play a pathogenic role in obesity&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) because its development precedes weight gain and impaired&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis and its inhibition improves metabolic health. Importantly, gliosis is&#xD;
      detectable in mice and humans by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using MRI, the&#xD;
      investigators discovered the first evidence of gliosis in obese humans and went on to show&#xD;
      associations of gliosis with insulin resistance in humans, independent of the level of&#xD;
      adiposity. New findings suggest that people with T2D have more extensive gliosis than is seen&#xD;
      in nondiabetic obese subjects. Further findings reveal that gliosis improves, but is not&#xD;
      completely reversed, 8 mo. after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in T2D patients. It&#xD;
      remains unknown whether gliosis improves similarly when weight loss occurs by lifestyle&#xD;
      change or if the efficacy and durability of weight loss via bariatric surgery is partially&#xD;
      explained by its ability to reverse gliosis via an as yet unknown mechanism of action. We&#xD;
      therefore propose three studies in humans to discover 1) if hypothalamic gliosis is reversed&#xD;
      by a standard behavioral weight loss intervention, 2) if the extent of gliosis predicts&#xD;
      successful weight loss during, or weight regain after, behavioral weight loss, and 3) the&#xD;
      time course of improvement in gliosis after RYGB and the relation of its improvement to the&#xD;
      short- and long-term efficacy of RYGB. Future research would define dietary, environmental,&#xD;
      or other risk factors for the development of hypothalamic gliosis in humans. Achieving a&#xD;
      better understanding of the role of the brain in obesity and its treatment could open new&#xD;
      avenues for research, intervention, and prevention.&#xD;
