      Multi centre observational pilot study using novel, contrast free functional renal MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of functional renal MRI scans will be performed (These scans do not constitute part&#xD;
      patients routine clinical care). The results will initially be used to assess renal perfusion&#xD;
      and fibrosis in patients with AKI and CKD. Subsequent analysis will be used to identify&#xD;
      specific markers on the renal MRI scans that differentiate chronic kidney damage from acute&#xD;
      injury to the kidney. Finally results will be used to stratify patients with AKI and CKD into&#xD;
      low and high risk of subsequent deterioration in renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AKI Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 patients with AKI stage 2/3 with or without renal replacement therapy (RRT) will undergo&#xD;
      functional renal MRI imaging at day 0, day 90 and day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Study Scan (Day 0): A functional renal MRI scan will be performed during an admission&#xD;
      to hospital with an episode of AKI 2/3. Vital signs and SOFA score will be recorded on the&#xD;
      day of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function assessment will occur± 2 days either side of the scan with an Iohexol&#xD;
      clearance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Study Scan (Day 90): Repeat functional renal MRI imaging will be planned at 90 days&#xD;
      (±14 days) after the 1st study scan day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function assessment will occur±7 days either side of the scan with an Iohexol clearance&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third Study Scan (Day 365): The final functional renal MRI imaging will take place 12 months&#xD;
      (±30 days) after the 1st study scan day. Renal function assessment will occur±7 days either&#xD;
      side of the scan with an Iohexol clearance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 patients with CKD stage 3-4 eGFR 20-59ml/min/1.73m2 will undergo functional renal MRI&#xD;
      imaging at day 0, day 7 and day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Study Scan (Day 0): A functional renal MRI scan will be performed as an outpatient.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be recorded on the day of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function assessment will occur ±7 days either side of the scan with an Iohexol&#xD;
      clearance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Study Scan (Day 7): A functional renal MRI scan will be performed as an outpatient.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be recorded on the day of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third Study Scan (Day 365): The second functional renal MRI imaging will take place 12 months&#xD;
      (±30 days) after the 1st study scan day. Renal function assessment will occur±7 days either&#xD;
      side of the scan with an Iohexol clearance test.&#xD;
