  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the influence of the use of a Smartphone App, on changes in general&#xD;
      well-being and the occurrence of symptoms during a tumor therapy. With this documentation,&#xD;
      medical professionals should be enabled to judge the influence of symptoms on quality of life&#xD;
      during different time periods, between planed visits on site.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the number, characteristics and intensity of electronically reported&#xD;
      symptoms and therapy side effects depending on treatment and characteristics of patients with&#xD;
      cancer of breast, colon, prostate, lung and hematological malignancies during a three-month&#xD;
      period from the initiation of therapy. This period frequently represents the duration of a&#xD;
      therapeutic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of agreement κ between the ECOG/CTCAE ratings by physicians at the time of the&#xD;
      regular consultation, and the ratings derived from the daily PROs between consultations, will&#xD;
      be analyzed in order to determine the reliability and utility of self-reported electronic&#xD;
      symptom monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate different qualities of symptoms self-reported electronically&#xD;
      between consultations with respect to the course of treatment application, out-patient&#xD;
      settings, gender and age. In particular, outpatients with frequent (weekly) consultations&#xD;
      will be compared to patients with infrequent consultations (3-weekly or less frequent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also aim to identify the conditions and factors that might increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of an unplanned consultation or emergency hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the proposed study design and associated primary and secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      enable us to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patient groups with infrequent outpatient visits (3-weekly or less) as is determined&#xD;
           by the treatment schedule, the level of agreement κ between ePRO-derived ECOG/CTCAE&#xD;
           ratings and physician-derived ECOG/CTCAE ratings (at time of consultation) is at least&#xD;
           as high as in patient groups with weekly visits for symptoms having occurred within the&#xD;
           week before the visit. However, κ is expected lower in the group with infrequent visits&#xD;
           for symptoms having occurred more than 2 weeks prior to consultation, due to higher&#xD;
           fidelity of ePRO-derived ratings for long-ago symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Regular visits of outpatients undergoing infusion therapy (as determined by the&#xD;
           treatment schedule) do not significantly decrease the number of unplanned and emergency&#xD;
           consultations necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Young female and older male patient groups report significantly more severe and&#xD;
           worsening symptoms and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the most common types of cancer in the treatment center will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast, Colon, Prostate, Lung, Hematological malignancies&#xD;

    <description>The app is used to record the study parameters for a period of 90 days.&#xD;
The following measures are used for data collection:&#xD;
Interview during regular consultation with doctor&#xD;
Web-App for gathering doctors data&#xD;
&quot;Consilium&quot; Smartphone App for gathering patient data During the course of care, the patient enters in a regular manner symptoms and treatment side effects in the Smartphone app. A continuous capture of the symptoms and treatment side effect is provided. If no entry is made within 3 days the patient is prompted to enter the data via a push message.&#xD;
Well-being through a patient rating on a visual analog scale&#xD;
Registration of symptoms and treatment side effects is done through the app&#xD;
After completion of the study patients will be questioned according to:&#xD;
• Usability and usefulness of the Smartphone app</description>
