    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well gabapentin, methadone, and oxycodone with or without venlafaxine&#xD;
      hydrochloride work in managing pain in participants with stage II-IV squamous cell head and&#xD;
      neck cancer undergoing chemoradiation therapy. Gabapentin may reduce the need for these pain&#xD;
      medications if given at the start of radiation therapy. Methadone and oxycodone may help&#xD;
      relieve pain caused by cancer. Venlafaxine hydrochloride may prevent or improve pain caused&#xD;
      by cancer. It is now yet known whether giving gabapentin, methadone, and oxycodone with&#xD;
      venlafaxine hydrochloride will work better in managing pain in participants with squamous&#xD;
      cell head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pain-reduction effects of adding venlafaxine to a regimen of gabapentin and&#xD;
      methadone to control pain during and after chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) of the rate of toxicities&#xD;
      possibly or probably related to the pain control regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The effect of venlafaxine on other quality of life scores, patient nutrition, hydration&#xD;
      status, and opioid requirements during and after chemoradiotherapy (CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants receive gabapentin orally (PO) daily or 3 times a day (TID). Participants&#xD;
      may also receive methadone PO TID and oxycodone PO every 8 hours as needed. Treatment&#xD;
      continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants receive gabapentin, methadone, and oxycodone as in Arm I and venlafaxine&#xD;
      PO twice daily (BID) or venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release daily for up to 12 months&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months, and then every 6 months for up to 24 months.&#xD;

             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this&#xD;
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been treated with surgery or radiation for head and neck&#xD;
             cancer and/or are being treated for recurrent head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because&#xD;
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patients prescribed medications for chronic and/or long term pain and/or&#xD;
             neuropathy will be excluded, including patients under treatment of a pain specialist&#xD;
             or substance-abuse programs. Acute post-op medications are allowed if the patient has&#xD;
             discontinued them prior to initiating study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patients prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin and&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing female patients.&#xD;

          -  Any condition which in the investigator?s opinion deems the patient an unsuitable&#xD;
             candidate to receive study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on dialysis or with transplanted organs.&#xD;
