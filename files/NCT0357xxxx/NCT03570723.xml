      Objective: To investigate the effect of A glove-loaded Foley's catheter tamponade versus&#xD;
      stepwise uterine devascularization on blood loss during cesarean section (CS) in patients&#xD;
      with complete placenta previa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to placenta previa is usually from the placental bed at the&#xD;
      lower uterine segment and it occurs after the placenta separation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite placenta previa can be diagnosed by obstetrician before delivery nowadays, still a&#xD;
      leading etiology of maternal mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placenta previa is an obstetric condition that is closely linked with massive obstetric&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Is not only associated with increased chance of requiring massive transfusion (&gt;&#xD;
      3 units of packed red blood cells) but also a is now the leading etiology of the cesarean&#xD;
      hysterectomies. The incidence has progressively risen worldwide, mainly due to the increasing&#xD;
      rates of cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine tamponade can be considered as a line of treatment before performing surgical&#xD;
      procedures in PPH resulting from the placental site bleeding. It can save the life, avoid&#xD;
      laparotomy and preserve fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the use of intrauterine balloons has been developed and become effective for the&#xD;
      control of placental site bleeding not responding to medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2-way Foley's catheter has many advantages over the gauze packing; first, it allows&#xD;
      drainage of blood, so no occult bleeding could be accumulated inside the uterus as in uterine&#xD;
      gauze, second the removal of the Foley's catheter balloon is easy and not painful, third, the&#xD;
      removal of 2-way Foley's catheter could be gradual as a test of its effectiveness before&#xD;
      complete removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bakri intrauterine balloon tamponade is used for the treatment of obstetric hemorrhage during&#xD;
      cesarean delivery and many recent reports had described the successful use of balloon&#xD;
      tamponade to manage hemorrhage due to placenta previa- with an overall success rate of 80%.&#xD;
      However; its price is high so in our country, its availability and use are difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the aims of this study to assess the effect of A glove-loaded Foley's catheter tamponade&#xD;
      versus stepwise uterine devascularization on blood loss during cesarean section (CS) in&#xD;
      patients with complete placenta previa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be single blinded randomized controlled trial carried out in a tertiary&#xD;
      University Hospital between June 2018to June 2021. The included patients will be scheduled&#xD;
      for CS due to complete placenta previa. They will be randomly allocated to the group (I)&#xD;
      managed by stepwise uterine devascularization, group (II) managed by A glove-loaded Foley's&#xD;
      catheter tamponade. The primary outcome will be the amount of intraoperative estimated blood&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
