      Diagnostic error is an important but often under-recognized source of adverse events in the&#xD;
      hospital. This study is focused on the delayed or missed diagnosis of sepsis associated with&#xD;
      bacteremia among patients admitted to The Ottawa Hospital. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence and characterization of diagnostic error among patients admitted to&#xD;
      the at The Ottawa Hospital with sepsis associated with a positive blood culture. This study&#xD;
      will consist of a retrospective chart review of all patients who are greater than 18 years&#xD;
      with positive blood culture taken within 12 hours of presenting to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      of Ottawa Hospital Civic and General Campus between January 2016 to August 13th 2017. For&#xD;
      charts that are eligible for review for diagnostic errors, the qSOFA (Quick Sequential&#xD;
      [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment) score at time at admission will be used to&#xD;
      identify those patients who were at risk of serious harm because of a missed diagnosis of&#xD;
      sepsis and lack of treatment. Patient variables will be collected and compared between the&#xD;
      following three groups: (1) patients who received antibiotics within 24 hours, (2) patients&#xD;
      who did not receive antibiotics within 24 hours and who did not meet qSOFA criteria, and (3)&#xD;
      patients who did not receive antibiotic within 24 hours and who met qSOFA criteria. Variables&#xD;
      to be studied include age, gender, hospital campus, admitting service, day of admission&#xD;
      (weekend vs. weekday), time of admission (night vs. day), length of stay, disposition and&#xD;
      Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. For charts eligible for review for diagnostic error, the DEER&#xD;
      (Diagnostic Error Evaluation Research) Taxonomy tool will be used to classify cases per the&#xD;
      location and type of error that occurred in the diagnostic process.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic error is an important but often under-recognized source of adverse events in the&#xD;
      hospital. It ranks second as the cause of adverse events1. Studies have indicated that major&#xD;
      diagnostic discrepancies are found in 10-20% of autopsies, and that diagnostic error is the&#xD;
      leading cause of malpractice litigation for physicians in Canada2. Furthermore, diagnostic&#xD;
      error is of upmost importance in the eyes of our patients: Studies have cited that 55% of&#xD;
      patients indicated diagnostic error as their chief concern when seeing a physician.&#xD;
      Diagnostic error occurs most commonly in areas where there is a high degree of diagnostic&#xD;
      uncertainty such as General Internal Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic error can be classified as either systems or cognitive errors. Systems errors&#xD;
      involve technical failure, equipment problems and organization flaws. Systems errors have&#xD;
      been the focus of most quality improvement and patient safety research in the past few&#xD;
      decades. In contrast, cognitive sources of errors have received little attention despite&#xD;
      studies indicating that the cognitive factors play in a role in up to 74% of cases involving&#xD;
      diagnostic error. Cognitive error is defined by faulty knowledge, data gathering and&#xD;
      synthesis of information. They often occur as the result of biases and heuristics used by&#xD;
      physicians during the diagnostic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most diagnostic errors are associated with common conditions such as sepsis, pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, drug intoxication, myocardial infarction and appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on the delayed or missed diagnosis of sepsis associated with bacteremia&#xD;
      among patients admitted to The Ottawa Hospital. Sepsis is a common and important diagnosis.&#xD;
      Delayed treatment is associated with significant morbidity and mortality9. Therefore, timely&#xD;
      and correct diagnosis of sepsis is of upmost importance. No research thus far has been&#xD;
      conducted assess the incidence and etiology of diagnostic error among patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response&#xD;
      to infection and the definitive diagnosis of sepsis is often complex. Given this, this study&#xD;
      will include only patients with a missed diagnosis of sepsis who also have a positive blood&#xD;
      cultures given the need for an objective marker of the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and characterization of diagnostic error&#xD;
      among patients admitted to the at The Ottawa Hospital with sepsis associated with a positive&#xD;
      blood culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a retrospective chart review of all patients who are greater than&#xD;
      18 years with positive blood culture taken within 12 hours of presenting to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department of Ottawa Hospital Civic and General Campus between January 2016 to August 13th&#xD;
      2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a positive blood culture, charts will be reviewed only for those patients&#xD;
      who did not receive treatment for sepsis on presentation by an Emergency Room (ER) physician&#xD;
      or consultant within the first 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with positive blood cultures with an organism that is deemed a probable-contaminant&#xD;
      organism from the study will be excluded. For this study, probable contaminant organisms will&#xD;
      be defined as the following: (1) Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNs), (2) Bacillus&#xD;
      species other than Bacillus anthracis, (3) Propionbacterium acnes and (4) Corynebacterium&#xD;
      species. Coagulase negative staphylocci (CoNs) will be considered as a probable-contaminant&#xD;
      if detected in only one bottle or the minority of bottles within a blood culture set in the&#xD;
      absence of risk factors for invasive infection. Risk factors for CoNs invasive infection&#xD;
      include intravascular catheters, hemodialysis catheters, vascular grafts, recent prosthetic&#xD;
      joints or hardware, presence of pacemaker or prosthetic cardiac valves. Bacillus species,&#xD;
      Proprionbacterium acnes and Corynebacterium species, will be considered contaminants if they&#xD;
      are detected in one or the minority of bottles in a blood culture set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For charts that are eligible for review for diagnostic errors, the qSOFA (Quick Sequential&#xD;
      [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment) score at time at admission will be used to&#xD;
      identify those patients who were at risk of serious harm because of a missed diagnosis of&#xD;
      sepsis and lack of treatment. The qSOFA is a score included in the Sepsis-3 Recommendations&#xD;
      published in 2016, and is a validated bedside tool used for out-of-hospital, emergency&#xD;
      department or general hospital ward settings in which patients with a suspected infection can&#xD;
      be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis. The score&#xD;
      consists of the following criteria and a score of 2 or more criteria correlates to worse&#xD;
      outcomes: (1) respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, (2) altered mentation and (3) systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure of 100mm Hg or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient variables will be collected and compared between the following three groups: (1)&#xD;
      patients who received antibiotics within 24 hours, (2) patients who did not receive&#xD;
      antibiotics within 24 hours and who did not meet qSOFA criteria, and (3) patients who did not&#xD;
      receive antibiotic within 24 hours and who met qSOFA criteria. Variables to be studied&#xD;
      include age, gender, hospital campus, admitting service, day of admission (weekend vs.&#xD;
      weekday), bacteria species, time of admission (night vs. day), length of stay, disposition&#xD;
      and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For charts eligible for review for diagnostic error, the DEER (Diagnostic Error Evaluation&#xD;
      Research) Taxonomy tool will be used to classify cases per the location and type of error&#xD;
      that occurred in the diagnostic process.&#xD;
