    <textblock>
      Study participants will be shown an illustrated training video demonstrating and explaining&#xD;
      the RST. The video may be reviewed until the participant feels confident to perform&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rapid Sequence Tracheostomy (RST) consists of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Orientational palpation and vertical midline skin incision followed by separation of the&#xD;
           strap muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exposure of the trachea and cricoid followed by anterior luxation of the trachea with a&#xD;
           Backhaus towel clamp&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform a vertical puncture with a tip scissors between the Cricoid and 1st tracheal&#xD;
           ring followed by a vertical incision of no more than 2 rings in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An age adapted tracheal tube is inserted into the trachea and the lungs are ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teaching methodology: Prior to the hands-on training of eFONA, all participants shall watch a&#xD;
      2-minute training video of RST performed on rabbit cadaver following the steps outlined&#xD;
      above. During video demonstration, no additional explanation or support will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once study participants express confidence to perform the skill, participants shall attempt&#xD;
      to perform the RST 10 times. During the RST procedure no additional explanation or support&#xD;
      will be provided. Study participants will be allowed to watch the video again between&#xD;
      attempts, if needed. Each attempt will be video recorded and time recorded for rater&#xD;
      analysis, as outlined above. Successful tracheotomy is defined as ventilation of the lungs by&#xD;
      way of a standard self-inflating bag that is to be connected to the tracheal tube or visual&#xD;
      confirmation of the tube being placed at least 2 cm inside the trachea (dissection of the&#xD;
      rabbit cadaver performed by assistant).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current difficult airway algorithms end with the need for tracheal airway access to be&#xD;
      obtained via Front Of Neck Access (FONA) to achieve oxygenation. In children &lt; 8 years&#xD;
      existing recommendations and the literature do not offer guidance on how to perform emergent&#xD;
      FONA. Emergent tracheotomy is the potentially life-saving procedure - which needs to be&#xD;
      performed without delay. When emergent tracheotomy is attempted in children &lt; 8 years of age,&#xD;
      there is a substantial risk for complications. As a result, health care providers who do not&#xD;
      have routine at performing this procedure are often reluctant to perform FONA, Diameters,&#xD;
      vertical/horizontal dimensions, vocal cord distance, larynx position, and cricothyroid&#xD;
      membrane size of the rabbit airway suggest considerable similarities with infant airways,&#xD;
      making it a good model to learn this technique. The FONA rapid sequence technique (RST) is a&#xD;
      simple technique suitable for emergent pediatric tracheotomy. RST outlines 4 clearly defined&#xD;
      steps, that enable airway establishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Vertical midline skin incision and separate the strap muscles Step 2: Expose trachea&#xD;
      and cricoid through palpation, lift and immobilize trachea with a clamp Step 3: Vertical&#xD;
      trachea incision with the sharp tip scissors (2 cm) Step 4: Open the trachea and insert the&#xD;
      tube The steps are easy to perform, if sufficiently practiced. Anesthesiologist, pediatric&#xD;
      intensivists, surgeons, and emergency physicians who are most likely to need to perform FONA&#xD;
      in small children, shall learn to perform RST emergent pediatric tracheotomy in less than 60&#xD;
      seconds. The investigators seek to measure and study learning curves of participants for&#xD;
      establishing an artificial airway using the RST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: After having practiced the procedure 10 times, 80% of study participants will not&#xD;
      be able to successfully demonstrate FONA within 60 seconds. Alternative hypothesis: study&#xD;
      participants will be able to successfully demonstrate FONA within 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-center interventional trial. The only inclusion criterion is informed consent. A high&#xD;
      quality instructional video demonstrating the RST on a rabbit cadaver will teach the&#xD;
      participants. Performance time will be defined (from touching the skin until ventilation of&#xD;
      the trachea with a standard self-inflating bag connected to the tube). The investigators seek&#xD;
      to assess the learning curves of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. In order to obtain a lower limit of the 95% Confidence interval of 80% success&#xD;
      in FONA the investigators would need 40 study participants assuming 2 failures by the 10th&#xD;
      attempt. Statistical methods: Descriptive statistics for demographics. To establish the&#xD;
      learning curve the increase over the 3 attempts will be analyzed by repeated ANOVA or&#xD;
      Friedman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the reasons outlined above the investigators will provide a suitable and valid training&#xD;
      model for pediatric airway practitioners to practice the invasive front of neck access&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
