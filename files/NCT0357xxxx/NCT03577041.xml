  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness after 50 years in&#xD;
      industrialized countries, compromising daily activities and reducing quality of life. And&#xD;
      whose treatment is one of the first health expenditures. Since September 2015, Bevacizumab,&#xD;
      which does not have marketing authorization in AMD, has been given a temporary recommendation&#xD;
      for use. Studies in other countries have shown that bevacizumab is cost-effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of AMD compared to other anti-VEGF therapies used.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of Bevacizumab in the treatment of&#xD;
      neovascular AMD as well that non-inferiority compared to Ranibizumab in terms of clinical&#xD;
      efficacy at 1 year on visual acuity measured by the ETDRS scale of patients with neovascular&#xD;
      AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding general tolerance, a recent meta-analysis including a large number of patients did&#xD;
      not find any difference in systemic serious adverse reactions, neither any new special signal&#xD;
      of tolerance with Bevacizumab. Concerning eye tolerance, there is no evidence of difference&#xD;
      significant. Medico-economic analyzes carried out in other countries, as the United States or&#xD;
      Brazil, have shown that Bevacizumab is cost-effective compared to Ranibizumab in AMD&#xD;
      Neovascular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost-utility analysis of the different methods of care patients with AMD will rely on the&#xD;
      construction of a self-centered model built from: data available in natural history&#xD;
      literature AMD in the absence of treatment; results of the network meta-analysis comparing&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerance of different strategies to assess; available data on adherence&#xD;
      and persistence of treatments; pharmacovigilance data on the occurrence of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis benefits from two related studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Micro-costing, multicenter study of the preparation of intravitreal injections of&#xD;
           Bevacizumab hospital pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multicenter, prospective evaluation, cross-section, quality of life data and patient&#xD;
           cost depending on the level of visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the recommendations, at the beginning of the treatment, after the diagnosis of&#xD;
      neovascular naive AMD, the patient will benefit from a fixed regimen of treatment by&#xD;
      intravitreous injection of Bevacizumab or Ranibizumab or Aflibercept renewed every month for&#xD;
      3 months. Before each Intra-vitreous injection, the patient will be reviewed in consultation&#xD;
      to collect the occurrence of events adverse reactions related to the injection of one of the&#xD;
      three products. After 3 months, the monthly intra-vitreous injections will be left to the&#xD;
      appreciation of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up of the patients, during a specialized consultation will be spread out over 6&#xD;
      months according to the rhythm of a consultation by months and then 12 months.&#xD;
