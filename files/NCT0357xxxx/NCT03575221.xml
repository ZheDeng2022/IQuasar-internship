      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder. OI affects many aspects of a&#xD;
      person s health and growth. It can cause frequent fractures, short stature, and bowing of the&#xD;
      long bones. There is no known cure for OI so researchers want to learn more about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain a natural history of the course of OI. To find changes in genes that affect the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People from birth to age 12 years with certain types of OI&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who previously had childhood data collected in certain other protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the clinic for a few days each visit. Visits will be about every&#xD;
      3-4 months to age 5 then about every 6-12 months. Visits may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing measured while wearing a clear plastic hood for about 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of motion, strength, and motor skills&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays of the left hand, chest, legs, and spine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone density scan. Participants will lie on a flat table while a very small dose of x-rays is&#xD;
      passed through the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Participants will lie on an exam&#xD;
      table that moves in and out a scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing tests using stickers on the chest, a light probe on a finger or foot, and a face&#xD;
      mask&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small section of skin removed from the arm or thigh&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some tests, participants may take medicine to make them sleepy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give separate consent for photos to be taken.&#xD;

      We propose a longitudinal study of the natural history of the collagen-related disorder&#xD;
      osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The overall objectives are to 1) obtain a comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of the natural history and progression of the multiple secondary features of&#xD;
      osteogenesis imperfecta, and 2) further the understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation&#xD;
      using biosamples collected from well-characterized affected individuals. This study is in&#xD;
      part a continuation of protocol 97-CH-0064, and thus will continue to follow individuals with&#xD;
      OI enrolled in that protocol, to incorporate biosamples obtained, and to analyze data&#xD;
      collected under that protocol. The major objectives of protocol 97-CH-0064 have focused on&#xD;
      radiographic features including scoliosis and rib deformities, bone density, intensive&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and physical therapy. New developments in genetics, bone tissue biology, and&#xD;
      pathophysiology of OI in the past decade, along with the increasing life expectancy of&#xD;
      affected individuals, highlight a need for the continuation and expansion of this natural&#xD;
      history study to understand the full disease phenotypic spectrum, and to generate biobanks of&#xD;
      tissue samples from well-characterized study participants for continued research. This&#xD;
      proposed protocol will: 1) Continue to follow study participants, use biosamples, and analyze&#xD;
      data gathered under protocol 97-CH-0064 (which will be closed upon the start of this&#xD;
      protocol). 2) Expand to include currently known collagen-related OI types V-XVIII and&#xD;
      potential additional types, in addition to collagen OI types III and IV included under&#xD;
      protocol 97-CH-0064. 3) Extend the age criteria for study participants to include individuals&#xD;
      of all ages, with age at study enrollment targeted to those from birth to 12 years. This will&#xD;
      allow us to follow clinical outcomes of young adults who had aged out of prior NICHD OI&#xD;
      research programs. The major objectives will focus on: 1) Continued comprehensive assessment&#xD;
      of radiographic, bone density, audiology, dental, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic&#xD;
      manifestations, and physical rehabilitation. The immediate goals from this will encompass a)&#xD;
      identifying underlying contributing factors and comorbidities for scoliosis, b) gaining&#xD;
      insight into occurrence and progression of cardiac valvular abnormalities, and c) elucidating&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of primary lung parenchymal defects in individuals with OI. 2) Additional&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of endocrine and renal systems. The novel evaluation of metabolism&#xD;
      in individuals with OI will allow understanding of obesity prevalence in this population. 3)&#xD;
      Continued genetic and molecular biology investigations of OI.&#xD;
