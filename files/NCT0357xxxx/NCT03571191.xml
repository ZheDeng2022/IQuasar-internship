      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of denosumab on bone turnover&#xD;
      in individuals with fibrous dysplasia (FD). Secondary objectives are to determine the effect&#xD;
      of denosumab on bone pain, FD lesion intensity as revealed in 18F-sodium fluoride PET/CT bone&#xD;
      scan, and to determine the effect of denosumab discontinuation on bone turnover re-bound&#xD;
      after discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 14 adult subjects with FD may be enrolled to ensure complete study data on 9 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single center, open label pilot study of once-monthly dosing of denosumab.&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated for 6 months, after which they will be followed by an 8-month&#xD;
      observation period. A final visit will occur 21 months after denosumab discontinuation.&#xD;
      Dosing will be adopted from studies in adults on treatment for giant cell tumors, with&#xD;
      denosumab administered at 120 mg per dose every 4 weeks, with loading doses on days 7 and 14&#xD;
      of month 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the effects of denosumab on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Markers of bone turnover:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-crosslaps C-telopeptides (bone resorption marker)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procollagen-1-propeptide (bone formation marker)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the effects of denosumab on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bone histomorphometric indices:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mineralized perimeter&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bone formation rate&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Osteoid perimeter&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mineral apposition rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surrogate markers of a direct therapeutic effect of denosumab on FD lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Semi-quantitative changes in RANKL, Ki67 (marker of cell proliferation), p16 (marker of&#xD;
           cell senescence), and/or apoptosis index before and after treatment, as assessed by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
           Changes in sentinel lesion intensity, measured quantitatively by uptake on 18Fsodium&#xD;
           fluoride PET/CT bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FD-related bone pain assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) , a validated&#xD;
           self-reporting tool for assessment of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effect of denosumab initiation and discontinuation on&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG), and RANKL/OPG levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effect of denosumab discontinuation, as measured by the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biochemical markers of bone metabolism: beta-crosslaps C-telopeptides, procollagen-1&#xD;
           propeptide, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, NTX-telopeptides&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effect measured by change in other outcome measures, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone density assessed by DXA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation evaluation&#xD;

               5. Self-reported FD-related bone pain at a site of FD, present for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Ability to understand and provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Willing and able to complete the protocol scheduled assessments and medication&#xD;
                  regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Willing and able to take calcium and vitamin D supplements provided by NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Women of child bearing potential must use two forms of acceptable contraception:&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injected hormones or vaginal ring);&#xD;

                  obtained at screening that two forms of acceptable contraception are being used,&#xD;
                  and that the subjects agree to use the two forms of contraception from the time&#xD;
                  they sign study consent through five months after study completion (19 months&#xD;
                  total).&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Serum calcium or albumin-adjusted serum calcium within the normal range for the&#xD;
                  NIH laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Administration of denosumab within the previous year&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of bisphosphonates within one year prior to first day of the denosumab&#xD;
             administration (Day 0). Examples of bisphosphonates include: pamidronate (Aredia),&#xD;
             Alendronate (Fosamax) and Zoledronate (Zomata).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior history, or current evidence, of osteomyelitis/osteonecrosis of the jaw or&#xD;
             presence of an active dental or jaw condition which requires oral surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Planned invasive dental procedure for the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of non-healed dental or oral surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Orthopedic procedure performed less than 12-weeks prior to first day of the denosumab&#xD;
             administration (Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Acute fracture less than 12-weeks prior to first day of the denosumab administration&#xD;
             (Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. 25-hydroxyvitamin D level than 30 ng/mL (patients will be eligible for re-screening&#xD;
             after a repletion period lasting no longer than 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Untreated or inadequately treated hypophosphatemia, defined as serum phosphate levels&#xD;
             below the NIH normal range (patients will be eligible for re-screening after&#xD;
             initiation or optimization of phosphorus replacement no longer than 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed&#xD;
             while on study and through 5 months after completion of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Use of another investigational agent within the last 3 months prior to the first day&#xD;
             of the denosumab administration (Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during the&#xD;
             study (e.g. polyketide antibiotics, mammalian derived products, calcium, or vitamin D)&#xD;
