  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine clinical impact of EUS-guided microbiopsy procedure&#xD;
      and supplementary molecular analyses compared to standard diagnostic workup of pancreatic&#xD;
      cysts. The hypothesis is that a combination of previously mentioned modalities may change the&#xD;
      management of some pancreatic cystic lesions, increase the diagnostic accuracy and optimize&#xD;
      the discrimination between high- and low-risk pancreatic cysts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for 6% of all cancer related deaths in&#xD;
      Denmark, and the 5-year survival rate is only 8%. PDAC develops from precursor lesions with&#xD;
      pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (panIN) being the most common, and cystic lesions as a&#xD;
      second precursor. Unlike panINs, which are too small for detection with current imaging&#xD;
      modalities, cystic lesions of the pancreas are increasingly diagnosed due to the extended use&#xD;
      of cross-sectional imaging. Pancreatic cystic lesions may be observed in up to 13.5% of all&#xD;
      MRI scans and 3% of all CT scans. There are several types of pancreatic cysts and each of&#xD;
      them requires individual management, ranging from no treatment over watchful waiting to&#xD;
      surgical resection according to their malignant potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard diagnostic workup includes cross-sectional imaging of the cystic lesions and, in&#xD;
      selected cases endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with aspiration of cyst fluid by fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration (FNA), followed by cyst fluid cytology and tumor marker analysis. The diagnostic&#xD;
      algorithm is based on International consensus guidelines established in 2006, and revised in&#xD;
      2012 and 2017, integrating clinical features with EUS-findings. The level of evidence in&#xD;
      these guidelines is unfortunately low. A recent meta-analysis concluded that EUS and cyst&#xD;
      fluid cytology have low sensitivity (54-63%), whereas the specificity is acceptable (88-92%)&#xD;
      for detection of mucinous cysts. Low sensitivity is mainly due to absence of sufficient&#xD;
      cellular material in the cyst fluid for definite diagnosis. Tumor marker analysis of cyst&#xD;
      fluid, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 72.4, CA 125, CA 19.9, and CA 15.3, have&#xD;
      been studied extensively with CEA being the most accurate marker. A cut-off value of 192&#xD;
      ng/mL for CEA distinguishes mucinous from non-mucinous cysts with a good, albeit imperfect,&#xD;
      accuracy of 80%. However, the value will not differentiate between IPMN and MCN, and more&#xD;
      importantly, it does not correlate with the level of dysplasia or malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-guided through-the-needle microbiopsy using the Moray™ forceps is a novel adjunctive. The&#xD;
      device can be inserted through a EUS-FNA needle and used to obtain microbiopsies from&#xD;
      different tissues in relationship to the gastrointestinal system. This instrument can be used&#xD;
      in combination with EUS-FNA to subsequently obtain microbiopsies from the pancreatic cyst&#xD;
      wall. Microbiopsies seem to represent a break-through in pre-operative classification of&#xD;
      pancreatic cysts, as they provide histological material for examination of tissue&#xD;
      architecture not readily accessible in FNA material. However, very little experience has been&#xD;
      obtained hitherto. Even though this technique is currently described only in a few studies,&#xD;
      it seems feasible and theoretically offers a higher quality of material than what can be&#xD;
      obtained by EUS-FNA alone.&#xD;

    <description>All patients are evaluated at a multidisciplinary conference prior to microbiopsy procedure. A primary decision is made based on available imaging modalities and/or cyst fluid analysis (operation, follow-up or discontinuation from follow-up). Subsequently, each patient is once again evaluated at a multidisciplinary conference, and a possible change in management is noted. Clinical impact is defined as a proportion of the patients where a change in clinical management is observed.</description>
