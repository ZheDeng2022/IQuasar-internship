  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability, and PK of single and&#xD;
      multiple doses of Epanova in healthy male and female Chinese subjects and to allow comparison&#xD;
      of these parameters with the Western population studied to date.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, single- and multiple-dose, PK study in Chinese healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Approximately 14 subjects will receive a single oral dose of Epanova 4 g followed&#xD;
      by a 72-hour washout period, and then receive Epanova 4 g orally once daily for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days. Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within&#xD;
      4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of investigational product (IP). Subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical pharmacology unit approximately 48 hours prior to the first dosing&#xD;
      (Day -2) and will stay at the unit until at least 72 hours (Day 20) after their last dose of&#xD;
      IP (Day 17). Blood samples will be collected for PK analyses. Subjects will be monitored&#xD;
      closely for adverse events throughout the study.&#xD;
