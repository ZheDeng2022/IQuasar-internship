    <textblock>
      Sport-related concussions occur during different types of sport and are still an&#xD;
      underestimated brain injury. Especially children are affected due to their lacking movement&#xD;
      control and thereby at higher risk of situations leading to concussion. However, research&#xD;
      about the rehabilitation of balance and coordination in children after sustaining a&#xD;
      concussion is lacking. Therefore, the return-to-sport question cannot be answered reliable&#xD;
      due to the missing understanding of the underlying mechanisms disturbing coordination, yet.&#xD;
      Analyzing postural control, meaning the ability of the body controlled by the brain to&#xD;
      maintain balanced, is suggested to be a valid method to investigate movement coordination. A&#xD;
      newer method to analyze postural control using reflective marker data will be used to study&#xD;
      the rehabilitation process. The findings may help to improve concussion treatment and give&#xD;
      implication to the return-to-sport decision. The investigators expect to see an altered&#xD;
      postural control after sustaining a concussion visible in the movement amplitude especially&#xD;
      short after the injury. Moreover, the researchers assume coordination patterns which are not&#xD;
      visible to be altered for an extended time period of up to 30 days as well. Participants will&#xD;
      be children aged 10 to 16 years and the aim is to recruit 30 children and adolescents who&#xD;
      suffer from a concussion. The data of the concussed participants will be compared with data&#xD;
      of healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussions are a major public health issue and occur in many sports, for example soccer,&#xD;
      basketball, or American football. After sustaining a concussion balance is affected, often&#xD;
      for weeks. The return to motor and cognitive tasks frequently occurs as soon as postural&#xD;
      stability seems to be recovered. However, a research group around Cavanaugh investigated&#xD;
      already in 2005 changes in postural control by analyzing the center of pressure (COP)&#xD;
      movement. Their findings suggest that postural sway variables cannot be interpreted as the&#xD;
      only parameters regarding rehabilitation of balance, since postural control was still&#xD;
      noticeably affected after the sway variables returned to normal levels. They further state&#xD;
      that athletes who return too early back to sport may still be &quot;unstable&quot; and are likely to be&#xD;
      more vulnerable than healthy athletes. Furthermore, a compromised balance may lead to falls,&#xD;
      shown in several studies, which found correlations between weak balance and the risk to fall.&#xD;
      An additional and very important issue is that a second impact to the head of a not fully&#xD;
      recovered person can lead to cumulative effects. Athletes with successive concussions showed&#xD;
      significantly lower performance on memory testing than athletes with only one concussion.&#xD;
      Consequently, it was stated that the &quot;return-to-field&quot; or &quot;return-to-play&quot; decision, for&#xD;
      instance in rugby, is one of the most important questions to solve in the context of&#xD;
      concussions in sport. However, despite the increasing research interest in the last decade, a&#xD;
      very recent systematic review conducted by McLeod still highlights the difficulty of&#xD;
      diagnosing a concussion and of making &quot;return-to-action&quot; decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to their natural need of movement, adolescents and children are specifically at risk of&#xD;
      returning to unsafe situations too early after sustaining a mild traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (mTBI). Hugentobler pointed out that age seems to have a major effect on common used&#xD;
      post-concussion postural control assessments. During the ten competition days of the Youth&#xD;
      Olympic Games in Innsbruck 2012, 7,2% of the injured athletes suffered from a concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research into concussions often focuses on collegiate athletes; fewer studies are available&#xD;
      on adolescents or children. Researchers observed that high school children had prolonged&#xD;
      memory dysfunction after a concussion compared to college athletes. The reason for this age&#xD;
      difference might be the different brain structure of children compared to that of adults,&#xD;
      observed as overall increase in white matter volumes, regional differences in gray matter&#xD;
      mass and also volumetric differences. These age-related distinctions may lead to different&#xD;
      alterations in postural control in children, maybe due to not fully automated motion&#xD;
      patterns, as shown for hand movements during writing. Hence, while the study of Cavanaugh&#xD;
      already identified limitations in the standard assessment of concussion-related deficits in&#xD;
      the postural control of healthy adults, it remains an open research question, how the&#xD;
      postural control system of children or adolescents is affected and how the recovery process&#xD;
      develops in this age group in which postural control is less automated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, assessments of the COP, as in the study of Cavanaugh, give an indication that&#xD;
      changes exist, but cannot answer the question which control mechanisms are affected. For&#xD;
      example, concussions might disturb the coordination of postural control movements, e.g.&#xD;
      change the coordination between hip and ankle strategies, or concussions could affect how the&#xD;
      postural movements are controlled, e.g. slower reaction mechanisms or slower or false&#xD;
      anticipatory mechanisms. None of these mechanisms can be distinguished in an assessment of&#xD;
      the COP excursion. However, a whole body analysis of kinematic marker data using a principal&#xD;
      component analysis (PCA) is a more detailed approach and proved to be reliable for&#xD;
      investigating the mechanisms that play a role in human postural control. The method offers&#xD;
      two new variables: 1) Analysis of movement components and their relative contribution to the&#xD;
      overall motions needed to maintain balance (PC-eigenvalues) and 2) principal accelerations&#xD;
      (PA), which can be interpreted as motor control actions and therefore facilitate a deeper&#xD;
      insight into what aspects of the postural control processes may be compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has two main goals. The first goal is to better understand the effects of&#xD;
      concussions on balance and postural control in adolescents and children. Since postural&#xD;
      control in this age group is less automatized and due to several other structural differences&#xD;
      in the nervous system between adolescents and adults the investigators expect that&#xD;
      concussions might affect their postural control differently. It is also expected that the&#xD;
      recovery process may differ. The second goal is to develop a better understanding of how&#xD;
      concussions compromise postural control by applying a novel analysis technique based on&#xD;
      principal component analysis (PCA). The researchers expect that the PCA will be better able&#xD;
      to distinguish effects on the coordination of segment movements from effects on how movement&#xD;
      components are controlled. Specific hypotheses that will be tested are, for example,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Existing results suggest that the recovery of postural control after a concussion occurs&#xD;
           in different phases. Early in the recovery process (three days to two weeks), postural&#xD;
           sway amplitudes, which are substantially increased after a mTBI, return to normal&#xD;
           levels. Yet, how postural movements are controlled (measured through the entropy of the&#xD;
           COP movements) shows abnormalities for several weeks. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
           the early phase will be characterized by disturbed coordination of movement components&#xD;
           (quantifiable through PC-eigenvalues). The late recovery phases will be characterized by&#xD;
           timing issues in the control of individual movement components, which can be detected in&#xD;
           the movement component accelerations (PAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The PAs might also reveal underlying mechanisms of how concussion affects the neural&#xD;
           postural control system. For example, if concussion prolongs sensorimotor delays, then&#xD;
           one might expect less frequent activity in the PAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The opposite behavior might also occur: if the concussion disturbs automatized control&#xD;
           processes in the brain, then one might hypothesize that more cognitive processes need to&#xD;
           be involved in postural control after a concussion. This might manifest in more frequent&#xD;
           changes of the PAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the data in the prescribed way a principal component analysis (PCA) will be&#xD;
      conducted with the kinematic data of the participants, representing the whole kinematics of&#xD;
      the movement. The idea is to divide the movement into many one-dimensional principal&#xD;
      components (PCs) with different impact on the whole movement. This method is valid for&#xD;
      comparing the measured variance of center of pressure (COP) data of participants standing in&#xD;
      quiet stance, with the variance given by calculated PCs as resulting from a PCA. The COP&#xD;
      variance was explained by the resultant principal movements (PMs) better than other methods&#xD;
      did so far. The first 15 PMs explained 99.3% of the postural variance during the quiet stand.&#xD;
      Every PC described a little part of the whole movement and had its own impact on the overall&#xD;
      motion called &quot;eigenvalue&quot;. The method is therefore proven to be able to detect even small&#xD;
      adjustment movements performed by the motor control system during quite stance. This ability&#xD;
      of revealing very small adjustments enables it to be used as method investigating movement&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyzes will be performed using the Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) with the alpha-level set to 0.05. A Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to ensure&#xD;
      the normal distribution of the data. The comparison of the PC-values as main output will be a&#xD;
      within-subject analysis and therefore the used method is going to be a one-way repeated&#xD;
      analysis of variance (rANOVA) to evaluate the data provided in case of normal distribution.&#xD;
      If normal distribution is not given, a Friedmann test will be utilized. Applied Post-Hoc&#xD;
      tests will be conducted using a Sidak correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample rate is dependent on the amount of children and adolescents suffering from a&#xD;
      concussion in the planned time period of the study that moreover want to participate.&#xD;
      However, based on the study of Cavanaugh a power-analysis was conducted for the planned&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA, within factors. The α-error was set to 0.05 and the expected power&#xD;
      was set with 0.95. The effect size of 0.73 was calculated using the mean of difference in the&#xD;
      concussed group (0.19) and the standard deviation of difference (SD = 0.26) calculated by&#xD;
      multiplying the given standard error of the mean (SEM = 0.05) with the root out of the sample&#xD;
      size (n = 27). Power analysis stated a required total sample size of 27 participants based on&#xD;
      the calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case a dropout-quote of 50% would occur and would slim the sample size to only 15&#xD;
      participants, this would yield to a power of 75% based on our calculations.&#xD;
