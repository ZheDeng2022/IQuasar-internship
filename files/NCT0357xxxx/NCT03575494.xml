  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases and dental caries are initiated by a pathogenic biofilm, in a&#xD;
      susceptible host, affecting the tooth periodontium and hard tissues. Its possible association&#xD;
      with many biologic systems has been studied. In this study, researchers investigated&#xD;
      association between oral health and female infertility, and what is the biological rationale&#xD;
      for such relationship.&#xD;

      Power analysis was performed with the G-Power software package to determine sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To cover possible data loss, 10% of a group were added to each group. Medical and dental&#xD;
      examination will be performed both of control and experimental groups. In dental examination&#xD;
      decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index will be used according to World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO 1997) criteria. All teeth were visually using the International Caries&#xD;
      Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the correlation between oral health status and female infertility linear&#xD;
      regression test and for comparison of both the groups (case and control), two sample t test&#xD;
      and chi square test were used.&#xD;

    <description>All teeth were visually using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II). The chosen sites were recorded as:&#xD;
0 = sound;&#xD;
= first visible sign of noncavitated lesion seen only when the tooth is dried;&#xD;
= visible noncavitated lesion seen when wet and dry;&#xD;
= microcavitation in enamel;&#xD;
= noncavitated lesion extending into dentine seen as an undermining shadow;&#xD;
= small cavitated lesion with visible dentine: less than 50% of surface;&#xD;
= large cavitated lesions with visible dentine in more than 50% of the surface. A single calibrated examiner measured probing depth-PD, clinical attachment level- CAL, plaque (Pl), and gingival indices (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP) at four sites per tooth using a manual periodontal probe (PCPUNC, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).</description>
