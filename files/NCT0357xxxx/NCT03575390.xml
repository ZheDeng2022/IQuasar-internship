    <textblock>
      Pomegranate has anti-oxidative capacity. It might reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
      Drug-induced hepatitis, and might prevent deterioration of cardiovascular diseases and cancer&#xD;
      progression. But, the beneficial effects of pomegranate on hearing impairment was still&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of pomegranate on hearing impairment&#xD;
      by a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial design. The investigators'll&#xD;
      include 120 elderly patients without hemodialysis in our hospital, and divided them into 2&#xD;
      groups. Control group will receive placebo treatment; pomegranate group will receive oral&#xD;
      pomegranate (500 mg, twice per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive above treatment for 9 months, and receive examinations of pure tone&#xD;
      audiometry, word discrimination score before start of this clinical trial, 4.5th month after&#xD;
      the start day, the end of treatment (the 9th month), and 4.5 months after the treatment (the&#xD;
      13.5th month).&#xD;

      progression. But, the beneficial effects of pomegranate on hearing impairment was still&#xD;

&#xD;
      This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of pomegranate on hearing impairment&#xD;
      by a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial design. The investigators'll&#xD;
      include 120 elderly patients without hemodialysis in our hospital, and divided them into 2&#xD;
      groups. Control group will receive placebo treatment; pomegranate group will receive oral&#xD;
      pomegranate (500 mg, twice per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive above treatment for 9 months, and receive examinations of pure tone&#xD;
      audiometry, word discrimination score before start of this clinical trial, 4.5th month after&#xD;
      the start day, the end of treatment (the 9th month), and 4.5 months after the treatment (the&#xD;
      13.5th month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;background&gt; Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) was very common in the elderly. Hearing&#xD;
      deteriorated not only due to problems with the peripheral hearing organs, but also because of&#xD;
      degeneration of the central auditory system. In general, peripheral hearing deteriorates more&#xD;
      quickly and severely in male subjects than in female subjects, more severely at higher than&#xD;
      low frequencies, and more quickly in the central auditory system than the peripheral hearing&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of ARHI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, including obesity, obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea, systemic diseases, noise, chemical exposure, alcohol, tobacco, ototoxic&#xD;
      medication, diet, hormonal factors, menopause and socioeconomic status, may also contribute&#xD;
      to hearing degeneration. Contributing mechanisms of this disease may include&#xD;
      hypoxia/ischemia, reactive species formation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic/necrotic death&#xD;
      of inner ear hair cells/spiral ganglion cells, neural cells, or vascular endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor serum vitamin B-12 and folate status levels may be associated with age-related auditory&#xD;
      dysfunction in older females. Elevated plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentration may be&#xD;
      associated with hearing loss in older adults. Hearing function of noise-exposed workers was&#xD;
      negatively correlated with plasma vitamin E levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, one report reported that plasma levels of homocysteine, erythrocyte folate and vitamin&#xD;
      B6 were not associated with severity of age-related hearing impairment. Serum magnesium and&#xD;
      vitamin C levels were also not correlated with severity of noise-induced hearing loss. The&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 6 gene was upregulated while the thioredoxin reductase 1 gene&#xD;
      was downregulated in mice with ARHI. Furthermore, our study group had found that plasma&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species levels were correlated with severity of ARHI in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention and/or treatment of ARHI It is reasonable to expect that improved endogenous&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity and/or exogenous antioxidant supplementation may suppress oxidative&#xD;
      damage to the cells of auditory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some agents were reported to be beneficial for the senescent auditory system. For example,&#xD;
      (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate(EGCG) could protect cultured spiral ganglion cells from&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidizing damage. Vitamin C or E could prevent ARHI in animals.&#xD;
      Coffee and caffeine were good for auditory neuropathy of mice. Also, antioxidants were also&#xD;
      beneficial for the senescent auditory cortex of aged rats. B12 supplementation could prevent&#xD;
      hearing loss in B12-deficient individuals. Folic acid supplementation slowed hearing decline&#xD;
      slightly in low frequencies, but not in high frequencies in a population without folic acid&#xD;
      fortification of food. Higher folate intake had lower risk of developing hearing loss in&#xD;
      older males. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) could slow down the deterioration of presbycusis. There was&#xD;
      an inverse association between higher intakes of long-chain n23 poly-unsaturated fatty acid&#xD;
      (PUFAs) and regular weekly consumption of fish and age-related hearing loss. Patients who&#xD;
      achieved the highest plasma concentrations of vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium had&#xD;
      significantly less loss of high-tone hearing. And, salicylate use and moderate alcohol intake&#xD;
      were possible protective factors for ARHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, report claimed that life style with higher intake of vitamin C, E, beta carotene, or B12&#xD;
      did not reduce the risk of hearing loss in adult males. Vitamin E or atorvastatin cannot slow&#xD;
      down the deterioration of presbycusis. Low-dose difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) could not&#xD;
      protect hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction of pomegranate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomegranate is a subtropical and tropical fruit of great importance from a health point of&#xD;
      view. It has antioxidant activity and antimutagenic potential. Oxidative and histologic&#xD;
      evaluation showed that pomegranate juice might have a preventive effect in&#xD;
      paracetamol-induced acute liver damage. Six weeks supplementation of pomegranate juice could&#xD;
      have favorable effects on oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pomegranate&#xD;
      extract alleviates disease activity and some blood biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress in rheumatoid arthritis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomegranate seed extract exhibited therapeutic potential for memory and muscular coordination&#xD;
      in rats, which was most likely related at least in some part to its antioxidative and free&#xD;
      radical scavenging actions. Long-term dietary supplementation with pomegranates from Oman&#xD;
      attenuates cognitive and behavioral deficits in a transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. Consumption of pomegranates improves synaptic function in a transgenic mice model of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Pomegranate's neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease are&#xD;
      mediated by urolithin, its ellagitannin-gut microbial derived metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not suggest&#xD;
      any effect of pomegranate consumption on lipid profile and on plasma c-reactive protein&#xD;
      levels. One report also concluded that the quality of previous studies about the use of&#xD;
      dietary pomegranate preparations in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      was poor. Even in the best studies, indications of benefit did not reach the conventional&#xD;
      levels of statistical significance. And, future studies need to prove the clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methanol extract of pericarp of pomegranate (PME) had anti-proliferative effect on human&#xD;
      breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), endometrial (HEC-1A), cervical (SiHa, HeLa), and ovarian (SKOV3)&#xD;
      cancer cell lines, and normal breast fibroblasts (MCF-10A). Also, PME could modulate&#xD;
      osteoblastic cell differentiation. Pomegranate evokes antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and&#xD;
      antimetastatic effects, induces apoptosis through the modulation of Bcl-2 proteins,&#xD;
      upregulates p21 and p27, and downregulates cyclin-cdk network. Furthermore, pomegranate&#xD;
      blocks the activation of inflammatory pathways including, but not limited to, the nuclear&#xD;
      factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells(NF-κB) pathway. However, another&#xD;
      meta-analysis showed that the evidence of clinical effectiveness for cancer treatment in&#xD;
      humans was poor because the quality of the studies was poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomegranate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new candidate for ARHI treatment? Pomegranate has antioxidative capacity and could prevent&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, oxidative damage was one of the underlying mechanisms for&#xD;
      ARHI. So, it is reasonable to expect that pomegranate might have a beneficial effect for&#xD;
      ARHI.&#xD;
