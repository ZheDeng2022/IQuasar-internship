    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Weight Watchers (WW) Freestyle ®&#xD;
      (Flex® in UK) weight loss program compared to a control group following a do-it-yourself&#xD;
      (DIY) approach for 12 months. Participants in the United States, Canada and the UK (n=360&#xD;
      total) will be randomly assigned to either participate in the commercially available WW&#xD;
      program in their local community or to follow their own approach for weight loss. This study&#xD;
      will examine the impact of the WW program on weight, fitness levels, quality of life, health&#xD;
      behaviors and other health outcomes in overweight and obese adults after 3 and 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the Weight Watchers program&#xD;
      delivered in the community to a DIY approach for weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited through a variety of advertisement methods. Those&#xD;
      individuals responding to these advertisements will undergo web-based preliminary screening.&#xD;
      Initially eligible individuals will be contacted by phone to receive more detailed&#xD;
      information and to complete screening. Eligible and interested participants will be consented&#xD;
      in person and complete screening assessments that will be used to confirm eligibility (height&#xD;
      and weight to determine body mass index, resting blood pressure. For participants deemed to&#xD;
      be eligible and randomized to participate in this study, these measures will also be used as&#xD;
      their baseline data from analysis. Additional data collection will be collected at the&#xD;
      baseline assessment visit, with assessments repeated at 3 months and after the intervention&#xD;
      at 12 months. Assessments will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height and Weight Resting Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Aerobic Stamina Flexibility Waist&#xD;
      Circumference Dietary Intake Additional Questionnaires to assess demographics, sleep, food&#xD;
      cravings, hunger and satiety, weight control strategies, affect, lifestyle activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group assignment will be revealed to study participants in a separate visit/contact after all&#xD;
      assessment procedures and randomization is completed. The contact will last 15-30 minutes and&#xD;
      participants will be provided with the resources they need to either follow the Weight&#xD;
      Watchers program or the DIY approach. The Weight Watchers orientation and DIY intervention&#xD;
      will not be provided by staff who collect measurements in order to preserve the blinding of&#xD;
      the measurement staff. Following randomization reveal, the staff will maintain communication&#xD;
      in order to promote retention (e.g., birthday card or small token reinforcer such as a water&#xD;
      bottle sent to all participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEIGHT WATCHERS FREESTYLE (FLEX) GROUP Intervention Description Participants randomized to&#xD;
      the WW Freestyle (Flex) treatment arm will be referred to their local WW Meetings + Online&#xD;
      Plus program delivered at a WW center / meeting convenient to them. At the randomization&#xD;
      visit, they will be provided with a code to sign up for the Weight Watchers program free of&#xD;
      charge for 12 months. They will also be guided to download the smartphone app on their phone,&#xD;
      provided with a list of local meetings, and instructed on how to start the Weight Watchers&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following describes the weight loss intervention that is delivered solely through the&#xD;
      commercially available Weight Watchers program. Measurement staff will not be involved in&#xD;
      delivery of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program type. Participants will receive a program with a structured, lifestyle modification,&#xD;
      weight-loss methodology. Specifically, it will include 1) a food plan, which is based on&#xD;
      balanced diet and healthy eating, 2) an activity plan, designed to promote progressive&#xD;
      physical activity increase, 3) group support, and 4) cognitive behavior modification.&#xD;
      Participants will determine their weight goal and will be encouraged to utilize all&#xD;
      intervention components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the Scale. This holistic and personalized program focuses on multiple ways for&#xD;
      participants to define success, on and off the scale. The three main components are: eating&#xD;
      healthier, moving more, and finding and shifting the study subject's mindset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly meetings. Weight Watchers members attend weekly Weight Watchers meetings conducted in&#xD;
      local commercial centers with a group Leader and a receptionist and last30-60 minutes.&#xD;
      Meetings consist of lesson delivery of a new behavioral skill or knowledge transfer on&#xD;
      healthy habits, check-ins with each participant on their previous week, and group discussions&#xD;
      on the week's topic and application of that skill in their own lives. The discussions are led&#xD;
      by Weight Watchers Leaders, who are Lifetime members who have successfully achieved and&#xD;
      maintained a healthier body weight through the Weight Watchers program, and have successfully&#xD;
      completed a leader skills training course and ongoing professional development and quality&#xD;
      assurance (QA). WW participants have their weight measured at each meeting on regularly&#xD;
      calibrated scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention materials. Weight Watchers participants receive: 1) access to an app for food&#xD;
      and activity tracking, 2) welcome packet a menu of 'how to's' and inspiration to get started&#xD;
      and weekly lesson plans delivered by the Meeting Leader, 3) weekly take-home skill builder&#xD;
      worksheet and content within the app 4) Weight Watchers emails, and 4) access to social&#xD;
      support from other WW Leaders and WW members through on online support portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary goals. Dietary plan. The core of the Food Program is the SmartPoints® weight loss&#xD;
      system, which is a method of self-monitoring dietary intake. The SmartPoints system assigns&#xD;
      each food and beverage a SmartPoints value per portion based on its nutrition, factoring in&#xD;
      four components: calories, sugar, saturated fat, and protein. SmartPoints encourages a&#xD;
      healthier pattern of eating. This is translated into the following general guidelines:&#xD;
      certain foods have a SmartPoints value of zero which includes plant-based proteins, skinless&#xD;
      chicken and turkey breast, eggs, non-fat yogurt, skinless fish, fruits and most vegetables&#xD;
      (excludes starchy vegetables). For foods outside these categories, foods higher in lean&#xD;
      protein, such as lean cuts of steak and ham, have lower SmartPoints values while foods higher&#xD;
      in unhealthy saturated fats and sugar have higher Smartpoints values&#xD;
&#xD;
      SmartPoints Budget. Based on the Mifflin St-Jeor formula, which factors in age, gender,&#xD;
      height, and weight, participants will get a personalized SmartPoints Budget. The SmartPoints&#xD;
      budget consists of: a daily SmartPoints Target plus an extra bank of Weekly SmartPoints for&#xD;
      flexibility. Participants are free to spend their SmartPoints however they wish and can 'roll&#xD;
      over' up to 4 SmartPoints a day into their weeklies for added flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Log. Participants will be encouraged to track their SmartPoints each day on the Weight&#xD;
      Watchers app provided to them. Within the app there is a wealth of tools to help find and&#xD;
      track food choices, which includes; a barcode scanner to quickly identify foods, recipes,&#xD;
      restaurant and grocery store items in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity goals. FitPoints. A large part of the Beyond the Scale program is the FitPoints™&#xD;
      system, which is a method of self-monitoring physical activity. The FitPoints system assigns&#xD;
      each activity a FitPoint value based on its duration (minutes) and intensity based on a&#xD;
      participant's current weight and FitPoints emphasizes activity because it feels good, not&#xD;
      solely as a means to swap for SmartPoints. FitPoints highlights that all activity counts and&#xD;
      adds up; &quot;some is better than none&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FitPoints goal. Participants will receive a personalized daily FitPoints goal based on their&#xD;
      fitness level and goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity Log Participants will be encouraged to track their FitPoints each day on the Weight&#xD;
      Watchers app provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindset Approach. The Weight Watchers Freestyle/Flex program promotes the adoption of skills&#xD;
      and techniques to adopt a positive mindset in order to support lifestyle change and healthy&#xD;
      weight Participants receive digital and print materials around these topics and in person&#xD;
      support in the meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DO-IT-YOURSELF GROUP Participants randomized to the DIY group will be provided with a brief&#xD;
      resource guide with basic information about a variety of healthful behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      approaches (meal plans, apps for calorie tracking, meal replacements, dietary approaches to&#xD;
      reduce calories healthfully such as following a low fat or low carb diet, and moderate&#xD;
      physical activity) and encouraged to choose an approach that would fit with their lifestyle.&#xD;
      The resource guide will provide model &quot;profiles&quot; of lifestyle factors that may help the&#xD;
      individual choose the approach that would work best for them. These approaches are consistent&#xD;
      with information that can be found in the general press and will be limited to approaches&#xD;
      that are deemed healthful by weight loss and medical professionals. Participants will be&#xD;
      informed that many people follow a DIY approach and can be successful (will reference the&#xD;
      National Weight Control Registry which is a research-based registry of individuals who have&#xD;
      lost weight and kept is off successfully; 50% of whom followed a DIY approach). For&#xD;
      retention, participants in the DIY group will be notified that if they choose to utilize WW&#xD;
      after the completion of the study, they will be offered free vouchers for 12 months of the WW&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

    <description>The most commonly used tool to measure subjective sensations of hunger is the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A VAS measures sensations that range across a continuum of values and cannot be easily directly measured. Operationally, the VAS is a horizontal line measuring exactly 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors (i.e., 0=Not at all hungry, 100=Extremely hungry) at each end. At baseline, Months 3 and 12, participants will be asked to complete a three item VAS by placing a mark on the line at the point they feel represents their response to the question.</description>

    <description>The Weight Control Strategies Scale (WCSS) is a 30 item self-report measure of behavioral strategies commonly used for weight loss and will be used to measure strategies used for the purpose of weight loss. The measure was validated in a pooled sample from three behavioral weight loss trials. Principal components analysis with varimax rotation revealed a four-component solution for the WCSS, representing the following subscales: Dietary Choices, Self-monitoring Strategies, Physical Activity, and Psychological Coping (α from 0.79 to 0.89). Longitudinal analyses showed that WCSS subscale scores increased during treatment (P &lt; 0.01). In adjusted models, changes in WCSS total and subscale scores were associated with post-treatment weight loss (P &lt; 0.01). Higher scores indicate more strategies endorsed and subscales indicate the type of strategies. Higher scores are predictive of weight loss.</description>

    <description>The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) is a brief 12-item scale, with six items corresponding to positive emotions and six items corresponding to negative emotions. Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 represents &quot;very rarely or never&quot; and 5 represents &quot;very often or always.&quot; The positive and negative scales are scored separately and each range from 6 to 30. The two scores can also be combined as a scale of balanced affect. Internal consistency is good (ranging from 0.81-0.89 across the scales), as is temporal stability (0.62-0.68). The SPANE has performed well in terms of convergent validity with other measures of emotion, well-being, happiness, and life satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II) is a 52-item instrument measuring self-initiated health behaviors that serve to maintain or enhance the level of self-actualization and wellness. Included are six subscales: physical activity, spiritual growth, health responsibility, interpersonal relations, nutrition, and stress management. It is self-administered and uses a 4-point response format yielding a score for overall health-promoting lifestyle which is obtained by calculating a mean of the individual's responses to all 52 items. Similarly, subscale scores are obtained by calculating a mean of the responses to subscale items. Scores range from 1 = Never to 4 = Routinely, with a higher score corresponding to a more health-promoting lifestyle.</description>

    <description>The Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II) is a 52-item instrument measuring self-initiated health behaviors that serve to maintain or enhance the level of self-actualization and wellness. Included are six subscales: physical activity, spiritual growth, health responsibility, interpersonal relations, nutrition, and stress management. It is self-administered and uses a 4-point response format yielding a score for overall health-promoting lifestyle which is obtained by calculating a mean of the individual's responses to all 52 items. Similarly, subscale scores are obtained by calculating a mean of the responses to subscale items. Scores range from 1 = Never to 4 = Routinely, with a higher score corresponding to a more health-promoting lifestyle.</description>

    <measure>Change in Flexibility from Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Flexibility will be measured using the sit-and-reach test. They will then sit on the floor with their legs outstretched in front of them and their feet perpendicular to the floor (toes facing up). A vertical 12 inch box will be placed against their feet. The participant will then be asked to place one hand over the other such that the tops of their two middle fingers will be on top of one another. Finally, the participant will be instructed to slowly stretch forward and slide their fingers along the box as far as possible. A ruler is used to measure the distance they can reach. This test is repeated three times and the best score will be retained.</description>
