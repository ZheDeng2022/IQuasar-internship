  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and catecholamines for shock,&#xD;
      nearly 40% to 50% die, and functional recovery is often delayed in survivors. International&#xD;
      guidelines include early nutritional support (≤48 h after admission), 20-25 kcal/kg/d at the&#xD;
      acute phase, and 1.2-2 g/kg/d protein. These targets are rarely achieved in patients with&#xD;
      severe critically illnesses. Recent data challenge the wisdom of providing standard amounts&#xD;
      of calories and protein during the acute phase of critical illness. Studies designed to&#xD;
      improve enteral nutrition delivery showed no outcome benefits with higher intakes. Instead,&#xD;
      adding parenteral nutrition to increase intakes was associated with longer ICU stays and more&#xD;
      infectious complications. Studies suggest that higher protein intakes during the acute phase&#xD;
      may be associated with greater muscle wasting and ICU-acquired weakness. The optimal calorie&#xD;
      and protein supply at the acute phase of severe critical illness remains unknown. NUTRIREA-3&#xD;
      will be the first trial to compare standard calorie and protein feeding complying with&#xD;
      guidelines to low-calorie low-protein feeding potentially associated with improved muscle&#xD;
      preservation, translating into shorter mechanical ventilation and ICU-stay durations, lower&#xD;
      ICU-acquired infection rates, lower mortality, and better long-term clinical outcomes. This&#xD;
      multicentre, randomized, controlled, open trial will compare, in patients receiving&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and treated with vasoactive agent for shock two strategies for&#xD;
      initiating nutritional support at the acute phase of ICU management (D0-D7): early&#xD;
      calorie/protein restriction (6 kcal/kg/d/0.2-0.4 g/kg/d, Low group) or standard&#xD;
      calorie/protein targets (25 kcal/kg/d/1.0-1.3 g/kg/d, Standard group). Patients in both&#xD;
      groups will receive enteral or parenteral nutrition appropriate for their critical illness.&#xD;
      Two alternative primary end-points will be evaluated: all-cause mortality by day 90 and time&#xD;
      to discharge alive from the ICU. Second end-points will be calories and proteins delivered,&#xD;
      nosocomial infections, gastro-intestinal complications, glucose control, liver dysfunctions,&#xD;
      muscle function at the time of readiness for ICU discharge and quality of life at 3 months&#xD;
      and 1 year after study inclusion.&#xD;
