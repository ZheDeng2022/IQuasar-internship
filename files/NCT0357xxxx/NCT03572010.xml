      The objective of this study is to compare HIV infected children to uninfected children&#xD;
      regarding 1) quantifying iron absorption from iron fortified maize porridge, lipid-based food&#xD;
      supplements and oral iron supplements, and 2) quantifying the daily iron requirement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Anemia&#xD;
      frequently complicates pediatric HIV infection and predicts disease progression and&#xD;
      mortality. Iron requirements and the specific contribution of iron deficiency (ID) to anemia&#xD;
      in pediatric HIV infection remains uncertain. The fundamental barrier to understanding iron&#xD;
      nutrition in HIV infection is that sub-clinical inflammation in individuals with HIV&#xD;
      infection confounds the usual bio-markers used to assess iron status and response to iron&#xD;
      interventions. A novel iron stable isotope technique developed by ETH Zurich, Switzerland, is&#xD;
      a promising new tool for better understanding of iron metabolism in HIV infection. In&#xD;
      contrast to existing conventional bio-markers of iron status, a method based on isotopic&#xD;
      dilution of whole body iron labeled with stable, non-radioactive isotopes of iron (58Fe,&#xD;
      57Fe) could directly quantify iron requirements, as well as iron absorption from&#xD;
      interventions, completely free of bias and confounding by inflammation. This method could&#xD;
      offer, for the first time, a long-term quantitative measure of iron balance and absorption&#xD;
      from iron interventions and provide reliable data on which to base nutrition recommendations&#xD;
      for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to compare HIV infected children to uninfected children: 1) Quantify iron&#xD;
      absorption from iron fortified maize porridge, lipid-based food supplements and oral iron&#xD;
      supplements; 2) Quantify the daily iron requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be recruited from the South African Stellenbosch&#xD;
      University/Tygerberg Children's Hospital long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) cohort of&#xD;
      perinatally HIV infected children and uninfected controls from the same communities, matched&#xD;
      by age and gender. As a secondary outcome, we want to investigate the effect of iron&#xD;
      supplementation on the gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study 1, using a randomized cross-over design and stable isotope labeled single meal/doses&#xD;
      the investigators will: a) quantify the impairment of dietary iron absorption in HIV&#xD;
      infected, iron deficient children compared to HIV uninfected, iron deficient controls using a&#xD;
      labeled iron fortified maize meal, a lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) and an oral&#xD;
      iron supplement; and b) administer sufficient iron isotope label (57Fe) to allow&#xD;
      equilibration and follow up of isotopic composition in the blood for two years (isotope&#xD;
      dilution technique). At the end of Study 1, all iron deficient children will be iron replete&#xD;
      prior to entering Study 2. In study 1, in parallel, a group of HIV infected and uninfected,&#xD;
      iron sufficient children will be given orally 12 mg 57Fe as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study 2, the investigators will apply the principle of long-term isotope dilution to&#xD;
      quantify the daily iron requirement in both the HIV infected and uninfected children, and the&#xD;
      difference in iron requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal is to provide optimized recommendations on dietary iron requirements and&#xD;
      iron treatment regimens in HIV infected children, in order to reduce ID and anemia, improve&#xD;
      their health and well-being, their long-term prognosis and quality of life.&#xD;
