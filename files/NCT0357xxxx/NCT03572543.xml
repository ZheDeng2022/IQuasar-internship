  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric disorders characterized by pathological fear and anxiety are common and often&#xD;
      disabling. Despite their limitations, exposure therapies are among the most efficacious&#xD;
      treatments for these disorders. Extinction learning is thought to be a core mechanism of&#xD;
      therapeutic exposure. Extinction learning is mediated by a well-defined circuit encompassing&#xD;
      the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. This raises the exciting&#xD;
      possibility that direct engagement of this circuitry might enhance the response to&#xD;
      therapeutic exposure. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation&#xD;
      technology that can augment brain plasticity, learning, and memory. The proposed study will&#xD;
      evaluate whether tDCS can improve therapeutic learning and memory processes among&#xD;
      participants diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) This study aims to use tDCS&#xD;
      to improve learning and memory processes within the context of an exposure laboratory&#xD;
      challenge. Participants diagnosed with OCD will complete a two-day experimental study. On day&#xD;
      1, participants will receive sham (placebo) or active tDCS followed by approximately&#xD;
      50-minutes of individualized exposure. on day 2, participants will return to complete an&#xD;
      additional 50-minutes of exposure. Subjective distress will be repeatedly monitored during&#xD;
      exposure to allow for the modeling of within-trail and within-session learning and&#xD;
      between-session recall of learning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most effective behavioral treatments of disordered anxiety involve repeated exposure to&#xD;
      feared stimuli, which often results in systematic reductions in fearful responding to said&#xD;
      stimuli. It is believed that this process results from successful fear extinction, a&#xD;
      well-characterized learning process that is mediated by fear extinction brain circuitry.&#xD;
      Namely, fear extinction is an inhibitory learning process that requires activation and&#xD;
      plasticity within a variety of brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),&#xD;
      which can exert inhibitory control over fearful responding and parts of the brain that drive&#xD;
      said responding. Behavioral treatments of disordered anxiety, while effective, have serious&#xD;
      limitations; many patients fail to respond at all or only partially respond to exposure-based&#xD;
      treatments. One candidate reason for this is deficits in fear extinction learning or memory&#xD;
      processes. The proposed study aims to examine the effects of non-invasive neuromodulation -&#xD;
      namely, multifocal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the mPFC - on&#xD;
      therapeutic learning and memory among adults diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder&#xD;
      (OCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 26 subjects with OCD to complete a two-day experimental protocol to&#xD;
      examine the effects of tDCS on therapeutic learning and memory, which will be measured with&#xD;
      an exposure and response prevention laboratory challenge. On Day 1, OCD subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1, double-blind) to receive Active (n = 13) or Sham (n = 13) tDCS prior to&#xD;
      completing five 10-minute in vivo exposure exercises to assess the effects of tDCS on the&#xD;
      acquisition of therapeutic learning. Subjects and raters (including those directing exposure&#xD;
      sessions) will be blind to allocation. On Day 2, OCD subjects will return to complete five&#xD;
      additional exposure trials to examine the effects of tDCS on recall of therapeutic learning.&#xD;
      Subjective ratings of emotional distress (0-100) will be collected at baseline, before and&#xD;
      after tDCS, and during each minute of each exposure trial. It is hypothesized that tDCS will&#xD;
      improve the acquisition and recall of therapeutic learning (Aim 4); that participants&#xD;
      randomized to Active tDCS would show more rapid reductions in subjective distress and would&#xD;
      recall therapeutic learning on Day 2 when compared to participants randomized that Sham tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS will be delivered using an 8-channel Starstim transcranial electric stimulator from&#xD;
      Neuroelectrics. To target the mPFC, the anodal electrode will be placed over the frontal pole&#xD;
      (Fpz, 10-20 EEG landmarks) and will be surrounded by five return (cathodal) electrodes in a&#xD;
      circumferential array (AF7, AF8, F3, Fz, and F4). Subjects in the Active tDCS condition will&#xD;
      receive 20 minutes of direct current stimulation for 20 minutes; current will be ramped in&#xD;
      and out for 30 seconds at the beginning and end of the 20-minute period. Subjects in the Sham&#xD;
      tDCS condition will receive the same electrode placement and ramping procedures, but no&#xD;
      current will be delivered between ramping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear mixed modeling will be used to assess within and between-trial exposure-relevant&#xD;
      learning. Power analyses suggest that a sample of 24 (12 per condition) would adequately&#xD;
      power a priori analyses when using linear mixed modeling. Mixed ANOVA will be used to assess&#xD;
      recall of exposure-relevant learning. The proposed study will provide important preliminary&#xD;
      data to examine the potential for medial prefrontal tDCS to augment exposure-relevant&#xD;
      therapeutic learning.&#xD;
