    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (DM2) I may be associated with low level of Quality of Life (QOL),&#xD;
      depression, persistent stress and autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD). A new&#xD;
      biological measure measuring the Pressure Pain Sensitivity (PPS) of the chest bone has been&#xD;
      found to be a marker for persistent stress and ANS function, and linked to depression, QOL,&#xD;
      chronic inflammation and HbA1c. An intervention which uses the PPS measure as a biological&#xD;
      feedback marker for stress reduces the level of persistent stress (PPS) and depression,&#xD;
      reduces blood pressure, serum lipids, restores ANSD and increases quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: primary: if a simple individualized self-care based intervention, using the PPS&#xD;
      of the chest bone as a biofeedback marker for stress, reduces PPS and with concomitant&#xD;
      reduction in HbA1c. Secondly, if changes in PPS and HbA1c correlate, if the level of&#xD;
      depression and number of clinical stress symptoms are reduced, and QOL and personal&#xD;
      empowerment increased. Thirdly, if use of glucose-lowering medication, blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, work of the heart, autonomic nervous system dysfunction measured by PPS and&#xD;
      cardiovascular response to tilt table test and heart rate variability, serum lipids and&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation are reduced. As a separate part of the study, the implementation&#xD;
      aspects of the PPS guided intervention are studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:RCT,single-blinded, 1:1 randomization, in which diabetic treatment as usual (TAU) is&#xD;
      compared to TAU plus a self-care based intervention program based on daily PPS measurements&#xD;
      at home over a 6 months period and daily 2 times nervestimulation as mandatory. The study&#xD;
      will be open to the patient and the treating professionals but blinded towards the evaluating&#xD;
      researchers. The implementation part of the study will be conducted according to WHO&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: 160 patients with DM2 from primary health care. Effect variables: Primary: HbA1c.&#xD;
      Secondary : PPS, depression, QOL, personal empowerment, and the correlation between changes&#xD;
      in PPS and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: All patients receive diabetes care as usual. The active group receives in addition&#xD;
      the self-care based, non-pharmacological PPS guided intervention program, which focuses on&#xD;
      daily PPS measurement for cognitive reflection and cutaneous sensory nerve stimulation for&#xD;
      reduction of PPS with the aim to reduce the elevated PPS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction About 350 million people worldwide have type 2 diabetes (DM2). Approximately 85%&#xD;
      of these patients are controlled in the primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high level of personal care, i.e. high empowerment, is a pre-requisite for successful&#xD;
      outcome of their diabetes disease. Therefore, all patients are encouraged to measure their&#xD;
      blood glucose levels several times a week or daily, depending on the type of treatment, and&#xD;
      to act according to the blood glucose level, typically by changing lifestyle. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that high empowerment increases QOL in diabetes patients. In general, living with&#xD;
      a chronic disease is associated with low QOL, fear of the future, anxiety and depression, and&#xD;
      similarly for patients with DM2. These elements may lead to a state of chronic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between persistent stress on the one side, and chronic arterial inflammation and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events recently received support from a long-term study using region brain&#xD;
      activity as assessment for chronic stress&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPS measure and the PPS-guided intervention Persistent stress or allostatic overload as&#xD;
      it is also called can be measured using an algometer measuring the pressure pain sensitivity&#xD;
      at the sternum (PPS), and the measure can be used as self-monitoring at home using daily&#xD;
      measurements. This can then be followed by action, and thus increase the personal&#xD;
      empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an intervention study in healthy office workers, it was found that a reduction of an&#xD;
      elevated PPS was significantly associated with a reduction in HbA1c, blood pressure, serum&#xD;
      lipids, body mass index, serum YKL 40 (a marker of inflammation),and ANS dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another chronic disease, ischemic heart disease, we have demonstrated that daily&#xD;
      measurement of one's individual stress levels by this algometer followed by nerve stimulation&#xD;
      as a mandatory stress modulating treatment (the ULLCARE program) reduced depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      increased well-being and quality of life and restored ANSD The concept: measure PPS and take&#xD;
      action aiming at reducing the persistent stress load in chronic disease is thus established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study (n=100), approximately 70% of DM2 patients had an elevated PPS measure (≥&#xD;
      60), indicative of presence of persistent stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines of WHO for implementation research will be applied in the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study The pharmaceutical treatment in DM2 is associated with potential side&#xD;
      effects, is associated with health care expenses and may in the long run show to be&#xD;
      insufficient to keep blood glucose low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this background, the search for non-pharmaceutical selfcare-based interventional&#xD;
      modalities that increase patient empowerment become attractive. The present intervention&#xD;
      represents one such intervention. Further, application of the concept to the most vulnerable&#xD;
      patients with ischemic heart disease has an effect size on depression much larger than&#xD;
      anti-depressive medication.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A simple individualized self-care based intervention program, that uses frequently&#xD;
      PPS measure as a feedback marker of stress followed by cutaneous sensory nerve stimulation,&#xD;
      reduces the level of persistent stress measured as PPS, and concomitantly reduces HBA1c,&#xD;
      depression, clinical stress score, and increase QOL and empowerment, and by this reduces the&#xD;
      use of glucose-lowering medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the self-cared based intervention program ULLCARE, with focus on PPS measurement as&#xD;
      biofeedback marker of stress and nerve stimulation as mandatory plus free-of-choice own&#xD;
      efforts for stress reduction, help patients with DM2 through increased self-care over a six&#xD;
      months period leading to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced persistent stress measured as PPS Reduction of an elevated HbA1c Reduction in&#xD;
      depression and clinical stress score, and improved QOL and empowerment Correlation between&#xD;
      reduction in PPS and reduction in HbA1c among patients with HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol at baseline,&#xD;
      PPS ≥ 60 arbitrary units at baseline, and who obtain a reduction in PPS ≥ 15 arbitrary units&#xD;
      during intervention period Reduction in use of glucose-lowering medication Reduction in blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, work of the heart, low grade inflammation (i.e. YKL 40), ANS&#xD;
      dysfunction, serum lipids, BMI and visceral fat&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a separate part of the study, the implementation aspect of the PPS guided intervention is&#xD;
      as studied according to the WHO implementation study guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions at 6 months follow-up up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient evaluation of the intervention program: Among others:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How long did it take you to become familiar with the use of the PPS measurement device? To&#xD;
      what extend do have you found the use of the PPS measurement device useful? Does the PPS&#xD;
      measure serve its purpose, to increase sense of increased personal control? Are the mandatory&#xD;
      daily PPS measurement and nerve stimulation acceptable and feasible?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A prospective, randomized observer-blinded controlled trial in which the effect of a 6&#xD;
      and 12 months PPS guided selfcare based intervention program plus treatment as usual (TAU)&#xD;
      (e.g. active group) is compared to a control group, who receives TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and randomization The study is open to the participating patients and the&#xD;
      instructors of the active group. The study is blinded to all others, including the&#xD;
      statisticians who make the main analysis. The personnel conducting the clinical examinations&#xD;
      does not have access to the documents containing information about the treatment or treatment&#xD;
      procedures. This is to prevent bias in the comparison between the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study endocrinologist, who regulates all glucose-lowering, lipid-lowering and blood&#xD;
      pressure-lowering medication, is blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is 1:1, active: control. An independent research company electronically&#xD;
      conducts the practical randomization. The result of the randomization is blinded to the&#xD;
      investigating personel besides the people conducting the training of the active group as well&#xD;
      as patients are excluded from blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are stratified in three groups: HbA1c below 53 mmol/mol: HbA1c: 53 - 63&#xD;
      mmol/mol; HbA1c: 64 - 75 mmol/mol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material 160 patients recruited from primary health care will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the first 50 patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria in all aspect,&#xD;
      except by having a PPS value below 60, will be invited to participate in the full baseline&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: see elsewhere Exclusion criteria : see elsewhere Outcome measures : see&#xD;
      elsewhere Previous studies have shown that when an elevated PPS is reduced, the secondary&#xD;
      effect on other outcome measures is larger, if these outcome measures are elevated at&#xD;
      baseline as well&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this background, the present study will focus on effect on these outcome measures, when&#xD;
      they are elevated at baseline. Discrimination values for each outcome measure will be as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c: ≥ 53 mmol/mol PPS: ≥ 60 arbitrary units Blood pressure: ≥ 130/85 mm Hg Heart rate: ≥&#xD;
      70 beats/minute Depression score; MDI ≥ 15 WHO 5: score &lt; 50 arbitrary units Clinical stress&#xD;
      score: ≥8 arbitrary units Total cholesterol: ≥5.0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol: ≥3.5 mmol/L HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol: ≤ 0.9 mmol/L Triglyceride: ≥ 2.0 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation related outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      User feedback addressing the:&#xD;
&#xD;
      educational program, conduction of the program at home, the professional support and the web&#xD;
      related support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider feedback among the professional staff taking care of education and professional&#xD;
      support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of glucose-lowering medication The treatment target for glycemic control is 48 mmol/mol.&#xD;
      Reduction in HbA1c to a level above or equal to 48 mmol/mol does not lead to change in&#xD;
      medication In patients with a HbA1c below 48 mmol/mol a further reduction of 3 mmol/mol will&#xD;
      lead to an evaluation with respect to reduction in anti-diabetes medication performed by the&#xD;
      study diabetologist, blinded to the randomization and according to Danish National Guidelines&#xD;
      If the patient experiences a hypoglycemic episode, she or he is asked to contact the study&#xD;
      nurse, and the study diabetologist will consider whether change in glucose-lowering&#xD;
      medication is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If HbA1c increases more than 3 mmol/mol at any point at follow- up, the glucose lowering&#xD;
      medication is evaluated with respect to an increase in anti-diabetic medication and according&#xD;
      to the judgement of the study diabetologist and according to Danish National Guidelines. The&#xD;
      study diabetologist is blinded to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Control/Active group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: continue their diabetes care program as usual&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active group: receive in addition to the above mentioned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruction in UllCare program during a 45 minute personal consultation by a UllCare program&#xD;
      instructor certified nurse Mandatory daily efforts: Self-measurement of PPS to be done twice&#xD;
      daily; Nerve stimulation according to instruction; Use of personal web journal Free-of-choice&#xD;
      modalities for further reduction of the PPS measure if needed. The patient receives the&#xD;
      following instruction material: An Ull Meter, a written instrument instruction manual, a&#xD;
      booklet with the Ull Care intervention program, a DVD instructor manual for use of PPS&#xD;
      measurement device and nerve stimulation, and a log-in for their personal web journal Five&#xD;
      telephone consultation with the UllCare instructor after 1,3, 5, 6 and 10 weeks Two&#xD;
      face-to-face consultations with UllCare Instructor at 1 and 3 months The patients record&#xD;
      their PPS measurements either on a web platform or on paper at least once a week If their PPS&#xD;
      records show a PPS ≥ 60 for 7 consecutive morning measurements, the patient is contacted&#xD;
      regarding the need for additional technical instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After six months of participation in the project all patients (both groups) are called to a&#xD;
      repetition of the baseline visit at Herlev Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two examinations at Herlev hospital are conducted by the same blinded nurse at baseline&#xD;
      and the 6-month follow-up respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data with respect to the outcome measures of the study may also be obtained from the patient&#xD;
      record at www.sundhed.dk After 12 months data with respect to HbA1c and use of&#xD;
      glucose-lowering medication is obtained through the public data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case blood glucose/HbA1c increases In this case the diabetologist, which is blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment allocation, will decide which potential changes in medication should be done. In&#xD;
      case the General Practitioner wants to change blood pressure medication or lipid lowering&#xD;
      medication, he or she is urged to inform the study nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods PPS measurement An Ull Meter is used, which is an instrument developed to measure the&#xD;
      sensibility/activity in the polymodal nervous system corresponding to the most painful point&#xD;
      on the sternum between costa 3-5. The point is identified by finger pressure. First the&#xD;
      patient learns his/hers pain threshold as the instructor applies a gradually increasing&#xD;
      pressure on the distal phalanges of the left index finger with the instrument and the patient&#xD;
      is instructed to say stop when the threshold of pain/discomfort is reached. If the instructor&#xD;
      observes a withdrawal reflex (i.e. an involuntary muscle contraction of the muscles around&#xD;
      the eyes, the neck or upper limb) before the patient says stop, the procedure is stopped as&#xD;
      well. The procedure is then repeated on the most tender place on the sternum. The instrument&#xD;
      then displays a number on a scale from 30 to 100, where an increased sensibility is&#xD;
      accompanied by an increasing number, PPS; meaning that a high PPS measure reflects a high&#xD;
      level of stress (high sensitivity). The PPS is determined as the average of two consecutive&#xD;
      measurements on the same location on the sternum and with 5 seconds between measurements. If&#xD;
      difference between the two measurements exceeds 10 PPS arbitrary units, a third measurement&#xD;
      is conducted and the average between the three measurement is used as the PPS measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ull Meter has the following special features:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hidden measurement value until the measurement is completed. A calculation of the sensitivity&#xD;
      to a tenderness score on a logarithmic scale similar to the decibel scale used to estimate&#xD;
      the limit values of sound pressure in connection with a hearing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alarm that is activated by a pressure before the occurrence of any injury. A special foot&#xD;
      pad that prevents irritation of the skin to ensure that it is the pressure sensitivity of the&#xD;
      bone that is measured and not the skin's sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment modalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current diabetes care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, all patients received standard diabetes care according to national guidelines,&#xD;
      which include medical counselling by the study nurse, medical standardization by the study&#xD;
      diabetologist, education in DM2 and life style adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ull Care program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic elements of the intervention are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self-care part. A professional instruction in the PPS measurement, cognitive reflection in&#xD;
      relation to the measure and nerve stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous recording of the participants' PPS measurements through a Web journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-care based intervention program is a stress management program based on the use of&#xD;
      the PPS measure as a biofeedback marker of stress. The most important effort is the daily&#xD;
      self-care in the form of PPS measuring, cognitive reflection and nerve stimulation, which is&#xD;
      linked to professional technical help depending on need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elements of the self-care program An individual start-up of a 45-minutes face-to-face&#xD;
      consultation at home with an Ull Care instructor who explains the use of the instrument, the&#xD;
      interpretation of the PPS measurement, nerve stimulation and the web platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personal Ull Meter instrument. A personal web journal for track recording of the&#xD;
      participant's PPS measure's development (patients without internet access will receive&#xD;
      printed registration sheets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A booklet that describes the self-care program in details. Two additional face-to-face&#xD;
      meetings with additional professional instruction should the PPS measure remain ≥ 60 after 1&#xD;
      and 3 months respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 x 15 minutes of telephone consultations after 1, 3, 5, 6 and 10 weeks respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online assessment of the participant's PPS measurements. This assessment is made&#xD;
      automatically on the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professional support: If the morning PPS measure has been ≥ 60 for more than seven days in a&#xD;
      row, the participant is contacted pro-actively and offered additional professional support&#xD;
      with the overall aim in mind: obtain and main low PPS measure, preferable &lt; 45, and&#xD;
      acceptable &lt; 60 arbitrary units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily steps of the self-care program Four elements constitute the daily self-care system:&#xD;
      measuring, cognitive reflection, action and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring: PPS is measured twice a day as a fully private measure and is entered in a&#xD;
      personal web journal, so that the person can track his/hers own development, while at the&#xD;
      same time there is a regular external professional control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reflection: Cognitive reflection as a reaction to the actual PPS measure and its development.&#xD;
      Action: Nerve stimulation on selected acupuncture points corresponding to the instruction.&#xD;
      Possible further own efforts are as mentioned in the book on general stress management given&#xD;
      to all participants (both the active and control group). The PPS measure is used as a&#xD;
      personal feedback marker of stress, taking into account the effect of the participant's&#xD;
      chosen effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Measure the effect of any action/inaction at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This four-step procedure should be done at least twice a day (morning and evening) to be&#xD;
      preventive; it is recommended to perform the procedure morning and evening in order to&#xD;
      promote the construction of a conditioned reflex. This reflex (i) facilitates the habit and&#xD;
      (ii) improves the effect of the action, which is important for ad-hoc use, should the&#xD;
      participant want to reduce his/hers level of stress acutely or if he/she experience one or&#xD;
      more of the clinical stress symptoms, which is presented to her/him as part of the&#xD;
      educational program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific therapeutic elements of the program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily mandatory efforts Biofeedback measuring of stress using the PPS measure as composite&#xD;
      measure for important diabetes risk factors which are possible to influence by the suggested&#xD;
      own efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory nerve stimulation (acupressure/shiatsu massage) Free-of-choice supplementary own&#xD;
      efforts. As the main effort of the program is to reduce an elevated PPS measure, additional&#xD;
      own-efforts will be recommended on an individual basis in response to the observed reduction&#xD;
      in PPS or lack of such reductions. Such efforts included a variety of physical, mental,&#xD;
      emotional, social modalities as well as diet recommendations. These modalities are presented&#xD;
      to the patient as part of the written educational material&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPS measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are instructed to perform the PPS measurement twice daily, similarly and as a&#xD;
      supplement to the home blood sugar measurement. It is explained that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the PPS measure represent a simple and reliable composite measure for a variety of important&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular health risk factors, including HbA1c, autonomic function, blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, work of the heart, serum lipids, low grade inflammation, QOL,&#xD;
      depression and persistent stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That all of these risk factors improves concomitantly (if elevated) when PPS is persistently&#xD;
      reduced to a level below 60 arbitrary units and with the ultimate goal to obtain a morning&#xD;
      PPS below 45 arbitrary units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That the present PPS guided self-care based non-pharmacological intervention will do the job&#xD;
      when applied on a daily basis, similarly to the daily tooth brushing for caries prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are instructed to perform the preventive nerve stimulation twice a day plus ad&#xD;
      hoc when they urgently want to reduce their stress. Nerve stimulation is done by applying&#xD;
      pressure with a finger for one minute - you should feel it, but it should not cause any pain,&#xD;
      This is done at the following acupuncture points; on the sternum at the level of the fourth&#xD;
      intercostals space (Shanzhong, C.V. 17), and on the back 3,8 cm lateral to the spinal process&#xD;
      of the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebra (Jueyinshu and Xinshu, U.B. 14 and 15) Nerve&#xD;
      stimulation is done successfully when the patient can observe that the tenderness of the&#xD;
      point has been reduced after applying pressure for 20 to max 60 seconds. If this result has&#xD;
      not been achieved, the patient is instructed to repeat the treatment. The repetitive nerve&#xD;
      stimulation has two primary goals: 1) to restore the nervous system's ability to adapt&#xD;
      through the repetitive stimulation of the diffuse pain inhibitory control (DNIC) system and&#xD;
      2) to reduce an elevated stress level through the repeated non-painful sensory stimulation of&#xD;
      the polymodal nerve cell, causing a release of the oxytocin hormone. If possible, the spouse&#xD;
      or cohabitant will be instructed to perform nerve stimulation on the patient's back, which&#xD;
      may independently contribute to stress-relieving effects through a separate oxytocin release&#xD;
      caused by the human care. If a spouse or cohabitant is not available, the patient can perform&#xD;
      the treatment himself with a ball (the person will receive instructions in the technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analyses Blood samples are taken locally at Medical Department , Endocrinology Unit,&#xD;
      Herlev Hospital. Routine analyses as HbA1c is measured immediately at. After analysis, and by&#xD;
      June 1st 2021, the debris is destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides this a blood sample is taken and stored at -80 degrees until analysis. This is for&#xD;
      research purpose. All research analysis will performed at Medical Department , Endocrinology&#xD;
      Unit, Herlev Hospital. All samples are analysed in the same assay to avoid inter-assay&#xD;
      variation, i.e. the analyses are first performed after completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides this, a spare sample of 20 ml of blood is taken for any later use at baseline and at&#xD;
      the 6 months follow-up. These spare sample are stored in coded form (without CPR number) in&#xD;
      one of the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Capital Region's approved bio banks&#xD;
      (database id: 30122009.HEH.O.JF). This database is an ongoing database without a planned end&#xD;
      date. The aim of this data bank in supplementary blood analyses for research purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questionnaires will be included as outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes empowerment is measured by the questionnaire DES-SF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Major depression inventory (MDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. WHO-5 quality of life score&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical stress sign score&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. SF-36 for physical and mental health&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Epworth Sleepiness score&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      other measures BMI: will be measured as weight in kilogram divided with height in meters&#xD;
      squared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure (mm Hg) and pulse (beasts/minute: measured automatically conducted in the&#xD;
      supine position after 10 minutes of rest Work of the heart is measured as&#xD;
      Pressure-Rate-Product (mm Hg/beats per minute: systolic blood pressure x heart rate Body&#xD;
      Composition (visceral fat): measured by Omron BF 500, 4-point bio electrical impedance&#xD;
      measure, using metal footpads and hand electrodes&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANS measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRV measured by Vagus instrument (non-invasive procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Table tilt testing: standardized procedure tilting the subject to 70 degrees and measure&#xD;
           blood pressure, pulse rate and PPS before and after 7 min tilting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Calculation of sample size and power analysis Calculation of sample size is based&#xD;
      on the followed premises with respect to HbA1c. The Minimal Important Difference is 4&#xD;
      mmol/mol; mean HbA1c as baseline is estimated to be 64 mmol/mol, and with standard deviation:&#xD;
      9 mmol/mol. Alfa: 5%, Beta: 80 %. This lead to 160 as total sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Minimal Important Difference with respect to effect size is calculated as per protocol&#xD;
      (i.e. all patients who complete the study, including the 6 months follow-up examination) as&#xD;
      well as on all included patients on intention to treat basis. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohens effect size is a fraction that consists of the difference in a HbA1c from before&#xD;
      intervention till after treatment for the active group, minus the same difference for the&#xD;
      control group divided by the spread (i.e. standard deviation) of the change in HbA1c, when&#xD;
      taking all patients together. Example: the HbA1c in active group changes from 64 to 56&#xD;
      (64-56) = 8 mmol/mol; while the HbA1c for the control group changes from 64 to 60 (64-60) = 4&#xD;
      mmol/mol. This change in the HbA1c is 8-4 = 4; if the spread on the HbA1c for all patients is&#xD;
      9, the effect size will be 4/9 = 0.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the effect variables Five percent (5 %) will be used as significance level in all&#xD;
      statistic tests. The statistics are compiled on an &quot;per protocol&quot; and &quot;intention to treat&#xD;
      basis&quot;. The former meaning that all patients who complete the trial are included; the latter&#xD;
      meaning that all enrolled patients are included in the subsequent analysis. Both set of&#xD;
      analyses will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delta values (i.e. difference between baseline and follow-up measurement) for the active and&#xD;
      control group respectively will be compared to analyse for a possible treatment effect. All&#xD;
      secondary and tertiary effect variables will be analysed after the intervention through&#xD;
      variance and regression analysis. If the premises for the proposed statistical analysis&#xD;
      cannot be met, non-parametric analysis is used. Quality-of-life data will be analysed to meet&#xD;
      the directions of each of the questionnaires. All effect data will be presented a unifying&#xD;
      table and primary, secondary and tertiary effect variables will be listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to calculate the effect with respect to outcome measures, which are elevated at&#xD;
      baseline, these will be calculated for the group of patients who has an elevated risk profile&#xD;
      with respect to the individual outcome measure (e.g. when triglyceride is tested for change,&#xD;
      this is done among the patients with an elevated triglyceride level at baseline). These&#xD;
      effect variables include: triglyceride, Total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL cholesterol, blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate and Pressure-Rate-Product, glycated hemoglobin, PPS, MDI depression&#xD;
      score and WHO5 well-being score (see point 5: outcome measures). The proportion of patients&#xD;
      who obtain such effect will be compared between the two groups of patients: those who&#xD;
      experience a reduction of PPS ≥ 15 arbitrary units, and those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose-lowering medication: it will be calculated as between-group differences in the&#xD;
      proportion of participants who: (i) reduce the use of glucose-lowering medication, (ii) who&#xD;
      totally discontinue the use, and (iii) who increase their use. The between-group difference&#xD;
      in proportion of patients who reduce, discontinue or increase their use of glucose-lowering&#xD;
      medication will be calculated using 2x2 Contingency table test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success criteria The first priority criterium for a successful outcome of the study is a&#xD;
      significant between group difference. Secondly, effect size calculated as described in&#xD;
      Statistics section of this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits for the patients By participating in the study, each patient can get a general&#xD;
      profit from the opportunity of an additional comprehensive health check. If the findings of&#xD;
      the study are positive, it means that the patients in the active group have an extra benefit&#xD;
      in terms of improved glycemic control, increased empowerment, reduced stress, improved QOL,&#xD;
      reduced glucose-lowing medication and some concrete tools for maintaining these benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The study is approved by the local Scientific Ethics Committee. The study is also&#xD;
      reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency. The study complies with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are informed orally and in writing about the study. The subject's right not to&#xD;
      receive information on his/hers health condition and disposition to disease will be reviewed&#xD;
      and respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject gives written permission, two spare blood sample will be stored from both&#xD;
      baseline and the month follow-up in one of the Danish Data Protection Agency's approved bio&#xD;
      banks (jr.nr 2005-41-5655, later 2008-41-2031, and from Dec 2009: 30122009.HEH.O.JF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no financial compensation to subjects. If during the conduct of the trial new&#xD;
      information on effect, risks and side effects appear, the subjects will be informed, and a&#xD;
      new informed consent may be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the blood samples for any other purpose than what the subjects initially consented and&#xD;
      what is referred to in this protocol will follow the usual guidelines, including a renewed&#xD;
      reporting to the ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and rights and information of the participants The patients are not deprived of other&#xD;
      known effective treatment, and participation in the study does not interfere with the&#xD;
      patient's current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked for permission to take an extra blood sample for research purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By measuring the pressure threshold, some soreness or bruises may occur if the participant&#xD;
      does not follow the instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HRV position testing is non-invasive and without discomfort or risk to the person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The given active intervention is risk-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial contact from the study group to the patient is by invitation presented in public&#xD;
      media and to the local general practitioners. The first contact is a telephone call from the&#xD;
      patient to the study nurse. Secondly, the patient come to Herlev Hospital for a personal&#xD;
      information consult with the study nurse, and which takes place in a room with no other&#xD;
      persons around. For this meeting, the patient is recommended to bring an assessor.&#xD;
      Furthermore, at this consultation the patient receives the following documents 1)&#xD;
      &quot;Deltagerinformation, 2) &quot;Samtykkeerklæring&quot;, 3) &quot;Forsøgspersoners rettigheder i et&#xD;
      sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt&quot;, og 4) &quot;før du beslutter dig&quot;. For this consult,&#xD;
      there will be emphasis on the fact that the information session is about a query of&#xD;
      participation. The subject's right not to receive information on his/hers health condition&#xD;
      and disposition to disease will be reviewed and respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, if the patient wants to participate, the &quot;Samtykkeerklæring&quot; must be returned to the&#xD;
      study nurse, preferable within a week after the information consult. Thereafter, the patient&#xD;
      is scheduled for baseline examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflicts of interest Søren Ballegaard is a shareholder in Ull Care A/S and is the inventor&#xD;
      of the Ull Meter. To minimize possible bias, he shall not participate in 1) patient&#xD;
      selection, and 2) evaluation of the treatment. Jens Faber, Finn Gyntelberg and Ebbe Eldrup do&#xD;
      not own shares or other financial interests in Ull Care A/S and have never received&#xD;
      funding/fees from the company. Thus they have nothing to declare as disclosures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wirth respect to the use of the DES-SF questionnaire, the project described was supported by&#xD;
      Grant Number P30DK092926 (MCDTR) from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and&#xD;
      Kidney Diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy By the use of public registers (i.e. www.Sundhed.dk, it is the intention to conduct&#xD;
      a 12 months follow-up with respect to 1) HbA1c and 2) use of glucose lowering medication.&#xD;
      Secondly to record the implementation aspect of the study. Presently, financial support for&#xD;
      this sub study is applied for.&#xD;
