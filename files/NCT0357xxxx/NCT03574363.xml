      This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074 in patients with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease and uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will enroll up to 165 patients, randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment&#xD;
      groups (55 patients in each group): KBP-5074 0.25 mg once daily (QD), KBP-5074 0.5 mg QD, or&#xD;
      placebo QD. Randomization will be stratified to balance enrollment for key variables that may&#xD;
      influence safety and/or efficacy evaluations, including estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate&#xD;
      (eGFR) (30 versus 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) (160 versus &lt;160&#xD;
      mmHg). The study will be approximately 5 months in duration with 84 days of double-blind&#xD;
      treatment. The study will consist of an up to 4-week screening period; 2-week, open-label&#xD;
      (placebo) run-in period; 84-day double-blind treatment period; and a 4-week post-treatment&#xD;
      safety follow-up period. Patients will be sampled for plasma pharmacokinetics (PK). Total&#xD;
      KBP-5074 levels will be assessed in patients treated with active drug. A total of 4 PK&#xD;
      samples will be collected from each patient, including Day 1 (prior to discharge), Day 14&#xD;
      pre-dose, Day 28 pre-dose, and End of Study Visit (Day 98)/Early Termination Visit. The&#xD;
      pre-dose samples assume that patients will be dosed in the unit on those days above. If&#xD;
      patients are not dosed in the unit on those days, a flexible PK sample will be collected&#xD;
      during each of these visits.Safety will be assessed systematically, and an independent data&#xD;
      monitoring committee will perform cumulative reviews of safety data at regular intervals&#xD;
      during the study. Serum potassium levels, serum creatinine, and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      closely monitored throughout the study. At Screening, patients must have uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension, defined as resting trough cuff seated SBP 140 mmHg, based on the mean of the&#xD;
      last 2 consecutive blood pressure readings at Screening in the clinic. In all cases, dose and&#xD;
      frequency of concurrent antihypertensive medications are expected to be maintained without&#xD;
      change for 30 days prior to randomization in order to ensure that blood pressure is stable.&#xD;
      In general, patients should not add nor adjust dose and/or types of the antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications they are receiving during the screening period and throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      study (unless they develop hypertensive crisis or symptomatic hypotension). Patients will be&#xD;
      advised to maintain their normal diet and avoid alcohol or potassium-rich foods/drinks during&#xD;
      the study period. No potassium supplements are permitted, unless clinically indicated to&#xD;
      treat hypokalemia until serum potassium values are within the normal range. Potassium-sparing&#xD;
      agents are not permitted. After completion of the screening period and the qualifying&#xD;
      Screening Visit, patients who meet all eligibility criteria (except those criteria scheduled&#xD;
      to be assessed after the Screening Visit), will enter the 2-week, open-label (placebo) run-in&#xD;
      period. At the end of the run-in period, patients will be re-assessed for eligibility,&#xD;
      including compliance to study drug received during the run-in period, which must be &gt;80% and&#xD;
      120% (i.e. placebo and stable antihypertensive medication, i.e. no change in antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication). If a patient is found to be ineligible during Screening, a 1-time re-screening&#xD;
      is allowed if the Investigator believes that the patient's condition has changed and the&#xD;
      patient may be eligible before the re-screening tests. Please note that a new patient number&#xD;
      should be assigned to any re-screened patient, and all the procedures defined in the protocol&#xD;
      for the Screening Visit and during the run-in period must be repeated. Patients who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria at the end of the screening period and run-in period will be randomized&#xD;
      (stratified based on eGFR 30 versus 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 and SBP 160 versus &lt;160 mmHg) into the&#xD;
      study on Day 1. All randomized patients will receive double-blind treatment for 84 days.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 4 weeks for safety assessments after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug. A subset of patients who still meet eligibility criteria at the end of the run-in&#xD;
      period (Visit 3) will undergo 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on Day 1,&#xD;
      Day 40, and Day 82.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Males with partners who are WOCBP must agree to use condoms plus spermicide and their&#xD;
             female partner must also be using contraception (eg, hormonal or intra-uterine&#xD;
