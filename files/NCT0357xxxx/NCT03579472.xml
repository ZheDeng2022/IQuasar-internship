      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose and side effects of eribulin mesylate when given&#xD;
      together with M7824)in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as M7824, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving eribulin mesylate and&#xD;
      M7824 may work better at treating triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of eribulin mesylate (eribulin) when in&#xD;
      combination with the fixed dose of bintrafusp alfa (M7824) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of M7824 when in combination with eribulin in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the best overall response (BOR) rate according to Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses to M7824 in combination with eribulin in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimation of progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic TNBC patients treated with&#xD;
      M7824 in combination with eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Perform correlative studies on blood and tissue samples to evaluate systemic and tumor&#xD;
      biomarkers of response and resistance to M7824 and eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlative studies on blood and tissue samples will also be used to evaluate systemic&#xD;
      and tumor biomarkers of response to M7824 and eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bintrafusp alfa intravenously (IV) over 50-80 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29,&#xD;
      and eribulin mesylate IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      42 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days.&#xD;
