  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics like enrofloxacin are widely used in animal farming to treat and prevent&#xD;
      bacterial infections. A previous study in poultry farms has shown that yardmen show&#xD;
      significant concentrations of administered antibiotics in their urine. It is currently&#xD;
      unclear how poultry yardmen are exposed to the administered antibiotics. The objective of&#xD;
      this exemplarily study is to obtain information on the pharmacokinetics of the different&#xD;
      uptake routes (oral, inhaled or dermal).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be exposed to enrofloxacin at a concentration level representative for&#xD;
      occupational exposure of yardmen at poultry farms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As three uptake-routes, oral, inhalation and dermal, are conceivable all three cases will be&#xD;
      investigated. After administration blood and urine samples will be analysed for enrofloxacin&#xD;
      and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin at several time points. The objective of this&#xD;
      exemplarily study is to obtain information on the pharmacokinetics of the different uptake&#xD;
      routes. If different exposure routes are characterized by different pharmacokinetics, such&#xD;
      studies can be used to obtain a better understanding of general routes of exposure in&#xD;
      occupational environments. On the basis of the results mitigation strategies can be&#xD;
      developed, reducing the risk of exposure.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The subjects are exposed to 250 µg of enrofloxacin on three different dosing days that are separated by at least 7 days. On the first dosing day, enrofloxacin is administered via the dermal route. On the second dosing day, enrofloxacin is administered via inhalation of 5 mL solution in a concentration of 50 µg/mL by an ultrasonic nebulizer. On the third dosing day, enrofloxacin is administered orally as a 20 mL solution in a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (including a normal&#xD;
             coagulation profile), ECGs, vital signs and spirometry.&#xD;
