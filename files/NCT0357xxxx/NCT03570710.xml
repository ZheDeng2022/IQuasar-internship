  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PAS is an obstetrics condition that is closely linked with massive obstetrical hemorrhage&#xD;
      with a varied incidence about once in every 533 live births. It is considered one of the&#xD;
      causes of massive transfusion (&gt;4 units of packed red blood cells) and cesarean hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that peripartum hysterectomies are performed in approximately0.08% of all&#xD;
      deliveries. A large study from the United Kingdom noted that 38% were a result of PAS. More&#xD;
      recently, population-based analyses show that PAS is the indication for the majority of&#xD;
      peripartum hysterectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding at the time of peripartum hysterectomy for PAS is often substantial. Nearly 90% of&#xD;
      patients need blood products, while 38% of patients need a massive blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a 30% risk of an ICU admission, thromboembolic disease, readmission, reoperation,&#xD;
      poor wound healing, and a reported rate of surgical re-exploration ranging from 4% to 33%.&#xD;
      The risk of maternal death reported being as high as 7% (although less in most recent series)&#xD;
      Therefore, adequate homeostatic techniques are essential. Currently, surgical hemostasis can&#xD;
      be secured by a variety of methods, including mechanical sutures (or clamping), electric&#xD;
      coagulation, ultrasonically activated scalpel or drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TA is a lysine analog which acts as an antifibrinolytic via competitive inhibition of the&#xD;
      binding of plasmin and plasminogen to fibrin. The rationale for its use in the reduction of&#xD;
      blood loss depending on the implication of the coagulation and fibrinolysis processes .&#xD;
      However, concerns about possible thromboembolic events with the parental administration of TA&#xD;
      has stimulated increasing interest in its topical Use&#xD;

      Eligible participants were allocated to one of three groups. Group (I): patients received 110&#xD;
      ml normal saline IV just before skin incision Group (II): patients received 1 gm TA (2&#xD;
      ampoules of Capron 500 mg /5 ml; Amoun, Cairo, Egypt) intravenous just before skin incision.&#xD;
      Group (III): patients received 2 gm topical TA (4 ampoules of Capron 500 mg/5 ml) applied on&#xD;
      the placental bed after placental delivery. Patients were randomized to three groups, each&#xD;
      compromised of 43 patients according to a three-blocked randomization list which was coded (1&#xD;
      or 2 or 3) at 1:1:1 ratio. The three parallel groups were prepared using a Computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization system. The allocated groups will be concealed in serially numbered sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes that will only be opened after recruitment. The patient allocation will be&#xD;
      performed prior to the induction of anesthesia by an independent person, who will not&#xD;
      otherwise be involved in this study. The trial will be appropriately blinded; the&#xD;
      participants, outcome assessors and the surgeon performing the procedure will be blinded to&#xD;
      the medication type, which will be used. In all eligible participants, CH was performed under&#xD;
      general anesthesia by the same operative and anesthesia team. A dose of 1 g of&#xD;
      first-generation cephalosporin (CefazolinÂ®; Bristol Mayers Squibb, Cairo, Egypt) was&#xD;
      administered intravenously immediately prior to skin incision. The abdomen was exposed&#xD;
      through Pfannensteil incision. After skin incision, the subcutaneous fat and abdominal fascia&#xD;
      were opened crosswise, and the rectus muscle was opened on the midline, the parietal&#xD;
      peritoneum was opened longitudinally, the visceral peritoneum was opened transversely and&#xD;
      dissected downwards with the bladder and kept against symphysis pubis by a Doyen retractor,&#xD;
      followed by transverse incision of the uterus at the upper border of the placenta to avoid&#xD;
      transplacental incision which provoke severe bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were allocated to one of three groups after induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia and immediately prior to the operation and just before skin incision. they&#xD;
      received 1-gram tranexamic acid (10 ml) in 100 ml saline infusion or placebo (110 normal&#xD;
      saline) by slow intravenous injection at an approximate rate of 1 mL per min. Throughout the&#xD;
      operation irrigation was done by 60 ml of (2g tranexamic acid (10 ml) diluted in 100 ml of&#xD;
      sodium chloride 0.9%) or placebo ( 60 ml of sodium chloride 0.9%.).At the end of operation&#xD;
      another dose of 60 ml of (1g tranexamic acid (10 ml) diluted in 50 ml of sodium chloride&#xD;
      0.9%) or placebo ( 60 ml of sodium chloride 0.9%.) was left intraabdominal then 1&#xD;
      intraperitoneal suction drain was routinely used in all patients the drains were closed for 3&#xD;
      hour postoperative , after that time the drains were opened and removed on the second&#xD;
      postoperative day unless otherwise indicated.. To ensure a sufficiently high concentration of&#xD;
      topical tranexamic acid, it was diluted only to a volume sufficient to moisten a large wound&#xD;
      surface. 20 ml moistens at least 1500 cm2.&#xD;
