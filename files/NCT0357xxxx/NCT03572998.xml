      Protocol resume&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swelling of tissue due to excess fluid, called lymphedema, is a common side effect of breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment that requires lifelong treatment but in what way the treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer affects the lymphatic vasculature is not yet fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to examine the baseline lymphatic function and anatomy in&#xD;
      women who have undergone and completed treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison will be made between:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treated arm and the untreated arm in the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treated arm in patients who did not develop lymphedema and the treated arm in&#xD;
           patients who did.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using an emerging technique, Near Infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF), and non-contrast&#xD;
      MRI it is now possible to examine the link between breast cancer treatment and the&#xD;
      development of lymphedema. This project will describe the impact of breast cancer treatment&#xD;
      on contractile function and morphological changes of the lymphatic vasculature in the upper&#xD;
      extremity in patients treated for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 28 patients treated for breast cancer who simultaneously&#xD;
      are enrolled in the Skagen 1 trial. The NIRF imaging and MRI will be performed after&#xD;
      completion of breast cancer treatment and no later than half a year after completion&#xD;
      treatment. All examinations will be made under similar conditions, on the same segment of&#xD;
      lymphatic vasculature, in the same room and bed and with patients in the supine position. The&#xD;
      estimated duration of each examination is approximately 3,5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival participants will receive three injections of ICG distally on each arm, two on&#xD;
      the dorsal side and one on the palmar side. Ten minutes after injection, the primary sequence&#xD;
      of the lymphatic vessels will be recorded, allowing for calculation of frequency and&#xD;
      velocity. Following, the pumping pressure of the lymphatic vessels will be estimated. After&#xD;
      completion of the NIRF examination, an MRI scan of the upper body and extremities will be&#xD;
      made, allowing for morphological evaluation of the lymphatic system in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By studying the lymphatic vessels in these patients, data may elucidate the characteristics&#xD;
      of the changes taking place and thus provide new insight for future studies and possibly&#xD;
      future treatments and ways to prevent or reduce the development of edema.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to examine the baseline lymphatic function and anatomy in&#xD;
      women who have undergone and completed treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison will be made between:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treated arm and the untreated arm in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treated arm in patients who did not develop lymphedema and the treated arm in&#xD;
           patients who did.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lymphatic vasculature is distributed around the entire body where it pumps excess&#xD;
      protein-rich fluid from the interstitial space back to the circulatory system. It does so&#xD;
      partly by intrinsic contraction of lymphatic smooth muscle cells in the lymphatic vessel wall&#xD;
      and partly by the forces applied to the lymphatic vessels by surrounding contracting muscles.&#xD;
      Lymphatic valves in the vessels prevent backflow of the fluid. Lymphedema occurs when the&#xD;
      lymphatic vasculature is unable to transport the lymphatic fluid out of an affected region.&#xD;
      (1) There are two types of lymphedema. The first is idiopathic lymphedema and consist of&#xD;
      lymphedema caused by genetic dysfunction or inherent anatomical abnormalities of the&#xD;
      lymphatic vasculature. The second type is called acquired lymphedema and is due to external&#xD;
      factors such as physical disruption, compression of lymphatic vessels, surgery or&#xD;
      radiotherapy. (2) The commonest reason for lymphedema in the western world is cancer&#xD;
      treatment. It is seen after treatment of several different cancer types such as gynecologic&#xD;
      cancer, melanoma, genitourinary cancer, head and neck cancers and particularly breast cancer&#xD;
      being the most frequent cancer type in women in Denmark. (3-7) More than one in five patients&#xD;
      surviving breast cancer experience lymphedema, however, estimates range from 13-65%.(8, 9)&#xD;
      Radiation therapy to the breast or to the axilla appears to increase the risk of lymphedema&#xD;
      significantly. (10-12) These patients experience a large number of severe consequences, both&#xD;
      physical and psychological, following development of lymphedema. These include decrease of&#xD;
      physical strength, range-of-motion and sense in the upper extremities. An increased feeling&#xD;
      of pain and heaviness is also experienced. Psychologically, these women experience anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, sexual dysfunction, reduced body confidence and a lowering of general quality of&#xD;
      life. (13-18) The current treatment of lymphedema consists primarily of complete decongestive&#xD;
      treatment (CDT), which combines different treatment approaches such as bandaging, compression&#xD;
      garments, manual lymphatic drainage, and exercise. Although the current treatment options can&#xD;
      help patients with lymphedema significantly, the patients still have to undergo a lifelong&#xD;
      treatment and cope with some of the complications previously mentioned. (19) In order to&#xD;
      secure a foundation for the development of curative or preventive treatments of lymphedema&#xD;
      developed due to breast cancer treatment, the impact of this oncological treatment on the&#xD;
      function and anatomy of the lymphatic vessels has to be understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 28 patients treated for breast cancer who simultaneously&#xD;
      are enrolled in the Skagen 1 trial. The NIRF imaging and MRI will be performed after&#xD;
      completion of breast cancer treatment and no later than half a year after completed&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information to the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women being candidates for the Skagen 1 Trial will be invited to participate in this&#xD;
      study by their oncologist. If the patient is interested contact information will be passed&#xD;
      along to the principal investigator. He and the participant will make an agreement of place&#xD;
      and time for the meeting to happen and the participant will be informed that she is requested&#xD;
      to participate in a health scientific research project. The participant is encouraged to&#xD;
      bring along an assessor to the information. The meeting takes place in a quiet and&#xD;
      undisturbed room affiliated with the Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery. Oral&#xD;
      as well as written information of the study are given to the participant and the procedures,&#xD;
      the risks and the gains of the study are carefully explained. If the patient is interested in&#xD;
      participating she will be asked to give her written consent. The patient will be told that&#xD;
      she should consider it before deciding and that her consent is not binding and can be&#xD;
      withdrawn at any time should she wish to do so. The study will be performed no earlier than&#xD;
      two weeks after the information is given. Therefore, they will have two weeks to consider&#xD;
      whether to participate or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the meeting the participant will be informed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If new information regarding risks, side effects or complications emerges.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If any changes to the research design is made that affects the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If new information regarding the health status of the participant emerges unless she has&#xD;
           asked to not be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Of the results obtained and their consequences regarding the participant in she wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the project is cancelled and the reason why.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using a novel lymphatic imaging technique, the Near Infrared Fluorescence imaging (NIRF),&#xD;
      and non-contrast MRI scans the function and the anatomy of the lymphatic vasculature can be&#xD;
      visualized and analyzed. These two imaging techniques have been shown to be superior to other&#xD;
      techniques in lymphedema imaging. (20) All examinations will be made under similar&#xD;
      conditions, on the same segment of lymphatic vasculature, in the same room and bed and with&#xD;
      patients in the supine position. The estimated duration of each examination is approximately&#xD;
      3,5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRF setup: This study will be using a custom-built setup previously used by the Department&#xD;
      of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery at Aarhus University Hospital (21, 22): A EM-CCD&#xD;
      camera (C9100-13 Hamatsu, Japan), with a Navitar lens (25mm f 0.95) and 835±15nm band-pass&#xD;
      filters on each side of the lens. The light source is a custom designed 785 nm 450 mW laser&#xD;
      (PowerTechnology, Arkansas, US). A 780±28nm band-pass filter is placed in front of the laser&#xD;
      to minimize light leakage. Indocyanine Green (ICG) will be used as a fluorophore, and a 0,1&#xD;
      mL injection of 0.025% ICG dissolved in saline, equivalent to a 25μg dose per injection, will&#xD;
      be given prior to commensal of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging: In this study, different tests will be made to measure&#xD;
      lymphatic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency and velocity: Contraction frequency and package velocity will be examined and&#xD;
      calculated using LabView. Contraction frequency will be defined as lymphatic contractions&#xD;
      generated per minute, and contraction package velocity as the velocity by which the lymph is&#xD;
      propelled forward following each contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pumping pressure: A highly accurate (±1mmHg) cuff system (Hokanson E20 rapid cuff inflator,&#xD;
      Hokanson AG101 air source) will be positioned around the proximal antebrachium, after having&#xD;
      manually emptied the lymph vessels proximally to the cuff. The cuff will then be inflated to&#xD;
      80 mmHg, and after every 5 minutes, the pressure will be lowered by 5 mmHg. Over time the&#xD;
      pressure of the lymphatic vessels will exceed that of the cuff, and lymph will pass through,&#xD;
      giving an estimate of the pressure within the lymphatic vessel. The cuff will be placed&#xD;
      identically during both examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging: MRI will be used to visualize the anatomy and the morphology of&#xD;
      the lymphatic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: The lymphatic anatomy of the neck, entire chest, abdomen, and arms will be imaged and&#xD;
      investigated with a 3 T MRI system (Siemens Skyra; Siemens Medical, Germany). MRI will&#xD;
      included a respiratory-gated (navigator) 3D fast spin-echo sequence with the following&#xD;
      parameters: matrix = 448 × 448, voxel size = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.8 mm3 FOV = 100 - 400 cm2,&#xD;
      repletion time = 2830 ms, echo time = 649 ms, flip angle = 125˚. This sequence will be&#xD;
      repeated sequentially for whole-body coverage using multiple phased-array coils, with each&#xD;
      coil covering a different body region, without coil repositioning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival participants will receive three injections of ICG distally on each arm, two on&#xD;
      the dorsal side and one on the palmar side. Ten minutes after injection, the primary sequence&#xD;
      of the lymphatic vessels will be recorded, allowing for calculation of frequency and&#xD;
      velocity. Following, the pumping pressure of the lymphatic vessels will be estimated as&#xD;
      described above. All NIRF sequences will be recorded of the same region of lymphatic vessels&#xD;
      and on both arms. After completion of the NIRF examination, an MRI scan of the upper body and&#xD;
      extremities will be made, allowing for morphological evaluation of the lymphatic system in&#xD;
      the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs used as a tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG (0.5mg/ml solution) will be injected intradermally distally on each arm, two on the&#xD;
      dorsal side and one on the palmar side for a total dose of 180μg. The Danish Health and&#xD;
      Medicines Authority have approved the use of ICG to visualize lymphatic vessels using near&#xD;
      infrared fluorescence in this study (reference number: LMST-2012025009). ICG green was FDA&#xD;
      approved in the 1950's and has safely been used in different clinical procedures&#xD;
      (ophthalmology, neurosurgery, hepatology and cardiology) ever since. In comparison to doses&#xD;
      used in these procedures, up to 2mg/kg, the dose administered in the investigator's study&#xD;
      (180μg) is considered small. ICG associates with albumin and as soon as it reaches the blood&#xD;
      stream it is taken up by the liver and secreted into the bile, resulting in a biological&#xD;
      half-life of 2-4 minutes in the blood. The only &quot;side-effect&quot; seen is a 4-5 mm green&#xD;
      discolouration of the skin at the injections sites, which will disappear in a couple of days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible side effects of ICG (ICG-pulsion, Nomeco A/S, Denmark) are severe allergic&#xD;
      reaction, which occurs very rarely (affects fewer than one in every 10,000 patients) and&#xD;
      local irritation of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with the symptoms of the allergic reaction, an increase of special white blood cells&#xD;
      associated with allergic reactions can occur (hypereosinophilia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of an allergic reaction is greater in patients with extremely serious kidney&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start September 1st, 2018 and terminate August 31st, 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical concerns Aside from the ICG injections and the discomfort of being inside an MRI&#xD;
      machine, no inconvenience will be applied to the participants. The participants will not&#xD;
      benefit from this study themselves other than knowing that they could contribute with&#xD;
      knowledge that might enable a possible future treatment. The gain of knowledge this study&#xD;
      provides outweighs the discomfort the participants may experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants participate on a voluntary basis with informed consent that can be withdrawn&#xD;
      at any time. The participant's integrity and privacy will be respected. The study is&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and Danish law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation to volunteers There will be no compensation to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published in an international&#xD;
      scientific journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiology behind the development of edema in breast cancer patients undergoing treatment&#xD;
      is still not clear, however, a possible part of the explanation could be a change in function&#xD;
      and/or anatomy of the lymphatic vessels after breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the treatment of lymphedema is unsatisfactory. It is often life long treatment and&#xD;
      invalidating for the quality of the patients life. If a change can be shown further studies&#xD;
      can clarify what part or parts of the treatments are responsible for the change. This could&#xD;
      be done by including patients before the start of treatment and then examine the patients&#xD;
      after surgery/chemotherapy and after radiotherapy subsequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By studying the lymphatic vessels in these patients, data may elucidate the characteristics&#xD;
      of the changes taking place and thus provide new insight for future treatments and ways to&#xD;
      prevent or reduce the development of edema.&#xD;
