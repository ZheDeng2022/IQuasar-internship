  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who are in a hospital with respiratory distress often have difficulty breathing,&#xD;
      have thick mucus, and may find it hard to eat normally. Sometimes physical therapy is used to&#xD;
      treat these children, but it is not entirely known which methods help the children's&#xD;
      condition. The aim of this study is to evaluate the most common physiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      method that is currently in use in Sweden for infants who are hospitalized with a lower&#xD;
      respiratory infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All children under 2 years of age who are admitted to the hospital for a respiratory&#xD;
      infection and who have previously been essentially healthy are asked to participate. The&#xD;
      infants will be randomized to 3 groups, 1 control group and 2 intervention groups. The&#xD;
      infants in the control group will receive the standard care at the clinic. In one&#xD;
      intervention group the parents will receive instructions how to vary their child body&#xD;
      position regularly, and in the other intervention group the child will receive physiotherapy&#xD;
      regularly and the parents will carry out some treatment. Further actions in the form of&#xD;
      inhalations or stimulation of deep breathing, will be used when needed. The children will be&#xD;
      observed following a structured observational protocol regularly throughout the hospital&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
