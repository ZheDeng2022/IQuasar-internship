      This study will aim to recruit at least 70 children who participated in the iMAP2 study whose&#xD;
      mothers received a pertussis vaccine in pregnancy as part of the iMAP2 trial and at least 15&#xD;
      children born to mothers who did not receive a pertussis vaccine in pregnancy. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be obtained prior to and one month after the routine preschool booster vaccination and&#xD;
      vaccine responses compared between children whose mothers received one of two pertussis&#xD;
      vaccines or no pertussis vaccine in pregnancy. Children will be vaccinated with the routine&#xD;
      booster vaccines by the study team on the same visit as the pre-vaccination bloods are taken.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, all pregnant women are offered a whooping cough-containing vaccine during&#xD;
      pregnancy. This protects newborn infants against whooping cough, but there have been some&#xD;
      concerns that this vaccination in pregnancy may affect the response to childhood&#xD;
      vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preceding study called immunising Mums Against Pertussis 2 (iMAP2) was conducted involving&#xD;
      pregnant women randomised to receive one of two different whooping cough-containing vaccines,&#xD;
      with a control group also recruited, and the antibody levels in their infants were measured&#xD;
      at age 2, 5 and 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, immunising Mums Against Pertussis 3 (iMAP3), is a follow up study of children who&#xD;
      participated in iMAP2, to investigate the sustained impact of whooping cough vaccination in&#xD;
      pregnancy on childhood vaccine responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the antibody levels in these children before and after the&#xD;
      routine pre-school booster (DTaP/IPV vaccination) vaccine. It will help the Department of&#xD;
      Health continue to ensure the best protection is offered to the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those eligible for the study are children who participated in the iMAP2 study who have&#xD;
      reached the age for pre-school booster vaccination (from age 3 years 4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will be approximately 4-6 weeks with two study visits. The first visit will&#xD;
      take place when the child is around 3 years and 4 months of age. After informed consent a&#xD;
      blood sample will be obtained followed by administration of the pre-school booster vaccine.&#xD;
      At the second visit another blood sample will be obtained. These blood tests will measure the&#xD;
      level of protective antibody against the components of the pre-school booster vaccine. Visits&#xD;
      will take place either in the child's home or at a suitable clinical setting within the study&#xD;
      team's sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be run by St. George's, University of London, in collaboration with St&#xD;
      George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford Vaccine Group and Bristol&#xD;
      Children's Vaccine Centre.&#xD;
