  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In industrialized nations diabetic retinopathy(DR) is the most frequent microvascular&#xD;
      complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of visual impairment and&#xD;
      blindness in the working-age population. The well-accepted strategy for prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of diabetic eye complications focused on confirmed diabetic retinopathy, diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema, cataract, etc, and there was no definitive therapy for preclinical central&#xD;
      visual acuity (CVA) impairment, mainly because of its unknown pathogenesis. In our previous&#xD;
      population-based study, the prevalence rate of early CVA impairment was as high as 9.1%, and&#xD;
      that obviously limits the effects of diabetic eye diseases prevention and early-stage&#xD;
      treatment strategy. Of note, the choriocapillaris is the only route for metabolic exchange in&#xD;
      the retina within the foveal avascular zone, it was speculated that early CVA impairment is&#xD;
      related to diabetic choroidopathy (DC). Recent research shows that the decreased macular&#xD;
      choriocapillaris vessel density (MCVD) in diabetic eye ,which indicating early ischemia, is&#xD;
      already present before diabetic macular edema can be observed; we have observed subfoveal&#xD;
      choroidal thickness (SFCT) decreased significantly in the early CVA impairment patients.&#xD;
      However, up til now, there was no epidemiology report on early CVA impairment in Chinese&#xD;
      diabetes population. In the present study, we plan to conduct a 10-year perspective cohort&#xD;
      observation of 2217 Chinese type 2 diabetic residents without diabetic retinopathy, diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema, cataract and other vision impairing diseases, trying to find out related&#xD;
      physical and biochemical risk factors. The results will facilitate discriminating high risk&#xD;
      groups of early CVA impairment in diabetic patients. In the same time, a quantitative&#xD;
      relationship between SFCT change, MCVD change and CVA change will be established. This study&#xD;
      will demonstrate the role of DC in the occurrence of preclinical CVA impairment, and provide&#xD;
      important theoretic evidence of blocking agents which target on DC.&#xD;
