      The purpose of this study is to document how often and how severe are the breathing&#xD;
      difficulties that patients suffer, while recovering on a general ward following a serious&#xD;
      operation&#xD;

      This is a prospective, 2-center, 2-phase pilot study of post-surgical adult patients on the&#xD;
      hospital ward at high risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular events. Phase I, 70&#xD;
      patients will be 1:1 randomly allocated to Capnostream 20p monitoring system or to PM1000N-RR&#xD;
      pulse oximeter monitoring system and the alarms of both devices will be silenced and the&#xD;
      screen information blinded, to establish a baseline for the incidence of respiratory events.&#xD;
      Phase II, 140 patients will be 1:1 randomly allocated to Capnostream 20p or to PM1000N-RR&#xD;
      monitoring but the screen information will be visible at the bedside and through the Vital&#xD;
      Sync™ remote patient monitoring system.&#xD;

          <description>ARISCAT Score is an accurate risk score for predicting high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery, calculated based on preoperative data such as on patient's age, preoperative SpO2, respiratory infection, anemia, surgery type and duration.&#xD;
An ARISCAT score of ≥ 26 indicates high or intermediate risk for postoperative pulmonary complications.&#xD;
Low risk: &lt;26, Intermediate risk: 26-44, High risk: ≥45 No theoretical minimum and maximum score exists; scores are calculated based on patient variables (listed above).</description>
