    <textblock>
      This first-in-human, Phase 1, single-center study will evaluate single ascending doses (SAD)&#xD;
      and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of RTA 1701 conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (SAD) of this&#xD;
      study will be conducted in approximately 56 healthy participants in up to 7 groups. Each&#xD;
      group will consist of up to 8 participants who will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a&#xD;
      single dose of RTA 1701 or placebo, respectively. Safety, tolerability, and available&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in each group will be assessed by the Safety Monitoring Committee prior to&#xD;
      dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (MAD) of this study will be conducted in approximately 30 healthy participants in up&#xD;
      to 3 groups and will commence after safety data for the highest dose in the SAD phase has&#xD;
      been evaluated. Each group will consist of up to 10 participants who will be randomized in a&#xD;
      4:1 ratio to receive 14 daily doses of RTA 1701 or placebo, respectively. Safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and available pharmacokinetics will be assessed in each dosing group prior to&#xD;
      dose escalation&#xD;
