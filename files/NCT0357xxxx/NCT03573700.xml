  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SJCAR19 is a research study seeking to evaluate the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#xD;
      cell therapy, a type of cellular therapy, for the treatment of pediatric, adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
      CAR therapy combines two of the body's basic disease fighters: antibodies and T Cells. For&#xD;
      this type of therapy, peripheral (circulating) immune cells are collected and then undergo a&#xD;
      manufacturing process to engineer them to more effectively kill cancer cells. The SJCAR19&#xD;
      product will be manufactured at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Good&#xD;
      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The largest dose of SJCAR19 that is safe to give,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How long SJCAR19 cells last in the body,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The side effects of SJCAR19, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether or not treatment with SJCAR19 is effective in treating people with refractory or&#xD;
           relapsed ALL.&#xD;

      SJCAR19 is a Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the use of SJCAR19 (CD19- specific CAR&#xD;
      engineered autologous T-cells) in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/ refractory CD19+ ALL. Treatment will include a single treatment course, with most&#xD;
      patients receiving a lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen of fludarabine/&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, followed by a single infusion of SJCAR19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol contains a 3-part consent process: 1) to proceed with autologous apheresis, 2)&#xD;
      to proceed with manufacturing of the SJCAR19 product, and 3) to receive treatment with the&#xD;
      SJCAR19 product (initially as Phase I, then proceeding to Phase II). The Phase I portion will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SJCAR19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II portion will evaluate the efficacy, and provide further safety evaluation, of&#xD;
      SJCAR19 in an expansion cohort at the MTD determined in the Phase I portion of the study.&#xD;
      Additionally, for both the Phase I/II portions of the study there are correlative studies&#xD;
      evaluating the biology of this treatment as well assessments into patient/caregiver&#xD;
      experiences with undergoing this treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in both the Phase I and Phase II portion of the study will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy (unless determined by PI that lymphodepletion is not necessary), followed by a single infusion of the patient-derived SJCAR19 cellular product. The most commonly used lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen will consist of the agents: Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide. They will also receive Mesna. Dosing of SJCAR19 on the Phase I study will follow a dose escalation schema, with dose changes based on dose-limiting toxicities. In the Phase II study, SJCAR19 dosing with follow the maximum tolerated dose, as determined in the Phase I portion.&#xD;

    <description>The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products). These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest.</description>
