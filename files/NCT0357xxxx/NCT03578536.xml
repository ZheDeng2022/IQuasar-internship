      Current protocols for therapy on a rehabilitation unit call for intensive rehabilitation&#xD;
      composed of high intensity, long duration therapy. Evidence from brain healing and animal&#xD;
      research, along with motor learning principles suggest that a treatment program composed of&#xD;
      short duration therapy sessions distributed throughout the day may provide better&#xD;
      rehabilitation outcomes for stroke patients. Such a program can be implemented using&#xD;
      constraint-induced therapy in which the Veteran is provided with opportunities to use the&#xD;
      affected limb while participating in a video game and completing complementary tasks in&#xD;
      therapy. Additionally, rehabilitation outcomes may improve if Veterans are provided with&#xD;
      regular opportunities to participate in gaming therapy at home after discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital rather than having to travel to a clinic or receive limited or no follow-up in rural&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will develop a therapeutic model that promotes use of the impaired arm and hand.&#xD;
      Researchers often call this type of therapy &quot;constraint induced therapy&quot;. In this study,&#xD;
      participants focus on using the impaired limb rather than the unaffected limb. A small group&#xD;
      of patients will participate in a question and answer session about preferences for&#xD;
      activities which make up transfer tasks. Up to twenty-four (24) Veterans inpatient with&#xD;
      hemiparesis due to stroke in the brain will be recruited from the Minneapolis VA Health Care&#xD;
      System. Study participants will only be able to play the game using the impaired limb.&#xD;
      Participants may also receive automated reminders to use the impaired arm throughout the day.&#xD;
      Gaming will occur in patient room and during occupational therapy. Participants will have the&#xD;
      option of being discharged with the gaming system for continued gameplay. Outcome measures&#xD;
      will include motor function tests that evaluate upper extremity function.&#xD;

      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two questions to be answered by this study are: 1) To what extent does game-based CI&#xD;
      therapy (with the Transfer Package) increase use of the more affected upper extremity from&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation through subacute follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) What is the clinical effectiveness of distributed gaming CI therapy for improving motor&#xD;
      function of the more affected upper extremity at 3 months post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constraint-Induced (CI) Movement therapy is arguably the best treatment paradigm to pilot&#xD;
      throughout the continuum of care because it is established as the most empirically-supported&#xD;
      intervention in subacute and chronic stroke and is more effective than standard care in acute&#xD;
      stroke when lower duration/intensity protocols are utilized. CI therapy has strong evidence&#xD;
      of increased effectiveness relative to standard care in the only positive&#xD;
      definitively-powered upper extremity trial. A limitation of the acute CI therapy literature&#xD;
      is that most studies omitted the most essential component of CI therapy: The Transfer Package&#xD;
      of behavioral techniques that promotes carry-over of training to daily activities. In absence&#xD;
      of the Transfer Package, everyday use of the weaker arm does not substantially improve and&#xD;
      structural brain plasticity and quality of life gains are not realized. Early studies also&#xD;
      show that any treatment advantage of CI therapy acutely is not maintained in follow-up,&#xD;
      suggesting that maintenance therapy post-discharge is likely essential for altering the&#xD;
      recovery trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will have a positive impact on the field of rehabilitation because it offers a&#xD;
      solution to the main barriers of delivering distributed empirically-based treatment within an&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation setting. By providing a paradigm for delivering distributed upper&#xD;
      extremity practice, the product of this work has the potential to improve post-stroke health&#xD;
      outcomes, lower-cost, and maintain the continuity of treatment from inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      to community care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will involve participatory action research methods to identify potential barriers&#xD;
      to implementation of this new intervention within the VA and to refine the treatment approach&#xD;
      to meet the needs of an inpatient population. A focus group will involve at least 3 patients&#xD;
      who are currently on the inpatient rehabilitation unit (or recently discharged), their&#xD;
      families, and occupational therapy/physical therapy (OT/PT)/recreational therapy staff. This&#xD;
      meeting will serve to finalize the treatment protocol for this study. Areas that will be&#xD;
      addressed will include the &quot;dosing&quot; schedule for the game-based intervention and needed&#xD;
      adaptations to the CI therapy Transfer Package techniques (described below) to promote&#xD;
      maximal carry-over from trained activities to everyday use of the weaker upper extremity. Any&#xD;
      needed modifications to the technology platform (e.g. data storage) will also be made to&#xD;
      comply with the VA's regulatory policies regarding adoption of new technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 stroke survivors with upper extremity hemiparesis will be enrolled. Participants&#xD;
      have the option of taking the gaming system home after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaming CI Therapy (Approximate Schedule)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 30 total inpatient hours OT/PT:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One 30-minute session to teach game play&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4.5 hours devoted to Transfer Package&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Remainder time spent in usual care activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 14 hours independent game play while inpatient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 18 hours independent game play following discharge (30 min, 3 times weekly) over and&#xD;
           above standard care (will be documented as covariate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Optional use of smart watch with biofeedback&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MVAMC). The&#xD;
      MVAMC is home to the Stroke Specialty Program (SSP), a Commission on Accreditation of&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) accredited program. The SSP tailors rehabilitation for&#xD;
      survivors of any stroke mechanism (hemorrhagic, occlusive, etc.) affecting any part of the&#xD;
      brain. Services can be adapted for survivors with cognitive challenges. The SSP has averaged&#xD;
      41 admissions in the past three years, though 2017 has projected admissions over 50.&#xD;
      Retrospective chart review demonstrates the primary diagnosis resulting from stroke to be&#xD;
      hemiplegia in approximately half of the admissions. Most patients (85%) are older than 60&#xD;
      years, predominantly Caucasian (85%) or African-American (10%) and male (98%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be patients enrolled in the MVAMC Stroke Specialty Program.&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be screened by study staff. A retrospective chart review will&#xD;
      be conducted to review outcomes of patients who underwent stroke rehabilitation at the&#xD;
      Minneapolis VA but did not receive the study intervention. These subjects will serve as a&#xD;
      retrospective control.&#xD;
