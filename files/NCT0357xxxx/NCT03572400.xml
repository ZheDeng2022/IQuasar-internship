      &lt;Research Hypothesis&gt; The dynamics of immune cells by CCRT/Durvalumab will be uncovered. The&#xD;
      combination of Durvalumab with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT/gemcitabine)) as neoaduvant&#xD;
      treatment in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is feasible and&#xD;
      efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Durvalumab with cytotoxic chemotherapy (gemcitabine) as an adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment is feasible and efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Objectives&gt; To assess the effect of Neoadjuvant CCRT with Gemcitabine/Durvalumab followed by&#xD;
      adjuvant Gemcitabine/Durvalumab in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 year-DFSR (disease-free survival rate) Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: 2 year-OSR (overall survival rate), disease-free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
           overall response rate (RECIST 1.1, ir response) after neoadjuvant CCRT, disease control&#xD;
           rateEORTC QLQ-C30, the number of immune cells (TIL, macrophage, etc) in resected&#xD;
           pancreatic tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: toxicity (CTCAE V), irAE,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate baseline measures and changes of immune systems and regulations by&#xD;
           neoadjuvant CCRT with gemcitabine/Durvalumab in peripheral blood and tumor tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect and store DNA from blood (according to ethical procedures) for future&#xD;
           exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie,&#xD;
           distribution, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to study treatments and or&#xD;
           susceptibility to disease (optional).&#xD;
