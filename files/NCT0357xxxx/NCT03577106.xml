      Investigators will test a novel intervention through experimental therapeutic approach using&#xD;
      fMRI-directed Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), a high frequency TMS paradigm, for&#xD;
      the treatment of severe, uncontrollable worry. While worry is a universal human experience,&#xD;
      severe and excessive worry has been recently linked to increased risk of stroke and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, increased risk of conversion to Alzheimer's disease as well as to&#xD;
      higher risk of all-cause mortality in midlife and late-life. Severe, uncontrollable worry has&#xD;
      been repeatedly associated with reduced quality of life and impaired functioning. Current&#xD;
      treatment choices (antidepressant/anxiolytic medications and psychotherapeutic interventions)&#xD;
      have been proven moderately efficacious in reducing anxiety/depression burden, but&#xD;
      ineffective in reducing worry severity, a phenomenon that may contribute to the high relapse&#xD;
      rates associated with mood and anxiety disorders. Our research indicated that worry severity&#xD;
      is associated with hyperactivation in specific regions such as orbital frontal cortex,&#xD;
      superior parietal gyrus, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. This pilot study will explore&#xD;
      the efficacy of targeting one of these regions with iTBS. Based on investigators' previous&#xD;
      results, the most accessible target is the right superior parietal gyrus (rSPG) - a region&#xD;
      that remained significantly associated with severe worry after controlling for effects of&#xD;
      comorbid depression or overall anxiety. As this region showed an increased in cerebrovascular&#xD;
      flow in association with worry severity, investigators will use iTBS (5x/week for 2 weeks) to&#xD;
      modulate cortical plasticity in this region and consequently, to reduce worry severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS during wakefulness has been shown to alter subsequent sleep [4], Further, changes in&#xD;
      sleep in response to TMS has been associated with how participants respond to the TMS as a&#xD;
      treatment [5]. Thus, the study will measure sleep throughout the protocol to determine&#xD;
      whether sleep changes as a function of TMS and whether sleep changes are associated with&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty percent of older adults in the community report severe worry. While worry is a&#xD;
      universal human experience, severe and excessive worry in older adults has been recently&#xD;
      linked to increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, increased risk of&#xD;
      conversion to Alzheimer's disease as well as to higher risk of all-cause mortality. As worry&#xD;
      is a transdiagnostic construct, it is present in several mood and anxiety disorders,&#xD;
      including major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Current treatment&#xD;
      choices in late-life (antidepressant/anxiolytic medications and psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions) have been proven moderately efficacious in reducing anxiety/depression burden,&#xD;
      but ineffective in reducing worry severity, a phenomenon that may contribute to the high&#xD;
      relapse rates associated with mood and anxiety disorders in the geriatric population. These&#xD;
      elements support the need for novel, experimental interventions specifically designed to&#xD;
      target the neural basis of severe worry in late-life. Through a pre-existing study (R01&#xD;
      MH108509), investigators focus on describing the behavior of canonical neural networks during&#xD;
      resting state and during worry induction in participants with low-to-high worry. The research&#xD;
      indicates that simple induction of worry activates a distinct set of regions&#xD;
      (caudate/thalamus, visual cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate). Given the universality and&#xD;
      potential evolutionary benefits of worry, investigators believe that the neural network&#xD;
      associated with worry induction supports a normal, physiologic experience. However, the&#xD;
      regions involved in maintaining worry (hippocampus, thalamus) as well as those associated&#xD;
      with severe worry (orbitofrontal cortex, superior parietal gyrus, amygdala, parahippocampal&#xD;
      gyrus) support a pathological phenomenon and may represent ideal targets for interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will test the engagement of therapeutic targets during TBS. Based on the&#xD;
      investigators' preliminary results, the most accessible and relevant target is the parietal&#xD;
      cortex - a region that in the investigators K 23 sample remained significantly associated&#xD;
      with severe worry after controlling for effects of comorbid depression or overall anxiety. As&#xD;
      parietal cortex cerebrovascular flow increased in association with worry severity, the&#xD;
      investigators will use inhibitory TBS [high frequency TMS at 1 Hz] to modulate cortical&#xD;
      plasticity and consequently reduce worry severity. To test target engagement, the research&#xD;
      team will use the in-scanner worry induction paradigm designed by Dr. Andreescu and her&#xD;
      mentors during her K23 award and currently use to probe worry induction in the R01 MH108509.&#xD;
      Given the exploratory nature of this proposal and based on our preliminary data, we will use&#xD;
      two measures of target engagement: 1) the relative decrease in BOLD signal in the parietal&#xD;
      cortex and 2) the relative decrease in rSPG-dACC functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe worry in late-life carries a significant health care risk. Worry is defined as a&#xD;
           complex affective and cognitive process, negative-affect laden, and relatively&#xD;
           uncontrollable [6]. While worry is a universal human experience that may confer an&#xD;
           evolutionary advantage by modifying threat-related decision-making, severe and excessive&#xD;
           worry has been recently linked to increased risk of conversion from mild cognitive&#xD;
           impairment to Alzheimer's disease [7], and with increased risk of stroke and other&#xD;
           cardiovascular events, after controlling for depression and vascular risk factors.&#xD;
           Severe worry is also associated with interruption in functioning and reduced quality of&#xD;
           life and with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in midlife and late-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severe worry in late-life responds poorly to traditional interventions. Traditionally,&#xD;
           severe worry has been confined to categories such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)&#xD;
           and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), multiple lines of research support the presence of&#xD;
           severe worry in other several other anxiety and mood disorders. Thus, while GAD is built&#xD;
           around the concept of severe, uncontrollable worry, only 20% of severe older worriers&#xD;
           qualify for a GAD diagnosis. This evidence supports a major recent shift in the&#xD;
           conceptualization of worry as a transdiagnostic entity most suitable for dimensional&#xD;
           investigations. Current late-life GAD treatment choices, including cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
           therapy (CBT) and antidepressant pharmacotherapy, have proven moderately efficacious in&#xD;
           reducing overall burden of anxiety but ineffective in reducing worry severity. The&#xD;
           ineffectiveness of current treatments in reducing worry severity may be at the root of&#xD;
           the chronic, relapsing course of late-life GAD, which is one of the least likely mental&#xD;
           disorders to remit and most likely to relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Novel circuit-based targets for intervention. Several neuroimaging studies have&#xD;
           investigated both activation and functional connectivity among various brain regions&#xD;
           involved in GAD - in adolescents and young adults. This research team has published&#xD;
           exclusively on the neural markers of GAD in older adult participants. Also, very few&#xD;
           studies used fMRI paradigms specifically tailored to induce worry or analyzed&#xD;
           specifically the effect of worry severity at rest or during task. The investigators'&#xD;
           current results point toward two different networks that may benefit from targeted&#xD;
           interventions: the one associated exclusively with severe worry&#xD;
           (amygdala-parahippocampus- rOFC- rSPG) and the one associated with maintenance/the&#xD;
           protracted quality of worry (insula-caudate/thalamus-amygdala-parahippocampus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators decided to target the network associated with worry severity due to both&#xD;
      the richer literature regarding the pernicious effect of severe worry on both public health&#xD;
      and treatment response but also due to accessibility for TMS of the rSPG. Overall, the worry&#xD;
      severity network seems to implicate excessive limbic/paralimbic activation potentially&#xD;
      amplified by the cognitive anticipation of the negative affective value of future events&#xD;
      processed through the OFC as well as probable attempts to cognitively control the arousal and&#xD;
      dysphoria through structures such as dACC and SPG. This speculation is in line with newer&#xD;
      interpretations of pathologic worry that suggest severe worriers both maintain arousal in&#xD;
      order to seek out potential solutions to the anxiogenic source while attempting to inhibit&#xD;
      representations of the potential bad outcomes.&#xD;
