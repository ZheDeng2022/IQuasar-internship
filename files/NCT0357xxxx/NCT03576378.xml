      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid neoplasm characterized by the presence of CD30-positive&#xD;
      Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells in a background of inflammatory cells. The majority of patients&#xD;
      with HL have a good outcome with first-line chemotherapy such as ABVD (doxorubicin,&#xD;
      bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) or BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, vincristine,procarbazine and prednisone) sometimes combined with radiation&#xD;
      therapy. However, the same lymphoma has different results in the older than 60 years-old&#xD;
      patients. This population of 60 years of age or older accounts for 20% of all HL cases. Age&#xD;
      at diagnosis is an independent adverse prognostic factor for HL. The poor outcome in this&#xD;
      group is due to both toxicity of chemo and radiotherapy resulting in higher treatment-related&#xD;
      mortality and insufficient dosing of the applied treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most clinical trials exclude older patients with HL because older patients have more&#xD;
      unfavorable risk profiles and the approaches to treat older patients with HL with intensive&#xD;
      regimens resulted in treatment associated mortality of up to 21%. More effective treatments&#xD;
      to get better results in this patient population are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2001 the problem about the need for effective treatments with acceptable toxicity for the&#xD;
      older patients with HL was discussed. After that different international groups accepted the&#xD;
      challenge of trial organization for older patients with HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phase 2 studies were developed with modified chemotherapy regimens. The first, BACOPP&#xD;
      (Bleomycin, doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone and procarbazine), was a&#xD;
      BEACOPP regimen modified, used in younger patients. In this study, 65 patients with early&#xD;
      unfavorable or advanced stage HL aged between 60 and 75 years were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty-five percent of patients achieved complete remission, 3% achieved partial remission,&#xD;
      and 7% developed progressive disease. Eighteen patients died (30%), including 7&#xD;
      treatment-associated deaths. This chemotherapy regimen although was effective, had an&#xD;
      important toxicity in this older HL patient population. The second trial was PVAG (regimen&#xD;
      composed of gemcitabine, prednisone, vincristine and adriamycin). The treatment was used in&#xD;
      elderly HL patients in early unfavorable and advanced stages. Fifty-nine patients were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study; 78% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) o CR uncertain; 3,4%&#xD;
      responded with partial response; 25% didn't achieve a response or relapsed. Seventeen deaths&#xD;
      were observed, but only 1 of them was secondary to treatment-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VEPEMB phase II study (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, procarbazine,&#xD;
      etoposide, mitoxantrone and bleomycin) was also developed. For VEPEMB study, 105 HL patients&#xD;
      over 65 years of age were treated, of which 48 were early stage (IA-IIA) HL patients and 57&#xD;
      were advanced stage (IIB-IV) HL patients. CR was achieved in 98% of early stage and 58% of&#xD;
      advanced stage HL patients. Five-year actuarial OS rate was 94% in early stage and 32% in&#xD;
      advanced stage HL patients. Two patients died during the treatment induction, but not related&#xD;
      to treatment toxicity In the United Kingdom, the VEPEMB treatment was adopted in the new&#xD;
      SHIELD (Study of Hodgkin in the Elderly Database) program, that was a prospective study made&#xD;
      up of two components: I.) a phase II trial with VEPEMB treatment and II.) a prospective&#xD;
      registration study of patients no treated as part of the VEPEMB study. One hundred and&#xD;
      seventy-five patients were enrolled in this program, 103 patients received VEPEMB treatment&#xD;
      and 72 patients received other therapies (ABVD regimen, CHOP, CLVPP regimen, etc). In this&#xD;
      study, 74% of CR in early stage and 61% of CR in advanced stage in older HL patients were&#xD;
      observed with the VEPEMB treatment. Three-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) were 81% and 74% respectively. Of patients achieving CR, 13% with early-stage&#xD;
      and 5% with advanced-stage disease progressed. The overall treatment-related mortality was&#xD;
      7%. VEPEMB has demonstrated minimal pulmonary toxicity in this study, (only 1 patient). This&#xD;
      therapeutic regimen provides adequate disease control in elderly patients with HL, with&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity and sustained remission in those who have a complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of three components:&#xD;
      a) the chimeric anti-CD30 antibody cAC10, b) Monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) and c) a&#xD;
      protease-cleavable linker that attaches MMAE to cAC10. Binding of BV to cells is followed by&#xD;
      internalization of the ADC and cleavage of the peptide linker by lysosomal enzymes, and&#xD;
      subsequent release of MMAE, an antimitotic agent, blocks the polymerization of tubulin,&#xD;
      resulting in G2/M phase growth arrest and apoptotic death in a way similar to taxanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, due to membrane permeability of MMAE, a possible cytotoxic effect on bystander&#xD;
      malignant cells and surrounding stroma may occur. In vivo, BV inhibits proliferation, induces&#xD;
      apoptosis and complete tumor regression in mouse xenograft models of both HL and anaplastic&#xD;
      large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with improved efficacy relative to the unconjugated antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Phase I trial was made in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30 positive lymphomas.&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin was administered every 3 weeks at doses escalating from 0,1 to 3,6 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Forty-five patients were treated in this study. Ninety-three percent of the patients had&#xD;
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for doses every 3 weeks was defined as 1,8mg/kg and the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities were febrile neutropenia, prostatitis. Objective responses were&#xD;
      observed in 17 patients including 11 CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pivotal open-label, single arm Phase II trial studied the efficacy and safety of BV in&#xD;
      patients with relapse or refractory HL after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). The&#xD;
      used dose was 1,8mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 16 infusions. One hundred&#xD;
      two patients were enrolled with a median age of 31 years. The ORR was 75% and 34% of patients&#xD;
      achieved a CR. The median duration of response was 6.7months and it increased up 20.5 months&#xD;
      for patients who achieved a CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurring in &gt;10% of all patients were&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (PN) (42%), nausea (35%), fatigue (34%), neutropenia (19%), diarrhea&#xD;
      (18%), pyrexia (14%), vomiting (13%), arthralgia (12%), pruritus (12%), myalgia (11%),&#xD;
      peripheral motor neuropathy (11%) and alopecia (10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of BV with ABVD and AVD chemotherapeutic regimens was investigated in a phase&#xD;
      I study in 51 untreated patients with HL. The maximum tolerated dose of BV combined with ABVD&#xD;
      or AVD was not reached and no DLT was observed up to 1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, an increased incidence of pulmonary toxicity was observed with the association with&#xD;
      bleomycin. Ninety-two percent of patients achieved CR which compares favorably with&#xD;
      historical controls. A phase 3 study comparing BV combined with AVD versus ABVD alone is&#xD;
      ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous phase I study of Younes of the combination of BV with ABVD or AVD&#xD;
      therapy, no dose-limiting toxicity were observed with 1.2 mg/Kg of BV, and the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose was not exceeded at 1.2 mg/Kg of BV combined with ABVD or AVD. Since the&#xD;
      combination of BV and EPEM has not been tested before a safety run in stage phase is added to&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;
