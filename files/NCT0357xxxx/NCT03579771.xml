  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel work before&#xD;
      surgery in treating participants with high-risk bile duct cancer in the liver (intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and&#xD;
      gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue&#xD;
      that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of therapeutic approach that includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      including gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine), cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel for&#xD;
      high-risk but technically resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and is completed with&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the radiological response rate to neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy according to&#xD;
      the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the R0 resection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine patient recurrence-free survival (RFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify patient overall survival (OS) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, cisplatin IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes, and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Participants with stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) then&#xD;
      undergo standard of care hepatectomy with portal lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 4 months for 3 years.&#xD;
