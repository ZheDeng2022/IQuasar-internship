  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the differential diagnosis and clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome with non-obstructive coronary arteries, to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between the structural and functional state of the heart and the clinical course&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 14% of patients with acute myocardial infarction do not have obstructive changes in the&#xD;
      coronary arteries according to invasive coronary angiography (defined as stenosis of &gt; 50% by&#xD;
      ESC Guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without&#xD;
      persistent ST-segment elevation, 2017). Elevation of highly sensitive Troponin I is a marker&#xD;
      of damage to cardiomyocytes, but it is not an underlying mechanism of myocardial damage.&#xD;
      Forty patients with acute coronary syndrome are planned to be enrolled in the non-randomized&#xD;
      open controlled study. On admission, patients will receive the standard treatment for ACS&#xD;
      with and without ST elevation. Within 24 hours, they will undergo diagnostic coronary&#xD;
      angiography. In case of nonstenotic atherosclerosis of coronary arteries (normal / stenosis &lt;&#xD;
      50%), patients are planned for cardiac contrast MRI, which will identify both ischemic and&#xD;
      non-ischemic causes of acute coronary syndrome; MSCT will be performed to study the coronary&#xD;
      arteries and the structure of atherosclerotic plaques; scintigraphy of the myocardium will be&#xD;
      performed to characterize the perfusion defect. The frequencies of carrying the genetic&#xD;
      alleles associated with the factors that predispose to thrombosis will be studied.&#xD;
      Significance of these alleles in the development of thrombosis in acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      will be identified. The profiles of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory response markers&#xD;
      will be determined. Significance of these profiles in the development of acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction in patients with non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis will be determined in&#xD;
      comparison with control group. At one-year follow up, structural and functional&#xD;
      characteristics of the heart will be studied again to assess dynamic changes in cardiac&#xD;
      state. At one-year follow up, repeated studies will be perform to dynamically assess the&#xD;
      structural and functional state of the heart.&#xD;
