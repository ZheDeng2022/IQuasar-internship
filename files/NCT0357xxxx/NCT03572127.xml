      Protein is vital for the preservation of health and optimal adaptation to training. However,&#xD;
      animal proteins come with a number of economic and environmental issues. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      investigators need to develop an evidence base for more sustainable dietary proteins to&#xD;
      support human nutrition. Mycoprotein is a non-animal protein produced by the continuous&#xD;
      fermentation of the fungus Fusarium Venenatum. Previously, in a mechanistic study, it was&#xD;
      determined that a single bolus of mycoprotein effectively supports muscle building in both&#xD;
      rested and exercised skeletal muscle, to a similar extent as what would be expected of animal&#xD;
      proteins. This suggests that similar adaptation of muscle tissue during training could be&#xD;
      achieved when protein is obtained from non-animal derived protein sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the effect of high non-animal vs animal based habitual protein&#xD;
      consumption on muscle protein metabolism and changes in muscle mass and function over a&#xD;
      longer period of time. Initially, the study will employ a stable isotope tracer to quantify&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis over a period of three days in healthy male and female volunteers.&#xD;
      During this time participants will consume a controlled vegan diet or an animal based diet,&#xD;
      with daily unilateral resistance exercise. The second phase of the study will employ a 10&#xD;
      week diet and resistance training intervention, with the majority of a participant's protein&#xD;
      either coming from animal or non-animal sources. This will determine the ability of a largely&#xD;
      non-animal derived diet to support augmentations in muscle size and strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, participants will undergo 6 muscle biopsies over the course of an 11 week period.&#xD;
      Initial biopsies will quantify muscle protein synthesis. Subsequent biopsies will&#xD;
      characterise the adaptive response to the effects of nutrition and exercise. MRI scans will&#xD;
      be employed to determine changes in muscle volume, and DXA scans will measure changes in body&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
