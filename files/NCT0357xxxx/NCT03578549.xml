  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess tooth health by using a pulse oximeter which measures&#xD;
      the blood flow within the tooth. This method is not currently being used in dentistry. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that if we can measure both sensation and blood flow in a tooth, we will be able&#xD;
      to better determine if the tooth is &quot;alive or dead&quot;. In the future, this method may help&#xD;
      determine which teeth are diseased and require dental treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vitality of the pulp is determined according to the health of the vascular supply not the&#xD;
      sensory fibers. Conventional subjective tooth assessments (percussion, palpation, cold, and&#xD;
      electrical pulp testing) and objective pulpal blood flow measurements will be used for teeth&#xD;
      that are planned for extraction and also up to 2-5 additional teeth in each participant. The&#xD;
      correlation between a single combined score from collective conventional subjective tooth&#xD;
      assessments and the objective pulse oximetry reading for selected teeth will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate if pulse oximeter measurements are a reliable marker for patient's reported&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, you must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must be a patient of the Oral Surgery Clinic at the University of Michigan School of&#xD;
             Dentistry&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must be scheduled for at least one tooth extraction at Oral Surgery Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be able to understand and willing to cooperate with all study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must be able to sign an IRB-approved written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must have at least two teeth with an intact crown, without any full metallic crown&#xD;
             coverage, and/or previous root canal treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have no history of spontaneous pain, and/or lingering pain to cold/hot in teeth&#xD;
             that are not going to be extracted on that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If one of the teeth mentioned in inclusion #6 is being extracted, be willing to give&#xD;
             your extracted tooth/teeth for further analysis to determine of the tooth is &quot;alive or&#xD;

            <description>To assess the ability of pulse oximeter to assess the presence of pulse in teeth and to correlate pulse oximeter readings with conventional pulp testing measures including cold test, electrical pulp test, percussion and palpation testings, pulse oximeter will be used with a special holding frame, for 15-30 seconds.&#xD;
Note: the reading will not affect clinical practice; it is simply to gather data to see if pulse oximetry can facilitate diagnostic practices in the future. Pulse Oximetry: Pulse Oximeter is being applied with a special holding tool to test the oximeter for its ability to measure pulpal blood flow, but no effect of the oximeter is being measured.</description>

          <title>Subjective Tooth Assessment: Number of Teeth With Normal and Abnormal Pulp</title>
          <description>Conventional subjective tooth assessments (percussion, palpation, cold, and electrical pulp testing) will be used for teeth that are planned for extraction and also upto 2-5 additional teeth in each participant. Pulp status is determined as &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot; according to the classification system from the American Academy of Endodontics.</description>

Pulse Oximetry: Pulse Oximeter is being applied with a special holding tool to test the oximeter for its ability to measure pulpal blood flow, but no effect of the oximeter is being measured. Thus, to that degree the use is observational rather than interventional.</description>
