      This study is undertaken to compare effectiveness of homoeopathic treatment versus integrated&#xD;
      approach of homoeopathy and yoga in the treatment of menstrual disorders in females with&#xD;
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex metabolic, endocrine and reproductive&#xD;
      disorder affecting approximately 5-10% of the female population in developed countries. The&#xD;
      developing countries like China and India, undergoing rapid nutritional transitions due to&#xD;
      westernised diets and lifestyle also indicate similar prevalence (9.13%). Its prevalence&#xD;
      among infertile women is 15%-20%. The aetiology of Polycystic ovarian syndrome remains&#xD;
      unclear; however, several studies have suggested that Polycystic ovarian syndrome is X-linked&#xD;
      dominant condition.Women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome have abnormalities in the&#xD;
      metabolism of androgens and oestrogen and in the control of androgen production. High serum&#xD;
      concentrations of androgenic hormones, such as testosterone, androstenedione, and&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), may be encountered in these patients. However,&#xD;
      individual variation is considerable, and a particular patient might have normal androgen&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome is also associated with peripheral insulin resistance and&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia, and obesity amplifies the degree of both abnormalities. Insulin resistance&#xD;
      in Polycystic ovarian syndrome can be secondary to a post binding defect in insulin receptor&#xD;
      signalling pathways, and elevated insulin levels may have gonadotropin-augmenting effects on&#xD;
      ovarian function. In addition, insulin resistance in Polycystic ovarian syndrome has been&#xD;
      associated with adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates lipid metabolism&#xD;
      and glucose levels. Both lean and obese women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome have lower&#xD;
      adiponectin levels than women without Polycystic ovarian syndrome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anovulation and elevated androgen level suggests that under the increased stimulatory&#xD;
      effect of luteinizing hormone (LH) secreted by the anterior pituitary, stimulation of the&#xD;
      ovarian theca cells is increased. In turn, these cells increase the production of androgens&#xD;
      (eg, testosterone, androstenedione). Because of a decreased level of follicle-stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (FSH) relative to LH, the ovarian granulosa cells cannot aromatize the androgens to&#xD;
      estrogens, which lead to decreased estrogen levels and consequent anovulation. Growth hormone&#xD;
      and insulin-like growth factor 1 may also augment the effect on ovarian functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical manifestation of Polycystic ovarian syndrome varies from a mild menstrual&#xD;
      disorder to severe disturbance of reproductive and metabolic functions. Women with Polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian syndrome are predisposed to type 2 diabetes or develop cardiovascular disease .&#xD;
      Factors implicated in the low fertility in these patients include anovulation, increased risk&#xD;
      of early miscarriage, and late obstetric complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic criteria of the syndrome were revised by the Rotterdam European Society for&#xD;
      Human Reproduction/American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), where the following&#xD;
      criteria were established: oligo/amenorrhea, clinical and biochemical signs of&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism, and sonographically confirmed Polycystic ovarian syndrome. . Diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria for Rotterdam diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the following three criteria are required:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oligo/Anovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperandrogenism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical (hirsutism or less commonly male pattern alopecia) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical (raised FAI or free testosterone)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound Other aetiologies must be excluded such as congenital&#xD;
           adrenal hyperplasia, androgen secreting tumours, Cushing syndrome, thyroid dysfunction&#xD;
           and hyperprolactinaemia Sonographic features of Polycystic ovarian syndrome include the&#xD;
           presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2-9 mm in diameter and/or&#xD;
           increased ovarian volume (&gt;10 mL). This is regardless of follicle distribution or&#xD;
           ovarian stromal echogenicity. One ovary fulfilling this definition is sufficient to&#xD;
           define Polycystic ovarian syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hirsutism is often classified in terms of the distribution and degree of hair growth, such as&#xD;
      through pictorial scales. The most widely recognized scoring method is the Ferriman-Gallwey&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ferriman-Gallwey scale for hirsutism. A score of 1 to 4 is given for nine areas of the&#xD;
      body. A total score less than 8 is considered normal, a score of 8 to 15 indicates mild&#xD;
      hirsutism, and a score greater than 15 indicates moderate or severe hirsutism. A score of 0&#xD;
      indicates absence of terminal hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Cochrane Database Systematic Review article, Treatment options for polycystic ovary&#xD;
      syndrome, It's mentioned about Alternative medicine and Polycystic ovarian syndrome.&#xD;
      Alternative medicine has been emerging as one of the commonly practiced medicines for&#xD;
      different health problems. Alternative medicines include many modalities, such as&#xD;
      kinesiology, herbalism, homeopathy, reflexology, acupressure, acupuncture, and massage&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homoeopathy can be defined as a system of drug therapeutics based on the law of&#xD;
      similars.Polycystic ovarian syndrome has a specific set of problems which need an&#xD;
      individualistic approach.The concept of individualization takes into consideration the total&#xD;
      response of the individual to unfavourable environment. This total response is seen through&#xD;
      signs and symptoms on three planes: emotional, intellectual and physical where the life force&#xD;
      manifests itself.The teachings of Dr Samuel Hahnemann(founder of homoeopathy)-that the human&#xD;
      being is a unit -mind, body and spirit and that these are so correlated as to act freely and&#xD;
      without any impediment when the vital principle, the spirit like force or dynamis is in&#xD;
      equilibrium; yet if this equilibrium of health be thrown out of balance by the dysfunction of&#xD;
      one member the whole is affected to a greater or less degree.Homoeopathy is the dominant&#xD;
      option to treat Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. Homoeopathic approach towards management of&#xD;
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome is constitutional taking into account the patient's physical&#xD;
      symptoms along with their mental and genetic makeup that individualizes the person. Early&#xD;
      intervention with Homoeopathy can assist in preventing further progress and hence&#xD;
      deterioration caused by Polycystic ovarian syndrome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homoeopathic constitutional treatment will help balance hyperactivity of the glands, regulate&#xD;
      hormonal balance, dissolve the cysts in the ovaries and force them to resume normal&#xD;
      functioning. Homoeopathic medicines will not upset the balance of endocrine secretions ,for&#xD;
      the similimum(indicated remedy) will fill the demands of the system in all its parts without&#xD;
      stimulating too much those organs which have maintained a relatively secure balance, in other&#xD;
      words our remedies affect directly the vital energy which in itself establishes equilibrium.&#xD;
      All the homoeopathic polycrest remedies (deep acting with a wide sphere of action) will yield&#xD;
      richly to our search for effective remedies in endocrine disorders.Hence, Homoeopathic&#xD;
      medicines can restore hormonal balance, normal ovulation, menstrual cycles, and also&#xD;
      eliminate the need for hormone therapies and surgery. This can significantly increase the&#xD;
      chances of conception. The different expressions of this disease can be managed effectively,&#xD;
      safely and gently with Homoeopathic remedies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homoeopathy works towards nature. All homeopathy medicines are proved in human beings. It is&#xD;
      very refined. It comforts modern living. The medicines have no negative side-effects. They&#xD;
      are safe, effective and easy to attain cure. By taking homoeopathy medicines, ovulation and&#xD;
      regular menses can be attained in a natural way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yogic life style, a form of holistic mind-body medicine, is known to reduce stress and&#xD;
      sympathetic tone. Recent randomized controlled trial found holistic yoga program for 12 weeks&#xD;
      to be significantly better than physical exercise in reducing Anti-Mullerian Hormone,&#xD;
      Luteinizing Hormone and Testosterone, Modified Ferriman and Gallway (mFG) score for hirsutism&#xD;
      and improving menstrual frequencies in Polycystic ovarian syndrome patients. Yoga not only&#xD;
      addresses the problems of Polycystic ovarian syndrome but is likely to prevent the long term&#xD;
      complications such as Cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following yogic practices are found to be useful in Polycystic ovarian syndrome :&#xD;
&#xD;
