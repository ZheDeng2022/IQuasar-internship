      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of a viscous and fermentable dietary fibre on&#xD;
      ad libitum eating in morbidly obese patients before and 6 month after Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass (RYGB) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to study the effect of a viscous and fermentable dietary fibre&#xD;
      on perceived appetite, the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), breath hydrogen (as&#xD;
      a marker of large intestinal fermentation), the secretion of gastrointestinal (GI) satiation&#xD;
      hormones and glycaemia in morbidly obese patients before and 6 month after RYGB surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome measure is macronutrient and food intake (grams and kcal eaten) at&#xD;
      the ad libitum buffet meal as well as time to complete the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are 1) Appetite ratings (validated visual analogue scales, VAS)&#xD;
      including hunger, fullness, thirst, desire to eat, and amount of food desired to eat. 2)&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations of SCFA (propionate, acetate, butyrate). 3) Breath hydrogen (as a&#xD;
      marker of large intestinal fermentation) 4) Plasma concentrations of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      hormones (ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY)&#xD;
      and potentially other, yet to be identified gut hormones). 4) Concentrations of plasma&#xD;
      insulin and glucagon and blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, single-blinded cross-over trial in 24 morbidly obese human subjects undergoing&#xD;
      RYGB (study A, n=12; study B, n=12). Study B also includes an additional pilot study in 6&#xD;
      morbidly obese patients before and 6 month after RYGB surgery. Thus, the total number of&#xD;
      subjects including the pilot study is 30.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. The only effective treatment option&#xD;
      currently available is bariatric surgery, with the gold standard procedure, the Roux-en-Y&#xD;
      gastric bypass (RYGB), resulting in dramatic and sustained excess weight loss of 60-75% and&#xD;
      often prompt amelioration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The unparalleled efficacy of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery in obesity treatment opens a completely new perspective for the development&#xD;
      of anti-obesity drugs, and suggests that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is of much more&#xD;
      importance in the control of eating and energy homeostasis than previously thought.Two key GI&#xD;
      mechanisms have been identified to inhibit eating: 1) gastric distention resulting in&#xD;
      activation of mechanoreceptors and neural gut brain signaling, and 2) small intestinal&#xD;
      nutrient sensing resulting in the secretion of satiation peptides such as CCK, GLP-1 and PYY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A completely novel implication of the importance of the GI tract in the control of eating and&#xD;
      body weight is the role of the large intestine and the gut microbiome as well as its&#xD;
      metabolic products.That the gut microbiome can have potent effects on eating and body weight&#xD;
      was first recognized in landmark experiments with germ-free mice that became obese when they&#xD;
      were inoculated with microbiota from obese mice or humans, while they remained lean when&#xD;
      microbiota was transplanted from lean mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanisms that link the gut microbiome to the control of eating and energy&#xD;
      homeostasis remain however, largely unexplored. One suggestion for obesity development is&#xD;
      that the 'obese' microbiome may have an increased capacity to extract energy from the same&#xD;
      diet as compared with a 'lean' microbiome. In fact, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) formed&#xD;
      through bacterial fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates can provide additional energy to&#xD;
      the host (about 10% of total energy from the diet). However, whether this is the main cause&#xD;
      for obesity development remains controversial because SCFA also stimulate the secretion of&#xD;
      leptin, GLP-1 and PYY and, thus, activate eating-inhibitory mechanisms. Because under&#xD;
      physiological conditions, a meal will take about 6 hours or longer (depending on meal&#xD;
      composition and inter-individual variability of intestinal transit) until it reaches the&#xD;
      large intestine so that fermentable meal components can be metabolized to SCFA, the&#xD;
      contribution of SCFA in acute eating-inhibitory effects has been questioned in humans.&#xD;
      Bariatric patients provide an ideal model to study this mechanism. Based on the anatomical&#xD;
      alterations during RYGB surgery resulting in a much faster nutrient transit to the large&#xD;
      intestine, it can be hypothesized that a more rapid and more pronounced production of SCFA&#xD;
      contributes to the marked acute eating-inhibitory effects as seen after surgery. In addition,&#xD;
      RYGB patients have a small stomach pouch about 2% of the size of a normal, un-operated&#xD;
      stomach resulting in early distention upon food ingestion. The effect of increased stomach&#xD;
      distention and its contribution to the overall effects on eating behavior and weight loss&#xD;
      have not been evaluated, to the best of our knowledge. Dietary fibres provide an ideal&#xD;
      nutritional intervention to study the underlying eating-inhibitory effects of RYGB surgery.&#xD;
      1) High viscous fibres such as oat beta glucan delay gastric emptying and, thus, may&#xD;
      contribute to the eating effect via an increase in gastric distention. 2) Non-viscous,&#xD;
      fermentable fibres such as inulin or fructo-oligossachides (FOS) are highly fermented into&#xD;
      SCFA in the large intestine upon ingestion, and thus may participate in the eating effect via&#xD;
      activation of SCFA receptors and release of satiation hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective in both study A and B is to evaluate the effect of a viscous and&#xD;
      fermentable dietary fibre on ad libitum eating in morbidly obese patients before and 6 month&#xD;
      after RYGB surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in the pilot study in study B, the primary objective is the time course of&#xD;
      fibre-induced large intestinal fermentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives in both study A and B are to study the effect of a viscous and&#xD;
      fermentable dietary fibre on perceived appetite, the production of SCFA, breath hydrogen (as&#xD;
      a marker of large intestinal fermentation), the secretion GI satiation hormones and glycaemia&#xD;
      in morbidly obese patients before and 6 month after RYGB surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome measure in both study A and B is macronutrient and food intake&#xD;
      (grams and kcal eaten) at the ad libitum buffet meal as well as time to complete the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in the pilot study in study B, the primary study outcome measure is breath&#xD;
      hydrogen and plasma SCFA concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures in both study A and B are 1) Appetite ratings (validated visual&#xD;
      analogue scales, VAS) including hunger, fullness, thirst, desire to eat, and amount of food&#xD;
      desired to eat. 2) Plasma concentrations of SCFA (propionate, acetate, butyrate). 3) Breath&#xD;
      hydrogen (as a marker of large intestinal fermentation) 4) Plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hormones (ghrelin, CCK, GLP-1, PYY and potentially other, yet to be&#xD;
      identified gut hormones). 4) Concentrations of plasma insulin and glucagon and blood glucose.&#xD;
