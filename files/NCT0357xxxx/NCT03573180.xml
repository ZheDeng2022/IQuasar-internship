    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of dental caries using CAST index among a&#xD;
      group of Egyptian children in primary dentition stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egyptian children aging from three to six years old attending the Outpatients' Clinic of both&#xD;
      of Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Misr University for Science and&#xD;
      Technology and the Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Cairo University will be examined using Caries Assessment Spectrum and Treatment&#xD;

      -  A custom made examination chart (Appendix 1) will be filled for each child including&#xD;
           date, name, age, address, gender, medical history and any previous dental treatment.&#xD;
           Parents' data includes: level of education and oral hygiene level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to performing dental examination, the child will be asked to rinse his mouth with&#xD;
           tap water and the teeth will be cleaned with cotton.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The examiner will carefully inspect all surfaces of the teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the primary teeth will be evaluated using CAST index as shown in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each child will be given two printed sheets translated into Arabic, of his diagnosed&#xD;
           caries status, the oral hygiene measures needed to inform the parents about the oral&#xD;
           health status and how to keep good oral health and to indicate the need for treatment&#xD;
           for children diagnosed with dental caries, and dietary bad habits that should be avoided&#xD;
           to prevent caries occurrence.&#xD;
