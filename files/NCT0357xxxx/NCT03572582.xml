      The IMMUTACE study evaluates the safety and the efficacy of the anti-programmed-death-1&#xD;
      antibody (anti-PD-1) nivolumab in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in&#xD;
      patients with multinodular, intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as first line&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal and prevalent cancers worldwide. The&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with HCC is dismal and the mortality rates are almost the same as the&#xD;
      incidence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used to act locally in the&#xD;
      intermediate disease stage and is the most common first-line treatment in patients with HCC.&#xD;
      Early randomized trials and more recent reviews and meta-analyses reported improved survival&#xD;
      rates of patients with unresectable lesions managed with TACE so that TACE has been accepted&#xD;
      as the standard treatment for intermediate stage disease. However, outcome of patients&#xD;
      treated with TACE in real-life cohorts is still very poor with median overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      of 20 months or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase the outcome of TACE, several trials have analyzed the combination of&#xD;
      TACE with sorafenib and other anti-angiogenic agents. However, none of the trials have&#xD;
      reported an improved overall survival for patients treated with the combination of TACE and&#xD;
      sorafenib. Early clinical data already support a safe combination of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition with TACE. Moreover, preliminary data from the CheckMate-040 trial strongly&#xD;
      suggest that nivolumab has clinical activity and is tolerable in patients with HCC, including&#xD;
      those with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TACE in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab in patients with intermediate stage HCC.&#xD;

All of the scales and single-item measures have a score range from 0 to 100. A high score shows a high response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.</description>
