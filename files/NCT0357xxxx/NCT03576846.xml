  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-blinded study will investigate the effects of Spinal Manipulative&#xD;
      Therapy on Heart Rate Variability and Pain Sensitivity in a population of patients with&#xD;
      recurrent and persistent neck pain. Alongside, the study will also develop a clinical test&#xD;
      for Conditioned Pain Modulation and investigate its predictive properties.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT) was thought to mechanically affect the&#xD;
      restoration of muscular and joint function, by normalising muscle tension and joint mobility.&#xD;
      However, recent research has suggested that SMT may be influencing the incoming/ascending&#xD;
      pain signals and/or the excitability of the central pain regulating mechanisms. People with&#xD;
      chronic neck/shoulder pain have been found to have a disturbance of the Autonomic Nervous&#xD;
      System (ANS). Little is known about the changes in the ANS and its relation to changes in&#xD;
      pain in a series of treatments conducted in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre randomized controlled clinical trial will be carried out in multimodal&#xD;
      primary care clinics where both physiotherapists and chiropractors are consulted for&#xD;
      musculoskeletal issues are selected to minimize selection bias from the patient's pre-desired&#xD;
      treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited among patients seeking care for persistent or recurrent Neck&#xD;
      pain (NP), either self-selected or through referrals from general practitioners in the local&#xD;
      areal. The aim is to study the effect of SMT and stretching exercises compared to stretching&#xD;
      exercises alone, two well-known interventions for NP, during a two-week treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the activity of the autonomic nervous system (Heart Rate Variability&#xD;
      (HRV), but also Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) will be measured. HRV and CPM will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline, prior to the third treatment and after the fourth treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective pain experience will be investigated by using two different instruments&#xD;
      accessing pain intensity and the affective quality of pain, asked at the assessments during&#xD;
      the two weeks of treatment and 2 months after the period of intervention ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly structured data collection procedures should provide reliable data to answer these&#xD;
      questions. The study utilizes normal clinical procedures, which should aid the&#xD;
      transferability of the results.&#xD;
