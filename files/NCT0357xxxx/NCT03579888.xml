  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of CD19 positive (+) specific&#xD;
      CAR-T cells in treating patients with CD19+ lymphoid malignancies, such as acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma. Sometimes researchers change the genetic material in the cells of a&#xD;
      patient's T cells using a process called gene transfer. Researchers then inject the changed&#xD;
      T-cells into the patient's body. Receiving the T-cell infusion may help to control the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of donor-derived genetically&#xD;
      modified, CD19-specific T cells expressing mbIL15 and HER1t using the Rapid Personalized&#xD;
      Manufacture (RPM) process (autologous CD19-CD8-CD28-CD3zeta-chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      [CAR]-mbIL15-HER1t T cells [CD19-mbIL15-CAR-T cells]) administered to patients with CD19+&#xD;
      advanced lymphoid malignancies who have previously received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT), including haploidentical HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of the RPM process. II. To determine the incidence and&#xD;
      grading of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine persistence of genetically modified T cells. IV. To determine if cetuximab&#xD;
      can control numbers of infused T cells. V. To screen for the development of host immune&#xD;
      responses against the transgenes (one or more of CAR, mbIL15, HER1t).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine cytokine profile of the patient with infused T cells. VII. To demonstrate&#xD;
      the homing ability of the infused T cells. VIII. To assess disease response after T-cell&#xD;
      infusion. IX. To assess progression-free and overall survival. X. To detect emergence of CD19&#xD;
      negative (neg) malignant B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19-CD8-CD28-CD3zeta-CAR-mbIL15-HER1t&#xD;
      T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on days -5, -4, and -3 in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive autologous CD19-CD8-CD28-CD3zeta-CAR-mbIL15-HER1t T cells&#xD;
      IV over 15-30 minutes on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 3 days after T-cell&#xD;
      infusion and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, then at 3, 6, and 12 months, then periodically&#xD;
      for up to 15 years.&#xD;
