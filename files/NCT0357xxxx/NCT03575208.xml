      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver. When the immune system tries to clear&#xD;
      hepatitis B, it damages the liver. Eventually, the immune system gets exhausted fighting the&#xD;
      virus. Researchers want to see if giving large doses of an antibody (HBIg) with the drug&#xD;
      peginterferon will boost the immune system in people with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe the effect of large doses of antibody against the hepatitis B surface antigen on&#xD;
      the immune response to the virus. To see if removing hepatitis B surface antigen from the&#xD;
      blood enhances the action of peginterferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with hepatitis B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened twice with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and&#xD;
      urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly put in one of two groups. All participants will get&#xD;
      peginterferon for 24 weeks. One group will first get HBIg for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the combination group will have a 4-day clinic stay. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeats of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of HBIg by IV over 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      These participants will get HBIg at the clinic up to 8 times over 12 weeks then start the&#xD;
      peginterferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get peginterferon for 24 weeks. They will get it by injection under the&#xD;
      skin once a week. They may do this themselves. They will keep a drug diary. They will have 5&#xD;
      visits to assess response and monitoring for safety..&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stopping the study drug, participants will have 4 follow-up visits over 36 weeks. They&#xD;
      will repeat screening tests and have 1 liver ultrasound.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 300 subjects with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative chronic hepatitis B who are&#xD;
      inactive carriers (specified as those with HBV DNA levels &lt;2,000 IU/mL over a 6-month period&#xD;
      with ALT levels &lt;1.5 X upper limit of normal and HBsAg level &lt;1500 IU/mL) will be screened&#xD;
      and 25 enrolled in a randomized trial of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) for 12 weeks&#xD;
      followed by peginterferon alfa for 24 weeks versus peginterferon alfa-2a alone for 24 weeks.&#xD;
      The focus of the study is to understand mechanistically what effect the removal of HBsAg will&#xD;
      have on the immune response and action of peginterferon alfa-2a. Chronic hepatitis B is&#xD;
      characterized by immune exhaustion, which is felt to be caused by ongoing exposure of immune&#xD;
      cells to high levels of viral antigens such as HBsAg. Presence of viral antigen results in&#xD;
      continuous immune cell stimulation leading to functional exhaustion and progressive loss of&#xD;
      immune function. In this study, we will attempt to achieve elimination of circulating HBsAg&#xD;
      from the blood of chronically infected patients by administering high doses of hepatitis B&#xD;
      immunoglobulin followed by peginterferon alfa-2a. A control arm consisting of peginterferon&#xD;
      alfa-2a alone will be included to allow for assessment of the effect of HBIg on response to&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2a. We will investigate whether this strategy will result in restoration&#xD;
      of and/or increase in innate immunity leading to HBsAg clearance and development of&#xD;
      long-lasting protective immunity. The proposed study will be conducted in three phases with&#xD;
      pre-specified stopping rules to ensure subjects are responding appropriately at the end of&#xD;
      each phase before moving to the next phase. The primary endpoints of the trial will be&#xD;
      restoration of HBV-specific adaptive immunity at two time points (the end of HBIg treatment&#xD;
      (week 12) and at the end of treatment (week 36) and increase in innate immune response to&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2a treatment and a secondary endpoint will be a greater than 0.5 log10&#xD;
      reduction in HBsAg level at the study end point (week 36).&#xD;
