  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or lateral hip pain, is associated with muscle&#xD;
      weakness, altered movement patterns and painful daily activities. The disability associated&#xD;
      with GTPS is comparable to end stage hip osteoarthritis, primarily affecting young and middle&#xD;
      aged women. Few non-operative treatments have demonstrated long-term lasting or satisfactory&#xD;
      results. For those who do improve, recurrence rates of pain and disability can be as high as&#xD;
      50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gluteal tendinopathy is the most common condition associated with a GTPS diagnosis. High&#xD;
      compressive loads of the gluteal tendons during common activities like walking,&#xD;
      stair-climbing, and running are the theorized mechanism for GTPS. These compressive loads are&#xD;
      exacerbated with postures and movement patterns that involve the lateral tilting of the&#xD;
      pelvis or movement of the thigh across the midline of the body. There is recent evidence that&#xD;
      load modification through education and exercise is superior to a corticosteroid injection&#xD;
      for reducing pain in these patients. However, it is unknown whether the possible effects of&#xD;
      the load modification program were due to exercise alone or the reduction in compressive&#xD;
      loads. As current physical therapy interventions for GTPS commonly incorporate high load&#xD;
      postures and exercise activities, there is an urgent need to compare outcomes of standard of&#xD;
      care physical therapy to load modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects of load modification education&#xD;
      on pain and function in individuals with GTPS. Participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either standard exercise education or load modification education. Both groups will complete&#xD;
      a series of questionnaires about their pain and function, and undergo a brief 2-dimensional&#xD;
      assessment of their posture and movement. Between follow-up sessions, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to respond to brief weekly online surveys to document their home program compliance,&#xD;
      pain, and function. It is hypothesized that the group of participants receiving load&#xD;
      modification will have the highest proportion of individuals with significant improvements in&#xD;
      pain and function, and will demonstrate improved posture and movement.&#xD;
