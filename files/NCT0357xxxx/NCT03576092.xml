      The objective of this study is to evaluate lung ultrasound as a tool in pregnant patients.&#xD;
      This tool has not been well studied in pregnancy but has the potential to detect pulmonary&#xD;
      edema in patients with preeclampsia before they become critically ill. In addition, the&#xD;
      presence of pulmonary edema is a criterion for the diagnosis for severe preeclampsia, and if&#xD;
      detected early, may change management and decrease morbidity in these patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that healthy pregnant women and women with preeclampsia in the&#xD;
      third trimester have normal lung ultrasound patterns in the absence of clinical signs or&#xD;
      symptoms of poor lung aeration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective cross-sectional study to compare pregnant patients&#xD;
      with and without a diagnosis of preeclampsia treated at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center&#xD;
      (LIJ) and North Shore University Hospital (NSUH) from August 2016 - May 2018. A cohort of&#xD;
      healthy gestational age-matched pregnant patients from 32 - 41 weeks without a diagnosis of&#xD;
      preeclampsia will serve as controls. Inclusion criteria include singleton pregnancies over 31&#xD;
      6/7 weeks gestational age treated at LIJ or NSUH. Exclusion criteria include age less than 18&#xD;
      years and refusal to participate in the study. Informed consent will be obtained for all&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of preeclampsia will be made based on standard criteria as outlined by the&#xD;
      American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). Interstitial edema will be defined as&#xD;
      an ultrasound finding of three or more B-lines in an interstitial space in two or more lung&#xD;
      regions. B-line dominant lung fields are suggestive of alveolar interstitial syndrome. The&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of pulmonary edema is based on findings including dyspnea, tachypnea,&#xD;
      tachycardia, hypoxemia (measured by non-invasive pulse oximeter), and diffuse crackles on&#xD;
      lung exam. The patient characteristics and ultrasound findings will be compared between the&#xD;
      cohort of preeclamptic patients and healthy controls. A secondary analysis will be performed&#xD;
      on the images that were obtained before and after magnesium sulfate therapy in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features to determine the effect on sonographic&#xD;
      findings. If a preeclamptic patient received a chest x-ray as part of her management plan&#xD;
      because of a clinical suspicion of pulmonary edema, the reported results will be collected&#xD;
      and compared to lung sonogram results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung sonography will be performed on a SonoSite portable ultrasound machine with a C60e 5 - 2&#xD;
      MHx 30cm probe using a modified standard technique examining four lung regions; anterior&#xD;
      mid-clavicular high and low on left and right sides, and one on each side posteriorly) in the&#xD;
      semi-recumbent position. Still images and video clips will be reviewed by an expert in lung&#xD;
      ultrasound who is blinded to the patients' clinical information (Dr. Seth Koenig). Lung&#xD;
      sonography will be performed on two occasions for each preeclamptic patient who is treated&#xD;
      with magnesium sulfate; 1) at the time of diagnosis of preeclampsia, and 2) after completion&#xD;
      of magnesium sulfate bolus. Lung sonography will be performed on only one occasion for&#xD;
      gestational age-matched controls and for preeclamptic patients who are not treated with&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate. Patients will not be given a diagnosis of pulmonary edema nor will their&#xD;
      management plans be altered based on the results of the lung sonography performed for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and stored in RedCap. The investigators will collect data on patient&#xD;
      demographics, past medical and surgical history, blood pressure measurements at time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, results of routine lab values that are drawn for evaluation of preeclamptic&#xD;
      patients, and the review of four ultrasound examination regions to determine if they are&#xD;
      B-line dominant or A-line dominant. Descriptive statistics and appropriate comparison tests&#xD;
      will be used to analyze the data.&#xD;
