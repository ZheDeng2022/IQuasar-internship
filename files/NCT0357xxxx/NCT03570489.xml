      This is an open-label randomized controlled tria testing if an improvement in cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness can improve quality of Life and reduce seizure frequency in patients with refractory&#xD;
      epilepsy.. Before the intervention each subject will undergo an evaluation of baseline&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness. Patients will be randomized into two groups One group will listen to&#xD;
      a relaxation tape 5 days per week for 6 months and the other group will receive a ergometric&#xD;
      cycle and perform a predetermined level of exercise per day , 5 days per week for 6 months.&#xD;
      Randomization will be conducted an external randomization center based on a sequence of&#xD;
      random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AED) treatment during the study will be&#xD;
      minimized, and restricted to AED changes deemed to be necessary to address AED-related&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;

      Medical examination; body weight; fitness test, including ECG and BP measurements, seizure&#xD;
      frequency; adverse effects (unstructured interview); details of concomitant concomitant&#xD;
      treatment, mood assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS);&#xD;
      health related quality of life (RAND-36), E4-data downloading, will be done at baseline and&#xD;
      after 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Proportion of patients with at least 50% seizure reduction&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of a 6-month course of&#xD;
      standardized physical exercise, added on to pre-existing stable AED treatment, on seizure&#xD;
      frequency in patients with epilepsy aged 16 to 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the assessment of the effect of a 6-month course of standardized&#xD;
      physical exercise, added on to pre-existing stable AED treatment, on (i) depressive and&#xD;
      anxiety symptom scores; (2) health-related quality of life; (3) adverse&#xD;
&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label randomized controlled trial. Before the intervention each subject will undergo an&#xD;
      evaluation of cardiovascular fitness using the cycle ergometric test and his/her work level&#xD;
      ((Wmax/kg) transformed into a stanine (1-9) score. Patients will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups by applying a stratification procedure which will allow a similar proportion of&#xD;
      patients with high fitness (stanine score 5 to 9) and low fitness (stanine score 1 to 4) in&#xD;
      both groups. Randomization will be conducted by telephone through an external randomization&#xD;
      center based on a sequence of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the two randomized groups, one (Intervention group) will receive a course of standardized&#xD;
      physical exercise for at least 5 days per week while the other group (control group) will&#xD;
      randomize to listening to a computerized disc (CD) on muscular relaxation..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in concomitant AED treatment during the study will not be allowed unless for adverse&#xD;
      events related to the AEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients considered to be eligible for the study will undergo initially a 4-week prospective&#xD;
      baseline to ascertain baseline seizure frequency. After confirming their eligibility based on&#xD;
      seizure frequency recording, patients will be examined by a study physician and by a physical&#xD;
      therapist who will conduct an ergonomic test with a stationary bicycle under ECG and blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring to determine the level of cardiovascular fitness required for&#xD;
      stratification. Thereafter the patients will be randomized to the intervention and the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive a course of standardized physical exercise designed to&#xD;
      fulfill the Swedish recommendations (FYSS) on exercise for disease-prevention (150 min per&#xD;
      week of average intensity); at least 5 days per week for 6 months using a bicycle ergometer&#xD;
      for 30 minutes a day. An individually adjusted workload will be determined by the physical&#xD;
      therapist to achieve moderate intensity workout based on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2)max and&#xD;
      percentage of maximal heart rate. Patients in the other group (control group) will be&#xD;
      randomized to listen to a CD on muscular relaxation every day for 20 minutes and continue&#xD;
      with their usual lifestyle. At enrollment, subjects randomized to the intervention group will&#xD;
      be provided with a bicycle ergometer. requirements) as well parameters related to seizure&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following evaluations will be conducted at the times indicated, which correspond to&#xD;
      hospital visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time 0 (enrollment): Medical examination; body weight; fitness test (Ã…strand submax test,&#xD;
      which is a submaximal test of aerobic fitness.), including ECG and BP measurements, seizure&#xD;
      frequency (last 4 weeks); adverse effects (unstructured interview); details of concomitant&#xD;
      concomitant treatment, mood assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale-Anxiety (HADS); health related quality of life (RAND-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5: Seizure frequency (recorded daily on seizure calendars), adverse&#xD;
      effects (unstructured interview); body weight; details of concomitant treatment, E4-data&#xD;
      downloading, advice on exercise from physical therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 6: Medical examination; body weight; fitness test, including ECG and BP measurements,&#xD;
      seizure frequency; adverse effects (unstructured interview); details of concomitant&#xD;
      concomitant treatment, mood assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS); health related quality of life (RAND-36), E4-data&#xD;
      downloading,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any additional testing (e.g. EEG, laboratory tests) may be performed as considered clinically&#xD;
      indicated by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that 40% of patients in the intervention group vs. 20% of patients in the control&#xD;
      group have a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with baseline, 79&#xD;
      patients per group provide 80% power to identify a difference between groups at a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05. To account for potential dropouts, a total of 100 patients per&#xD;
      group will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be intent-to-treat (ITT) using &quot;The Last Observation Carried&#xD;
      Forward &quot; (LOCF) extrapolation when appropriate. Per-protocol analysis (PPT) will exclude&#xD;
      patients discontinuing prematurely the study and patients with less than 75% compliance with&#xD;
      exercise requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committees of Gothenburg in behalf of the&#xD;
      participating centers. Before the study, all patients will be informed about the objectives&#xD;
      and implications of the study, and will be asked to sign an informed consent form.&#xD;

    <description>Reduction in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) scores.The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3. A total score can be between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. A lower score indicates less depression or anxiety: a cut-off point of 8/21 indicates the presence of anxiety or depression</description>

The eight health concepts are: physical functioning, role limitations caused by physical health problems, role limitations caused by emotional problems, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, pain and general health perceptions. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In a second step, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>
