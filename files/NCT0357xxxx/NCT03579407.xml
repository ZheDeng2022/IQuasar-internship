  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability around the world. The aging population&#xD;
      is only further increasing its prevalence. Moreover, increasing rates of obesity, as well as&#xD;
      increasing athletic participation, is leading to patients developing OA at younger ages.&#xD;
      Although total joint replacement is effective for alleviating the effects of OA for many&#xD;
      patients, it is less beneficial for younger patients given the resultant reduced mobility and&#xD;
      the ~15 year life of a total joint replacement. Therefore, new options are needed for OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such option is bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection into the diseased joint.&#xD;
      Several recent studies have shown significant symptomatic improvement from this therapy. Now,&#xD;
      efforts are needed to better understand how to optimize this therapy, as numerous variables&#xD;
      are involved, including: the volume of aspirate, adjuvant, aspiration location or locations,&#xD;
      anesthetic, etc. Additionally, several FDA-approved needles are available for the aspiration&#xD;
      step. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare two different styles of FDA-approved&#xD;
      needles--an open-ended trocar vs. a fenestrated blunt trocar--with respect to clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, cell counts, and colony forming units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the comparison arms, taking these two groups together, this study will serve&#xD;
      as prospective case series of 30 patients undergoing BMAC injection for knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      without a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or any other adjuvant/carrier.&#xD;
