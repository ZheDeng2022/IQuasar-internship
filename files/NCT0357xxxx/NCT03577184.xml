    <textblock>
      Galvecta Plus is a combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride. Combination drug&#xD;
      with complementary mechanisms of action, provides efficacy and allows to reach glycemic&#xD;
      targets compared to continuing metformin monotherapy and is used as an oral hypoglycemic in&#xD;
      Type II diabetes mellitus that shows potential to achieve better blood glucose without&#xD;
      increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, exposing to weight gain and altering common&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and lipid profile). The fact that Vildagliptin with&#xD;
      metformin substantially enhances the incretin effect. Vildagliptin belongs to dipeptidyl&#xD;
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) by Vildagliptin&#xD;
      prevents degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and reduces glycaemia in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with low risk for hypoglycemia and no weight gain and&#xD;
      metformin is a Biguanides with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and&#xD;
      postprandial plasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not&#xD;
      produce hypoglycemia.&#xD;
