  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a lidocaine patch to ibuprofen in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pains. Half of the participants will get only ibuprofen for their pain, while&#xD;
      other half will receive lidocaine patch plus the ibuprofen. After addition of the pain&#xD;
      medications, the participants will be followed for their pain scores and return visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory pain medications have been traditionally&#xD;
      used for relief of mild to moderate acute musculoskeletal pains. However, if this medication&#xD;
      did not work, a different modality for pain control would be added to the original regimen.&#xD;
      In recent times, lidocaine patch has been introduced as a separate modality for pain control.&#xD;
      This medication is thought to help by selectively inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in&#xD;
      nociceptors involved in pain response. Given the separate modality, it would be prudent to&#xD;
      see whether the addition of lidocaine patch to the ibuprofen would help relieve the pain&#xD;
      moreso than the antiinflammatory-only regimen.&#xD;

A repeat pain intensity level will also be asked 48-72 hours after discharge. This measure will also examine change of baseline numerical score from initial visit. Each item is scored 0-10 (0=No pain, 10= Worst pain possible).</description>
