    <description>Part A: AsiDNA as a single agent:&#xD;
The study will follow a dose escalation &quot;3 + 3&quot; cohort design (with 6 dose levels).&#xD;
All patients will receive a loading dose of AsiDNA for 3 consecutive days as iv infusion at Day 1 (D1), Day 2 (D2) and Day 3 (D3), followed by iv infusion once a week (at D8 and D15 of a 21 days treatment period (1 cycle = 21 days). Each subsequent cycle will be administered on a weekly basis (D1, D8, D15) of a 21 days treatment period.&#xD;
Part B: AsiDNA combination with Carboplatin with or without Paclitaxel (Background treatments):&#xD;
Part B1: Combination cohort of AsiDNA at DL3 (600mg) with Carboplatin AUC 5.&#xD;
Part B2: Combination cohort of AsiDNA at DL3 (600mg) with Carboplatin AUC 5 and weekly Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m2 (full dose).</description>

    <description>All patients will receive a loading dose of AsiDNA iv infusion (D1, D2, D3) followed by weekly iv administrations.&#xD;
At cycle 1: Part B1: Carboplatin will be administered by a 1 hour IV infusion at D8, 1 hour after the end of AsiDNA infusion. Part B2: Carboplatin will be administered by a 1 hour IV infusion at D8, 1 hour after the end of AsiDNA infusion and Paclitaxel will be administered by a 1 hour IV infusion at D8, D15, D22 or 1 hour after the end of AsiDNA infusion for weekly administrations.&#xD;
At each other cycle: AsiDNA will be administered on a weekly basis. Part B1: Carboplatin will be administered by a 1 hour IV infusion at D1, 1 hour after the end of AsiDNA infusion. Part B2; Carboplatin will be administered by a 1 hour IV infusion at D1, 1 hour after the end of AsiDNA infusion and Paclitaxel will be administered on a weekly basis by a 1 hour IV infusion.&#xD;
Patients will continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal to continue.</description>
