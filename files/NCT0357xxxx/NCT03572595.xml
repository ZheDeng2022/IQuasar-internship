  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer death in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall relative 5-year survival is about 50%-60% but is highly dependent on disease&#xD;
      stage at the time of diagnosis ranging from approximately 80% to only 3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curative treatment comprises resection of the primary tumour combined with adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in selected patients. In recent years there has been an increasing role for&#xD;
      curative intended surgical or ablative intervention in limited metastatic disease, i.e.,&#xD;
      solitary or few metastases to the liver and/or the lungs. Accurate preoperative staging is of&#xD;
      paramount importance for directing the most appropriate therapeutic options, for indicating&#xD;
      prognosis and outcome, and to avoid futile operations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of imaging in the staging and restaging of colorectal cancers has been evolving and&#xD;
      improving in the last two decades. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accepted modality&#xD;
      for staging of rectal cancer, allowing an accurate identification of transmural invasion of&#xD;
      the mesorectal fat and mesorectal fascia involvement. Computed tomography (CT) significantly&#xD;
      lacks resolution of soft tissue contrast so that its utility in T staging of rectal cancer is&#xD;
      limited. Due to the higher sensitivity and specificity compared with CT,Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography/ Computed Tomography with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG PET/CT) is recommended&#xD;
      for use in a metastatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT are useful for staging and therapeutic management. Pelvic MRI&#xD;
      allows for accurate definition of the distance to mesorectal fascia which is a predictor of&#xD;
      the local recurrence rate, as well as for definition of the regional nodal status. 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT also helps in evaluating the nodal status and is especially performed for the&#xD;
      detection of distant metastases. MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT are thus 2 complementary modalities&#xD;
      for the initial staging of advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant therapies are performed for stage II and stage III rectal cancer. It has been&#xD;
      shown that neoadjuvant therapy decreases local recurrence and increases survival. Therefore,&#xD;
      correct preoperative staging has a critical role in determining whether patients should&#xD;
      undergo neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature on the clinical use of FDG-PET/CT in colorectal cancer staging is fairly&#xD;
      limited, but recent works have demonstrated some promise for optimizing the accuracy of&#xD;
      initial staging by clarifying equivocal findings on conventional imaging in preoperative&#xD;
      staging, and evaluating apparently limited metastatic disease before intervention .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was reported that the use of FDG-PET/CT in this study changed the planned treatment&#xD;
      strategy in a total of 30% of the patients. A change from palliative to curative or vice&#xD;
      versa was seen in almost 10% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT provides high accuracy for the detection and staging of liver lesions in CRC patients,&#xD;
      PET led to a change in patient management in an average of 24 % of patients, including both&#xD;
      exclusion from curative surgery and modification of the surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of local recurrence is substantial and correlates to the extension and grade of the&#xD;
      tumor and to the nodal status at initial presentation. The guidelines also highlight the&#xD;
      usefulness of PET/CT for restaging in the setting of a serially elevated carcinoembryonic&#xD;
      antigen level (CEA), negative results on conventional imaging, and potentially resectable&#xD;
      metachronous metastases documented by CT, MRI, or biopsy.It was reported that a high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting recurrent CRC, largely regardless&#xD;
      of CEA levels, as well as they concluded that 18F-FDG PET/CT have high diagnostic value and&#xD;
      can be used as the first choice in the detection of recurrent CRC in patients with&#xD;
      unexplained rising CEA, even in patients with a recent normal routine CT.&#xD;
