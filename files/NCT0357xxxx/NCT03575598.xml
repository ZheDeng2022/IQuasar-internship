    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, pre-operative window of opportunity&#xD;
      study for patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity who are&#xD;
      considered suitable for curative-intent surgical resection, with pre-operative Sitravatinib&#xD;
      and Nivolumab. A total of 12 patients who are evaluable for correlative studies, are planned&#xD;
      for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve treatment with Sitravatinib and Nivolumab, tests and procedures done&#xD;
      for safety and the collection of blood samples for biomarker research. Tissue samples (fresh&#xD;
      biopsy or archival tissue) will also be collected for biomarker research and evaluation.&#xD;
