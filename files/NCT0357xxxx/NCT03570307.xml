      Study Objective: To compare the time to new pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes in women who&#xD;
      received Misoprostol for uterus evacuation versus those treated surgically with dilatation&#xD;
      and curettage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Women to be admitted to the Lis maternity department for first trimester&#xD;
      failed pregnancy. Patients will choose between medical versus surgical management. Of this&#xD;
      group, women interested and successful in achieving a new pregnancy without first engaging in&#xD;
      birth control methods will be included in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Women with first trimester failed pregnancy (up until week 12 according&#xD;
      to LMP and up to CRL compatible with 11 gestational weeks) Exclusion Criteria: Women under&#xD;
      the age of 18 or over the age of 45, women who conceived via fertility treatments, women with&#xD;
      a molar pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: prospective study. Study Description: Women who visit the emergency department or&#xD;
      gynecology clinic with a first-trimester miscarriage will be questioned regarding their&#xD;
      subsequent family planning. In the event that the woman is interested in another pregnancy,&#xD;
      and is not planning to use birth control methods prior to conception, the use of folic acid&#xD;
      will be recommended, and she will receive an explanation of the research process. Women who&#xD;
      agree to participate in the study orally and who sign a written consent form will be included&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to six months following uterine evacuation, study participants will receive a telephone&#xD;
      call to assess whether they have conceived, and the case that they had not yet conceived,&#xD;
      will receive a follow-up call after an additional three to six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each woman who conceived, will receive a follow-up call to assess the details of the birth.&#xD;
      In the event that she did not give birth in the Lis Maternity Hospital, she will be asked to&#xD;
      fax a copy of the release letter she received from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Birth: Normal vaginal delivery, operative delivery, cesarean section. Birth details&#xD;
      will be collected via the automated system in Lis in the event that the birth took These&#xD;
      women will be included in the study and will be divided into two groups: surgical vs. medical&#xD;
      management. The study will include roughly 200 women in each of the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be clarified that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The researcher will confirm the identity of the participant at the outset of the&#xD;
           telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The researcher will request consent and introduce him or herself as a member of the&#xD;
           research team from the Lis Hospital. In the event of refusal to participant, the&#xD;
           research will apologize and terminate the telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Parameters: 1 .Demographic Parameters of the two groups - age, gravity, parity,&#xD;
      ethnicity, history of infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Comparison of the success of the surgical treatment versus medical management - in this&#xD;
      case, failure is defined as the need for subsequent surgical treatment. This will include&#xD;
      data on the percentage of women who received multiple doses of Misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. A comparison of the time (in months) until a new pregnancy is conceived (from the data of&#xD;
      the dilatation and curettage or the first dose of the Misoprostol) 4. Pregnancy Outcomes -&#xD;
      first trimester miscarriage, obstetric outcomes, early deliveries, pregnancy complications -&#xD;
      IUGR, placental abruption, pre-eclampsia, cesarean sections, neonatal outcomes. This data&#xD;
      will be collected in multiple telephone conversations - three months after conception and&#xD;
      following the delivery date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validation of details of pregnancies that ended in miscarriage - was the pregnancy&#xD;
           desired? Mode of conception (if fertility treatments - which?), months until conception,&#xD;
           gestational age at the time that a non-viable pregnancy was diagnosed, mode of pregnancy&#xD;
           termination. The details will be validated in relation to details in our automated&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At what month did the woman resume menstruation? Was an ultrasound performed to assess&#xD;
           uterine evacuation prior to a new pregnancy conception?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Details on pregnancy following dilatation and curettage - time to conception from&#xD;
           pregnancy termination, pregnancy outcomes, gestational age at birth (or miscarriage),&#xD;
           birth weight, Apgar scores, pH (if available).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data on fertility, age, obstetric history, time to conception of new pregnancies, need&#xD;
           for fertility treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of Anonymity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary researcher will be responsible for the removal of identifying data. After this&#xD;
      data has been removed, in the event that it is still necessary to complete data on the&#xD;
      participants, we will make contact with the participant and he will sign a telephone consent&#xD;
      form regarding this data completion. In the event that no data is mission and/or after the&#xD;
      data is completed through a telephone call, the identifying details will be removed in a way&#xD;
      that it will be impossible to replace them. And the telephone consent forms will be saved in&#xD;
      a cabinet that can be accessed only by the primary and secondary researchers.&#xD;
