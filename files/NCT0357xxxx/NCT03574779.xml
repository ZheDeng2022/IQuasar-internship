  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib is an orally available, potent, highly selective poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose&#xD;
      polymerase (PARP) 1 and PARP2 inhibitor. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      niraparib novel treatment combinations in participants with advanced, relapsed, high-grade&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel combinations of niraparib with other agents with&#xD;
      strong scientific rationale for synergistic activity in participants with recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. This study will consist of screening, treatment and end of treatment periods.&#xD;

             date of the last administered dose of platinum therapy to the date of the radiographic&#xD;
             imaging showing disease progression. Participants with primary platinum-refractory&#xD;
             disease as defined by those who progressed during or within 4 weeks of completion of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, might interfere with the&#xD;

             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not&#xD;
             considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             proteinuria on dipstick at baseline should undergo 24-hour urine collection and must&#xD;
             demonstrate &lt;2 gram of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
