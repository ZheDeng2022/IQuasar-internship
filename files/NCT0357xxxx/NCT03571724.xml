  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of switching from usual brand cigarettes to very low nicotine&#xD;
      cigarettes on cigarette consumption, smoking behavior, and biomarkers of exposure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very low nicotine (VLN) cigarettes contain a 'non-additive' level of nicotine. This study&#xD;
      will switch smokers from their usual brand to VLN cigarettes. Periodically during the study&#xD;
      the investigators will collect blood and measure nicotine exposure and also other biomarkers&#xD;
      to see what effect switching has. The participants will also use a diary to record number of&#xD;
      cigarettes smoked. Cigarette butts will also be collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Cigarettes Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed daily from Week -1 to Week 6; Week -1, Week 2, and Week 6 reported</time_frame>
    <description>Primary objective is to measure a change in cigarette consumption behavior before, during and after switching from usual brand to to VLN cigarettes. Subjects will record their cigarette consumption daily in an electronic diary. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).All 142 randomized subjects were included in the ITT population based on product use. Out of these, 71 subjects were included in the PP Population and 71 were excluded. All excluded subjects had a ratio of [plasma cotinine/CPD VLN]/[plasma cotinine/CPD baseline] &gt; 0.2. It was pre-specified to exclude participants with a ratio &gt;0.2 as they were considered non-compliant.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Effects - Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale - Revised (MNWS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>-1 week, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will answer a MNWS-R questionnaire. The MNWS is considered as the briefest scale among the self-report measures of nicotine withdrawal symptoms currently available. The original MNWS was developed by Hughes and Hatsukami in 1986. It consisted of nine nicotine withdrawal symptoms including craving. The scale was modified to reflect changes made in the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for nicotine withdrawal. The total score of the scale range from 0 to 36 depending on participant's rate for the symptoms as not present (0), slight (1), mild (2), moderate (3), and severe (4). A high total score implies high nicotine addiction. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>

The subjects indicated their perception of the risk of becoming addicted to the cigarette they were currently using on a scale from 1 to 10. Scale =1 was a very low risk of becoming addicted and Scale =10 was a very high risk of becoming addicted. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>

        <description>Primary objective is to measure a change in cigarette consumption behavior before, during and after switching from usual brand to to VLN cigarettes. Subjects will record their cigarette consumption daily in an electronic diary. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).All 142 randomized subjects were included in the ITT population based on product use. Out of these, 71 subjects were included in the PP Population and 71 were excluded. All excluded subjects had a ratio of [plasma cotinine/CPD VLN]/[plasma cotinine/CPD baseline] &gt; 0.2. It was pre-specified to exclude participants with a ratio &gt;0.2 as they were considered non-compliant.</description>

        <title>Smoking Topography - Puff Duration</title>
        <description>Puff duration will be measured before, during, and after switching to VLN cigarettes. Topography will be measured during an ad libitum smoking session. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>

Puff topography was conducted in a randomly-selected subset of 18 non-menthol and 18 menthol cigarette smokers at a single site.

        <title>Smoking Topography - Peak Puff Flow Rate</title>
        <description>Peak Puff Flow Rate will be measured before, during, and after switching to VLN cigarettes. Topography will be measured during an ad libitum smoking session. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>

Puff topography was conducted in a randomly-selected subset of 18 non-menthol and 18 menthol cigarette smokers at a single site. The randomly-selected subjects have been assigned to switch to smoking very low nicotine (VLN) cigarettes.</population>

        <title>Subjective Effects -Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependance (FTCD)</title>
        <description>Subjects will answer a Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependance (FTCD) questionnaire which contains six items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence.The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, is scored from 0 to 1 for yes/no items and 0 to 3 for multiple-choice items.The items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10. The higher the total Fagerström score, the greater the patient's physical dependence on nicotine. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>

        <description>Subjects will answer a Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief). QSU is on a scale of 1-7, with 1 being strongly disagree and 7 being strongly agree. The average score of the following is taken to determine the Factor Score 1 and Factor Score 2; Factor 1: Average of Questions 1, 3, 6, 7, and 10; Factor 2: Average of Questions 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. The score for each factor is calculated by summing the item scores; the total score is calculated by summing all questions together. The higher the score, the greater the urge to smoke. The total score range for this questionnaire is 10-70. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>

        <title>Subjective Effects - Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale - Revised (MNWS-R)</title>
        <description>Subjects will answer a MNWS-R questionnaire. The MNWS is considered as the briefest scale among the self-report measures of nicotine withdrawal symptoms currently available. The original MNWS was developed by Hughes and Hatsukami in 1986. It consisted of nine nicotine withdrawal symptoms including craving. The scale was modified to reflect changes made in the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for nicotine withdrawal. The total score of the scale range from 0 to 36 depending on participant's rate for the symptoms as not present (0), slight (1), mild (2), moderate (3), and severe (4). A high total score implies high nicotine addiction. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>

        <title>Subjective Effects - Perceived Health Risks</title>
        <description>Subjects will answer a Perceived health risks questionnaire. The subjects indicated their perception of the risk of becoming addicted to the cigarette they were currently using on a scale from 1 to 10. Scale =1 was a very low risk of becoming addicted and Scale =10 was a very high risk of becoming addicted. The baseline data were collected for participants at Week -1, and Week -1 data are reported per post-switch Arms/Group randomization (instead of pre-switch Arms/Group assignment).</description>
