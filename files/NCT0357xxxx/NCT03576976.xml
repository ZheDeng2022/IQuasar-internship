    <textblock>
      This project will explore adaptations of treatments for schizophrenia, with the goal of&#xD;
      optimizing their effectiveness in real-world clinical settings and readiness for broad&#xD;
      deployment. Schizophrenia is associated with cognitive deficits that negatively impact&#xD;
      essential areas of daily functioning. NY State Office of Mental Health (OMH) is the first and&#xD;
      largest state system of care to implement a statewide program of cognitive remediation (CR),&#xD;
      an evidence-based practice for improving cognition and aiding functional recovery. Through&#xD;
      Cognitive Remediation to Promote Recovery (CR2PR), CR is now offered in outpatient programs,&#xD;
      with plans to expand to more services and further adapt implementation to improve treatment&#xD;
      outcomes. This project will work directly with OMH clinics and clinicians to build upon and&#xD;
      improve current CR delivery methods. This project will study the impact of two adaptations.&#xD;
      One focuses on increasing the accessibility of the program, which participants report is&#xD;
      limited by the requirement of twice weekly attendance. This project will compare the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of delivering CR in either two clinic-based sessions (Clinic)&#xD;
      or one clinic and one remote session (Hybrid) per week. Qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with stakeholders to explore the impact of the adaptation. The second adaptation is&#xD;
      intended to improve personalization of CR by systematically accounting for individual&#xD;
      differences in neurocognitive needs. Drawing upon convergent evidence for tailoring CR based&#xD;
      on need for early auditory processing (EAP) training, this project examines whether&#xD;
      integrating a measure of EAP into the current baseline assessment facilitates personalization&#xD;
      of the menu of restorative computer-based exercises used in CR. Feasibility parameters and&#xD;
      qualitative/quantitative data analyses of facilitators and barriers to Hybrid CR delivery&#xD;
      will together inform further treatment refinement and the design of a larger effectiveness&#xD;
      trial of Clinic versus Hybrid CR. This project will examine how EAP assessment is employed by&#xD;
      practitioners to personalize the CR treatment plan and examine if EAP improvement is&#xD;
      associated with cognitive outcomes in public practice CR settings. Finally cognitive,&#xD;
      functional, and service use outcomes in Hybrid versus Clinic CR will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive remediation (CR) is an evidence-based practice to treat the pervasive and&#xD;
      significant cognitive deficits that contribute to functional decline in schizophrenia. The&#xD;
      New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) has teamed with the Principal Investigator to be&#xD;
      the first, and largest state system of care to implement a statewide program of CR tied to&#xD;
      recovery programming. Through Cognitive Remediation to Promote Recovery (CR2PR), CR is now&#xD;
      offered in outpatient programs throughout the state, with plans to expand to more services&#xD;
      and further adapt implementation to improve treatment outcomes. To proceed systematically,&#xD;
      this project will work directly with CR2PR programs, guided by practice-based evidence&#xD;
      gathered during CR2PR to build upon and improve current CR delivery methods in two ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ongoing program evaluation indicates that the burden of attending clinic twice per week&#xD;
           for CR limits the number of people who enroll. This project will test the feasibility&#xD;
           and collect preliminary data on the effectiveness of personalized CR delivery that&#xD;
           involves one clinic visit and one remote session per week. Demonstrating the&#xD;
           effectiveness of incorporating remotely delivered CR would double the number of patients&#xD;
           who could access the OMH CR program and reduce treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current effect sizes for cognition and functional outcomes may remain limited if&#xD;
           personalization, mechanisms of action, and relevant targets are not better addressed.&#xD;
           Given evidence that early auditory information processing ability (EAP) works as a&#xD;
           neurobehavioral marker of need for sensory processing training, this study will test the&#xD;
           potential to use baseline EAP assessment to tailor CR, incorporating EAP with other&#xD;
           cognitive skills training as clinically indicated. The ultimate goal of integrating&#xD;
           scalable assessment practices to personalize CR is to improve recovery outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a repeated measures, randomized design. Eligible participants who are&#xD;
      referred to CR2PR will complete a routine baseline neurocognitive assessment with the&#xD;
      addition of a EAP measure, and will then be randomized to either all-clinic CR (Clinic) or&#xD;
      clinic+remote (Hybrid) CR. The Clinic research arm consists of 30 sessions delivered twice&#xD;
      weekly in a group format of up to 8 participants with rolling admission. The Hybrid condition&#xD;
      consists of 15 clinic sessions in the above format, and independent homework on cognitive&#xD;
      exercises for 60 minutes per week for 15 weeks using a laptop, PC or tablet available to&#xD;
      them. All clinic sessions consist of 45 minutes of working on 3-4 computerized exercises&#xD;
      selected by a clinician from a menu of web-based programs to improve the cognitive functions&#xD;
      identified as impaired on the assessment. Computer exercises are followed by 15 minute&#xD;
      manualized discussion groups based on the concept of &quot;Bridging&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete a treatment satisfaction survey and will be re-tested on&#xD;
      outcome measures approximately 1 week following end of treatment. Additional data on the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the Hybrid approach will be gathered through a qualitative&#xD;
      interview with participants at treatment endpoint.&#xD;
