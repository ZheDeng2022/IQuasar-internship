      The investigator will seek to determine the feasibility of wearable biometric sensors to&#xD;
      acquire high resolution biometric data, including heart rate and activity level (i.e. steps)&#xD;
      for patients undergoing radiation therapy and surgery, with or without postoperative&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active cancer treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy can cause side effects&#xD;
      or toxicities, which, if untreated, can lead to poorer quality of life, decreased patient&#xD;
      well-being, and worse clinical outcomes. Routine monitoring of patients while under active&#xD;
      treatment can entail the routine practice of clinic visits at regular intervals with the&#xD;
      acquisition of vital signs, routine laboratory testing, patient-reported outcome surveys, and&#xD;
      face-to-face interaction with their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the availability of commercially-available wearable fitness sensors has&#xD;
      allowed end-users to monitor their fitness progress and activity levels. These devices depend&#xD;
      on small sensors that can collect minute-to-minute data on heart rate and activity level that&#xD;
      may be transmitted to a smartphone or computer. Through this system, users can easily track&#xD;
      and monitor their fitness progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigator will seek to determine the feasibility of wearable biometric&#xD;
      sensors to acquire high resolution biometric data, including heart rate and activity level&#xD;
      (i.e. steps) for patients undergoing radiation therapy and surgery, with or without&#xD;
      postoperative radiotherapy. The investigator believe that changes in heart rate may predict&#xD;
      for increasing pain, dehydration, and stress in general. Moreover, changes in daily step&#xD;
      count are a surrogate for performance status on treatment, and the investigator will perform&#xD;
      a series of preliminary analyses to assess whether there is validity to this hypothesis. The&#xD;
      investigator hope to use biometric monitoring to identify patients at risk for adverse&#xD;
      outcomes, with the ultimate goal of intervening before these outcomes occur.&#xD;
