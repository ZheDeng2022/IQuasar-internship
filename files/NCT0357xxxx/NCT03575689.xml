  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septoplasty is one of the most performed surgeries in rhinology as a solo procedure, or in&#xD;
      combination with sinus surgery. The procedure for septoplasty and postoperative management&#xD;
      has evolved over time based on several studies that have been done. The current standard of&#xD;
      care in our centre is to conduct a septoplasty using quilting technique and apply Doyle&#xD;
      splints in both nostrils to stabilize the septum for 6 days. However these splints are&#xD;
      associated with morbidity in the post-op period. The quilting technique was developed to&#xD;
      prevent complications and stabilize the septum. This study examines the efficacy of these&#xD;
      splints in stabilizing the septum and preventing complications after septoplasty&#xD;

      1. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare the success rate of septoplasty in correcting the nasal septal deviation&#xD;
           (with regards to nasal obstruction and intranasal access) among patient who used Doyle&#xD;
           splints and those who did not. The investigators will also determine if patient's&#xD;
           quality of life in the postoperative period is affected by the use of Doyle splints or&#xD;
           not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Is there a significant difference in success rates of septoplasty in patients who used a&#xD;
           Doyle nasal splint when compared with patients who did not use the Doyle nasal splint?&#xD;
           Null hypothesis There is no significant difference in success rates of septoplasty in&#xD;
           patients who used a Doyle nasal splint when compared with patients who did not use the&#xD;
           Doyle nasal splint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently in most North American rhinology clinics, nasal splints are used after&#xD;
           septoplasty (using the quilting technique) to improve stability of the nasal septum. The&#xD;
           quilting technique in addition to reduction of other complications was developed to&#xD;
           improve septal stability after septoplasty. No study has been conducted to examine the&#xD;
           efficacy of using only the quilting method when compared to the current standard of care&#xD;
           which adds extra cost to the surgery. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
           quilting technique in improving stability of the nasal septum among patients using nasal&#xD;
           splints and those not on nasal splints after septoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A recent study (Objective usefulness of thin silastic septal splints after septal&#xD;
           surgery; i Jung, M.D., Kim, M.D. et al Am J Rhinol Allergy 25, 182-185, 2011) has shown&#xD;
           Insertion of a silastic septal splint after septal surgery should be accepted as a&#xD;
           routine procedure. Our study is aiming to show that quilting suture in x-shaped fashion&#xD;
           technique is as effective and safe as using them yet avoids the potential complication&#xD;
           of discomfort/pain/toxic shock syndrome etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The essence of this study is to show that using the quilting suture technique alone&#xD;
           without splints is as good as when used with splints. No other study has been done to&#xD;
           investigate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective To compare the success rate of septoplasty in correcting the nasal&#xD;
           septal deviation (with regards to nasal obstruction and intranasal access) among patient&#xD;
           who used Doyle splints and those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives To determine if patient's quality of life in the postoperative&#xD;
           period is affected by the use of Doyle splints or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Method&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a Single blind Randomized Control Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study population will be consecutive patients diagnosed with nasal septal deviation&#xD;
           and who are undergoing nasal septal surgery. It will be a single blind randomized&#xD;
           control trial. Allocation concealment will be ensured by the use of sequentially&#xD;
           numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. An assessor blinded to which patient is using Doyle&#xD;
           splints will assess the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consent will be obtained for this study prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding The study will be single-blinded study. The patients will be randomized into 2&#xD;
           arms/groups. An assessor blinded to which patient got the Doyle splints will assess the&#xD;
           primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There will be two possible scenarios resulting from randomization: All patients will&#xD;
           undergo septoplasty using quilting technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. The Doyle splint will be places in both nostrils of the patient after septoplasty.&#xD;
           The doyle splints will be removed 6 days after surgery as per standard of care. No other&#xD;
           procedures will be changed during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. No Doyle splints will be placed in the nostrils of the patient after septoplasty. All&#xD;
           standart of care visits will remain the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PI will be the blinded assessor. The choice of which patient gets a Doyle splint&#xD;
           will be randomized using the sealed envelope system mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The randomization will be balanced to ensure that both arms have patients with extensive&#xD;
           surgeries as well as isolated NSRs&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations Due to lack of data on failure rates of septoplasty in our centre,&#xD;
      an a priori sample size calculation was used to determine the number of participants required&#xD;
      to adequately compare the use of nasal splints. Given that this clinical trial is designed to&#xD;
      investigate equivalency between the use of nasal splints and the lack thereof, an equivalency&#xD;
      sample size calculation was performed. An equivalency limit of 5% was considered clinically&#xD;
      significant from consultation with our expert rhinologist. A previously conducted study&#xD;
      estimating failure and revision rates have estimated that the failure rate was 8%16. If there&#xD;
      is truly no difference between the use of splints or lack thereof, then 88 patients (44&#xD;
      patients per group) will be required to be 80% sure that the limits of a two-sided confidence&#xD;
      interval will exclude a difference in means of more than 5%. Accounting for dropout rates of&#xD;
      10%, a total of 96 patients (48 patients per group) will be required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Comparisons The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial will be to&#xD;
      compare the success rates of septoplasty in patents with and without use of nasal splints up&#xD;
      to 90 days post-surgery. Count and absolute percentages of rates will be reported. The&#xD;
      Chi-Squared test will be used to determine statistical significance between rates.&#xD;
      Probability values less than 5% (α=0.05) will be considered significant. Corresponding odds&#xD;
      ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary outcome measures (e.g. VAS, NOSE), results will be summated and considered&#xD;
      as continuous, numerical variables. Descriptive statistics using mean, median, standard&#xD;
      deviation and inter-quartile ranges will be reported. The unpaired two sample student t-tests&#xD;
      will be applied to investigate the difference between the means of the various outcome&#xD;
      measures. Probability values less than 5% (α =0.05) will also be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographics and clinical factors will be compared between each treatment group to&#xD;
      determine whether randomization yielded comparable groups. Multivariable logistic and linear&#xD;
      regression will be used to investigate the relationships in the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
