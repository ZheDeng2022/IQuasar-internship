    <textblock>
      One of the most commonly reported reasons for people not seeking hearing aids (HAs)&#xD;
      intervention is the high cost of HAs and the associated audiological fitting services.&#xD;
      Because HAs fitted using the audiologist-based service-delivery model (AUD model) are&#xD;
      unaffordable, more and more Americans purchase amplification devices via over-the-counter&#xD;
      service-delivery models (OTC models) to compensate for their impaired hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although OTC amplification devices are gaining popularity and are regarded as an important&#xD;
      option for promoting accessible and affordable hearing healthcare, it is unclear if they are&#xD;
      viable solutions for age-related hearing loss as OTC models exclude professional services.&#xD;
      Further, if there are outcome differences between AUD and OTC models, it is unknown if the&#xD;
      clinical improvement in outcomes will be offset by the improved value (outcome relative to&#xD;
      cost), or if it is possible to identify appropriate candidacy for each model to ensure&#xD;
      optimal patient care for all. Finally, no prior research has investigated if &quot;hybrid&quot;&#xD;
      service-delivery models, in which professionals provide streamlined services to fit OTC&#xD;
      amplification devices, offer affordable and quality amplification interventions as has been&#xD;
      recently advocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to characterize the differential effect of&#xD;
      service-delivery models on provision of amplification so that accessible and affordable&#xD;
      hearing healthcare can be facilitated. This project proposes to conduct research that would&#xD;
      provide new knowledge about the outcome, value, and candidacy of OTC, hybrid, and AUD models&#xD;
      and the effect of professional evaluation/selection services, patient-centered services, and&#xD;
      device-centered services on outcome and value. The proposed study will acquire this knowledge&#xD;
      through a two-site, double-blinded, randomized controlled field trial. The results obtained&#xD;
      will inform patients and hearing healthcare providers about what can be achieved with&#xD;
      different service-delivery models, and will help us develop guidelines to facilitate the&#xD;
      selection of the most appropriate and cost-effective intervention for a particular patient.&#xD;
      The significance of the proposed project from the public health point of view is that it will&#xD;
      facilitate not only accessible and affordable, but also quality, hearing healthcare.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss is a substantial national problem due to its high prevalence and&#xD;
      significant psychosocial consequences. However, the adoption rate of the primary intervention&#xD;
      of age-related hearing loss, i.e., hearing aids (HAs), is quite low (15-30%). One of the most&#xD;
      commonly reported reasons that people do not seek HA intervention is the high cost of devices&#xD;
      plus the costly professional (e.g., audiologist) fitting services. This type of&#xD;
      intervention-HAs fitted using the audiologist-based service-delivery model (AUD model)-is&#xD;
      considered to be the best practice for management of adults with hearing loss. Because the&#xD;
      AUD model is unaffordable for many Americans who need HAs (64%), there has been increased&#xD;
      advocacy for a variety of over-the-counter service-delivery models (OTC models). In 2010, 1.5&#xD;
      million Americans purchased amplification devices via OTC models to compensate for their&#xD;
      impaired hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the OTC models are gaining popularity and are regarded as an important option for&#xD;
      promoting accessible and affordable hearing healthcare, major questions remain unanswered.&#xD;
      Specifically, the OTC models proposed to date rely on assumptions that patients can&#xD;
      appropriately self-diagnose, self-select, self-fit and (in some cases) self-adjust&#xD;
      amplification. However, there is little data to support any of the underlying assumptions. A&#xD;
      recent study suggests that the AUD model yields better outcomes than the OTC models, but it&#xD;
      is unclear if a rigorous randomized controlled trial can replicate this result. Furthermore,&#xD;
      if there are outcome differences between AUD and OTC models, it is unknown if the clinical&#xD;
      improvement in outcomes will be offset by the improved value (outcome relative to cost), or&#xD;
      if it is possible to identify appropriate candidacy for each model to ensure optimal patient&#xD;
      care for all. Finally, no prior research has investigated if &quot;hybrid&quot; service-delivery&#xD;
      models, in which professionals provide streamlined services to fit OTC amplification devices,&#xD;
      offer affordable and quality amplification interventions as has been recently advocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to characterize the differential effect of&#xD;
      service-delivery models on provision of amplification so that accessible and affordable&#xD;
      hearing healthcare can be facilitated. The central hypothesis is that an OTC model or a&#xD;
      hybrid model is a viable solution for many, but not all, patients with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderately-severe age-related hearing loss. Since the optimal OTC model and the&#xD;
      definition of OTC amplification device is still in question, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      focus on the role of professional services in the provision of cost-effective amplification.&#xD;
      To answer the research questions, the investigators have designed procedures to implement an&#xD;
      OTC model, in which research participants will take the full initiative and responsibility&#xD;
      for learning and using amplification. The investigators then systematically add professional&#xD;
      patient-centered services (e.g., device orientation and counselling) to the OTC model to&#xD;
      create a hybrid model. Finally, the investigators add device-centered services (e.g., device&#xD;
      adjustment under the guidance of real-ear measures) to the hybrid model to create an AUD&#xD;
      model that serves as the control. The investigators will electronically configure HAs to&#xD;
      simulate OTC devices (e.g., fixed frequency response) and will use the same devices as HAs in&#xD;
      the AUD model. The investigators will conduct a two-site, randomized controlled study to&#xD;
      document the intervention outcomes of these four models using a test battery that consists of&#xD;
      behavioral and self-report measures. Several patient-centered variables, including degree and&#xD;
      configuration of hearing loss, cognitive functions, and personality will be measured and used&#xD;
      as candidacy predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine the outcome, value, and candidacy of the OTC model relative to the AUD&#xD;
      model. The OTC model excludes professional services and represents the simplest form of the&#xD;
      OTC model (referred to as the OTC model). The AUD model, in which professionals will use a&#xD;
      core set of best practices to fit entry-level HAs, likely represents the most cost-effective&#xD;
      AUD model (referred to as the AUD model). Based on the preliminary data, it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the OTC model will yield poorer outcomes than the AUD model. The value, which will be&#xD;
      compared using cost-effectiveness analysis, is less predictable because the model&#xD;
      hypothesized to yield better outcomes is more expensive. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that at least some patient-centered variables will be predictive of outcome&#xD;
      difference between the models and thus can be used to help decide which model a patient&#xD;
      should choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine the outcome, value, and candidacy of the hybrid model. The hybrid model&#xD;
      is the OTC-Plus model, in which professionals provide streamlined services to fit OTC&#xD;
      devices. It is hypothesized that the outcomes of the hybrid model will be poorer than the AUD&#xD;
      model but better than the OTC model. Because the investigators are proposing a total of three&#xD;
      levels of service (including no service), achieving this aim will also allow us to document&#xD;
      the effect of professional service on outcome and value. It is hypothesized that professional&#xD;
      services will contribute to outcomes, and that each increase in the level of professional&#xD;
      service will lead to an incremental improvement in outcomes. The value of each level of&#xD;
      service in the hybrid model is less predictable. It is also hypothesized that at least some&#xD;
      patient-centered variables will predict equal outcomes for some individuals across hybrid and&#xD;
      AUD models.&#xD;
