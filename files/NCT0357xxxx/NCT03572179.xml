      Statement of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Although there are many studies in the literature concerning methods of bonding of&#xD;
      mandibular retainers whether directly or indirectly, there is a very limited evidence&#xD;
      regarding their chair side time and bond failure. Also there are scarce data on fixed&#xD;
      mandibular retainers bonded using 3D printed positioning tray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of the comparator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ongoing study, direct bonding of mandibular fixed retainer will be the control group.&#xD;
      Thus, conducting a well-designed randomized clinical trial evaluating the chair side time and&#xD;
      bond failure of 3d printed positioning tray and direct bonding method of fixed mandibular&#xD;
      retainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and compare bond failure and chair side time by 3D printed positioning tray and&#xD;
      direct bonding method of mandibular fixed retainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The time needed for direct indirect bonding using 3D digital positioning tray of a&#xD;
           mandibular fixed retainer is shorter than the time needed for direct bonding, and (2)&#xD;
           there is no difference in failures between the 2 bonding methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Will the 3D digital positioning tray reduce chair side time, bond failure during&#xD;
           retainer placement in patient with need of fixed bonded mandibular retainer, when&#xD;
           compared to direct bonding method?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate chair side time and bond failure of 3D digital positioning tray during&#xD;
           mandibular retainer placement and direct bonding of mandibular retainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary objective To evaluate effect of 3D Digital positioning Tray on chair side time&#xD;
           Secondary outcome Immediate bond failure and bond failure during first 6 month of&#xD;
           placement of mandibular fixed retainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PICOTs format:&#xD;
&#xD;
           P: patient with the need of fixed bonded mandibular retainer after orthodontic treatment&#xD;
           I: 3D printed Digital positioning Tray for bonding mandibular retainer. C: conventional&#xD;
           direct bonding of mandibular retainer O: chair side time, immediate bond failure and&#xD;
           bond failure during first 6 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome Name,Measuring Tool and Measuring unit Primary is the Chair side Time measured&#xD;
           by Digital stopwatch in Seconds Immediate Bond Failure is the Number of Debonded&#xD;
           mandibular fixed retainer measured in Numerical value Bond failure during first 6 month&#xD;
           follow up by the Number of Debonded mandibular fixed retainer measured in Numerical&#xD;
           value&#xD;
&#xD;
           T: Immediate and T2: 6 month follow up S: Randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial Design This trial is designed as a parallel, randomized, controlled trial with&#xD;
           allocation ratio 1:1.It will be performed at the educational hospital of the Faculty of&#xD;
           Oral &amp; Dental Medicine, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Participants, Intervention and Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Source of patients: patients who finished their orthodontic treatment at the outpatient&#xD;
           clinic in Orthodontic department, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University,&#xD;
           Cairo government, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time: 2017-2018 The study will last for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Intervention Treatment Group After finishing orthodontic treatment, all patient will&#xD;
      receive a modified indirect technique for bonding fixed mandibular retainer and the key of&#xD;
      modification is the fabrication of 3D printed digital positioning tray for placement of&#xD;
      retainer with holes for composite pads for its direct application using 3 shape Ortho&#xD;
      analyser Software ® instead of conventional indirect retainer fabrication method The sample&#xD;
      selection and screening for inclusion of patients in clinical trial will be performed at all&#xD;
      patients at clinic of Orthodontic department, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning of impression and designing the digital tray Lower impression is taken for each&#xD;
      patient and the cast will be carefully scanned by desktop laser scanner for production of&#xD;
      digital cast, using 3 shape ortho analyser Software®, the tray will be designed Fabrication&#xD;
      and printing of the digital tray Using Dent1 3D printer® (Mogassam®, Greek campus, Cairo,&#xD;
      Egypt), the tray will be printed Clinical application of the digital tray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teeth to be bonded are polished and etched.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teeth isolation &amp; moisture control are achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dead Soft Stainless Steel wire is placed and adapted in its place in the digital tray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placement of the tray in the patient mouth on the prepared teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adhesive bond is applied to teeth and then curing of the adhesive bonding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3M ® composite (3M Unitek company , Monrovia, California, USA) is placed in the printed&#xD;
           tray holes and any excess composite will be removed and then light curing is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time will be recorded during this step&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of digital tray After insuring complete curing of the composite the digital tray is&#xD;
      then removed from patient mouth, Bond failure of composite pads will be checked in this step&#xD;
      and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group All patients of this group will follow conventional steps of direct bonding&#xD;
      procedure of fixed mandibular retainer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pumice and polish the lingual surface of teeth on which retainer is to be bonded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The retainer wire is prefabricated by incorporating perpendicular pieces of 1.5&quot;-2&quot;&#xD;
           ligature wire at interdental region of respective teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The retainer wire is then adapted on the tooth surface. The short ligatures are passed&#xD;
           interdentally one occlusal to contact point and other gingival to contact point and tied&#xD;
           over.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bonding procedure after etching and application of sealant is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enough adhesive should be used. Light curing is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3M ® composite (3M Unitek company, Monrovia, California, USA) is placed then light&#xD;
           curing is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cut the ligature wires and pull them laically to disengage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time will be recorded during this step&#xD;
&#xD;
      F) Sample Size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the sample is increased to a total size of 20 participants; 10 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G) Recruitment strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the orthodontic Department -&#xD;
           Cairo University&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consecutive sampling is done through screening of patients. This will continue until the&#xD;
           target population is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying and recruiting potential subjects is achieved through patient database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assignment of Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Sequence generation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be performed as 1:1 allocation. The sequence of the two groups will be done by&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers. This will be done by using Microsoft Office Excel 2013&#xD;
      sheet&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Allocation Concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random numbers obtained by random sequence generation will be written on white papers, each&#xD;
      paper will be kept in sealed envelope. Sealed envelopes will be kept in box at the secretary&#xD;
      of orthodontic department office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation will be carried out in the secretary of the orthodontic department at the&#xD;
      Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Patients can detect the transfer tray so blinding is not possible Operator The&#xD;
      main operator is responsible for the bonding so the blinding is not possible Assessor The&#xD;
      assessor (different from main operator will carry out the measurement blindly&#xD;
