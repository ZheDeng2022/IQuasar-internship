  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The group of patients diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasing and so is&#xD;
      the need for new and effective treatment methods. ASD is characterized, among other things,&#xD;
      by difficulties in social interaction and communication. These difficulties often affects&#xD;
      their quality of life and causes a risk of developing social anxiety or other forms of mental&#xD;
      illness, which often leads to isolation and may cause difficulties in participating in&#xD;
      regular face- to- face psychological treatment. Although research shows that group therapy is&#xD;
      favorable for this group of patients, many with ASD refrain from group-treatment due to&#xD;
      social anxiety or difficulties with public transport. In order to increase the availability&#xD;
      of evidence based psychological treatment for these patients, it seems important to be able&#xD;
      to offer a web-based treatment option, with the ability to participate in online group&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether Internet-based CBT is an effective method of&#xD;
      raising the quality of life and improving the mental health of adults with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled study design will be used. Assessment will be conducted through video&#xD;
      interviews, recruiting 84 patients with ASD and normal intellectual abilities. Symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and other forms of psychopathology will be assessed through MINI-7 interviews.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are quality of life and symptoms of depression and anxiety.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group receives a 37 session blended treatment combining&#xD;
      individual ICBT delivered through a treatment platform called Stöd och Behandling (SOB) with&#xD;
      the opportunity to participate in regular group discussions delivered through a discussion&#xD;
      forum online. Participants in the control groups are offered self-studies through psycho&#xD;
      educative books about ASD. Data will be collected at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment&#xD;
      and after six and 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by significant difficulties in&#xD;
      social interaction and communication as well as routine boundaries and constraints in&#xD;
      behavioral patterns. People with ASD have difficulties in the ability to mentalize, i.e.&#xD;
      difficulties in understanding how another person feels and thinks. Another characteristic of&#xD;
      persons with ASD is that they are detailed in their way of processing information and&#xD;
      therefore have difficulties in generalizing and managing changes in everyday life. Lacking in&#xD;
      planning, organizing, evaluating and adjusting their behaviors can lead to extensive needs of&#xD;
      support. About 40% of adult patients with ASD exhibit depressive symptoms. Different types of&#xD;
      anxiety disorders are also very common as well as obsessive compulsive disorder and eating&#xD;
      disorder. Many people experience constant stress and vigilance following efforts to behave&#xD;
      socially adequately and managing unpredictable situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the common belief that people with ASD are uninterested in others, they are in&#xD;
      fact often eager to fit in, acquire friends and engage in relationships. However, the&#xD;
      majority live alone. The uneven profile of strengths and weaknesses is often combined with&#xD;
      chronic stress and experience of failures and misunderstandings. In addition to having&#xD;
      difficulties in socializing, many also have difficulties in initiating and solving problems,&#xD;
      which contributes to unemployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological treatment Many people with ASD find it difficult to identify and express&#xD;
      feelings and thoughts, which is a common element in psychotherapeutic treatment. This can&#xD;
      hinder psychological treatment from progressing as expected. The goals of treatment are often&#xD;
      to increase the person's quality of life and ability to live an independent life, and a major&#xD;
      focus in treatment for children with ASD is on psycho education, cognitive interventions and&#xD;
      social skills. Treatment of adults with ASD is less explored. Experience from clinical&#xD;
      practice suggests that psychological interventions should be practical and focused on&#xD;
      behavioral change strategies, but to date, few treatments using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) have been scientifically evaluated for persons with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group format has been considered to have several benefits in psychological treatment for&#xD;
      adults with ASD. It offers an opportunity for participants to discover that they are not&#xD;
      alone in their quest to fit in socially. A group also provides the opportunity to reproduce&#xD;
      problematic social situations, provide behavioral feedback and enable exercises of skills in&#xD;
      a structured environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several studies, internet based psychological treatment has proven to be effective in&#xD;
      treating a variety of psychiatric diagnoses. Courses and information-based training materials&#xD;
      have been offered in some regions in Sweden, but only for children and adolescents with ASD.&#xD;
      Until now, no internet based cognitive behavioral treatment (ICBT) has been used for treating&#xD;
      adults with ASD. Since many with ASD have severe social anxiety or having difficulty with&#xD;
      travel, it seems important to be able to offer a web-based treatment option. This could&#xD;
      enable social interaction, learning and a sense of belonging, regardless of where they live&#xD;
      and the ability to leave the home as well as contributing to a more equal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier study Susanne Bejerot, a Swedish psychiatrist and psychotherapist with CBT focus,&#xD;
      has, together with colleagues, developed a new group based CBT manual (called ALMA) for&#xD;
      adults with ASD. The treatment aims to give participants a deep understanding of the&#xD;
      diagnosis and increase their quality of life. A randomized controlled study of this treatment&#xD;
      has been published in a reputable journal . Groups of 6-8 adults with ASD received the&#xD;
      intervention for a total of two semesters. The treatment significantly improved the quality&#xD;
      of life (Cohen's d = 0.43) and in a cumulative long-term follow-up (&gt; 8 months), it was found&#xD;
      that the improvement was lasting. In addition, 88% of the participants gained increased&#xD;
      self-understanding, higher self-acceptance (72%) and increased well-being (67%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study originates from the above-mentioned ALMA treatment. The CBT based material&#xD;
      used in ALMA will be transformed and adapted to an internet-based format. The effects of the&#xD;
      internet-based version will be evaluated using the same population as in the ALMA study -&#xD;
      i.e. adults with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of the study is to investigate whether Internet-based CBT is an effective&#xD;
      method of raising the quality of life and improving the mental health of adults with ASD.&#xD;
      Whether the occurrence of schizotypal personality traits predicts outcome or dropout will&#xD;
      also be investigated. Since internet based treatment is relatively unexplored for patients&#xD;
      with ASD, the research Group will also investigate the patients' subjective experience of&#xD;
      such treatment, as well as systematically investigate what the written communication between&#xD;
      patient and therapists will contain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will adults with autism spectrum disorder follow an internet-based individual therapy&#xD;
           that includes the possibility of participating in group sessions online for two&#xD;
           semesters and, if so, will they experience it as meaningful?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will an internet-based treatment lead to a greater increase in quality of life compared&#xD;
           to an active control group, and will this difference remain at follow-up after 6 and 12&#xD;
           months?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will an internet-based treatment lead to decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety&#xD;
           and better knowledge of autism compared to an active control group and will this&#xD;
           differences remain at follow up?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Will the number of days in psychiatric inpatient care two years before and two years&#xD;
           after the intervention differ between the group receiving internet-based CBT and the&#xD;
           active control group?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How do participants experience internet-based treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What content does the written communication between therapists and participants have?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Will schizotypal personality traits predict dropout or outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and selection Randomized controlled treatment design with two conditions. The&#xD;
      experiment group receives internet-based individual treatment with the possibility of&#xD;
      participating in group discussions online. An active control group reads two books about ASD,&#xD;
      one describing ASD and the other are stories of individuals who themselves have ASD. 84&#xD;
      persons with ASD between 16 and 55 years will be recruited from all over the country (with&#xD;
      priority from Örebro and Uppsala regions). Exclusion criteria are ongoing psychotherapy with&#xD;
      CBT or social behavior training, serious mental illness, mental developmental disorder or&#xD;
      high risk of suicide. Additional exclusion criteria include inability to fill out forms and&#xD;
      answer questions on the internet, inability to read and understand the Swedish language, as&#xD;
      well as reported threatening behavior.Participants will either be randomized into the&#xD;
      intervention group or active control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Information about the project is given to personnel working with the patient&#xD;
      group in psychiatric and habilitation centers. Information will also be available in waiting&#xD;
      rooms of healthcare facilities, in social media and on websites for psychiatric and&#xD;
      autism-related associations, as well as through local press advertising. Information will&#xD;
      clearly indicate how to apply for interest to the study. Potential participants will&#xD;
      themselves submit an application of interest to participate via 1177.se, the website for&#xD;
      Swedish healthcare e-services. Assessment interviews will be conducted through video link and&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and other forms of psychopathology will be assessed through MINI-7&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group receive 36 modules of internet based CBT (ICBT). Theoretical base and tasks&#xD;
      in each module will be presented in text. Each participant has a personal therapist who&#xD;
      guides the participant throughout the treatment and provides support and feedback linked to&#xD;
      each completed module of the treatment. The modules contain the following themes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychoeducation - diagnostic criteria, symptoms, mentalization, perception etc&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social interaction - relations, communication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental health/illness - depression, anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Goal settings- individual goals, what can i change?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral change - problem solving strategies, energy prioritizing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life quality - food, sleep, physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress management - relaxation, mindfulness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Everyday strategies - facilitate everyday life, structure and organization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social and civil rights - housing support, job opportunities, law and ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions with group discussions will be held at a certain time every 3rd week. The&#xD;
      discussions revolve around specific questions linked to the theme of the current treatment&#xD;
      week. The discussions will be supervised and led by a therapist and are held through a closed&#xD;
      discussion forum online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group The control group is offered self-studies by reading the book &quot;What does the&#xD;
      disability mean ?: Living with autism / Asperger syndrome&quot;, as well as a book containing&#xD;
      biographical stories from people who themselves have ASD. The first book will be read during&#xD;
      the first half of the project, and the second will be in the second half.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Each potential participant will initially be asked to answer a questionnaire&#xD;
      online. The questionnaire includes questions about psychiatric symptoms, quality of life,&#xD;
      demographic variables, employment and knowledge about ASD etc. Information that verifies the&#xD;
      ASD diagnosis is obtained from the patients' medical record with the participant's consent.&#xD;
      An interview via video or telephone is conducted with all potential participants and they are&#xD;
      interviewed with a structured assessment tool for psychiatric diagnostics (M.I.N.I. version&#xD;
      7). Information about prior treatment will also be collected, as well as a summary of prior&#xD;
      amount of care utilization, in order to enable a health-economic analysis. A questionnaire&#xD;
      that focuses on the participant's level of knowledge about ASD is distributed before and&#xD;
      after treatment, to investigate whether participants have acquired knowledge of ASD during&#xD;
      the course of intervention. Information about the patient's expectations of treatment is&#xD;
      obtained before start. Data on patient satisfaction with treatment and possible side effects&#xD;
      are obtained after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation The experience of treatment for adults with ASD is very limited, and&#xD;
      therefore, there are quite few previous results to be based on when making assumptions about&#xD;
      the expected effect. However, a previous study of adult patients with ASD found an effect&#xD;
      size of d = 0.43 (SD = 1.68) on self-assessed quality of life, measured before and after CBT&#xD;
      in group. To get 80% power to find a difference of that size (given an alpha level of 0.05),&#xD;
      42 participants will be recruited. In the previous study (on site) there was a loss of 17%.&#xD;
      It is difficult to estimate how much the loss occurs when the treatment is administered&#xD;
      through internet, but if assumed that the loss is 50%, the intention is to include at least&#xD;
      84 participants in order to answer the scientific questions. The calculations are made using&#xD;
      the PS - Power and Sample Size Calculations software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Quality of life is measured by Brunnsviken Brief quality of Life questionnaire&#xD;
      (BBQ) and RAND-36 before and after the end of treatment and in a 6-month and one-year&#xD;
      follow-up. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is used to measure global mental health and its&#xD;
      change after treatment. EQ-5D and Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC) measure overall health and&#xD;
      experience of context. Depression and anxiety are measured with Hospital Anxiety Depression&#xD;
      Scale (HADS), schizotypic traits with SPQ and obsessive symptoms are assessed with BOCS.&#xD;
      Suicide thoughts are examined using one item in PHQ-9 in addition to structured questions&#xD;
      about suicidal thoughts included in the structured diagnostic interview material M.I.N.I.&#xD;
      (version 7.0.0). The self-assessment form RAADS - Ritvo Autism-Asperger's Diagnostic Scale is&#xD;
      used to measure autistic traits and the level of participant autism is evaluated by clinics&#xD;
      before and after the intervention. Participants expectations on the treatment are assessed at&#xD;
      the beginning. Expectations are measured with Patient Prognostic Expectancy Inventory and&#xD;
      PATHEV. Knowledge about autism is measured before, during and after treatment using Autism&#xD;
      Knowledge questionnaire, which is a questionnaire created for the project. Self-acceptance,&#xD;
      self-awareness, mood and ability to ask for help, as well as the extent of social contacts,&#xD;
      sickness absence, and occurrence of work / studies will be measured after the intervention&#xD;
      using a collection of follow-up questions compiled for a previous project. Satisfaction with&#xD;
      the treatment is measured with CSQ and negative side effects are measured through Negative&#xD;
      Effects questionnaire (NEQ) after the end of treatment.&#xD;
