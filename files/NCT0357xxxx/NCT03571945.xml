  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The profiling of bi-spectral index (BIS) monitored facilitation of general anesthesia (GA),&#xD;
      including, anesthesia induction and maintenance of GA depth state, emergence characteristics,&#xD;
      and postoperative recovery parameters, is now extensively available. However, majority of the&#xD;
      data supporting the use of BIS have emanated from western Caucasian patient population.&#xD;
      Though research on BIS monitoring have also emerged from Asian subcontinent, the data&#xD;
      generated, at the best, is too scattered, random, and non-homogenous to reflect onto how BIS&#xD;
      guidance fares in Asians on a population basis. We aim to undertake a multi-centric&#xD;
      prospective cohort trial in Asian patient population to analyze as to whether BIS guidance&#xD;
      toes the profiling and the evidence in Caucasians.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After Institutional Ethics Committee approval and informed written patient consent, 2000&#xD;
      patients justifying inclusion and exclusion criteria ( will be included in this National,&#xD;
      multi-centric, prospective, randomised, double-blind (patients, analyst), 2- arm trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia will be randomly&#xD;
      (simple computer generated random number table) allocated to one of the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I [BIS Guided Group, n=1000]: GA will be monitored and controlled with Bi-spectral&#xD;
      index (BIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II [ETAG Guided Group, n=1000]: GA will be monitored and controlled with end-tidal&#xD;
      anaesthesia gas concentration (ETAG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation To detect a difference in incidence of awareness of 0.04 % (a rate&#xD;
      based on Mashour et al, Anesthesiology 2012) between the ETAG and BIS-guided group a total of&#xD;
      1800 patients will be required at a power of 80% with a type-II error 0f 0.5. To compensate&#xD;
      for possible drop outs 10% additional patients will be recruited for the study. Therefore,&#xD;
      the total sample size will include 2000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization concealment: will be done using opaque sealed envelopes with alphabetic codes.&#xD;
      In addition, before opening the envelope patient's data slip will be pasted on the envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Investigator, assessor and the data analyst will be blinded to the method of GA&#xD;
      (BIS or ETAG guided) Subgroup Analysis: Subgroup analysis will be specifically performed and&#xD;
      reported if the data shows gender equivalence (i.e., at least 40% patients of either sex in&#xD;
      each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine monitoring (EtCO2, pulse oximetery, EKG, NIBP) will be applied during the procedure.&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be induced with fentanyl 2-mcg/kg and propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (vecuronium/ rocuronium/ atracurium) will be administered to&#xD;
      facilitate tracheal intubation. GA will be maintained with inhalation regimen&#xD;
      (sevoflurane/desflurane-oxygen-air mixture) to target age-related MAC range of 0.7 to 1.3.&#xD;
      Corresponding BIS score and end-tidal agent concentration will be noted at 5-minute interval.&#xD;
      While, in the BIS group the anaesthesiologist will be blinded to ETAG and MAC readings, in&#xD;
      the ETAG group BIS display will be turned off. However, ETAG and MAC data will both be&#xD;
      analyzed once the study is over. Although, the MAC will be titrated to haemodynamic goals&#xD;
      (+20% baseline of SBP/MAP/Heart rate), it will be maintained within the prescribed range. On&#xD;
      either side of the range of MAC, the haemodynamic depression/ activation will be responded to&#xD;
      with vasopressor/vasodilators. At the end of surgery inhalation agent delivery will be&#xD;
      stopped. The residual neuromuscular blockade will be reversed with neostigmine and&#xD;
      glycopyrrolate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be extubated once wide-awake and following commands. ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS&#xD;
      Analysis of Intraoperative Awareness Quantitative: The participants will be subjected to&#xD;
      modified Brice Interview 20 24-hours after surgery and after one month. The Brice interview&#xD;
      at one month will be undertaken through telephonic contact and if awareness is present on any&#xD;
      or both the occasions, a three-member independent awareness committee will review the&#xD;
      incidence intensively. The awareness will be adjudicated in broad divisions, including,&#xD;
      definite, possible, and no awareness. 21 No Awareness: No awareness or a perception of&#xD;
      awareness that has a high probability of occurrence in the preoperative and the postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Awareness: There is a perception of awareness but the patient is unable to recall&#xD;
      any event definitive indicative of awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definite Awareness: Perception of awareness that has clear recall or has a high likelihood of&#xD;
      occurring in the intraoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative: After adjudication of a definite awareness by the awareness committee, the&#xD;
      participants will be classified on the awareness pattern using the Michigan awareness&#xD;
      classification instrument. 21 Class 1 will be defined by isolated auditory perception, Class&#xD;
      2 by tactile perceptions, Class 3 by pain experience, Class 4 by a feeling of paralysis and&#xD;
      helplessness to move, and Class 5 by the presence of both paralysis and pain. If the&#xD;
      awareness event is associated with distress the class will be modified with a suffix &quot;D&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If definite awareness is present, the participants will be offered counselling sessions to&#xD;
      ward off long-term behavioral changes and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) The&#xD;
      inter-reviewer observation will be analyzed for agreement using Fleiss's Kappa statistics for&#xD;
      blinded assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIS score and end-tidal inhalation agent concentration: The intraoperative BIS scores and&#xD;
      end-tidal inhalation agent concentration will be noted (every 5-minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to awakening and tracheal extubation: Time (in minutes) to awakening will be noted after&#xD;
      discontinuation of anaesthesia to point of first spontaneous eye opening. The time will be&#xD;
      confirmed by the ability of the patient to obey commands. Time (in minutes) to tracheal&#xD;
      extubation will comprise of the period after discontinuation of anaesthesia to tracheal&#xD;
      extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and procedural data will be analyzed with student's t-test, double sided, or the&#xD;
      Chi-square test with Yate's correction as appropriate. Analysis of awareness outcome will be&#xD;
      performed using Fisher's exact test. Sensitivity and specificity analysis will be undertaken&#xD;
      for BIS values vis-Ã -vis explicit recall or no recall.&#xD;
