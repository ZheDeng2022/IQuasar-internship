      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the combination of Avelumab, (a fully human&#xD;
      anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) IgG1 antibody) in combination with a taxane&#xD;
      chemotherapy (docetaxel) in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who are either&#xD;
      ineligible to receive cisplatin based chemotherapy, refractory to cisplatin in first line&#xD;
      setting or have disease relapse after receiving cisplatin based chemotherapy within a year in&#xD;
      the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single institution, phase 1b, single arm non-randomized, open label&#xD;
      prospective clinical trial to evaluate the combination of Avelumab and Docetaxel in adult&#xD;
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression&#xD;
      during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or&#xD;
      adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Phase 1b dose de-escalation of Docetaxel in combination with Avelumab, to establish&#xD;
           the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination. The dose de-escalation phase&#xD;
           will utilize a 3+3 design over 3 planned dose levels leading to the identification of a&#xD;
           RP2D for the combination of Docetaxel and Avelumab. Note: Dose de-escalation is allowed&#xD;
           only for Docetaxel and no changes will done to standard dose of Avelumab (i.e, 10&#xD;
           mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the dose expansion phase of the study, the fixed dose of Docetaxel in combination&#xD;
           with Avelumab will be evaluated. The study is powered to a primary endpoint of overall&#xD;
           response rate (ORR) with the combination of Docetaxel and Avelumab. Enrollment for part&#xD;
           2 will commence only after a RP2D is identified from phase 1.&#xD;

    <description>All adverse events (AEs )will be considered in DLT assessment unless an event is clearly unrelated to trial treatment. DLTs for phase 1b only include AEs that are considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the Docetaxel plus Avelumab regimen which occur during the first 21 days of therapy. All AEs, including DLTs, are to be reported according to instructions in the Study Reference Manual and graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03.</description>
