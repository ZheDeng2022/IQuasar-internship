      Brief Summary: This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial aimed&#xD;
      to compare the reperfusion strategy and clinical outcomes of STEMI patients treated by&#xD;
      angiography-guided vs. OCT-guided PCI. Patients presenting STEMI with coronary artery&#xD;
      diameter stenosis ≤70% and TIMI blood flow grade 3 at index or after thrombus aspiration are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either an OCT-guided group or an angiography-guided group. In OCT-guided&#xD;
      group, stent implantation or conservative medical treatment is determined based on OCT&#xD;
      findings. Conservative non-stenting strategy will be recommended in those with culprit plaque&#xD;
      erosions, certain ruptures without dissection and hematoma, SCAD without obstructive&#xD;
      stenosis. In the angiography-guided group, reperfusion strategy is decided by the operators&#xD;
      according to the local practice. The rate of stenting during primary PCI and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes at 1-month and 1-year are collected.&#xD;

      Methodology: As a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, patients with&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who have an intermediate stenotic culprit&#xD;
      lesion (angiographic diameter stenosis ≤70%) and TIMI flow grade 3 or residual stenosis ≤70%&#xD;
      after thrombus aspiration and TIMI grade 3 will be enrolled and randomized to OCT-guided&#xD;
      group or angiography-guided group. In OCT-guided group, pre-PCI OCT imaging of the culprit&#xD;
      lesion will be performed and revascularization strategy will be determined based on&#xD;
      underlying mechanism of culprit lesion morphology. For lesions required stenting, OCT&#xD;
      measurements will be used to guide the selection of stent size and to optimize the result of&#xD;
      stent implantation. In the angiography-guided group, OCT will not be performed and the PCI&#xD;
      procedures will be done according to routine practice by the operators. Primary outcome is&#xD;
      patient-level rate of stenting during primary PCI and the incidence of recurrent myocardial&#xD;
      ischemic events (unstable angina-induced rehospitalization, recurrent myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      target lesion revascularization) or cardiac death within 1 month. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      the incidence of cardiocerebrovascular events (cardiac death, recurrent myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke, target lesion revascularization, malignant arrhythmia, and unstable&#xD;
      angina-induced rehospitalization) and the incidence of heart failure event within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment and procedure overview: Patients with STEMI&lt;12h in whom coronary&#xD;
      angiography is planned will be screened. Those have a culprit lesion stenosis ≤70% by visual&#xD;
      estimation and TIMI blood flow grade 3 at index angiography or after thrombus aspiration will&#xD;
      be consented to participate in the study. After informed consent obtained, patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to OCT-guided group or angiography-guided group randomly. In the OCT-guided group,&#xD;
      OCT imaging of infarcted-related artery will be performed to assess the underlying mechanism&#xD;
      of culprit lesion. Reperfusion strategy will be decided by the operators according to the OCT&#xD;
      findings. Conservative medical strategy will be recommended if the underlying mechanism is&#xD;
      plaque erosions, small ruptures without dissection and hematoma, SCAD without obstructive&#xD;
      stenosis. Otherwise, stent implantation may be performed. The procedure of stent implantation&#xD;
      will be guided by OCT according to current guideline and consensus documents. Before stent&#xD;
      implantation, the landing zone and size of stent will be decided according to the pre-PCI OCT&#xD;
      images. After implantation, OCT imaging will be performed to optimize the results of stent&#xD;
      implantation including stent expansion, apposition, edge dissection, tissue protrusion. In&#xD;
      the angiography-guided group, PCI procedure will be performed according to current guidelines&#xD;
      and their daily practice. All patients are required to take dual antiplatelet treatment with&#xD;
      aspirin (100 mg/day) and ticagrelor (180 mg/day) or clopidogrel (75mg/day) for at least 12&#xD;
      months. The use of low molecular weight heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor are&#xD;
      determined by the operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will be followed by phone calls or clinical visits by study coordinators&#xD;
      at 1 month (30 days) and 1 year (12 months). Severe adverse events including heart failure&#xD;
      event, stent failure, cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, target lesion&#xD;
      revascularization, malignant arrhythmia, and unstable angina-induced rehospitalization will&#xD;
      be collected in all patients throughout the whole study period until the last patient&#xD;
      completes 12 months of follow up. Additional phone follow-up may also be performed subject to&#xD;
      executive committee approval.&#xD;
