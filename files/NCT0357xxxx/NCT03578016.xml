  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:The quality of attachment is greatly influenced by parental sensitivity.&#xD;
      Attachment based interventions are designed to promote parental sensitivity, to change&#xD;
      parental mental representations and to improve understanding of the developmental needs of&#xD;
      the child. Very few studies have investigated the effect of attachment-based interventions on&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms in children. Targeting parental sensitivity and the parent-child&#xD;
      interaction might have an important impact on psychiatric symptoms in a clinical sample of&#xD;
      children referred to child psychiatric services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to investigate whether Circle of Security-Parenting&#xD;
      (COS-P) has an effect on parental sensitivity in parents of children referred to child&#xD;
      psychiatric services. The secondary objectives are to investigate the effect on children's&#xD;
      behavioral and emotional symptoms and the parental stress and reflective functioning after 10&#xD;
      weeks of intervention and at the 24 week follow-up. The study is also exploring the effect of&#xD;
      parental attachment style, parental stress and parental psychopathology on the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The trial will include 128 families of children (age 3-8 years) who are referred to&#xD;
      child psychiatric services in a randomized and controlled design. Included families will be&#xD;
      randomized to COS-P+ Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: Considering the important impact of the quality of the parent-child&#xD;
      relationship on the child's well-being, it is essential to target it in interventions and to&#xD;
      investigate the relation with psychiatric symptoms. Generally there is a lack of&#xD;
      interventions targeting parental sensitivity in psychiatric child populations. Working with&#xD;
      the parents on the child-parent relation, might have an important impact on their children's&#xD;
      current psychiatric symptoms and could additionally prevent future psychopathology.&#xD;
