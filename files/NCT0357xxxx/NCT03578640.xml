  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a daily, fixed-dose, 8-week course combination of&#xD;
      Elbasvir/Grazoprevir in treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients who are mono-infected with&#xD;
      hepatitis C, genotype 4.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of hepatitis C has gone through significant advances in the last few years with&#xD;
      the development of direct-acting antivirals &quot;DAAs.&quot; Since 2013, many DAAs have been approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of HCV with excellent efficacy and safety profiles. The major hurdle in&#xD;
      treating patients on a large scale is the high cost of the current treatment regimens.&#xD;
      Multiple approaches have been proposed, among them, a shortened treatment regimen of 6 to 8&#xD;
      weeks rather than the standard 12-week-regimen. The strategy of shortening the treatment will&#xD;
      help in reducing the cost by 33% to 50%. Thus, it will increase the availability of the&#xD;
      treatment to more patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zepatier is a combination drug of Elbasvir (EBR), an NS5A inhibitor, and Grazoprevir (GZR), a&#xD;
      potent NS3/4A inhibitor. This study is being proposed to address two main issues. First,&#xD;
      collecting information on the safety and efficacy of a shortened course of zepatier (8 weeks&#xD;
      instead of the standard 12 weeks) in patients who are treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic and&#xD;
      mono-infected with HCV. Second, to investigate whether this course provides similar clinical&#xD;
      outcomes to the standard regimen in HCV-Genotype 4, which is the most common genotype in&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Quality of life evaluations will take place over three occasions. The first will be at baseline (upon treatment initiation), the second will be during treatment/at the end of treatment, and the last will be 12 weeks after the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To assess this outcome, a self-administered questionnaire called the &quot;Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire&quot; (HQLQ) will be used. The HQLQ is composed of 7 domains; the physical and mental components (PCS and MCS, respectively), a self-evaluated health transition item (SET), and four hepatitis-related items. The latter include general health distress (HD), psychological well-being (PWB), hepatitis-specific functional limitations (HLIM), and hepatitis-specific health distress (HHD) sub-scales. Higher numbers on each component/scale represent better results (e.g., better physical, emotional, and psychological functioning, and little to no limitations in these aspects). Higher scores on the self-evaluated transition item, however, represent less favorable results.&#xD;
These assessments will take place over three occasions. The first will be upon initiating the treatment, the second will be during/by the end of treatment, and the last will take place 12 weeks after the end of treatment.</description>
