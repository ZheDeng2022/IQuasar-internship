      This study will examine the effectiveness of pre-recorded instructional videos in the use of&#xD;
      bedside ultrasonography to ascertain the presence of a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) as compared to in-person lectures and hands-on training.&#xD;

      This will be a single site prospective pilot study analyzing the agreement between the&#xD;
      results of ED student bedside ultrasonography and radiology-performed ultrasonography.&#xD;
      Medical students rotating at St Elizabeth Boardman Hospital in the emergency department from&#xD;
      any U.S. medical school will be considered for enrollment. Once a rotation has been set up by&#xD;
      the medical student and the medical student coordinator, they will be given information on&#xD;
      the study being performed and asked if they will be interested. The medical student&#xD;
      coordinator will provide them this information. They will be instructed to reply to the&#xD;
      co-P.I. if they are interested in participating in the project and given the formal consent&#xD;
      to review upon receipt of their affirmative response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will be provided envelopes by the co-P.I. containing both the&#xD;
      formal written consent to participate in the study as well as a short knowledge test of&#xD;
      ultrasound technology and the DVT study itself. The student will be required to first sign&#xD;
      the consent form, then take the examination and receive a failing score in order to&#xD;
      participate in the study. This pre-test will be based heavily on the quizzes from the EMSono&#xD;
      learning modules. Permission has been obtained by Dr. Robert Jones to use these questions as&#xD;
      the basis for the pre-test examination. A passing score on the pre-test assessment will be&#xD;
      considered to be 80% or higher. The assignment list will be computer-generated using the&#xD;
      website www.randomizer.org. Students will be given their numeric randomization assignments&#xD;
      based on the order in which they finish their exam, after those that pass are excluded. The&#xD;
      exact methodology is described in https://www.randomizer.org/tutorial/lesson2.html. Utilizing&#xD;
      this methodology, a randomly-generated value of 1 shall be online training, and 2 shall be&#xD;
      in-person training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study itself shall consist of two arms separated by training. The patient inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will not vary between the two arms, only the level of student training. Additional&#xD;
      data will be obtained regarding study participants prior to the start of the study,&#xD;
      including: training level, approximate number of lower extremity ultrasound studies performed&#xD;
      by the participant in the past, overall ultrasound experience, and any formal sonographic&#xD;
      education or credentialing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first arm, participating students must have completed the &quot;Practical Scanning&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Lower Extremity DVT Ultrasound&quot; modules contained within the EMSono online ultrasound&#xD;
      instruction. In the second arm, participating student must have attended the in-person&#xD;
      training that will be provided by an RDMS-certified ultrasonographer, Kathryn Gentile. The&#xD;
      training will last approximately 4 hours in each training method and will include instruction&#xD;
      on performing a B-mode compression test of the deep veins of the lower extremities to assess&#xD;
      for presence or absence of DVT. There will be no significant difference in the approximate&#xD;
      content covered in each training method. Each arm must pass a practical examination in which&#xD;
      they must demonstrate basic proficiency in the use of the ultrasound device as well as the&#xD;
      ability to obtain all views necessary for their examinations. Failure of the practical exam&#xD;
      will result in exclusion from the remainder of the study. They will also be required to&#xD;
      repeat the pre-test assessment which will be tracked for improvement from their first&#xD;
      pre-test assessment. Both arms will have their pre-test assessment, training, and post-test&#xD;
      practical examination monitored by the P.I., co-P.I., ultrasonographer, or another suitable&#xD;
      proctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency department patients whom the physician has a clinical suspicion for lower extremity&#xD;
      DVT or PE and have intention of ordering formal radiology department performed ultrasound&#xD;
      will be consented to also have a bedside ultrasound performed by study participant. This&#xD;
      consent will be obtained by either the resident or attending physician providing the care of&#xD;
      the patient; at which point, the physician will inform whatever student study participant is&#xD;
      currently on shift in the department. If there are multiple student study participants&#xD;
      present and on shift in the department, the physician must inform a student in an appropriate&#xD;
      manner. If a student has already begun to see the patient that is to receive the DVT&#xD;
      assessment, then they shall be the study participant selected. If no student has begun to see&#xD;
      the patient, then the student with the fewest number of US DVT scans performed in the course&#xD;
      of this study will be the study participant selected. If neither of these factors are&#xD;
      definitive, then the ED physician shall decide the student to perform the examination via&#xD;
      coin toss. If a physical coin is unavailable, then a smartphone coin toss app will be&#xD;
      considered an acceptable alternative. The device utilized to obtain these exams shall be a&#xD;
      Philips Lumify linear 12-4 MHz probe attached to a Samsung Galaxy View 19&quot; tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each arm, each participant shall perform the examination according to the methods&#xD;
      described by the teaching methods; including what veins are considered to be studied and what&#xD;
      techniques to utilize in order to assess for the presence or absence of DVT. The study&#xD;
      participant must perform the bedside ultrasound and record their results on a standardized&#xD;
      document which will be placed in a locked box inside the department. The information recorded&#xD;
      shall include: patient information, reason for exam, date and time of exam, extremity&#xD;
      studied, technical limitations, number ultrasound for the study participant, and findings.&#xD;
      Data on the form shall be standardized and in check-box form whenever possible to avoid&#xD;
      ambiguity. This sheet will be completed and placed in the locked box prior to the patient&#xD;
      receiving their formal radiology department performed examination, the timing of which will&#xD;
      be verified by the resident or attending physician. At the completion of the study, all&#xD;
      charts will be reviewed by the co-P.I. and the results provided on the sheet shall be&#xD;
      compared to the results of the formal radiologic ultrasound and the data will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, no treatment will be initiated based on the student ultrasound alone. If the&#xD;
      suspicion remains very high and for some reason there is an urgent need to initiate treatment&#xD;
      (e.g. admitted patient needing bridge orders), then the resident or attending must either&#xD;
      perform an ultrasound exam themselves or must be able to interpret the images obtained by the&#xD;
      formal study as the basis for treatment. If the patient is diagnosed with a PE prior to the&#xD;
      formal study being completed, therapy will not be withheld until the formal US as it is&#xD;
      clearly indicated in PE. Every attempt will be made to document this on the chart or paper&#xD;
      form as applicable so that the chart can be reviewed more thoroughly for times of meds&#xD;
      given/scans done and studies and be appropriately rejected if significant confounding exists,&#xD;
      such as a positive DVT on student scan, initiation of anticoagulation for PE, then subsequent&#xD;
      formal US negative for DVT. Further, although the diagnosis of DVT does exist across a&#xD;
      spectrum, the presence of any thrombus on the formal radiological study is cause to initiate&#xD;
      treatment, regardless of whether or not it is hemodynamically significant. As such, the&#xD;
      positive presence of a thrombus will be treated as an affirmative result in both studies; and&#xD;
      a negative result will be considered as a complete lack of any evidence for DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students in particular present a unique research opportunity, as there is little existing&#xD;
      evidence on training truly naïve ultrasound users in the Emergency Department. Prior evidence&#xD;
      has focused primarily on resident and attending training in the use of bedside ultrasound.&#xD;
      Further, this study simultaneously represents a significant learning opportunity for students&#xD;
      who choose to enroll, in addition to having routine access to the ultrasound equipment&#xD;
      usually reserved for use by resident and attending physicians. The research goals of this&#xD;
      study will be modeled after the studies that exist for physician training. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct the study for a period of 12 months, aiming to obtain a minimum of&#xD;
      100 studies. There will be no upper bound on the number of examinations performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each rotation period, the studies will be collected from the locked box by the&#xD;
      co-P.I. and the results of the formal radiological study will be compared to the results of&#xD;
      the student-performed study. The paper studies from the locked box will then be transferred&#xD;
      to a locked drawer within the locked EM resident's workroom. Only the P.I., co-P.I.,&#xD;
      applicable research assistant, and residency coordinator will have access to the locked&#xD;
      drawer. These will then be transferred to a primary and backup encrypted flash drive in a&#xD;
      spreadsheet file using the standardized results on the data collection sheet and the&#xD;
      patient's visit number, so that the drive does not contain any identifiable PHI. The backup&#xD;
      drive shall remain in the locked drawer. The research assistant shall be responsible for&#xD;
      compiling this data on a semi-weekly basis as well as generation and maintenance of the data&#xD;
      files on the encrypted flash drive. It is expected that this will data processing task will&#xD;
      last for 5 hours every 2 weeks for the duration of the project at a cost of $20 per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed and relevant statistical analyses performed on the data to&#xD;
      determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the radiological&#xD;
      study result and the student study result in each arm, as well as the comparison between the&#xD;
      two arms. These analyses will be performed either by the P.I., co-P.I., or an appropriate&#xD;
      research assistant utilizing SPSS or similar statistical analysis application to determine&#xD;
      differences in sensitivity and specificity of exams grouped by training type. One training&#xD;
      method will be considered as superior to the other only if the p value for this data is&#xD;
      &lt;0.05.&#xD;
