      This is an open-label, non-randomized, phase II clinical research study designed to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with paclitaxel in&#xD;
      patients with treatment naïve NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically confirmed stage IV or recurrent non curable NSCLC of squamous or&#xD;
      non-squamous histology, with no prior systemic anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy given&#xD;
      as primary treatment for advanced or metastatic disease may be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled into the study will be given the study drugs, nivolumab (360 mg) (Day 1)&#xD;
      every 3 weeks, ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Day 1) every 6 weeks, and paclitaxel 80mg/m2 on days 1 and&#xD;
      8 of each 21- day study treatment cycle. Paclitaxel will be stopped after a total of 4-6&#xD;
      cycles of treatment. Blood samples and possibly a small piece of tissue may be removed the&#xD;
      patient's lung to see what type of lung cancer cells that she or he may have. Patients will&#xD;
      also have other tests, exams, and procedures for study purposes and their standard of care.&#xD;
      Subject participation in the study will last for up to approximately 48 months after the&#xD;
      start of the study drug or until their condition worsens or they experience intolerable&#xD;
      adverse events as deemed by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are possible patient risk to this study that include but are not limited to diarrhea,&#xD;
      itching, rash and a feeling of weakness.&#xD;
