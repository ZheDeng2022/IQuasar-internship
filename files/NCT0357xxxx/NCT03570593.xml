  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the treatment of cervical cancer in early stages is performed with a radical&#xD;
      surgery called Radical Hysterectomy with Pelvic Lymphadenectomy. This surgery, when indicated&#xD;
      correctly, in early stages of this disease, has a cure rate of approximately 90% at 5 years,&#xD;
      compared to the same Pelvic Radiotherapy. However, it is known that most patients with early&#xD;
      stage cervical cancer are young (average age 45) and treating these patients with&#xD;
      radiotherapy would have a loss of hormonal function by damage to the ovaries and damage in&#xD;
      sexual function by radiotherapy effects in the vagina. Furthermore, if the patient has a&#xD;
      pelvic recurrence, the option of radiotherapy treatment could not be offered. Due to the&#xD;
      factors listed above, nowadays, in young patients with good clinical conditions and tumors in&#xD;
      early stages, radical surgery is a good option. In this radical surgery there is a need for&#xD;
      removal of the parametrium, and different degrees of pelvic denervation may occur causing&#xD;
      damage of urinary function.Currently, there is no consensus about the correct moment of&#xD;
      catheter removal and evaluation of urinary function using the residual urine test. While in&#xD;
      some services the urinary catheter is removed on day 1 postoperatively, in others it is&#xD;
      removed on the 14th day postoperatively. For these reasons, this study aims to compare the&#xD;
      early catheter removal (day 1 postoperatively) versus standard in the investigator's service&#xD;
      (7 days postoperatively) withdrawal. If this study detect that the patients may remove the&#xD;
      urinary catheter on day 1 postoperatively, much less cost, discomfort, pain and comorbidities&#xD;
      associated with the use of indwelling catheter for prolonged periods occur, such as urinary&#xD;
      tract infection, use of antibiotics and even hospitalization for this reason.&#xD;
