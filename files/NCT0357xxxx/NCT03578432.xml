    <textblock>
      This early phase 1 trial studies the use of everolimus in restoring salivary gland function&#xD;
      in participants with locally advanced head and neck cancer after concurrent chemoradiation or&#xD;
      radiation therapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the recovery of salivary gland function after administration of a 5-day course&#xD;
      of everolimus, administered two weeks after completion of radiation or chemoradiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the decrease of saliva flow rates during radiation or chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the changes in saliva protein composition during radiation or chemoradiation&#xD;
      therapy and following administration of a 5-day course of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an early phase 1 proof of principal study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 5 days beginning 2 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of radiation or chemoradiation treatment. Participants also undergo saliva&#xD;
      output testing at baseline prior to radiation or chemoradiation treatment, after 3 weeks of&#xD;
      RT/chemoRT, after 6 weeks of RT/chemoRT, prior to everolimus administration, at completion of&#xD;
      the 5 day everolimus course, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the completion of radiation or&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Percent recovery of salivary gland function</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months after completion of radiation or chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point of the analysis will be the percent recovery of salivary gland function, with pre-everolimus treatment saliva flow rate as the denominator and the saliva flow rate at 3 months after completion of radiation or chemoradiation therapy as the numerator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of saliva flow rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of radiation or chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured during radiotherapy treatment at 3, 6 weeks, and prior to everolimus administration and the subsequent recovery of saliva flow rates at completion of the 5 day everolimus course and 1, 3 and 6 months after radiation therapy/chemoradiation therapy completion to determine the kinetics and stability of saliva flow rate recovery. Will be explored using graphical methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Saliva protein composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of radiation or chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Protein composition within the saliva will be measured and will be expressed as percent decrease and recovery of amylase at all available time points. Will be explored using graphical methods.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total score obtained on Xerostomia Visual Analog Scale survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of radiation or chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Will be explored using graphical methods. Subjective assessment of salivary dysfunction. • Scale ranges: not difficult at all - very difficult. • Not difficult at all is considered better, very difficult is considered worse. Subscales are summed. Scale ranges: 1-5 = • 1 (Never), 2 (hardly ever), 3 (occasionally), 4 (fairly often), 5 (very often). • Sub scales are summed.</description>
