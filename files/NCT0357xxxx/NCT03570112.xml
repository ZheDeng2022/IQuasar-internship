      This is a multicenter, non-comparative, observational study that will recruit women with&#xD;
      singleton pregnancy and chronic HCV infection to determine the natural history of chronic HCV&#xD;
      in pregnancy and the rate of vertical transmission to their infants. All participants will be&#xD;
      offered curative therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa ®) after delivery and the&#xD;
      cessation of breastfeeding. Subjects may be enrolled at any time after conception up through&#xD;
      36 weeks gestation. The management of subjects in pregnancy will be in accordance with ACOG&#xD;
      guidelines and individual clinical judgment, however testing will include, but not be limited&#xD;
      to, testing for HCV infection, HIV infection, HBV infection, HSV infection, group B&#xD;
      Streptococcal colonization, HCV genotype, HCV viral load, as well as assessment of hepatic&#xD;
      and renal function. Subjects will be followed on a schedule that is determined by their&#xD;
      obstetric care providers throughout their pregnancy. Following delivery, infants will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 12, 24 and 48 weeks of age, with testing for HCV RNA to be obtained at each&#xD;
      evaluation. Vertical transmission is defined as two positive HCV RNA PCR tests, at least one&#xD;
      before the 48 week infant visit, and again at the 12-month follow-up infant visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection has dramatically advanced in recent&#xD;
      years, with the availability of multiple interferon-free treatment regimens that result in&#xD;
      cure in over 95% of treatment naïve individuals with 8 -12 weeks of therapy. Despite these&#xD;
      advances, however, the natural history and treatment of HCV remains undefined in several&#xD;
      populations, including pregnancy. In particular, rates of vertical (mother to child)&#xD;
      transmission, perinatal and neonatal morbidity, assessment of disease severity (fibrosis) in&#xD;
      pregnancy and timing of treatment are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 2.3 million people in the United States and 185 million people worldwide are&#xD;
      believed to have chronic HCV infection, although as it is frequently asymptomatic until the&#xD;
      development of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), this may be a significant underestimate.&#xD;
      Between 2012 and 2014 the HCV detection rate among women of childbearing age increased by 22%&#xD;
      nationally and over 200% in Kentucky, while the proportion of children born to HCV infected&#xD;
      women increased 68% nationally and 128% in Kentucky.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in the United States, the overall rate of children born to HCV infected women is&#xD;
      3.4 per 1,000 live births, with the highest rate in West Virginia, with 22.4 per 1,000 live&#xD;
      births occurring to HCV-infected women. Overall, the number of HCV infected reproductive age&#xD;
      women has doubled from 2006 to 2014, with an estimated 29,000 HCV infected women giving birth&#xD;
      and 1,700 infants vertically infected each year, according to previous estimates of vertical&#xD;
      transmission.The true incidence of vertical transmission of HCV is unknown, although the most&#xD;
      commonly cited meta-analysis reported a mean transmission rate of 5.8% in HIV-negative women&#xD;
      and 10.8% in HIV-positive women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of vertical transmission is also not well characterized. There is limited data&#xD;
      regarding the course of chronic hepatitis C during pregnancy, HCV viral loads appear to peak&#xD;
      during third trimester. Both utero and peripartum transmission appear possible, while&#xD;
      breastfeeding does not appear to be a risk factor. It appears that between 80 and 90% of&#xD;
      children who acquire hepatitis C via vertical transmission will develop chronic infection.&#xD;
      However, as sequelae of infection are not commonly observed in childhood, and appropriate&#xD;
      testing of exposed children is poor, this may not be a true reflection of actual prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current AASLD/IDSA HCV Guidelines recommend all children born to HCV infected women be&#xD;
      tested, but they do not specify when or in what manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal HCV infection has been shown to contribute to worsened perinatal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes in the absence of vertical transmission. It is associated with increased rates of&#xD;
      intrauterine fetal death, preterm delivery, low birth rate, increased risk for adverse&#xD;
      neonatal neurological outcomes, increased infant feeding difficulties and subsequent maternal&#xD;
      infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is sufficient time between the end of the first trimester and delivery to&#xD;
      provide curative therapy during pregnancy, no safety studies in pregnancy have been done.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will offer curative DAA therapy to HCV infected Moms with the fixed&#xD;
      dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) after the cessation of breastfeeding.&#xD;
      This combination of sofosbuvir, a nucleotide inhibitor of the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA&#xD;
      polymerase, and velpatasvir, an inhibitor of the NS5A transcriptional activator, is approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic HCV infection due to genotypes 1 through 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the gaps in the investigator's understanding of HCV vertical transmission rates,&#xD;
      HCV-associated perinatal complications, and marked increases in both the number of women with&#xD;
      chronic HCV infection giving birth and the number of children under two years old testing&#xD;
      positive for HCV, this study will help to both better characterize the natural history of HCV&#xD;
      in pregnancy and ultimately, to facilitate its elimination when women are screened for&#xD;
      chronic HCV as part of routine gynecologic care and are offered curative therapy prior to&#xD;
      conception (or as part of prenatal care and when dosing during pregnancy can be safely&#xD;
      undertaken).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be offered curative therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa ®)&#xD;
      after delivery and the cessation of breastfeeding. Subjects may be enrolled at any time after&#xD;
      conception up through 36 weeks gestation. The management of subjects in pregnancy will be in&#xD;
      accordance with ACOG guidelines and individual clinical judgment, however testing will&#xD;
      include, but not be limited to, testing for HCV infection, HIV infection, HBV infection, HSV&#xD;
      infection, group B Streptococcal colonization, HCV genotype, HCV viral load, as well as&#xD;
      assessment of hepatic and renal function. Staging of hepatic fibrosis must be performed&#xD;
      within 12 months prior to initiation of SOF/VEL. Acceptable methods of staging include&#xD;
      transient elastography or liver biopsy. If elastography is performed, it must be performed&#xD;
      either prior to pregnancy or at least 12 weeks following delivery, due to pregnancy-related&#xD;
      changes in hepatic stiffness. Subjects will be followed on a schedule that is determined by&#xD;
      their obstetric care providers throughout their pregnancy. Data from clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      records regarding the participants pregnancy and delivery, and their infant's medical record&#xD;
      from the infant's pediatrician from birth to 12 months of age will be collected. Following&#xD;
      delivery, infants will be evaluated at 12, 24 and 48 weeks of age, with testing for HCV RNA&#xD;
      to be obtained at each evaluation. Vertical transmission is defined as two positive HCV RNA&#xD;
      PCR tests, at least one before the 48 week visit, and again at the 12-month follow-up infant&#xD;
      visit.At 24 weeks following delivery, participants will begin therapy with&#xD;
      sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) once daily for 12 weeks. Therapy will not be initiated until&#xD;
      cessation of breastfeeding. Participants will be evaluated at the initiation of SOF/VEL&#xD;
      therapy, at 4 and 8 weeks after starting therapy, as well as 12 weeks following completion of&#xD;
      therapy for determination of SVR-12. Quantitative measurement of HCV RNA will be obtained at&#xD;
      each visit, as well as evaluation of renal and hepatic function.&#xD;
