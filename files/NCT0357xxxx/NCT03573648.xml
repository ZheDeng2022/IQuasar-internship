  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer will undergo a biopsy and be&#xD;
      randomized to receive endocrine therapy (ET) versus endocrine therapy with palbociclib (PET)&#xD;
      in a 1:2 ratio. After 1 cycle (28 days) another biopsy will be obtained, and both arms will&#xD;
      receive avelumab (A) for 3 additional cycles. Patients will then undergo breast surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with endocrine therapy +/- palbociclib (125mg, taken orally, daily&#xD;
      for 21 days, 7 days off ) for 1 cycle (1 cycle =28 days) and undergo a repeat biopsy, MRI,&#xD;
      and blood draw at Cycle 2, Day 1. Afterwards avelumab will be added to both arms. Avelumab&#xD;
      will be administered 10mg/kg IV every 14 days (1 cycle = 2 doses = 28 days). Patients will be&#xD;
      treated for 3 cycles of avelumab with endocrine therapy +/- palbociclib (thus 4 cycles total,&#xD;
      including run-in without avelumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kind of endocrine therapy given will depend on menopausal status and will be a standard&#xD;
      treatment. For premenopausal women, the endocrine therapy will be daily tamoxifen (20mg taken&#xD;
      orally daily for 28 days), plus either Leuprolide (3.75mg taken intramuscularly) or Goserelin&#xD;
      (3.6mg taken subcutaneously) on Day 1 of each cycle. For postmenopausal women, it will be&#xD;
      daily letrozole (2.5mg taken orally).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated so long as there is no clinical evidence of progression and therapy&#xD;
      is tolerated. Patients who experience progressive disease (25% increase) of their tumor will&#xD;
      cease study treatment and undergo end-of-study assessment (including repeat MRI) and surgery.&#xD;
      Otherwise, patients completing all 4 cycles of therapy will undergo MRI and surgery.&#xD;
