  <detailed_description>

      Prurigo nodularis(PN) is a chronic skin disease, characterized by severe pruritus, multiple&#xD;
      hyperkeratotic nodules and papules often located on the extensor part of the upper and lower&#xD;
      extremities with a symmetrical distribution. The disease often appears between 20-60 years of&#xD;
      age affecting men and women equally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of PN is poorly understood and it is unknown whether PN is a primary&#xD;
      dermatological disease or if it arises secondary to intense pruritus and scratching of the&#xD;
      skin with other diseases being the cause of the itching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have investigated if certain biochemical parameters are involved in&#xD;
      mediating PN e.g. studies have indicated that the small nerve fibres in dermis in lesioned&#xD;
      skin have an increased density of Substance P (neuropeptide and a well-known mediator of&#xD;
      pruritus. when compared to non-lesioned skin.Other studies have suggested that patients with&#xD;
      PN have a high presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) in dermis leading to modulation of the&#xD;
      small nerve fibres, as well as an increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes, mast- and&#xD;
      Merkel cells. Additionally, studies have found increased levels of IL-6 and IL-31 in blood in&#xD;
      patient with PN. However the pathogenesis of PN remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients with atopic dermatitis there is a higher frequency of patients with PN as well&#xD;
      as PN seem to be associated with certain liver- and kidney diseases. Anxiety and depression&#xD;
      are also more common in patients with PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PN suffer from impaired quality of life due to ongoing pruritus and skin&#xD;
      lesions(5). PN is mainly treated with topical steroids, UVB, PUVA or thalidomide, although&#xD;
      none of these treatments seem to be able to control the disease and furthermore a number of&#xD;
      these treatments are associated with several side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)-inhibitor (apremilast) have shown a , it is speculated that&#xD;
      apremilast may have an effect in patients with PN. Lack of effective treatments for PN&#xD;
      supports further development for treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the anti-pruritic effect of apremilast in patients with known PN.&#xD;
      This interventional study, will be performed at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy at&#xD;
      Herlev and Gentofte Hospital (Gentofte site), University of Copenhagen, Hellerup, Denmark.&#xD;
