  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether patients who have early stage NSCLC bigger than a&#xD;
      certain size might benefit from receiving additional medicinal drug to treat their cancer&#xD;
      after the SBRT Surgeons and radiation doctors have understood for some time that the chances&#xD;
      of cancer showing up in areas outside the chest are higher for patients with tumors bigger&#xD;
      than 3 cm, (about 1 Â¼ inches). However, it is not routine to offer chemotherapy or drug&#xD;
      treatments after radiation or surgery for lung cancer for patients with early stage lung&#xD;
      cancer. This is because giving extra treatment in the form of chemotherapy has not shown to&#xD;
      help patients live longer. There has been reluctance to offer additional treatments,&#xD;
      especially chemotherapy, to patients with lung cancer who could not have surgery because of&#xD;
      their medical issues. Even if these patients were felt to be at a higher risk of their cancer&#xD;
      coming back, there is hesitation because the treatments can be difficult to tolerate in frail&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there have been very important advances in the kinds of drug therapy that are used&#xD;
      for lung cancer patients. These kinds of drugs are called immunotherapy since they work with&#xD;
      the body's immune system to fight the cancer. These drugs have been shown to make patients&#xD;
      with advanced, incurable lung cancer, live longer and also to be very safe with very limited&#xD;
      side effects. Because of these favorable characteristics, cancer specialists are interested&#xD;
      in using these drugs for patients with curable cancer and for patients who may be too fragile&#xD;
      for traditional chemotherapy. In this way, patients who get SBRT are already known to be&#xD;
      fragile so cancer doctors are interested in now studying this kind of drug in SBRT patients&#xD;
      to see if it can make patients with large tumors do better. The idea of the study then is&#xD;
      that the patient would receive their standard SBRT and if their tumor is of a certain size&#xD;
      that makes the risk of the cancer showing up outside the chest higher than routine, they&#xD;
      would be considered for getting the immunotherapy drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an investigational drug (also known as Keytruda), which has been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for use in certain types of skin cancer (melanoma), and for use in certain types of&#xD;
      head and neck cancer. However, it has not been approved for use in other cancers such as&#xD;
      newly diagnosed early stage NSCLC. It is FDA approved for advanced NSCLC, that is people who&#xD;
      have already had some chemotherapy and their disease has worsened. Pembrolizumab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that binds to the surface of some cells of the immune system and&#xD;
      activates them against cancer cells. It is not chemotherapy.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this pilot safety study is to determine the tolerability and&#xD;
      feasibility of administering pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting following completion of&#xD;
      definitive SBRT to the lung for patients with medically inoperable early stage NSCLC with&#xD;
      tumors greater than 3 cm in diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Distant metastases free survival (DMFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disease Free Survival (DFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design including dose escalation / cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, single arm feasibility study of lung SBRT followed 2 to 4 weeks after&#xD;
      completion by the addition of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have biopsy-confirmed T1b-T3N0M0 (stage IA-IIB) non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or large cell/NSCLC NOS), performance status&#xD;
      0-2, deemed medically inoperable by a thoracic surgeon or pulmonologist, and no&#xD;
      contraindications to pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study is safety and feasibility. For the first stage of this&#xD;
      study, 8 patients will be enrolled. If &gt;7 of the initial 8 patients complete the therapy&#xD;
      without experiencing a Grade &gt;3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade &gt;4 toxicity, an additional 7&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled for a total of 15 patients. If &gt;2 of the original 8 patients (&gt;25%)&#xD;
      experience a Grade &gt;3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade &gt;4 toxicity the trial will be closed&#xD;
      and the study therapy will be considered too toxic. If &gt;4 of 15 patients (&gt;26.7%) experience&#xD;
      a Grade &gt;3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade &gt;4 toxicity, the study drug regimen will be deemed&#xD;
      too toxic and unsafe. If &gt;12 out of 15 patients complete the study without experiencing a&#xD;
      Grade &gt;3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade &gt;4 toxicity, the study drug regimen will be&#xD;
      considered safe and feasible for further study.&#xD;
