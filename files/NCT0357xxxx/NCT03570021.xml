      Prospective randomized open phase III non-inferiority trial in cT1bT2N0 papillary thyroid&#xD;
      carcinoma comparing: total thyroidectomy alone (experimental group) versus total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy + Prophylactic Neck Dissection PND (reference group).&#xD;

      Pre-registered patients will be randomized before surgery for tumors with class-6 cytology&#xD;
      (Bethesda) or in the operating room after confirmation of malignancy by frozen section&#xD;
      analysis for tumors with class-5 cytology.&#xD;

- The number of lymph nodes resected, the number of metastatic nodes, their size and the presence or absence of extranodal spread will be recorded. Due to the large natural variability of the number of lymph nodes retrieved in a prophylactic neck dissection [Hartl DM, Ann Surg 2012], no patient will be excluded on the basis of number of lymph nodes. Furthermore, the participating surgeons routinely perform complete central neck dissections, and were chosen to participate in this study due to a homogenous technique among these surgeons [Hartl DM, World J Surg 2012].</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Thyroid nodule measuring 11-40 mm on ultrasound (cT1bT2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AND with fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) cytology in favor of &quot;papillary&#xD;
                  thyroid carcinoma&quot; (Type 6 according to the Bethesda classification (Appendix 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  OR with FNAB cytology &quot;suspicious for malignancy&quot; (Type 5 according to the&#xD;
                  Bethesda classification). In this latter case, randomization will be performed if&#xD;
                  confirmation of papillary carcinoma on intraoperative frozen section analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. cN0: absence of lymph nodes suspicious for malignancy on preoperative ultrasound&#xD;
             performed by the center's designated radiologist according to a standardized report&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Absence of a medical contra indication to performing a total thyroidectomy with or&#xD;
             without bilateral prophylactic neck dissection of the central compartment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine)&#xD;
             before any radioiodine administration. Sexually active patients must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective method of contraception or to abstain from sexual activity during the study&#xD;
             and for at least 6 months after last dose of radioiodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient affiliated to a social security regimen or beneficiary of such regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients age ≥ 18 years old, french-speaking&#xD;

             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Tumors &gt; 40 mm (cT3) or ≤ 10 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Tumors with extrathyroidal extension suspected or obvious on the pre-operative work-up&#xD;
             or intra-operatively (cT3T4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Metastatic neck lymph nodes or suspicious neck nodes on preoperative ultrasound (cN1);&#xD;
             for suspicious nodes, FNAB cytology and thyroglobulin assay on the needle washout&#xD;
             fluid will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Metastatic neck lymph nodes found during the thyroidectomy and confirmed with&#xD;
             intra-operative frozen section analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medullary thyroid carcinoma on FNAB cytology and/or with basal serum calcitonin &gt;50&#xD;
             pg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Preoperative or intra-operative suspicion of non-papillary thyroid carcinoma or&#xD;
             aggressive histopathological subtype or poorly differentiated carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Distant metastases (M1) apparent pre-operatively (found due to symptoms or&#xD;
             fortuitously; no specific pre-operative work-up will be performed, however, in&#xD;
             accordance with current clinical practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recurrent nerve paralysis visualized on systematic pre-operative laryngoscopy and/or&#xD;
             abnormal preoperative serum calcium&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or breast feeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in another therapeutic clinical trial within one year from study entry&#xD;
