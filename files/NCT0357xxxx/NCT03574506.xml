      Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody against protein C5 that works to inhibit&#xD;
      the activation of the terminal complement cascade. The Eculizumab is currently FDA approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic&#xD;
      syndrome (aHUS) and has been shown to improve the quality of life and overall survival in&#xD;
      these patients. aHUS is a life-threatening disease of complement mediated thrombotic&#xD;
      microangiopathy often triggered by an inciting event, such as an infection or&#xD;
      immunocompromised state. Pregnancy has also been identified as an inciting event, with&#xD;
      patients most often experiencing aHUS in the postpartum period. Due to its rare nature,&#xD;
      pregnancy-associated aHUS is often mistaken for preeclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver&#xD;
      enzyme, low platelet (HELLP) syndrome. As standard treatment for preeclampsia and HELLP&#xD;
      syndrome is completion of the pregnancy by expediting delivery of the baby. A missed&#xD;
      diagnosis of aHUS can result in delays in treatment, including use of Eculizumab when&#xD;
      appropriate; such delay can increase the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. When aHUS&#xD;
      is suspected in the postpartum period, Eculizumab could be initiated early; however, there is&#xD;
      limited data on use of Eculizumab in this setting.&#xD;

      Overall Objective The aim of this study is compare outcomes of women with suspected&#xD;
      postpartum aHUS, stratified by treatment with Eculizumab. Specifically, assess the maternal&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical presentation, disease course, treatment strategy, and short and&#xD;
      long--term complications among a cohort of women with suspected postpartum aHUS, with&#xD;
      analyses stratified by Eculizumab exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Hypothesis: Women with suspected postpartum aHUS treated with Eculizumab have a&#xD;
      decreased length of hospital stay and a decreased incidence of adverse maternal outcomes when&#xD;
      compared to those women with postpartum aHUS not treated with Eculizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Hypothesis: Women with postpartum aHUS treated with Eculizumab have low rates of&#xD;
      adverse maternal or neonatal events when followed up to 6 months after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Study Type: Retrospective cohort study Study population: Postpartum patients&#xD;
      meeting diagnostic criteria for pregnancy associated aHUS between January 2009 and May 2016&#xD;
      in Colombia. This study cohort will be stratified into two groups: 1) women with suspected&#xD;
      postpartum aHUS treated with Eculizumab and; 2) women meeting diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      postpartum aHUS that did not receive treatment with Eculizumab. The investigators chose a&#xD;
      start date of 2009 because this was the year that Eculizumab was approved by the National&#xD;
      Institute of Food and Drug Monitoring (INVIMA) for use in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria&#xD;
      (PNH). Eculizumab was subsequently approved for use in aHUS in 2011.In addition, in the same&#xD;
      period of time will identify a cohort of women diagnosed with pregnancy associated with HUS&#xD;
      in Colombia who did not receive treatment with Eculizumabse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unit of analysis: The medical data of patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the study,&#xD;
      ie, postpartum aHUS are summarized. For the group of women treated with Eculizumab, and who&#xD;
      continue to receive such therapy on an outpatient basis after hospital discharge, the&#xD;
      investigators will abstract follow up data up to 6 months postpartum. For missing data that&#xD;
      is not readily available in the medical chart the investigators will utilize research&#xD;
      assistants, or members of the study team, to contact study subjects or the treating provider&#xD;
      to obtain additional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be assessed sample size requirements necessary to determine a significant difference in&#xD;
      survival or end--stage renal disease between groups (primary outcomes), with 80% power and&#xD;
      alpha=0.05 (see tables below). Mortality from aHUS without Eculizumab in Colombia is&#xD;
      estimated at 30% based in previous reports. The investigators estimate out treatment cohort&#xD;
      of aHUS cases treated with Eculizumab to be at least Ten patients. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      have sufficient power to detect a significant increase in overall survival if it is 80% or&#xD;
      greater in the treatment arm. Rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with aHUS is estimated&#xD;
      at 70% in Colombia. The investigators have sufficient to detect a significant decrease in&#xD;
      ESRD with Eculizumab if the rate is 15% or lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Identification of study cohort Activity 1: This project will be submitted to Alexion&#xD;
      Pharma SAS in Colombia, in order to obtain approval and access to information on all patients&#xD;
      in their database who received treatment with Eculizumab after being diagnosed with&#xD;
      postpartum aHUS regardless of outcome. Alexion is the only authorized distributor of&#xD;
      Eculizumab by the National Institute of Food and Drug Monitoring (INVIMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2: Obtaining informed consent from all patients meeting criteria for postpartum&#xD;
      aHUS, regardless of Eculizumab treatment, to access data from medical records or directly via&#xD;
      interviews with study subjects or their representatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 3: Written and verbal communication to the various medical providers involved in the&#xD;
      care of the identified patient cohort. For this study, were defined as those providers who&#xD;
      made the initial and / or final diagnosis of pregnancy associated aHUS and who were&#xD;
      responsible for treatment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Review of information and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 1: Review all information obtained from the medical records of all subjects meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria by the investigators. A database will then be constructed and populated&#xD;
      with the information obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2: Data Verification A second researcher will conduct a verification of the&#xD;
      information included in the database, to assess quality control of the data entered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Analysis of results Activity 1: To describe clinical and sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics, disease course, and treatment approach in patients with postpartum aHUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2: To assess adverse maternal outcomes among women with postpartum aHUS, stratified&#xD;
      by treatment with Eculizumab. Short term outcomes will be assessed from the time of diagnosis&#xD;
      to the time of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 3: To determine the rate of delayed adverse maternal and neonatal events in women&#xD;
      with postpartum aHUS treated with Eculizumab, and who are followed up to 6 months after&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database in an excel spreadsheet format will be used to conduct descriptive analysis of&#xD;
      the demographic variables and subject characteristics. Correlations of outcomes will be made&#xD;
      with timing of initiation of Eculizumab after delivery, dose received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables Demographic characteristics, Obstetric history, Characteristics of current&#xD;
      pregnancy Clinical criteria (At time of presentation, diagnosis, and after treatment)&#xD;
      Laboratory test (if possible) (At presentation, diagnosis, and throughout treatment course)&#xD;
      Treatments Eculizumab treatment Maternal outcomes Neonatal outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Throughout the study period the investigators will ensure the&#xD;
      confidentiality of information collected, the accuracy of the results obtained, and above all&#xD;
      the investigators respect the ights of all patients involved. All copies of signed consent&#xD;
      forms and medical records retrieved will be stored in a locked cabinet in the principal&#xD;
      investigators office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is classified as &quot;safe&quot;, according to Article 11 of resolution 8430 of&#xD;
      1993 by the Ministry of Health of Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected during the study will be used solely for research purposes and all&#xD;
      appropriate measures will be taken to keep information confidential. Prior to proceeding this&#xD;
      project will be approved by the Ethic Committee of the hospital ESE Divina Misericordia from&#xD;
      Magangué, Colombia (see attached in appendix the Spanish version in PDF format), and will be&#xD;
      submitted to the institutional review board of Oregon Health &amp; Science University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study fits within the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki statement and the ethical&#xD;
      principles of the World Medical Association. As stated prior, all the information collected&#xD;
      for this investigation will be confidential and the results will be published only in&#xD;
      journals with academic and scientific interest, preserving the accuracy of the data as well&#xD;
      as the findings and results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alexion Pharma SAS in Colombia will provide the information of patients who received&#xD;
      Eculizumab for treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in the postpartum period.&#xD;
      After obtaining patient consent the investigators will then access their medical record&#xD;
      information and ensure all information is collected in a secure database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alexion Pharma SAS in Colombia is the only authorized distributor of Eculizumab by the&#xD;
      National Institute of Food and Drug Monitoring (INVIMA). Alexion Pharma SAS will receive a&#xD;
      copy of the analysis and report which will be published in an independent manner by the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol complies with the ethical requirements for human research outlined by the&#xD;
      American Medical Association such as its scientific value, describing the impact generated&#xD;
      using Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody, on the natural history and progression of aHUS&#xD;
      during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period and therefore, to raise future clinical&#xD;
      research in terms of reduction of morbidity and mortality related to this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, only patients who have given their informed consent will be included in the study.&#xD;

        Postpartum patients meeting diagnostic criteria for pregnancy associated aHUS between&#xD;
        January 2009 and May 2016 in Colombia. This study cohort will be stratified into two&#xD;
        groups: 1) women with suspected postpartum aHUS treated with Eculizumab and; 2) women&#xD;
        meeting diagnostic criteria for postpartum aHUS that did not receive treatment with&#xD;
        Eculizumab. We chose a start date of 2009 because this was the year that Eculizumab was&#xD;
