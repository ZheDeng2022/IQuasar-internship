    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a serious and challenging syndrome. Globally 26 million people are&#xD;
      living with this chronic disease and the prevalence is still increasing. Besides this growing&#xD;
      number in prevalence, HF is also responsible for almost 1 million hospitalizations a year in&#xD;
      the US and in Europe. Consequently, this has a major economic impact especially due to&#xD;
      recurrent admissions of these patients. Adequate prediction of decompensation could prevent&#xD;
      (un)necessary admissions as a result of heart failure. Philips is developing a Bayesian&#xD;
      Hemodynamics model for general practitioners. This model uses different observables, which&#xD;
      can be measured at home. The outcome of the model could be used as an aid in clinical&#xD;
      decision making in HF patients.&#xD;

      Heart failure (HF) is a world-wide problem. At the moment 26 million people are living with&#xD;
      this chronic disease and the prevalence is still increasing. Besides this growing number in&#xD;
      prevalence, HF is also responsible for almost 1 million hospitalizations a year in the US and&#xD;
      in Europe. Consequently, this has also a major economic impact especially due to recurrent&#xD;
      admissions of these patients. Adequate prediction of decompensation could prevent&#xD;
      (un)necessary admissions as a result of heart failure. Philips is developing a Bayesian model&#xD;
      for chronic heart failure, enabling monitoring of patients with heart failure in the hospital&#xD;
      and at home. An important characteristic of such a Bayesian model is that it is a&#xD;
      knowledge-based model, in contrast to data-mining based models, and requires only a few&#xD;
      patient data to get started (10-20 patients). Another important characteristic is that these&#xD;
      'knowledge-based models' are applicable in any setting, again in contrast to data-mining&#xD;
      based models. This makes the proposed model different from conventional data-mining&#xD;
      approaches to modelling. During a hospital admission, the model will be &quot;filled in&quot; with&#xD;
      personal patient data. Subsequently, during the rest of the hospital stay or after release&#xD;
      from the hospital, a number of symptoms and lab measurement variables (&quot;observables&quot;), will&#xD;
      be the input for the model. The output of the model (the result) will be a probability of&#xD;
      improvement (versus worsening) of the condition of the patient or the status of the heart&#xD;
      failure condition on a scale (from 1-10). The model can deal with less input variables than&#xD;
      the number it has been &quot;personalized&quot; with. With less input measurements, naturally the&#xD;
      reliability of the result will be reduced. This modelling approach basically captures the&#xD;
      clinical way of thinking into a model. If interpreted in the right way using smart Bayesian&#xD;
      modelling, the GP or geriatrician will be able to monitor and treat the majority of heart&#xD;
      failure patients. This fits in current thinking to reduce HC costs by keeping patients at&#xD;
      home and out of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation is designed to evaluate whether the outcome of the &quot;Bayesian&#xD;
      Hemodynamics model&quot; compares with the cardiologist's status assessment. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to validate the computer model that has been developed to assess the status of a&#xD;
      heart failure patient. With the model, the investigators aim to support healthcare&#xD;
      professionals with early detection of deterioration of heart failure patients and with&#xD;
      providing the right treatment when it is needed. If successful, this could help heart failure&#xD;
      patients to stay at home longer and reduce hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical literature review is documented in report, Personalized Heart Failure Monitoring&#xD;
      using a Bayesian network, Anja v.d. Stolpe, Wim Verhaegh, Folke Noertemann, PR-TN 2017/00180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is needed, because no complete datasets, including ground truth&#xD;
      assessments by cardiologists, are available, neither in existing databases, nor in clinical&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation needs to be performed on a population that fulfills the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria described in Chapter 6, because the &quot;Bayesian Hemodynamics&#xD;
      model&quot; is only valid for these cases.&#xD;
