  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety of inhaled SNG001 and the ability of inhaled&#xD;
      SNG001 to 'switch on' the cells' anti-viral defences in patients with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD). The study consist of two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will assess the safety of inhaled SNG001 in ten patients with stable COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will assess efficacy and safety of inhaled SNG001 in 120 patients with COPD with a&#xD;
      cold or COPD exacerbation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When people with COPD get a respiratory virus such as a cold or flu it often increases their&#xD;
      COPD symptoms, leading them to require treatment with either antibiotics or oral steroids and&#xD;
      severely affecting their quality of life. SNG001 is the study medication, and it contains&#xD;
      interferon beta (interferon-β) which is a natural antiviral protein. In this study we will&#xD;
      look to see whether inhaled SNG001 can boost anti-viral responses and minimise the worsening&#xD;
      of COPD symptoms/lung function when patients have a confirmed respiratory virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 ten COPD patients without a respiratory virus will be randomised to receive three&#xD;
      days of SNG001 or placebo. The aim of this part of the study is to assess safety of SNG001 in&#xD;
      COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 COPD patients will contact the research team when they experience cold or flu&#xD;
      symptoms or a deterioration of their COPD symptoms. At this point, eligible patients will&#xD;
      undergo a virus detection test and those that test positive for a virus will be randomised&#xD;
      1:1 to receive SNG001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. The first dose of study medication&#xD;
      will be administered within 48 hours. Other assessments will be performed during the 14 days&#xD;
      of treatment to look for changes in anti-viral biomarkers, lung function and COPD symptoms.&#xD;
      Patients will also be followed up 14 days post end of treatment.&#xD;

In Part 1 the ratio will be 4:1 and in Part 2 the ratio will be 1:1, both according to a pre-specified randomisation schedule.

&#xD;
          5. Should have stable COPD, having no symptoms of an exacerbation and/or respiratory&#xD;
             tract infection currently and/or within the past 6 weeks of screening and/or&#xD;
             randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Should be prescribed and taking regularly one or more long acting bronchodilators&#xD;
             (e.g. long acting β2 agonist [LABA], long acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA]) with or&#xD;
             without an inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy for their COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who produce sputum most days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient produced an adequate sputum sample at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female patients must be 1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using an&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception. Women should have been stable on their chosen&#xD;
             method of birth control for a minimum of 3 months before entering the trial and should&#xD;
             continue with birth control for 1 month after the last dose. In addition to the&#xD;
             acceptable birth control method (except for the practice of total sexual abstinence),&#xD;
             condom (in UK with spermicides) should be used by the male partner for sexual&#xD;
             intercourse from randomisation (Visit 2) and for 1 month after the last dose to&#xD;
             prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and&#xD;
             prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently&#xD;
             sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who&#xD;
             are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &lt;50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatment and if follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are in the&#xD;
                  postmenopausal range. If the FSH result is not available at the time of&#xD;
                  randomization, the patient must have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use&#xD;
                  highly effective contraception methods until the FSH result is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women ≥50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Motivation (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with protocol requirements and&#xD;
             complete all study visits, including the ability to communicate well with the&#xD;
             Investigator and be capable of understanding the nature of the research and its&#xD;
             treatment (including its risks and potential benefits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        PART 2 - pre-treatment Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, between and including 40-85 years of age at the time of the consent&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A confirmed physician diagnosis of COPD or a medical history consistent with a&#xD;
             diagnosis of COPD for at least 12 months prior to the consent visit.&#xD;

          3. Current or ex-smoker with ≥ 10 pack years of smoking history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Post bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Post bronchodilator FEV1 ≥40% of the predicted value. Once the safety data for the&#xD;
             first 16 patients have been reviewed and approved by the DSMC the criterion will be&#xD;
             changed to a post bronchodilator of FEV1 ≥30% of the predicted value*.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. To have had 1 or more COPD exacerbations in the last 12 months requiring intervention&#xD;
             with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics.&#xD;

             without an inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy for their COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients on self-management plans agree to consult a healthcare professional prior to&#xD;

             last dose of inhaled IFN-β-1a/matching placebo. In addition to the acceptable birth&#xD;
             control method (except for the practice of total sexual abstinence), condom (in UK&#xD;
             with spermicides) should be used by the male partner for sexual intercourse from&#xD;
             randomisation (Visit 2) and for 1 month after the last dose of inhaled&#xD;
             IFN-β-1a/matching placebo to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently&#xD;
             sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who&#xD;
             are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &lt;50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatment and if FSH levels are in the postmenopausal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women ≥50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
