  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally the measures of the optimally aesthetic breast have been assumed to be static&#xD;
      and to represent universal values (1). Measures developed for optimal aesthetic results in&#xD;
      breast reduction were derived from brassiere patterns and then applied universally (2). These&#xD;
      early and important papers still strongly influence the view of the aesthetics of the breast&#xD;
      despite the lack of individualisation and proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create satisfying results for specific patients, optimal proportions angles and relative&#xD;
      measures are needed for each patient. The study will clarify theses measures and provide&#xD;
      important guidelines for surgeons.The data will also help define optimal proportional&#xD;
      aesthetics in the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of universal beauty is unrealistic. It has always been taken for granted that&#xD;
      aesthetic values from all cultures are similar. Using 3D scanning on volunteers of youthful&#xD;
      age offers a complex set of data that may distinguish fine differences in aesthetic ideals in&#xD;
      different cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how life events and life-style factors affect breast aesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow a population with 3D scans over 5, 10 and 15 years will allow aesthetic ratings to&#xD;
      be correlated with life events such as pregnancy, childbirth, breast-feeding and life style&#xD;
      factors such as smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will improve the understanding of breast aesthetics in general, in different&#xD;
      cultures and in relation to life events and life style factors. No similar studies have&#xD;
      previously been performed.&#xD;

      Aims for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify aesthetic factors that contribute to overall beauty and aesthetics of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify proportions and measures of the most aesthetically pleasing breast and also of&#xD;
      the least appealing breast. This will provide a guideline and a map for the reconstructive&#xD;
      breast surgeon in what to aim for and what to avoid in the breast reconstructive process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify cultural differences in the perception of beauty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims for the longitudinal part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify lifestyle and life event factors that independently influences the progression of&#xD;
      cosmetic ratings and 3D measurements of the breast over 5, 10 and 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify trends and differences in aesthetic ratings of the same 3D scans over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial and all following controls of the study a short patient interview will be&#xD;
      conducted to obtain the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject demographics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, Race, Previous Medical History, Number of Childbirths, Breast feeding - how many&#xD;
      children - how many months per child, Surgeries of the breast, Surgeries of the chest wall,&#xD;
      Weight, Height, Bra Size, Sports bra use - always - during sports - rarely - never, Smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol, Occupation, Physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of the breast will be obtained by 3D scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating of the 3D scans will be performed by eight assigned teams:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 Plastic Surgeons from Scandinavia, 10 Plastic Surgeons from Texas, 10 Scandinavian nurses&#xD;
      without formal aesthetic or plastic surgery training, 10 Nurses and/or Physician assistants&#xD;
      from the USA without formal aesthetic or plastic surgery training, 10 Medical Students from&#xD;
      Texas, 10 Medical Students from Scandinavia, 10 Nursing Students from Texas, 10 Nursing&#xD;
      Students from Scandinavia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3D scans will be aesthetically rated by independent evaluators on a scale from 1-5. The&#xD;
      vertical split plane and the horizontal split plane as defined by Tepper et al (8) in&#xD;
      mammometrics will be used to subdivide the breast into aesthetic units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate rating will be obtained for each breast:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower pole 1-5, Upper pole 1-5, Medial pole 1-5, Lateral pole 1-5, Nipple position 1-5,&#xD;
      Areola color 1-5, Areola size 1-5, Breast footprint position, Overall score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also both breasts together will be scored regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermammary distance / breast cleft, symmetry, overall bilateral score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored for 16 years. The data will be stored in a password -protected&#xD;
      computer with firewall protection. The data will be stored in a locked safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation. Various subgroup&#xD;
      analyses may occur - continuous variables will be compared using the two sample T-test and&#xD;
      parametric variables will be compared using chi-squared analysis or Fischer's exact test.&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariate regression models will be used to analyze for confounding&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical calculations will be performed in Norway at the Dept of statistics at&#xD;
      Rikshospitalet Oslo and/or in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rating-system for aesthetics will be tested for reliability. Ten raters will be rating 30&#xD;
      of the same 3D scans twice with a 2 week interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of necessary number of participating women (n) as determined in collaboration&#xD;
      with the Dept of Statistics Oslo University:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study a mean score of &quot;overall score bilateral breasts&quot; will be compared in 10&#xD;
      American (Group 1, 3, 5, 7) and 10 Scandinavian/Norwegian (Group 2, 4, 6, 8) plastic&#xD;
      surgeons/nurses/medical students/nursing students. We define a mean &quot;overall score bilateral&#xD;
      breasts&quot; score difference of at least 0.5 to be a difference of statistical significance.&#xD;
      Significance will be defined as p = 0.05. In order to perform a power calculation we need an&#xD;
      estimate of the standard deviation (SD) of the scoring of &quot;overall score bilateral breasts&quot;&#xD;
      within each group. However such estimates are not available in the literature. We therefore&#xD;
      will use the following procedure to calculate (n):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Include 10 women and measure average score on &quot;overall score bilateral breasts&quot; for&#xD;
      each plastic surgeon. Then calculate SD for each of the average scores in each group. Then we&#xD;
      will use these estimates of SD in a power calculation, and calculate the (n) associated with&#xD;
      a test power of 80% as per Sandvik.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary estimation of power is 150 patients. The somewhat high number is due to&#xD;
      potential drop out rates for the longitudinal arm of the study.&#xD;

      Canfield Inc / Skintech are not active partners in the project, just partners supplying&#xD;
      technology and support. The name of the 3D Vectra system will be used in the paper to&#xD;
      scientifically describe the study. Canfield Inc will be mentioned in the Method section of&#xD;
      the study as contributing to the study and any conflicts of interests will be disclosed in&#xD;
      all and any presentations and publications. No funds have been received from Canfield Inc.&#xD;
      Canfield Inc has allowed use of the Vectra 3D camera in the study without any demands or&#xD;
      charges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aesthetic measures are the basis of all plastic surgical breast procedures and this study&#xD;
      will have a major influence on all of plastic surgical procedures of the breast -&#xD;
      particularly breast reconstruction. Determining a difference between aesthetic ratings in&#xD;
      different cultures would further stress the concept of &quot;beauty lying in the eye of the&#xD;
      beholder&quot; and that beauty concepts have to be adapted to the individual and not the other way&#xD;
      around. Beauty is not one strict measure, but a range of measures and proportions adapted to&#xD;
      the individual subject. The use of 3D scanning is a new technique that offers superior&#xD;
      quality documentation and preoperative analysis. The study will further define 3D scanning as&#xD;
      a new standard for aesthetic breast evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the long term follow up the factors affecting aesthetic ratings over time (aging of the&#xD;
      breast), such as smoking, would be revealed. This could further allow life style choices to&#xD;
      be made by patients promoting breast aesthetics and hopefully health in general.&#xD;
