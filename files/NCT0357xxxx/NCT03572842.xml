      The best renal replacement therapy is kidney transplantation. It improves end-stage renal&#xD;
      kidney disease (ESRD) patients quality of life and increases their survival, but still&#xD;
      remains risky. Morbidity in kidney transplantation is dominated by two main complications :&#xD;
      acute graft rejection and infections. To maintain an accurate balance between rejection and&#xD;
      infection, immunosuppressive therapy must to be used with caution and kept into a tight&#xD;
      spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators dispose of a new test measuring interferon gamma production after T cells&#xD;
      and Natural Killers (NK) in vitro stimulation : QuantiFERON Monitor® (QFM). They hypothesized&#xD;
      QFM monitoring could improve management after kidney transplantation providing functional&#xD;
      immune data to optimize balance between rejection and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess whether QFM could be an objective biomarker to predict&#xD;
      infection and rejection risks after kidney transplantation.&#xD;

      The best renal replacement therapy is kidney transplantation. It improves end-stage renal&#xD;
      kidney disease (ESRD) patients quality of life and increases their survival, but still&#xD;
      remains risky. Morbidity in kidney transplantation is dominated by two main complications :&#xD;
      acute graft rejection and infections. According to literature, acute rejection appears in&#xD;
      more than 10% of kidney graft recipients. The first month after transplantation is frequently&#xD;
      affected by bacterial infections such as pneumopathies (4.5 to 16%), urinary tract infections&#xD;
      (22.7 to 56.7 %), surgical site infections (7.3 to 18.5%) and bacteremia (3.5 to 4.6%). Then,&#xD;
      during the first year, infections, most of them opportunist ones, are essentially due to&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (8%), BK virus (most than 10%) and herpes simplex reactivation (most than&#xD;
      50%). Those immunosuppressed patients can also develop community acquired infections :&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections (flu or bacterial pneumonias) or urinary tract infections.&#xD;
      Therefore, long-term anticalcineurin use can lead to chronic graft dysfunction. To maintain&#xD;
      an accurate balance between rejection and infection, immunosuppressive therapy must to be&#xD;
      used with caution and kept into a tight spectrum. To guide physicians maintaining this&#xD;
      balance, therapeutic drug monitoring is performed in routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An objective marker for cellular immune response, based on cellular immunodeficiency status&#xD;
      specific for each patient could, guide a personalized immunosuppressive treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators now dispose of a new test measuring interferon gamma production after T cells&#xD;
      and Natural Killers (NK) in vitro stimulation : QuantiFERON Monitor® (QFM). They hypothesized&#xD;

&#xD;
      The investigators plan to perform a monocentric interventional prospective study. They will&#xD;
      dose QFM at D0, before patients discharge (between D7 and D21), M3 and M6 after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Patients will be followed up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their primary endpoint will be non specific cellular immunity evaluation after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation using serial measurements of QFM. Their secondary endpoints will be : (i)&#xD;
      correlate QFM levels with infectious risk, (ii) and with graft rejection, (iii) correlate QFM&#xD;
      levels with lymphocytes sub-populations monitoring.&#xD;
