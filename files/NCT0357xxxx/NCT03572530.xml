  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the optimum dose frequency of 5-Azacytidin (5-AZA) infusions&#xD;
      into the fourth ventricle of the brain. The study's primary objective is to establish the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose for infusions of 5-Azacytidine into the fourth ventricle in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent ependymoma. The study's secondary objective is to assess the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of 5-Azacytidine infusions into the fourth ventricle based upon imaging studies and&#xD;
      cytology.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participants who experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as any of the following events:&#xD;
New neurological deficit (grade 3 or higher) probably or definitely attributed to intraventricular 5-azacytidine infusions.&#xD;
New adverse event involving any organ probably or definitely attributed to intraventricular 5-azacytidine infusions with the specific exclusion of: Grade 3 or higher nausea and vomiting &lt; 3 days duration and grade 3 or higher headache &lt; 3 days duration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with disease progression as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day after surgery to remove tumor (which is about 1 week before the first infusion)</time_frame>
    <description>The PI and radiologist will determine Response to treatment according to the following three categories. Disease progression corresponds with the &quot;Progressive Disease&quot; category.&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. Stable Disease (SD) / Incomplete Response (IR): The persistence of one or more non-target lesions.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <description>5-AZA (12 mg) will be prepared in preservative-free normal saline to a total volume of 1.2ml. 5-AZA will be infused over a minimum of 30 seconds. 5-AZA will be followed by a 1 ml preservative-free normal saline flush over a minimum of 30 seconds.&#xD;
Patients will receive two, three, or four 5-AZA infusions per week depending on the dosing algorithm (see below). We refer to these dosing schedules as dose 1, 2, or 3.&#xD;
Patients assigned to dose 1 will receive two 5-AZA infusions per week (typically Monday and Thursday but may be given on other days based upon logistical considerations) for 8 consecutive weeks.</description>
