      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited blood disorder. Many people with SCD are at&#xD;
      risk to get pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH means that the blood pressure in the blood&#xD;
      vessels to the lungs is high, and is a serious disease and. Very few studies have looked at&#xD;
      the success of treatments for PH in people with SCD. Researchers want to learn more about&#xD;
      treating PH with a type of drug called phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I). They&#xD;
      will look at the records of people who have already joined other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify people who already joined NIH SCD protocols whose medical records should be&#xD;
      reviewed. The review will look at the description of SCD patients with PH who have already&#xD;
      taken PDE5-I and the outcomes for these people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with SCD and PH. They must have joined certain NIH studies and taken&#xD;
      PDE5-I therapy for at least 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a review of medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect data from databases of existing studies. They will identify people&#xD;
      in those studies who have SCD and PH and took the study drug for at least 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will review the full medical records of those people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From that review, researchers will find participants who meet the inclusion criteria. They&#xD;
      will extract data from those records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will analyze the data. This includes results from heart and lung tests, imaging,&#xD;
      and walking tests. It will also include results of a procedure called right heart&#xD;
      catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data and lab data will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will remove identifying information from the data, then share it in a database.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of evidence-based treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is a leading cause of mortality in SCD and is an independent&#xD;
      risk factor for mortality in this population. SCD is a major health problem worldwide,&#xD;
      primarily affecting people of African descent. In the United States approximately 100,000&#xD;
      individuals have SCD and 0.2% of African Americans have homozygous SS sickle cell disease,&#xD;
      while 8% of African Americans carry one allele and have sickle cell trait. In developed&#xD;
      countries, even in the current era of hydroxyurea, SCD patients have relatively shortened&#xD;
      lifespans with a median life expectancy of approximately 48 years for females and 42 years&#xD;
      for males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PH affects up to 1/3 of adults screened by echocardiography and pre-capillary PH is diagnosed&#xD;
      in 6% by right heart catheterization (RHC). Data suggest that either precapillary or&#xD;
      post-capillary PH in SCD are associated with a 5-fold risk of early mortality, and SCD&#xD;
      subjects with echocardiographic signs of both have a 13-fold risk of early mortality. Though&#xD;
      a cause and effect relationship between the presence of PH and early mortality in adult&#xD;
      subjects with SCD has not been conclusively established, data regarding the causes of death&#xD;
      in a prospective observational study of adult SCD patients suggest that cardiopulmonary cause&#xD;
      of death was present in at least 35% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified SCD-related PH as Group 5 in 2013.&#xD;
      Therefore, SCD-related PH is not eligible for vasodilator therapies currently available for&#xD;
      WHO Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There have only been three prospective&#xD;
      clinical trials of vasodilator therapies in sickle cell patients with RHC-defined PH. After&#xD;
      the findings of the Walk-PHaSST study were reported, a strong recommendation against&#xD;
      sildenafil in sickle cell patients with PH was made in guidelines published by the American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society in 2014. However, a major limitation of the trial was that, in order to&#xD;
      improve trial feasibility, subjects were eligible for enrollment based on an elevated TRV, as&#xD;
      well as RHC-defined PH, leading to incomplete hemodynamic characterization of study patients.&#xD;
      The physiologic understanding of the differences between subjects who developed SAEs and&#xD;
      those who tolerated sildenafil remains poorly understood. In individual circumstances, some&#xD;
      patients may have chosen to continue sildenafil. If some patients with SCD-related PH have&#xD;
      continued to benefit from sildenafil therapy in the time since this clinical trial was&#xD;
      reported, it would raise the question of whether a subgroup of SCD-related PH patients may&#xD;
      still benefit from PDE5-Is and how these patients could be clinically characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the difficulty of enrolling SCD-related PH patients into prospective, multi-center&#xD;
      trials, for example as demonstrated by the ASSET trials being closed due to low enrollment,&#xD;
      we plan to utilize existing clinical data available on patients who were documented to have&#xD;
      RHC- defined PH prior to initiation of PDEI-5 therapy, in order to better characterize the&#xD;
      use of this medication in patients with SCD-related PH.&#xD;
