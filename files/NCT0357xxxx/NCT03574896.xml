      Purpose: To evaluate the performance of AKIpredictor, a computer-based algorithm that&#xD;
      predicts the development of AKI in the 7 days following ICU admission, by comparing it with&#xD;
      similar predictions made by attending physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare the performances of AKIpredictor and physicians in predicting&#xD;
      AKI stage 2 or 3 in the 7 days following ICU admission Secondary objective(s): To investigate&#xD;
      the influence of the level of seniority of the physician on the accuracy of the predictions;&#xD;
      feasibility of making predictions within a 3 hour window for physicians Trial Design:&#xD;
      Monocentric, prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional Endpoints: Primary: comparing the&#xD;
      area under the ROC curves of the AKIpredictor and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: estimation of PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity of both predictors at&#xD;
      different thresholds; evaluation of alternative negative endpoints (ICU readmission after&#xD;
      discharge, death); subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: This is a pilot study. Sample size calculations to obtain sufficient power are&#xD;
      not feasible due to lack of previous studies. The investigation will be conducted with a&#xD;
      preset end time on June 30th. The investigators expect to include approximately 150 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of eligibility criteria: All adult patients admitted to UZ Leuven's surgical ICU in&#xD;
      the period of the study, with the exclusion of those with end-stage renal disease or AKI&#xD;
      already present at the time of admission&#xD;

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients admitted to the UZ Leuven's ICU after the approval of the study by the&#xD;
      local Ethical Committee and before June 30th 2018 will be included in the study. The only&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be the presence of end-stage renal disease before or of AKI on ICU&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer predictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elements from laboratory reports, clinical history and physiological monitoring will be used&#xD;
      both by clinicians and by the computer algorithm to estimate the risk of AKI. Such&#xD;
      measurements are part of the routine standard care in the ICU: no additional exam will be&#xD;
      required for this study. These values are regularly stored in the electronic health care&#xD;
      system (KWS, Klinisch Werkstation and iMDsoft's MetaVision). They will be retrieved in&#xD;
      read-only mode when needed for formulating the predictions. The retrieval will take place&#xD;
      regularly on a weekly basis in order to limit the amount of time that patients'&#xD;
      identification data will be stored for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In detail, the following parameters will be used by the computer model:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  upon admission: age, baseline serum creatinine (lowest value of the previous 3 months;&#xD;
           if not available, calculated using the Schwartz formula), surgical or medical category&#xD;
           (transplant surgery / cardiovascular surgery / abdominal or pelvic surgery / thoracic&#xD;
           surgery / other: medical, trauma, other surgery), planned admission (yes / no), history&#xD;
           of diabetes (yes / no), blood glucose, suspected sepsis (yes / no), and hemodynamic&#xD;
           support (none / mechanical / pharmacological / both);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the first morning after admission: serum creatinine (measured in the morning), APACHE&#xD;
           II score, blood lactate (worst value since admission), total bilirubin, and hours of ICU&#xD;
           stay;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at 24h after admission: hourly urine output, doses of inotropes and vasopressors, and&#xD;
           continuous arterial blood pressure values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians predictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians' predictions will be collected alternatively through interviews conducted&#xD;
      personally by one of the investigators or by means of a questionnaire compiled by the&#xD;
      physicians themselves. To parallel the timing of AKIpredictor, clinicians' predictions will&#xD;
      be gathered at three time-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  admission predictions: at the earliest after admission (up to 3h);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morning predictions: on the first morning after admission, right before or after the&#xD;
           handoffs that take place between 8.30 and 9.00 AM;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24h predictions: at 24h after admission (up to 24h+3h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews to multiple physicians about the same patient in the same time frame will be&#xD;
      encouraged, as long as they are not influenced by one another (junior resident, senior&#xD;
      resident, staff member).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every prediction, both a continuous (on a 0-100 % scale) and a binary (yes / no) estimate&#xD;
      of AKI risk will be inquired. A self-assessed degree of confidence about the prediction will&#xD;
      also be tracked (very confident / medium confident / not confident at all). The exact time at&#xD;
      which the human prediction is collected will be saved. Finally, data about the clinician&#xD;
      expressing the prediction will be tracked: age, gender, seniority (see above), years of ICU&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint assessment The effective development of AKI will be diagnosed in agreement with the&#xD;
      2012 KDIGO guidelines [1]. To take into account AKI occurring outside the ICU where hourly&#xD;
      measurements of urine output are not recorded, only the creatinine criterion will be used.&#xD;
      Serum creatinine values will be collected from the electronic health record system KWS&#xD;
      (Klinisch WerkStation) each day for 7 days following ICU admission. This biochemical exam is&#xD;
      routinely performed on a daily basis in any hospitalized patient unless considered at low&#xD;
      risk for complications, and it is always required if there's suspicion of an acute renal&#xD;
      insult. For these reasons, potential missing creatinine values will be considered evidence of&#xD;
      an improving patient and absence of AKI for that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU discharge and eventual readmission will also be tracked for secondary analyses. The death&#xD;
      of the patient will also be recorded and included among the negative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy The efficacy of both predictors will be evaluated with the&#xD;
      construction of ROC curves. Due to the lack of previous studies on the subject, a current&#xD;
      estimate of the accuracy of clinicians' prediction of AKI is not currently available.&#xD;
      Appropriate sample size calculations to obtain sufficient power are therefore not feasible at&#xD;
      the moment. Statistical analysis will be performed at the end of the data collection as&#xD;
      follows. A ROC curve will be plotted both for the computer-based AKIpredictor and the&#xD;
      continuous (%) estimate of AKI risk assessed by the clinicians at each of the three&#xD;
      time-points (upon admission, on day 1 and at 24 hours). The area under the curve (AUC) of&#xD;
      each plot will be calculated. The AUCs will then be compared in pairs by bootstrapping, and a&#xD;
      significance value of the comparison will be derived. Subgroup analysis will be performed&#xD;
      with the same approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and regulatory approvals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (current version) and the principles of good clinical practice. This protocol will be&#xD;
      submitted to the ethical committee of the UZ Leuven. Any eventual subsequent protocol&#xD;
      amendment will also be submitted to the ethical committee and Regulatory Authorities for&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By virtue of its non-interventional nature and that all the data will be stored in anonymized&#xD;
      fashion, informed consent will not be required from the subjects if this is deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the local Ethical Committee. The investigators shall treat all information and&#xD;
      data relating to the study as confidential and shall not disclose such information to any&#xD;
      third parties or use such information for any purpose other than the performance of the&#xD;
      study. The collection, processing and disclosure of personal data, such as patient health and&#xD;
      medical information is subject to compliance with applicable personal data protection and the&#xD;
      processing of personal data (Directive 95/46/EC and Belgian law of December 8, 1992 on the&#xD;
      Protection of the Privacy in relation to the Processing of Personal Data).&#xD;
