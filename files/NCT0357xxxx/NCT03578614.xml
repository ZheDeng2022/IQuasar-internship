  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is one of the most frequent causes of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment associated with aging. So far, there is no approved treatment for VCI. Recent&#xD;
      studies have suggested a protective effect from physical activity but adequate studies are&#xD;
      lacking in this field. The AFIVASC study - a Portuguese acronym for &quot;physical activity in&#xD;
      vascular cognitive impairment&quot; is a randomized controlled study, single-blinded,&#xD;
      nonpharmacological which aims to explore the benefits of physical activity in vascular&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (VCI)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vascular cognitive impairment is one of the most frequent causes of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      associated with aging. Vascular cognitive impairment includes clinical deficits due to&#xD;
      vascular subclinical brain injury, silent lesions or due to clinically overt stroke, and&#xD;
      appears frequently associated with Alzheimer disease. Vascular cognitive impairment has a&#xD;
      spectrum of manifestations, from mild to extreme manifestation (Vascular Dementia) that&#xD;
      represents the second most frequent cause of dementia. There is no approved treatment for&#xD;
      vascular cognitive impairment, and pharmacological trials have generated disappointing&#xD;
      results. As a result, nowadays, treatment is solely based on the control of vascular risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking is a physical activity recommended for the prevention of coronary disease. Besides,&#xD;
      it is a physical activity without additional costs, easily accessible to the general&#xD;
      population, and can be used in the whole population. Physical activity can potentially&#xD;
      prevent functional decline associated with aging and promote global health status. In recent&#xD;
      years, a growing interest has been given to the impact of physical activity as a protective&#xD;
      factor for cognitive decline and for the progression for dementia There are several&#xD;
      explanations for the protective effect in cognition: physical activity can implicate a better&#xD;
      physical and global mental status, but can also be mediated through metabolic,&#xD;
      physiopathological effects, as the increase cerebral inflow, the reduction of vascular risk&#xD;
      factors, the decrease of production of stress hormones or still better endothelial function,&#xD;
      among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no consensus in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies showed a protective effect of physical activity in Alzheimer disease. Protective&#xD;
      effect of physical activity on vascular cognitive impairment (including dementia) has still&#xD;
      to be proved. There are small studies with short follow-up, that do not take in consideration&#xD;
      relevant confounding factors or imaging data (e.g. evidence of small vessel disease) with&#xD;
      controversial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a large observational study showed the beneficial impact of physical activity&#xD;
      (defined according to the American Heart Association as at least 30 minutes of physical&#xD;
      activity at least 3 times a week) in the reduction of the risk of progression for vascular&#xD;
      dementia, in a cohort of subjects older than 65 years old, living independently, with&#xD;
      cerebral white matter changes, and controlling for confounding factors. Additionally, in&#xD;
      subjects with evidence of small vessel disease and no cognitive decline, physical activity&#xD;
      was associated with better executive performance overtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing studies do not come from adequate randomized and double-blind designs, so there&#xD;
      is no evidence-based data to sustain a recommendation for the type, intensity or frequency of&#xD;
      physical activity, and the long-term gain. Given these contradictory findings, it becomes&#xD;
      relevant to have an evidence-base to recommend physical activity in vascular cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and in what concerns the type, intensity, and frequency of activity which would be&#xD;
      necessary to achieve longterm gains.&#xD;

    <description>3 physical activity sessions are planned by week, 2 supervised and 1 non-supervised conducted over 6 months. On the first 2 months, the supervised sessions have 10 minutes of warm-up + 5 minutes active pause (balance, agility and coordinative exercises) + 15 minutes walking + 5 minutes active pause (resistance exercises - 1 series of 12 repetitions&#xD;
- 3 callisthenic exercises) + 15 minutes walking + 5 minutes flexibility (1 series of 10 seconds in 3 different postures). The aimed intensity in these first two months is 12/13. Between the 2nd and the 4th months, the duration of the walking period increases, as well as the intensity, RPE 13/14. Between the 4th and the 6th months, again the duration of the walking period increases, as well as the intensity, RPE 14/15. To measure the intensity level of the physical activity, the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) ranging from 6 (rest) to 20 (maximum effort) is used.</description>
