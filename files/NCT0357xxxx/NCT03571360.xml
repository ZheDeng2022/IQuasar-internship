  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the&#xD;
      IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands,&#xD;
      PD-L1 and PD-L2. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the&#xD;
      therapy of with chemotherapy pretreated NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 1%) on&#xD;
      tumor cells. In addition, pembrolizumab was approved for the first line treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50%) on tumor cells.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be given in a flat dose of 200 mg i.v. every 3 weeks until disease&#xD;
      progression, toxicity or patient withdrawal for a maximum of 2 years. Patients with untreated&#xD;
      advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma, without an EGFR mutation or ALK translocation, will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational&#xD;
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has received radiotherapy within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment or&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
