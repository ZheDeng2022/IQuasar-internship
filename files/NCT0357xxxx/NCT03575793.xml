  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I/II study, with a dose escalation part (Phase I) and a&#xD;
      single-arm part (Phase II), in patients with recurrent SCLC who progressed after first-line&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy and who are candidates for second line therapy. No PK evaluation&#xD;
      is planned in this study as nivolumab and ipilimumab are unlikely to alter plinabulin's PK,&#xD;
      since the route of excretion is different.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I/II study, with a dose escalation part (Phase I) and a single&#xD;
      arm part (Phase II), in patients with recurrent SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase I part, patients will receive plinabulin at escalating doses in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab. Doses of study drug will be administered as intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusions in 21 day cycles. Patients will receive all study drugs on Day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
      After 4 treatment cycles, ipilimumab is stopped and patients continue treatment with&#xD;
      nivolumab and plinabulin every 2 weeks (maintenance period) or until disease progression,&#xD;
      development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 3 patients will be enrolled in each cohort, starting at 20 mg/m2 of plinabulin. The&#xD;
      dose of plinabulin will be escalated in sequential patient cohorts after the safety data from&#xD;
      the first cycle is reviewed. Thereafter the dose of plinabulin will be escalated to 30 mg/m2,&#xD;
      provided that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not observed per the specified criteria,&#xD;
      until the RP2D is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase II part, up to 26 patients will be treated with the triple combination of&#xD;
      plinabulin (at RP2D) + nivolumab + ipilimumab. Patients will continue treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation occurs.&#xD;

                  control includes (a) intrauterine device plus 1 barrier method; (b) on stable&#xD;
                  doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable,&#xD;
                  implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective&#xD;
                  barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams&#xD;
                  or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized partner.&#xD;
