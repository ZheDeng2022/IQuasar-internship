      The cesarean section is a bloody operation, about 750 to 1000 ml are lost at most operations&#xD;
      and over 1000 ml of blood have lost to bring them into the definition of a postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage (PPH). In developing countries, PPH is the main cause of maternal deaths. Uterine&#xD;
      atony is the most common cause of immediate heavy PPH.Multiple pregnancy ones of a common&#xD;
      factor for uterine atony. The administration of oxytocic's after the delivery of the neonate&#xD;
      reduces the likelihood of PPH and 5 IU oxytocin by slow intravenous injection is currently&#xD;
      recommended for all cesarean sections. However, the use of additional oxytocic medication is&#xD;
      common, to arrest bleeding, or prophylactically if there are risk factors for PPH .&#xD;
      Carbetocin is a synthetic analog of human oxytocin with structural modifications that&#xD;
      increase its half-life, thereby prolonging its pharmacological effects. Carbetocin has been&#xD;
      approved in 23 countries for prevention of uterine atony and excessive bleeding following&#xD;
      cesarean delivery in spinal or epidural anesthesia. Oxytocin is a peptide of nine amino acids&#xD;
      (Nona peptide). The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of arginine vasopressin,&#xD;
      whose sequence differs from oxytocin by 2 amino acids. The best-known mechanism for oxytocin&#xD;
      to exert its stimulatory effect on myometrial contractility is by increasing the&#xD;
      intracellular concentration of calcium. Owing to its short plasma half-life (mean 3 min), a&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion is required to maintain the uterus in a contracted state. The&#xD;
      usual dose is 20 IU in 500 ml of crystalloid solution, with the dosage rate adjusted&#xD;
      according to response. Ergometrine is a selective and moderately potent tryptaminergic&#xD;
      receptor antagonist in various smooth muscles, being only a partially agonistic or&#xD;
      antagonistic at tryptaminergic receptors in the central nervous system. In blood vessels, the&#xD;
      alkaloid is only weakly antagonistic of dopaminergic receptors and partially agonistic of&#xD;
      α-adrenergic receptors. oxytocin (19%). Blood loss&gt;500 ml was only observed in women who&#xD;
      received oxytocin. The aim of the investigator's study was to compare the effect of&#xD;
      carbetocin vs. oxytocin and ergometrine for prevention of PPH during cesarean section in&#xD;
      women with multiple pregnancies.&#xD;

      Women included in the study were divided into 2 groups: Group (A): included patients who&#xD;
      received carbetocin 100 µg diluted in 10 ml normal saline and administered slowly (over 30-60&#xD;
      seconds) intravenously by anesthetist after the birth of the baby. Group (B): included&#xD;
      patients who received a combination of intraoperative oxytocin 5 I.U which was diluted in 10&#xD;
      ml normal saline and administered slowly over (30-60 seconds) intravenously by anesthetist&#xD;
      and intramuscular ergometrine 0.2 mg. The slow administration has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      potentially harmful hemodynamic effects of oxytocin (and presumably carbetocin). Also,&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of ergometrine did the same. All women were subjected to full history&#xD;
      taking, general and obstetric examination and investigations in the form of preoperative&#xD;
      routine labs and obstetric ultrasound, and postoperative serum hemoglobin %.&#xD;
