  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation of edentulous spaces with dental implants has become a routine treatment&#xD;
      option as implants enjoy high survival rates over time. Accompanying this increase in implant&#xD;
      use, epidemiological studies have also reported escalating incidences of peri-implant&#xD;
      diseases. A recent meta-analysis reported that peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis&#xD;
      had high estimated weighted mean prevalences of 43% and 22% respectively. It is common&#xD;
      knowledge that gingivitis is the precursor of periodontitis. Similarly, peri-implant&#xD;
      mucositis too precedes peri-implantitis, which is a very challenging condition to treat.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is strongly recommended that peri-implant mucositis is managed effectively and&#xD;
      in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the inflammatory burden within the periodontium, mechanical plaque removal&#xD;
      is of utmost importance. Mechanical debridement alone, without any adjunctive aids e.g.&#xD;
      chlorhexidine, was found to be effective in preventing per-implant mucositis in short-term&#xD;
      clinical trials but did not always result in complete resolution of inflammation&#xD;
      (Heitz-Mayfield, et al. 2011, Schwarz, et al. 2015). Therefore, it can be speculated that&#xD;
      patient administered home care may play a role in eliminating soft tissue inflammation over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate and compare the efficacy of the barrel shaped and tapered&#xD;
      interdental brushes in reduction of soft tissue inflammation through removal of interproximal&#xD;
      plaque at both tooth and implant sites in patients with moderately rough surface tissue level&#xD;
      or bone level dental implants, which were restored with single screw or cement retained&#xD;
      crowns and in function for the past 2- 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that The barrel shaped interdental brush can remove more&#xD;
      supra- and sub-gingival plaque and thus have more reduction in soft tissue inflammation,&#xD;
      compared to the tapered interdental brush.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are two study phases during the whole course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Examiner Calibration: 15 volunteers will be recruited for examiner calibration before the&#xD;
      study period. The intra-examiner reliability will be assessed using intraclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficient. The following clinical parameters will be collected at day 0 and day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Probing pocket depths (PPD) (6 points per tooth) ii. Full mouth bleeding score (FMBS) iii.&#xD;
      Plaque at 8 sites (mesiobuccal, mesial, mesiolingual, lingual, distolingual, distal,&#xD;
      distobuccal, and buccal) per implant&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Study phase: Stratified randomized single-blinded clinical controlled trial with 2&#xD;
      parallel arms is designed to achieve the aims of this research project. Study participants&#xD;
      who are visiting University Dental Cluster or any other dental clinics or hospitals will be&#xD;
      referred for this study. They will be enrolled at NUH University Dental Cluster if they&#xD;
      fulfill the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will be randomly assigned into the&#xD;
      barrel shaped (test) and tapered (control) interdental brushes groups and reviewed at 2 weeks&#xD;
      (± 3 days) and 4 weeks (± 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be randomly assigned to either test or control group based on a computer&#xD;
      generated randomization code after the screening of inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      signing of the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Allocation Concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examiner who will be doing the clinical examination and collecting the study data&#xD;
      will be blinded to the group allocation; however, it is not possible to blind the study&#xD;
      subjects to the group allocation. The clinician, who will be performing the treatment and&#xD;
      providing oral hygiene instructions, will be given a sequentially numbered envelope&#xD;
      containing the subject's group allocation after non-surgical periodontal therapy has been&#xD;
      performed and before giving the oral hygiene instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Probing pocket depths (PPD) (6 points per tooth) ii. Full mouth bleeding score (FMBS) iii.&#xD;
      Full mouth plaque score (FMPS) iv. Plaque at 8 sites (mesiobuccal, mesial, mesiolingual,&#xD;
      lingual, distolingual, distal, distobuccal, and buccal) per implant v. Characteristics of the&#xD;
      implant and implant crown: tissue level or bone level, supra- or submucosal margin, degree of&#xD;
      overcontour as seen on periapical radiograph vi. Peri-apical radiograph of implant taken with&#xD;
      parallel technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters (i) to (iv) will be performed at baseline, 2-weeks and 4-weeks post&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameter (v) and (vi) will be performed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-apical radiographs will be only taken with paralleling technique to determine that there&#xD;
      is no peri-implant bone loss at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated based on changes in mean bleeding on probing (BOP) (primary&#xD;
      outcome measure) between baseline and at 2 weeks post instrumentation review. Based on a&#xD;
      previous study (Larsen, et al. 2017), investigators calculated that 88 subjects (44 per&#xD;
      group) would be needed with 5% significance level and 80% statistical power. If investigators&#xD;
      expect an attrition rate of 20%, a total of 110 subjects (55 per group) will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis on the primary outcome variable (BOP) will be performed.&#xD;
      Last-observation-carried-forward method will be used in the event of subjects lost to&#xD;
      follow-up to the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation for continuous variable; frequency and&#xD;
      percentage for categorical variable) will be reported to summarize the baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of study participants. Primary analysis will be patient-level analysis and&#xD;
      secondary analysis will be implant-level analysis. One implant, will be randomly selected by&#xD;
      computer generated random number, from each recruited subjects for patient-level analysis.&#xD;
      All implants from the recruited subjects will be included in the implant-level analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At patient-level analysis, to examine the effect of shape of interdental brush,&#xD;
      difference-in-difference technique will be used for study the changes of outcomes (e.g. BOP,&#xD;
      PPD, FMBS and FMPS) from baseline at 2-weeks. Two-way ANOVA test with adjusting for implant&#xD;
      types will also be performed to study the effect of interdental brush shape in the form of&#xD;
      changes in BOP, PPD, FMBS and FMPS, at 2-week. Similar analysis will be replicated for&#xD;
      secondary study endpoint at 4-week. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) will be applied to&#xD;
      incorporate repeated measures data collected at 2- and 4-weeks. Baseline data and types of&#xD;
      implants will be adjusted in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At implant-level analysis, to adjust for within-patient dependency, multilevel mixed effects&#xD;
      model will be built to assess the effect of interdental brush shape on the study outcome&#xD;
      variables (e.g. BOP, PPD, FMBS and FMPS) over time. A multilevel hierarchical three-level&#xD;
      structure was chosen with three levels of analysis being: timing of follow-up measurements&#xD;
      (level 1), implant (level 2), and patient (level 3). Baseline values of study outcome&#xD;
      variables and types of implants will be adjusted in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance level for all analysis is set at p-value &lt;0.05. All statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out using STATA SE Version 15.0 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release&#xD;
      15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).&#xD;
