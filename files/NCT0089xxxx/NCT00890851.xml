  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TUNA is a known and already old technique. There exists, in the literature, a certain&#xD;
      number of studies showing the long-term effectiveness (5 years), evaluated on the IPS and the&#xD;
      flow mictional.This effectiveness is slightly lower than that of the endoscopic resection of&#xD;
      prostate. This technique does not present the disadvantages of the surgery prostate sufferer&#xD;
      on ejaculation. Moreover, it can be carried out in short hospitalization or ambulatory as it&#xD;
      is the case in particular in the States Unis. The aim of the study which will be led by the&#xD;
      AP-HP will be thus to test the feasibility of the TUNA during a hospitalization of less 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;

      The TUNA is a known and already old technique. There exists, in the literature, a certain&#xD;
      number of studies showing the long-term effectiveness (5 years), evaluated on the IPS and the&#xD;
      flow mictional. This effectiveness is slightly lower than that of the endoscopic resection of&#xD;
      prostate. This technique does not present the disadvantages of the surgery prostate sufferer&#xD;
      on ejaculation. Moreover, it can be carried out in short hospitalization or ambulatory as it&#xD;
      is the case in particular in the States Unis. The aim of the study which will be led by the&#xD;
      AP-HP will be thus to test the feasibility of the TUNA during a hospitalization of less the&#xD;
      24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective one: To test the feasibility of a procedure TUNA at the time of a hospitalization&#xD;
      of less 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: A sample of N=70 patients will make it possible to estimate the frequency&#xD;
      of success with a precision of ± 10% for any frequency higher than 75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyse statistical: Principal analyze: Count held of the aim of the study the principal&#xD;
      analyses will be descriptives. For the variables qualitative or semi-quantitative bilateral&#xD;
      the confidence frequencies and their interval at 95% (IC95) will be presented. If the&#xD;
      conditions of use of the asymptotic estimators would not be filled, of the exact estimators&#xD;
      will be used. For the quantitative averages and IC95%, median variables and outdistances&#xD;
      interquartile will be calculated. Together analyses will be presented for the general&#xD;
      population and by center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyze: In case of rate of important failure, an exploratory analysis at end of&#xD;
      identification of the predictive factors of failure will be made by analysis in multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awaited results: The precise evaluation carried out by the present study will make it&#xD;
      possible to evaluate the benefit report/ratio risks in the short run procedure and its&#xD;
      feasibility within the framework of a hospitalization in surgery ambulatory. The implications&#xD;
      are important. Indeed, if this technique can be done into ambulatory with a high rate of&#xD;
      success, then this technique of treatment could be proposed in alternative of the medical&#xD;
      treatment or to the bad responders with the medical treatments.&#xD;
