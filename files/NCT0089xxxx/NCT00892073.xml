  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effect of combined diazoxide-metformin therapy on body weight in youth with&#xD;
      hypothalamic obesity following treatment for craniopharyngioma. A secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell function, features of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, muscle metabolism and intramyocellular lipid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Treatment with diazoxide and metformin will result in weight loss or slowed&#xD;
      weight gain and improved metabolic profile, compared to pretreatment levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      46 children under the age of 22 years have been treated surgically for craniopharyngioma&#xD;
      tumor and are currently followed at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. Approximately&#xD;
      50% are obese (BMI â‰¥ 95th percentile for age and gender assessed from the updated Centre for&#xD;
      Disease Control growth charts), all of whom have panhypopituitarism requiring hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy. These children are assessed regularly in Endocrine Clinic and also are&#xD;
      invited to attend a comprehensive care clinic for evaluation by an endocrinologist (Principal&#xD;
      Investigator), neurosurgical clinical nurse practitioner, dietitian, exercise physiologist,&#xD;
      psychologist and social worker to provide multi-disciplinary dietary and exercise&#xD;
      consultation and psychological counseling for weight related concerns. This clinic will&#xD;
      provide the infrastructure for recruitment and follow-up of study patients. Recruitment of&#xD;
      eight subjects for this pilot study will occur over 6 months from patients attending the&#xD;
      comprehensive clinic. This number was chosen as it is equivalent to the number chosen in the&#xD;
      pilot study of octreotide by Lustig which showed beneficial changes in body mass index with&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates a novel combination therapy in children with hypothalamic obesity at&#xD;
      very high risk for complications. Evaluation of insulin resistance and metabolic changes on&#xD;
      therapy will allow a better understanding of how insulin secretion relates to weight gain in&#xD;
      this population. Successful therapy in a pilot setting will provide necessary data for a&#xD;
      larger randomized trial in individuals with hypothalamic obesity including children with&#xD;
      craniopharyngioma and others with damage to the hypothalamus secondary to other tumors,&#xD;
      surgery or cranial irradiation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Craniopharyngioma at least one year following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of at least one other endocrinopathy of hypothalamic origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable hormone replacement therapy (with one or more of thyroxine hydrocortisone,&#xD;
             DDAVP, sex steroids and GH)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obesity, defined as weight &gt;120% Ideal Body Weight (IBW) or BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2, with&#xD;
             normal weight for height before tumour diagnosis and weight gain &gt;2SD above mean for&#xD;
             age for 1 year following tumour treatment (41).&#xD;

          -  Age 9 -22 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum of 6 months of standard diet and exercise intervention (run-in period). This&#xD;
             was chosen to allow a period of prospective measurements to establish individual&#xD;
             baseline slope of change in BMI SDS prior to initiation of active treatment with&#xD;
             diazoxide and metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications for Metformin or Diazoxide use (history or evidence of cardiac,&#xD;
             renal, or progressive hepatic disease , diabetes or hypoxic conditions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids or use of other medications known to affect&#xD;
             glucose metabolism (e.g. beta-blockers, oral hypoglycemics)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Growth hormone (GH) initiation in the preceding 6 months or planned initiation in the&#xD;
             next 6 months (to rule out potential confounding effect of GH on weight / body&#xD;
             composition and glucose metabolism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of other weight loss medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability of the family and/or patient to comply with study protocol&#xD;
