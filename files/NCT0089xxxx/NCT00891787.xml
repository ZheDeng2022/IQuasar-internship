      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probiotics are oral food supplements containing live bacteria that may be beneficial to&#xD;
           a person s digestion or general health. Probiotics are available as tablets, powder, or&#xD;
           liquid supplements and are frequently used to supplement yogurt. They are available for&#xD;
           purchase without prescription in most supermarkets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The bacteria in probiotic supplements commonly express sugar substances on their&#xD;
           surface. These sugar substances are similar to group A and B blood group sugars, called&#xD;
           antigens. These antigens determine a person s blood group. Researchers are studying the&#xD;
           effect of probiotic supplements on the amount of blood group antibodies that are present&#xD;
           in a person s blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether taking oral probiotic supplements increases anti-A and anti-B&#xD;
           isoagglutinins (antibodies that cause red blood cells to clump together) in healthy&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the frequency of these effects and determine whether there is a dose-response&#xD;
           relationship with probiotics and isoagglutinin titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adults, 18 years or older, with type A, B, or O blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female participants need to have undergone menopause or have had a hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals are ineligible if they currently donate platelets; have a history of&#xD;
           ulcerative colitis or Crohn s disease; have had major bowel surgery; are pregnant or&#xD;
           capable of becoming pregnant; have a bleeding or clotting disorder; have a history of a&#xD;
           blood disorder or immune deficiency; have a history of high-risk behaviors for exposure&#xD;
           to HIV or hepatitis B or C; have diabetes; have received vaccinations in the past 2&#xD;
           months, with the exception of the flu vaccine; are currently taking immunosuppressive&#xD;
           medications; are currently taking antibiotics; or have taken probiotic supplements&#xD;
           within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will conduct the following tests throughout the 28-week study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood samples will be drawn every 2 weeks to measure the quantity of isoagglutinin&#xD;
                titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depending on individual results, continued blood testing may be done every 3 months&#xD;
                for 1 year, then every 6 to 12 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study subjects will take a probiotic supplement at a dose of 1 to 3 caplets per day for&#xD;
           18 consecutive weeks according to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the first 6-week period, the subject will take one probiotic tablet daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the second 6-week period, the subject will take one probiotic tablet twice&#xD;
                daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the third 6-week period, the subject will take one probiotic tablet three&#xD;
                times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group subjects will be followed in a similar manner but will not take probiotic&#xD;
           supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outcome measure is the percent of probiotic ingestors (the study subjects) versus&#xD;
           control group subjects who experience a fourfold or greater rise in isoagglutinin titer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study subjects will receive the following financial compensation: $10 per blood sample,&#xD;
           for a maximum of $240 if all 24 samples are collected; $100 after completing the first&#xD;
           6-week period; $150 after completing the second 6-week period; and $200 after completing&#xD;
           the third 6-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control subjects will receive $10 per blood sample, for a maximum of $150 if all 15&#xD;
           samples are collected.&#xD;

      Probiotics are over-the-counter dietary supplements which contain live bacteria. These&#xD;
      bacteria are normally present in the gastrointestinal tract and may provide health benefits&#xD;
      when added to a regular diet. Common reasons for taking probiotic supplements include&#xD;
      repopulating the gut with lactobacilli after taking antibiotics and aiding in the treatment&#xD;
      of inflammatory bowel disease, lactose intolerance, and gastrointestinal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut of neonates is sterile and becomes colonized with bacteria during the first few&#xD;
      months of life. Many of these bacteria possess terminal sugar structures on their membrane&#xD;
      components that are chemically similar to A and B blood group substances present on red&#xD;
      cells. Antibodies to A and B blood group substances are not present at birth. Early in life,&#xD;
      infants lacking A or B antigens on their red cells recognize the corresponding antigens on&#xD;
      bacteria and form antibodies against bacterial sugars that cross react with the corresponding&#xD;
      red cell antigen. These antibodies are known as anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins. They do not&#xD;
      cause disease, but are important in the transfusion of compatible blood units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have suggested that probiotics consumed in large doses may provoke the&#xD;
      formation of high titer isoagglutinins. This has relevance for transfusion of platelet&#xD;
      components, in that, since ABO-matching of platelets is not necessary, minor&#xD;
      ABO-incompatibility between donor and recipient is present in 10-20% of plateletpheresis&#xD;
      components transfused nationwide. Plateletpheresis components derived from donors taking&#xD;
      probiotics might contain high titer isoagglutinins, which could cause hemolytic reactions in&#xD;
      group A and B recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are (1) to determine whether taking oral probiotic supplements&#xD;
      increases anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins in healthy subjects, (2) to study the frequency of&#xD;
      these effects and determine whether there is a dose-response relationship with probiotics and&#xD;
      isoagglutinin titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be asked to take a probiotic supplement at a dose of 1-3 caplets per day&#xD;
      for 18 weeks. Blood samples will be drawn every 2 weeks during that time. Depending on&#xD;
      individual results, continued blood testing may be done every 3 months for a year, then every&#xD;
      6-12 months for up to 5 years. A group of control subjects will be followed in a similar&#xD;
      manner, but will not take probiotic supplements. The outcome measure is the percent of&#xD;
      probiotic ingestors versus controls who experience a four-fold or greater rise in&#xD;
      isoagglutinin titer in association with a final titer of at least 128.&#xD;
