      The primary objectives are to evaluate the extent of systemic exposure and dexamethasone&#xD;
      bioavailability following a single application of a dexamethasone iontophoretic transdermal&#xD;
      patch in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the systemic and topical safety of the dexamethasone&#xD;
      iontophoretic transdermal patch and of the dexamethasone intramuscular (IM) injection.&#xD;

             subjects of child bearing potential and peri-menopausal subjects may be included if&#xD;
             they have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and on admission to the clinic&#xD;

             continue use of this method for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be non-smokers, defined as not having smoked tobacco, used chewing tobacco, or&#xD;

                  normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
