  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the biochemistry of different types of Limb-Girdle&#xD;
      Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) and to determine appropriate outcome measures for future clinical&#xD;
      treatment trials for LGMD. It is being conducted at two sites in the Cooperative&#xD;
      International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG). It involves a one day clinical evaluation&#xD;
      at a participating institution that will take approximately four to six hours, and will&#xD;
      involve strength testing and muscle functional testing by a physical therapist, an evaluation&#xD;
      by a physician, pulmonary function testing, a complete cardiac evaluation with&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and echocardiogram (Echo), and involve two blood draws, one&#xD;
      before the evaluation and one after the evaluation is complete. During the visit, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to fill out a couple of questionnaires asking questions about&#xD;
      quality of life and activity limitations, as well as his/her understanding of their diagnosis&#xD;
      with regards to etiology (or cause of their muscle disorder), genetics, and inheritance of&#xD;
      their muscle disorder.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate integrity of the extracellular matrix in patients with LGMD by measuring&#xD;
      serum growth factors and cytokines and compare these to a disease control (BMD) and normal&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Measure growth factors and cytokines following medical evaluation and compare them to&#xD;
      the baseline levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Discovery Aim for future multicenter clinical trials in LGMD. Aim 3A: Abstract medical&#xD;
      records with particular emphasis on age of disease onset, initial clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      progression and location of the muscular weakness, treatments attempted, and other medical&#xD;
      complications. A review of the diagnostic testing performed will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3B: Perform complete clinical evaluation including anthropometric measures, evaluation of&#xD;
      joint limitations, timed functional testing, muscle strength, pulmonary function, and a&#xD;
      cardiac assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3C: Determine patient understanding of diagnosis of LGMD and genetic testing results. A&#xD;
      questionnaire will be generated that addresses the patient's understanding of his/her&#xD;
      diagnosis as well as their understanding of genetic concepts of autosomal recessive&#xD;
      inheritance, genes, molecular testing and implications for themselves as well as their&#xD;
      family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3D: Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires will be administered. These will be used to&#xD;
      identify functional limitations by the patients and compare those limitations with the&#xD;
      clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one visit will be necessary for this study. The study visit includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review of the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood collection Blood will be collected for the following: DNA extraction to confirm&#xD;
           genotype if not already performed; Muscle Enzymes before and after physical evaluation;&#xD;
           and Growth factors and cytokines: before and after physical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Medical history review&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Questionnaires: Participants will complete 3 questionnaires: Diagnosis and genetic&#xD;
           testing, ACTIVLIM, and INQoL&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical Evaluator assessment which includes: Manual Muscle Testing, Quantitative Muscle&#xD;
           Testing, Pulmonary Function Testing, Anthropometric measurements, and Timed and&#xD;
           Functional testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cardiac evaluation will include: Electrocardiogram and Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will be required to come to the test site to complete the informed consent&#xD;
      process, clinical evaluator assessment, and have blood drawn before and after the clinical&#xD;
      evaluator assessment. No other examinations or procedures will be performed on the control&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

        The subject population will include all patients diagnosed LGMD2I, LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and BMD.&#xD;
        BMD is an X-linked recessive condition that only affects males. It has been described in&#xD;
        all ethnic backgrounds. LGMD2I, LGMD2A and LGMD2B are autosomal recessive conditions&#xD;
        affecting both males and females of all ethnic backgrounds equally, both sexes and all&#xD;
        ethnicities are expected to be equally represented. Clinical symptoms manifest in the&#xD;
        second decade of life, therefore all participants will be over the age of 18. Healthy&#xD;
        controls will be recruited to match the study population based on age, sex, and ethnicity.&#xD;
