  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burns represent one of the most severe and dreaded traumas. Burned and traumatized tissue is&#xD;
      known as eschar. The dead eschar, if not removed, often becomes heavily contaminated and is&#xD;
      the source of local and/or systemic infection or sepsis. The local inflammation and infection&#xD;
      destroy healthy surrounding tissues and extends the original damage. In order to prevent&#xD;
      these complications, and in order to minimize the risk of infection, it is imperative to&#xD;
      evaluate the burn and remove all of the offending eschar at the earliest possible&#xD;
      opportunity. This removal of dead tissue is termed &quot;debridement&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most direct debridement method for eschar removal is surgery. Traditional, conservative&#xD;
      non-surgical debridement is a lengthy process which often involves many complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy (exploratory) of DGD in hospitalized patients with&#xD;
           Partial Thickness (mid and deep dermal) thermal burns of 4-30% total body surface area&#xD;
           (TBSA), but with total burn wounds of no more than 30% TBSA. Measures have already been&#xD;
           taken in previous studies involving deeper wounds to control safety parameters (such as&#xD;
           pain, fever and infection). Nevertheless, as part of the effort to expand the burn&#xD;
           population in the future phase 3 study to the more superficial wound group, it is&#xD;
           important to first explore these parameters in a small group involving this burn&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore DGD absorption as measured by Pharmacokinetic testing.&#xD;

    <description>DGD is a mixture of lyophilized enzymes derived from purified Bromelain from pineapple stem.&#xD;
Two grams or 5 grams of Debrase powder are dissolved in 20 grams or 50 grams of Gel Vehicle to obtain DGD. DGD is applied to the burn wound at a dose of 2g Debrase/20g Gel per 100 cm2 of skin or 5g Debrase/50g Gel per 250 cm2 for a duration of four hours. In an average human adult, 100 cm2 represents approximately 1% of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA).&#xD;
Please note that for individuals of exceptional size (e.g. children), it is important to calculate the dosage based on the 100 cm2 measurement.&#xD;
The Debrase powder and the Gel Vehicle are to be mixed at the patient bedside for a maximum of 15 min prior to use.&#xD;
DGD should not be applied to more than 15% TBSA in one session. If the wound area to be treated is more than 15% TBSA, DGD should be applied in two or more separate sessions.&#xD;
DGD should not be applied more than twice to the same burn wound area.</description>
