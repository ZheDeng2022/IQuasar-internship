      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of randomising&#xD;
      the phasing-in of the age extension of the NHS Breast Screening Programme in six volunteer&#xD;
      sites in different areas of England.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently all women are invited for breast screening between the ages of 50 and 70. In 2007&#xD;
      the Cancer Reform Strategy announced that from 2012 the NHS Breast Screening Programme would&#xD;
      be extended to cover women between the ages of 47 and 73. This means that all women will get&#xD;
      two extra screening invitations in their lifetime. It also means that all women will get&#xD;
      their first invitation before age 50. As capacity does not allow for full immediate roll out&#xD;
      across the whole of England, the age extension will be phased-in with full coverage from&#xD;
      2012. Randomising this phasing-in would provide unbiased evidence on the extent to which it&#xD;
      is beneficial to extend the age range for breast screening and whether an extra screen at&#xD;
      younger or older ages is more worthwhile. To date there is no clear evidence on this as no&#xD;
      trial has looked at the added value of one extra screen within an existing screening&#xD;
      programme. This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of randomising the&#xD;
      phasing-in of the age extension in six volunteer sites in different areas of England.&#xD;
