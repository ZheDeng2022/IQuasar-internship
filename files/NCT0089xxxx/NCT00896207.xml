  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized early phase I trial is studying different formulations of SR13668 in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Giving SR13668 may help doctors learn more about how SR13668 is used by the body.&#xD;
      It is not yet known which formulation of SR13668 is most effectively used by the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine which oral formulation of Akt inhibitor SR13668 provides the best&#xD;
      bioavailability in normal, healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the oral pharmacokinetics of a single, low dose of Akt inhibitor SR13668 in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the metabolism of Akt inhibitor SR13668 in healthy volunteers. III. Collect&#xD;
      preliminary safety data for Akt inhibitor SR13668 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 1 (for the first 6 participants enrolled in the study [closed to accrual as of August,&#xD;
      2009]): Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants complete an overnight fast of ≥ 10 hours, eat a high-fat (approximately&#xD;
      50% of total caloric content of the meal) and high-calorie (approximately 800-1,000&#xD;
      calories), and then receive a single dose of oral SR13668 in a PEG400/Labrasol® liquid&#xD;
      formulation with 8 ounces of water. Participants may not eat for ≥ 4 hours after study drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants complete an overnight fast of ≥ 10 hours and then receive a single dose&#xD;
      of oral SR13668 in a PEG400/Labrasol® liquid formulation with 8 ounces of water. Participants&#xD;
      may not eat for ≥ 4 hours after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 2 (for the next 12 participants enrolled in the study): The preferred dietary condition&#xD;
      (Arm I) identified in stage 1 is used. Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Participants receive a single dose of oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 in a Solutol®&#xD;
      self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Participants receive a single dose of oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 in a&#xD;
      Solutol®/vitamin E TGPS self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM V: Participants receive a single dose of oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 in a vitamin E TGPS&#xD;
      self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM VI: Participants receive a single dose of oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 in a Myrj 53&#xD;
      self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and periodically during the 24 hours after&#xD;
      study drug administration for pharmacokinetic analysis by high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed by telephone at 7-10 days and&#xD;
      at 30 days.&#xD;
