  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomized study in patients with different severity stages of hepatic&#xD;
      cirrhosis, in which rater pairs will be used for the assessment of the intra- and inter-rater&#xD;
      reproducibility of NRL972 pharmacokinetics and CTP sum score. Rating will be performed by 32&#xD;
      to 40 pairs of raters. The raters will perform the required assessments in the capacity of&#xD;
      sub-investigators of the phase I (co-ordinating) unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 240 patients with clinically established hepatic cirrhosis without confounding&#xD;
      end-stage co-morbidity (stable disease) will be studied. Within 30 days of confirmation of&#xD;
      eligibility, Visit 1 will take place to determine the investigational parameters (NRL972&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, clinical laboratory tests, and determination of CTP sum score). At&#xD;
      approximate intervals of one week, Visits 2, 3 and 4 will occur, and the investigational&#xD;
      parameters will again be assessed.&#xD;
