      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving acupuncture to patients with&#xD;
      lymphoma or a plasma cell dyscrasia can help to relieve numbness and/or tingling of the feet&#xD;
      and/or hands that is related to chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Acupuncture:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture involves the insertion of small, solid, sterile needles into specific points on&#xD;
      the skin. In this study, the needles are placed in areas that are intended to help relieve&#xD;
      numbness and tingling of the feet and hands. Weak electrical stimulation is also applied to&#xD;
      the needles to try to improve the treatment effects of the acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your first acupuncture session will be on the same day as the tests described above, if&#xD;
      possible. (If not, it will be scheduled for another day that will be no more than about 10&#xD;
      days after the screening visit.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an acupuncture session 3 times per week for 4 weeks (Weeks 1-4). You will then&#xD;
      have 1 week off (Week 5). After that, you will have an acupuncture session twice per week for&#xD;
      4 more weeks (Weeks 6-10). This is a total of 20 sessions. In addition to the 20 planned&#xD;
      sessions, you may also choose to receive an optional 21st acupuncture session at the&#xD;
      end-of-study visit that is scheduled for Week 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each session, you will be placed in a comfortable position and the study&#xD;
      doctor/acupuncturist will find points on your body where the needles will be placed. All&#xD;
      study participants will have the needles placed at the same points on the body (the hands,&#xD;
      feet, legs, abdomen, and scalp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very thin, solid, sterile, stainless steel needles will be used. All of the needles are&#xD;
      specially made for acupuncture. The depth of the needle in the skin and the number of needles&#xD;
      used is based on standard acupuncture procedures. The needles will remain in place for about&#xD;
      20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation will be added to some of the needles on the feet and hands. This&#xD;
      involves placing wires on the needles, which are connected to a machine that delivers a weak&#xD;
      electrical current through the wires. The strength of the electrical current will be changed&#xD;
      slowly until it is at a comfortable level for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each session, before you receive the acupuncture, the following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be&#xD;
           experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The color and coating of your tongue and the quality of your pulse will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week, you will also be asked to complete the same 3 questionnaires as you did at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most study visits will last about 1 hour. On the weeks that you complete the questionnaires,&#xD;
      it may add about 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, you may still receive your regular pain treatments. If you are receiving&#xD;
      Neurontin (gabapentin), Cymbalta (duloxetine), and/or Lyrica (pregabalin), you must stay on&#xD;
      the same drug(s) until you go off this study. Minor changes in the doses of your pain&#xD;
      treatments are allowed, but if there is a large change, you will be taken off study early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 21 acupuncture sessions over 13 weeks. If intolerable side effects or&#xD;
      symptoms occur, you will be taken off study early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 13, or if you go off study early for any reason, you will have an end-of-study visit.&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is necessary, the following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have&#xD;
           experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the same 3 questionnaires as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 4 nerve tests will be repeated in order to learn if there have been any changes in&#xD;
           your nerve function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your tongue and pulse will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end-of-study visit, your participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The acupuncture needles used in this study are commercially&#xD;
      available and FDA approved. It is considered experimental, however, to use acupuncture to&#xD;
      treat numbness and/or tingling in the feet and/or hands that is related to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at The University of&#xD;
      Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients, or the legal guardians of patients, must have the ability to understand&#xD;
             English, sign a written informed consent document, and be willing to follow protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &gt; 18 years and have a diagnosis of a plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have neuropathy greater or equal to 2 according to Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0 scale in spite of previous treatment&#xD;

             remain on the same medications throughout the study period; however, minor adjustments&#xD;
             in dosage are allowed. Patients will be removed from the study if a change in type of&#xD;
             medication is necessary. All patients will receive treatment to both upper and lower&#xD;
             extremities, regardless of whether or not they are experiencing symptoms in all four&#xD;
             extremities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient's previous chemotherapy treatment must have included thalidomide and/or&#xD;
             bortezomib and/or any derivatives.&#xD;

          1. Current active treatment with thalidomide and/or bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Local infection at or near the acupuncture site. (Although acupuncture is a minimally&#xD;
             invasive procedure, patients will be excluded if there is an indication of infection.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Deformities that could interfere with accurate acupuncture point location or out of&#xD;
             energy pathway as defined by traditional acupuncture theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent use of other alternative medicines such as herbal agents, high dose&#xD;
             vitamins and anticoagulation agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known coagulopathy and taking heparin (including low molecular weight heparin) or&#xD;
             Coumadin at any dose. Patients on aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories will be&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Cardiac pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Mental incapacitation or significant emotional or psychological disorder that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigators, precludes study entry. (These patients may not be able&#xD;
             to cooperate with this slightly invasive procedure or with the data collection&#xD;
             process.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Currently pregnant or lactating females. (Certain acupuncture applications have been&#xD;
             reported to stimulate uterine contractions and may alter lactation.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Chronic alcohol use as clinically estimated by the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of diabetic neuropathy or neuropathy related to HIV.&#xD;
