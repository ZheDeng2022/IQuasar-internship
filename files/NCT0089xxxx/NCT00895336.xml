      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence suggests that the enteric flora is the primary trigger for chronic mucosal&#xD;
      inflammation in the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative&#xD;
      Colitis (UC). Studies using probiotic administration to modify the flora for either induction&#xD;
      or maintenance of remission in IBD have had mixed results. Whether probiotics may exert an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect in IBD is not known. The investigators hypothesize that daily&#xD;
      administration of a probiotic, Lactobacillus GG, for four weeks will reduce objective markers&#xD;
      of mucosal inflammation in pediatric UC patients. The investigators will enroll 20 UC&#xD;
      patients in remission or with mild disease activity. These patients will have a one month&#xD;
      period of observation without intervention. They will then receive Lactobacillus GG&#xD;
      (Culturelle), 1010 CFU by mouth twice a day for four weeks (28 days). At baseline and Day 28,&#xD;
      and at day 56 clinical disease activity will be measured using the Pediatric UC Activity&#xD;
      Index (PUCAI), a blood sample for determination of circulating granulocyte pSTAT3+ activation&#xD;
      will be obtained, and a stool sample for determination of fecal calprotectin will be&#xD;
      obtained. In addition, =the investigators will sample subject saliva to determine salivary&#xD;
      glycan phenotype as a surrogate marker of changes of mucosal glycan expression in response to&#xD;
      probiotic administration. The investigators anticipate that both circulating granulocyte&#xD;
      pSTAT3+ activation and fecal calprotectin, as established biomarkers of colonic inflammation,&#xD;
      will be reduced in subjects who receive Lactobacillus GG. Completion of the proposed studies&#xD;
      will determine whether Lactobacillus GG reduces mucosal inflammation in pediatric UC, and&#xD;
      will provide information to design a larger randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study design is novel in that it is the first probiotic study in children&#xD;
      with UC and it will measure outcomes utilizing the biomarkers fecal calprotectin and pSTAT3+&#xD;
      circulating granulocytes.&#xD;
