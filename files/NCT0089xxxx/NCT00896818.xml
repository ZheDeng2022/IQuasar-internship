      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, urine, and tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients&#xD;
      with cancer and their female relatives and friends may help doctors learn more about changes&#xD;
      that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at genes and other risk factors for second primary&#xD;
      breast cancer in women with breast cancer and in their female family members and friends.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify new breast cancer susceptibility alleles in breast cancer patients and&#xD;
           family controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the prevalence of known polymorphisms in genes involved in hormonal&#xD;
           activation and degradation pathways in breast cancer patients and family controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate these polymorphisms with quantitative intermediate markers of&#xD;
           susceptibility to breast cancer, such as circulating hormone levels and mammographic&#xD;
           density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform linkage analysis to detect new susceptibility genes in larger multiple-case&#xD;
           families combined with data on families previously collected by the Institute of Cancer&#xD;
           Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between these polymorphisms and hormone levels in relatives&#xD;
           and family controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare average hormone levels in patients' unaffected first-degree relatives with&#xD;
           family controls using urine samples from premenopausal women and urine and/or serum&#xD;
           samples from postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform follow-up in a cohort of unaffected first-degree relatives at&#xD;
           moderate-to-high risk of developing breast cancer with prospective questionnaire data&#xD;
           and hormone measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Unaffected and affected first-degree female relatives and family or friend controls&#xD;
      undergo blood sample collection once during study. Genomic DNA is purified from the blood&#xD;
      samples for genetic analyses. Within a cohort of unaffected first-degree relatives,&#xD;
      postmenopausal women also provide a single urine sample for hormonal assays. Hormones&#xD;
      analyzed in the serum and/or urine of postmenopausal women include estradiol, estrone,&#xD;
      sulphate, prolactin, androstenedione, testosterone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and&#xD;
      SHBG. Unaffected premenopausal women within the cohort provide urine samples on 6 successive&#xD;
      days around the midpoint of their menstrual cycle and on one day towards the luteal phase of&#xD;
      their menstrual cycle. These samples are analyzed for luteinizing hormone and metabolites of&#xD;
      estradiol and progesterone (i.e., creatinine ratios for estrone glucuronide and pregnanediol&#xD;
      glucuronide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to case notes, mammograms, and archival tumor blocks and accompanying pathology&#xD;
      reports of breast cancer patients and their affected relatives is requested. When tumor&#xD;
      samples from both tumors in bilateral cases are available, these samples are analyzed to&#xD;
      identify regions of loss of heterozygosity in which both tumors have lost the same&#xD;
      chromosomal region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients and controls, including affected or unaffected first-degree relatives,&#xD;
      relatives by marriage, or friends complete a questionnaire at baseline to provide information&#xD;
      on demographics (i.e., personal and family), cancer diagnosis and treatment (if applicable),&#xD;
      and known risk factors for breast cancer (i.e., lifestyle, reproductive behavior, and family&#xD;
      history).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants may be followed periodically for cancer incidence and cause-specific&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
