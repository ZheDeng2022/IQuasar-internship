      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving everolimus together with whole-brain radiation&#xD;
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus and&#xD;
      to see how well it works when given together with whole-brain radiation therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I is intended to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Study drug will be administered&#xD;
      orally, once a day, for 15 days, one day prior to initiation of WBRT at 5 or 10 mg/day during&#xD;
      the phase I component. One of these doses will be selected as the maximum tolerable dose and&#xD;
      will be selected for the phase II component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of everolimus when combined concurrently with&#xD;
           whole-brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastasis from stage IV non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the median survival of these patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the response rates in these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine time to CNS (neurological) progression, confirmed by MRI, in these&#xD;
           patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine time to systemic (non-CNS) progression in these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 10 fractions of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) beginning on day 0, 5 days&#xD;
      per week, and receive oral everolimus once daily on days -1 to 13. Beginning 2 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of WBRT, patients receive oral everolimus once daily for 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.&#xD;
