    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence between the Phase 3 and the&#xD;
      to-be-marketed formulations of extended release (ER) OROS paliperidone and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of food on the highest to be marketed tablet strength. Additionally, the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the treatments in healthy volunteers will be assessed.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a single-center, open-label, randomized, 3 treatment-period,&#xD;
      crossover study in healthy male adults. The study consists of a screening phase and an&#xD;
      open-label treatment phase during which each volunteer will receive 3 treatments of study&#xD;
      drug in a random order and separated by a washout period of 10 to 14 days. Treatment A&#xD;
      consists of a single oral dose of 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone Phase 3 formulation in the&#xD;
      fasted state; Treatment B consists of a single oral dose of 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone&#xD;
      to-be-marketed formulation in fasted state; and Treatment C consists of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      15 mg ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation after consumption of a high-fat&#xD;
      breakfast. There are slight formulation differences between the ER OROS paliperidone&#xD;
      formulation that was used in Phase 3 efficacy studies and the formulation that is intended to&#xD;
      be marketed. What is more important, however, is that the highest tablet strength used in&#xD;
      Phase 3 and the tablet strength that is planned for the market as commercial formulation are&#xD;
      different. For Phase 3 studies, 9 mg was the highest tablet strength and the highest dose of&#xD;
      15 mg was administered as 2 tablets of 3 mg and 1 tablet of 9 mg. The highest to-be-marketed&#xD;
      tablet strength is 15 mg. This study is designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence between&#xD;
      the Phase 3 formulation and the highest tablet strength of the to-be-marketed formulation and&#xD;
      to assess the effect of food on the highest to-be-marketed tablet strength. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. All volunteers will receive each of the&#xD;
      following 3 treatments in the order specified by the random assignment:Treatment A, oral ER&#xD;
      OROS paliperidone Phase 3 formulation as 2 tablets of 3 mg and 1 tablet of 9 mg in the fasted&#xD;
      state; Treatment B, oral ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation as 1 tablet of 15 mg&#xD;
      in the fasted state; Treatment C, oral ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation as 1&#xD;
      tablet of 15 mg after a high-fat breakfast.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (weight [kg]/height [m²]) of 18 to 28 kg/m², inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between the range of 100 to 140&#xD;
             mmHg systolic, inclusive, and 50 to 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, ECG, and the&#xD;
             laboratory results of serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis performed within 21&#xD;
             days before the first dose. If the results of the serum chemistry, hematology or&#xD;
             urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges the volunteer can&#xD;
             be included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically&#xD;
             significant. For renal function tests, the values must be within the normal laboratory&#xD;
             reference ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             lock will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history of alcohol or substance abuse, a positive test result for the urine&#xD;
             drug screen at screening or upon admittance to the testing facility or a positive&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of any cancer, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;

             decrease of &gt;10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure after standing for at least 2 minutes&#xD;
             that is not associated with an increase of &gt;15 beats per minute (bpm) in heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50 bpm) as determined by screening ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or a positive test result for any of the serology tests (hepatitis B, C,&#xD;
