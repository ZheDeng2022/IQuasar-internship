      The Diskus Inhaler is administered by a nurse or medical technician in the Nursing Home (NH)&#xD;
      setting. The administration of the medication from the Diskus Inhaler includes 4 steps: open,&#xD;
      click, inhale, close. The only step that the resident must do is the &quot;inhale&quot; step, which&#xD;
      includes holding one's breath for 10 seconds after the inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that properly trained and motivated nurses and medical technicians&#xD;
      can successfully administer medication using the Advair Diskus to almost any mildly to&#xD;
      moderately cognitively impaired resident who can follow the instruction- &quot;inhale&quot; and hold&#xD;
      your breath for 10 seconds&quot;. The objective is to show that mild to moderate cognitive&#xD;
      impairment should not be a barrier to the use of Diskus Inhaler. There will only be 1 consent&#xD;
      visit and 1 evaluation visit per subject.&#xD;

      Background and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1.6 million geriatric nursing home (NH) residents are living in about 17,000&#xD;
      Nursing Homes in the United States. This population (including those who live in Assisted&#xD;
      Living Facilities [ALFs]) will increase significantly over the next 20 years as the &quot;Baby&#xD;
      Boomers&quot; enter this age group. Associated with this will be an increasing number of&#xD;
      cognitively impaired individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). As a&#xD;
      nation, we will need to find effective and efficient means of caring for this growing&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes there is an &quot;intuitive anecdote&quot;; a belief that mildly to moderately cognitively&#xD;
      impaired individuals (score of 10 to 24 on the Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE]) are unable to&#xD;
      synthesize and execute the instructions necessary for the successful use of the Diskus&#xD;
      Inhaler for COPD. We propose a controlled assessment of DISKUS Inhaler use in mildly to&#xD;
      moderately cognitively impaired residents living in NHs and ALFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Diskus Inhaler is administered by a nurse or medical technician in the NH setting. The&#xD;
      administration of the medication from the Diskus Inhaler includes 4 steps: open, click,&#xD;
      inhale, close. The only step that the resident must do is the &quot;inhale&quot; step, which includes&#xD;
      holding one's breath for 10 seconds after the inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that properly trained and motivated nurses and medical technicians can&#xD;
      successfully administer medication using the Advair Diskus to almost any mildly to moderately&#xD;
      cognitively impaired resident who can follow the instruction- &quot;inhale&quot; and hold your breath&#xD;
      for 10 seconds&quot;. The objective is to show that mild to moderate cognitive impairment should&#xD;
      not be a barrier to the use of Diskus Inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Equipment Diskus Inhalers filled with placebo only will be provided by GlaxoSmithKline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total number of subject will be 40&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects 18 and older will be selected from sites in the St. Petersburg, FL and&#xD;
                Dayton, OH areas&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No compensation will be given to subjects for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will spend about 15 -30 minutes at the one and only visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) will be administered to determine the degree of&#xD;
                cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will be recruited by the investigators and study coordinators (SC) while&#xD;
                visiting the NHs. No advertising will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration : Data collection will take 3 months with an additional 1 month data analysis&#xD;
           period&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigational Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) There will be a Principal Investigator in each state - Dr Fraser in Florida and Dr Patel&#xD;
      in Ohio. Fraser will also be the overall PI for the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Initial potential subjects will be drawn from the 2 practices that Dr Fraser and Dr&#xD;
      Patel are part of. Initial screening will be based on informal chart review from the&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Initial contact of the potential subject/Legally Appointed Representative (LAR) will be&#xD;
      from the PI/SubI/SC. The subject will be seen either in a Nursing Home (Bethany or&#xD;
      Brooksville Health Care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) If the potential subject has a LAR, the LAR will be contacted first to obtain their&#xD;
      informed consent before the study is discussed with the NH resident. The reason for this is&#xD;
      that we do not want to appear to be pressuring the LAR to agree to the potential subject&#xD;
      being enrolled. The reality is that living in a NH is monotonous and most NH patients enjoy&#xD;
      doing something different. The LAR will be told that the patients' entering the study does&#xD;
      not affect in any way the ongoing physician patient relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) If the LAR does not agree to allow the patient to be enrolled, the study will not be&#xD;
      discussed with the patient, and if they ask why they can't do it, they will told that they&#xD;
      are not eligible and they should discuss it with their LAR. They will NOT be told that the&#xD;
      LAR had declined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) There will be 2 consents forms (Form A) ; one for the LAR and another version using&#xD;
      simpler language (Assent - Form B) for all potential subjects to review and sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the LAR agrees, once we have fulfilled the steps involving the LAR on the Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form (ICF) Process and obtained written consent using Form A, then the study will be&#xD;
      discussed with the potential subject and their assent will be requested using Assent Form B.&#xD;
      If they do not want to participate, they will not be enrolled and they will not be regarded&#xD;
      as enrolled until either we have obtained their assent by the completion of Assent Form B OR&#xD;
      it is documented that they are unable to comprehend/sign Assent Form B&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vii) It is possible that since NHs/(Closed Congregate Retirement Centers)CCRCs are closed&#xD;
      communities, word will get around and other NH residents, under the care of other physicians,&#xD;
      will also want to be included. In this case, the PI/SubI/SC will ask the Nurses to obtain a&#xD;
      written order from the attending physician, which will be placed on the patient's chart&#xD;
      before the study is even discussed with the potential subject or the designated LAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) After the order is on the chart, the chart will be reviewed to determine if the patient&#xD;
      is a potential subject. Then the stages d (iv) thru d (vi) will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (viii) After informed consent is obtained, the PI/Sub I/SC will meet the subject and review&#xD;
      the chart in order to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The resident will be asked to take a deep breath and hold it while the PI/Sub I/SC&#xD;
           counts to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the subject is able to hold their breath for 10 seconds, then the subject will be&#xD;
           given the MMSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the score on the MMSE falls between 10 and 24 inclusively, the subject will be&#xD;
           instructed on the use of the Diskus Inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The PI/Sub I/SC will demonstrate the open, click, inhale, and close phases and then ask&#xD;
           the resident to repeat the actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The PI/Sub I/SC may repeat the demonstration 2 more times, (for a total of 3&#xD;
           demonstrations) if necessary, for the resident to complete all 4 tasks successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The PI/SubI/SC will allow 1-2 minutes between each attempt if the resident is showing&#xD;
           signs of shortness of breath. The PI/Sub I/SC will then rate each step on the Diskus&#xD;
           Inhaler Evaluation Scale (Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The rating will end after the resident successfully completes all 4 phases or the&#xD;
           resident 3 unsuccessfully attempts, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The rater will then complete a global assessment of the use of the Diskus Inhaler,&#xD;
           indicating overall whether the subject adequately or inadequately used the Diskus&#xD;
           Inhaler&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The subject will be told that they have completed the study and thanked for their&#xD;
           cooperation. They will be asked if they have any questions and all questions will be&#xD;
           answered before the PI/SubI/SC leaves the room&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The unit charge nurse will be told that the resident has completed the study and thanked&#xD;
&#xD;
      (xii) The LARs/potential subjects will be told that there is no financial benefit to either&#xD;
      of them in any way and that the study will take a maximum of 30 mins. They will be told that&#xD;
      there is no other direct benefit of any type to them but the knowledge gained may help&#xD;
      companies design delivery mechanisms which other cognitively impaired people, like the&#xD;
      subject, may benefit from in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (xii). There are no other study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. Chronology of Study: (i) A total of 40 subjects will be studied - 20 in Florida and 20 in&#xD;
      Ohio. If for any reason the sites in either state are unable to enroll 20, then the sites in&#xD;
      the other state will make up the deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following timeline is anticipated after receiving IRB approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1-4: Print forms, team meetings by phone between the 2 sites to review protocol and&#xD;
      ensure uniformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 5-12: Enroll subjects and perform study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week13-18: Perform statistical analysis, prepare and submit final report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Number of visits. Screening/ Consent explained 1 Consent obtained/ Evaluation visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a minimum of 3 days between the 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We determined the sample size if the 2 groups differ by as little as 50%. The estimated&#xD;
      sample size for two-sample comparison of proportions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Ho: p1 = p2, where p1 is the proportion in population 1 and p2 is the proportion in&#xD;
      population 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      alpha = 0.0500 (two-sided) power = 0.9000 p1 = 1.0000 p2 = 0.5000 n2/n1 = 1.00&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated required sample sizes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n1 = 18 n2 = 18&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to say that we examined for differences in Diskus use between groups that could be&#xD;
      as small as 50% with confidence (P&lt;.05 in two-tail testing &amp; with a Power of 0.90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      g. Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is no intervention, there will be no safety monitoring. Adverse events (AEs) will&#xD;
      not be recorded. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be captured only if the PI or Sub-I feels&#xD;
      the event is related to the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      h. Confidentiality protection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be identified with the resident's initials and a 4 digit subject number. No&#xD;
      names will be used. The data will be kept with the PI/Sub I/SC and brought back from the NH&#xD;
      to the research facility and stored in a locked area. No one other than study staff will have&#xD;
      access to the data collected. All data will be collected on paper; no electronic files will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Analysis/Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since a placebo will be inhaled for a maximum of 3 times, we believe there to be no risk to&#xD;
      the residents.&#xD;
