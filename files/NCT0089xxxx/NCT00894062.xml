      Stent thrombosis is an important issue in drug eluting stents. Incomplete endothelial&#xD;
      coverage and neointimal coverage over strut after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation could&#xD;
      be a possible cause of stent thrombosis. Therefore, theoretically dual antiplatelet therapy&#xD;
      should be continued to prevent the stent thrombosis until complete reendothelialization. But,&#xD;
      detection of endothelial coverage over stent is not possible with the available intravascular&#xD;
      devices in clinical practice. Among currently available intravascular devices, intravascular&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) could give a more clear identification for a thin layer of&#xD;
      neointima with high-resolution (10-20 μm) compared to intravascular ultrasound (100-150 μm).&#xD;
      Previous OCT studies showed the significant different pattern of neointimal coverage between&#xD;
      bare metal stent (BMS) and DES. In the investigators' experience, there were also some&#xD;
      differences in neointimal coverage among the DESs, especially zotarolimus eluting stent&#xD;
      (ZES). ZES has been known to be associated with significantly more neointimal coverage than&#xD;
      SES at 8 months intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Both everolimus eluting stent (EES) and ZES&#xD;
      resolute were recently introduced. The efficacy to suppress the neointimal growth for ZES&#xD;
      resolute and EES might be improved, but safety for neointimal coverage needs to evaluate in&#xD;
      human coronary artery. Therefore, this study will investigate the pattern of neointimal&#xD;
      coverage over stent in ZES resolute and EES at 9 months after stent implantation.&#xD;

      Recent autopsy study showed the most important histological and morphometric predictors of&#xD;
      stent thrombosis were endothelial coverage and the ratio of uncovered to total strut after&#xD;
      drug eluting stent (DES) implantation. Although there have been some controversies,&#xD;
      incomplete stent apposition might be possible cause of very late stent thrombosis after DES&#xD;
      implantation. Therefore, theoretically dual antiplatelet therapy should be continued to&#xD;
      prevent the stent thrombosis until complete reendothelialization. But, detection of&#xD;
      endothelial coverage over stent are no possible with available intravascular devices in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Among currently available intravascular devices, intravascular optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) could give a more clear identification for a thin layer of NIH and&#xD;
      malapposition with high-resolution (10 -20 μm) compared to intravascular ultrasound (100-150&#xD;
      μm). Previous OCT studies showed the significant different pattern of neointimal coverage&#xD;
      between bare metal stent (BMS) and DES. In our experience, there was also some differences in&#xD;
      neointimal coverage among the DESs, especially zotarolimus eluting stent (ZES). ZES have been&#xD;
      known to be associated with significantly more neointimal coverage than SES at 8 months&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). This finding might be related with strut thickness and drug&#xD;
      elution property. In our data, neointima was covered at 99.7% of stent strut in ZES, but&#xD;
      93.2% in sirolimus eluting stent (SES) at 9 month follow OCT. This difference was more&#xD;
      distinct in patients with acute myocardial infarction (99.3% in ZES vs.79.9% in SES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both everolimus eluting stent (EES) was recently introduced and ZES resolute also will be&#xD;
      available in the near future in Korea. Previous phosphorylcholine polymer was replaced with&#xD;
      new, proprietary polymer which can provide extended elution kinetics in ZES resolute.&#xD;
      Therefore, efficacy to suppress the neointimal growth might be improved but, safety for&#xD;
      neointimal coverage needs to evaluate in human coronary artery. Both new DESs are cobalt&#xD;
      chromium stent with thin stent strut and reported similar efficacy for suppressing the&#xD;
      neointima growth. Also, endothelial coverage over stent strut occurred earlier compared to&#xD;
      previous DESs (SES or PES) in animal experiments. But, there has been no data for neointimal&#xD;
      coverage and malapposition of ZES resolute and EES using OCT in human coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent paper according to Kubo et al reported that serial OCT examinations demonstrated&#xD;
      markedly different vascular response up to 9 months after SES implantation between unstable&#xD;
      angina and stable angina patients. These findings implied that initial native vessel status,&#xD;
      which covered with stent, might be important and related with neointimal coverage and&#xD;
      malapposition. But, there is little data evaluated the relationship between initial lesion&#xD;
      status and neointimal coverage or late malapposition with OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study investigates: 1) the relationship of the initial lesion and neointimal&#xD;
      coverage or late malapposition and 2) the neointimal coverage and malapposition at 9 month&#xD;
      after ZES resolute and EES implantation and 3) compare them between ZES resolute and EES at 9&#xD;
      months after stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective open labeled randomized study to compare the neointimal coverage&#xD;
      of ZES resolute (Endeavor® resolute) and EES (Xience®) in 9 month after stent implantation by&#xD;
      OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The primary endpoint is to compare the neointimal coverage of ZES resolute&#xD;
                (Endeavor® resolute) and EES (Xience®) at 9 months after stent implantation by OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the relationship between initial lesion and neointimal coverage and&#xD;
                malapposition at 9 months, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare of neointimal growth between ZES resolute and EES at 9 months and to&#xD;
                compare the difference in early and late malapposition between ZES resolute and EES&#xD;
                at 9 months.&#xD;
