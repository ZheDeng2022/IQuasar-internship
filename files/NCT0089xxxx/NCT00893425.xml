  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, diabetic nephropathy, which may lead to dialysis treatment, is the most&#xD;
      prevalent underlying disease of people in developed countries. A wide range of studies have&#xD;
      been carried out, from various points of view, to understand the progress of renal&#xD;
      dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy. The endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor&#xD;
      asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      and may have a role in the cardiovascular mortality and morbidity of these patients. In&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy, high ADMA levels were related to progression of diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
      The Fas (CD95) antigen is a cell surface polypeptide belonging to the tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      receptor (TNF-R) family (type I membrane protein) that transduces a death signal after&#xD;
      interaction with its ligand. Apoptotic cells are then recognized and removed by phagocytes.&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that, in uremic patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells undergo&#xD;
      accelerated apoptosis and this correlates with Fas levels. There is no data about the effects&#xD;
      of Renin angiotensin system blockage (RAS) on CD95 and ADMA levels in diabetic patients with&#xD;
      proteinuria. The aim of this study was to find out whether the beneficial effects of RAS&#xD;
      blockage in diabetic proteinuria has any relation with the alteration of ADMA and CD95levels.&#xD;
      The investigators searched for the effects of ACE inhibitor ramipril on the clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters of diabetic patients with proteinuria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The patients who were non-obese (BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2), non dyslipidemic (total cholesterol &lt; 200&#xD;
      mg/dl, Triglyceride&lt;150mg/dl), and free of cardiovascular events (negative medical history,&#xD;
      negative ECG findings) were investigated for enrollment. CKD stage 1 patients older than 18&#xD;
      years of age and willing to participate to the study were screened. From the 231 patients&#xD;
      with established type 2 diabetes mellitus, 126 had proteinuria and/or hypertension (24 h&#xD;
      protein excretion 1-2 g/day, systolic blood pressures ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressures ≥ 90 mmHg, respectively). All cases were first referrals and at the time of the&#xD;
      study all were off treatment. Patients with history of coronary artery disease, smokers and&#xD;
      those taking statins or renin-angiotensin blockers were excluded because of the effect of&#xD;
      these factors on endothelial dysfunction. Of 126 screened patients 78 met the study criteria&#xD;
      and were included in this study. The duration of proteinuria and diabetic nephropathy after&#xD;
      initial diagnosis was not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were as follows: A)Nephrotic syndrome, B)coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (patients with ischemic ST-T alterations and voltage criteria for LVH on electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      and with history of revascularization or myocardial infarction), C) elevated liver enzymes&#xD;
      (AST or ALT levels ≥ 40 U/L) and D) renal failure (serum creatinine levels &gt; 1.3 mg/dl). In&#xD;
      order to evaluate the effect of RAS blockade on plasma PTX3 concentrations, patients with&#xD;
      proteinuria were given an ACE inhibitor (ramipril 10 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The effect of RAS&#xD;
      blockade on insulin sensitivity and proteinuria was also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention period, blood samples were obtained for assay of plasma PTX3&#xD;
      concentrations, HbA1c , and insulin resistance scores (HOMA-IR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples were also collected over a 24-hour period to determine the degree of&#xD;
      proteinuria.&#xD;
