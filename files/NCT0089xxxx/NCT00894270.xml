  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus are required to inject insulin daily.&#xD;
      The injection technique should reliably deposit insulin into subcutaneous fat while&#xD;
      minimizing inadvertent delivery into either the skin or the underlying muscle, both of which&#xD;
      are associated with suboptimal outcomes. The use of shorter, thinner needles reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of intramuscular delivery and is associated with reduced discomfort, but increases&#xD;
      the risks of both shallow (intradermal) delivery and of loss of insulin through backflow to&#xD;
      the skin surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, 240 subjects (children and adults) will receive multiple injections of&#xD;
      small volumes of sterile air in the thigh and abdomen using 5 mm Novofine® needles, to&#xD;
      simulate insulin injections performed at the two sites using various injection techniques&#xD;
      (perpendicular or angled needle, with or without skin fold). Ultrasound visualisation of the&#xD;
      injected air will allow determination of the incidence of intradermal or intramuscular&#xD;
      delivery using the various delivery methods in the trial. In addition, adult subjects will&#xD;
      receive injections of a liquid test medium in order to determine the incidence and extent of&#xD;
      backflow. Qualitative data on perceived discomfort and information on body composition will&#xD;
      also be collected. This investigation will form the basis for recommendations regarding&#xD;
      preferred injection technique where 5 mm needles are used.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection techniques used with children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      should reliably deposit insulin into subcutaneous fat while minimizing inadvertent&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) insulin injections. Surprisingly, injection technique varies among&#xD;
      centres, tends to be protocol driven and is usually dependent on needle length. The&#xD;
      recommended injection procedure for diabetic children in our centre include a lifted or&#xD;
      pinched skin fold either on the abdomen, thigh or buttocks with perpendicular injection of 8&#xD;
      mm syringes and angled injection of 12.7 mm syringes. However both 8 and 12.7 mm needles,&#xD;
      have been associated with frequent IM injections with rates of 38% and 86% respectively,&#xD;
      reported using a perpendicular insertion (1, 2). IM injection of regular, NPH and glargine&#xD;
      insulin has been associated with more rapid insulin release, variability in glycaemic control&#xD;
      and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of IM insulin deposition is known to be related to a number of variables including&#xD;
      younger age, male sex, lower body mass index (BMI), injection technique (angle of insertion&#xD;
      and a lifted or pinched skinfold), and needle length (1, 2, 6-8). Reducing the length of the&#xD;
      insulin needle reduces the incidence of IM injections, however the use of 5 mm insulin&#xD;
      needles may result in insulin being administered too superficially in the dermal layer (9,&#xD;
      10). The consequence of intradermal insulin deposition is largely unknown, but may lead to&#xD;
      increased insulin leakage, increased injection pain, and an increased immune response (10).&#xD;
      Little information is known about skin thickness, although it does vary with age, obesity and&#xD;
      puberty (personal observations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smaller, thinner needles are also associated with reduced pain and discomfort. However they&#xD;
      may cause greater insulin loss after the injection. This latter issue may also reflect the&#xD;
      injection technique used with anecdotal evidence suggesting angled techniques may reduce&#xD;
      insulin loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To locate and compare simulated insulin injections in children,&#xD;
      adolescents and adults with diabetes given with 5 mm needle using a 45 degree and 90 degree&#xD;
      injection angle, with and without skin fold in order to provide injection guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the thickness of dermis in abdomen and thigh in children, adolescents and&#xD;
           adults with normal weight and over weight/obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the distance from skin surface to muscle fascia (abdomen/thigh) with and&#xD;
           without compression of the skin in children, adolescents and adults with normal weight&#xD;
           and over weight/obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To quantify the amount of backflow of the test medium to the skin surface in adults and&#xD;
           investigate whether there is a substantial clinically relevant difference among various&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess comfort and ease of injection technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a single-centre and open-label phase IV trial. The investigation will be&#xD;
      performed in three visits. Patients screening will be done at the first visit, 2 ± 1 days&#xD;
      prior to the second visit day. The second and the third visit will be performed with two&#xD;
      weeks ± 3 days apart. At the second visit day all the subjects will receive (performed by&#xD;
      study nurse) injected sterile air corresponding to 20 IU of insulin (200 µl) with Novofine 5&#xD;
      mm needles perpendicularly in abdomen and thigh with and without skin fold, giving in total&#xD;
      four injections at this visit. Following the injection, sterile air deposition will be&#xD;
      visualized by ultra sound (GELogic5 or a Phillips IU-22 machine). A 12.5 MHz linear array&#xD;
      transducer will be used. This measures depth up to 3cm accurately. To assess dermis and air&#xD;
      after injections a 1cm standoff will be employed. This is standard ultrasound technique to&#xD;
      examine changes close to the transducer and we developed expertise using this technique&#xD;
      during our previous study. Because of the better visualization using a standoff smaller, more&#xD;
      physiological, volumes of air can be reliably injected. Thickness of (i) dermis and (ii)&#xD;
      distance from skin surface to muscle fascia at the respective injection places will also be&#xD;
      measured by ultrasound both with and without lifted skin fold prior to injection. The adults&#xD;
      will be then injected with 200 µl of test medium with a 5 mm needle perpendicularly in&#xD;
      abdomen and thigh with a lifted skin fold, providing an additional four injections to the&#xD;
      adults. Possible backflow to skin surface will be absorbed by filter paper and quantified by&#xD;
      scale. Injection speed will be measured by time from start to end of injection. After each&#xD;
      injection subjects will be asked to complete a visual analog pain scale and after the&#xD;
      injections they will be asked their preference for needle technique and site of injection. On&#xD;
      the third visit day all subjects will be injected 200µl sterile air (performed by study&#xD;
      nurse) with 5 mm needles at 45degrees with and without pinch-up technique in the abdomen and&#xD;
      thigh, providing a total of four injections to each subject. In addition, 200µl test medium&#xD;
      with 5 mm needle at 45degrees in abdomen and thigh with and without lifted skin fold will be&#xD;
      injected to adults. Possible backflow to skin surface will be absorbed by filter paper and&#xD;
      quantified by scale. The weighing scale must be able to measure with three decimals in the&#xD;
      metric system (microgram). A 10 cm visual analog pain scale will be used to assess the&#xD;
      discomfort of the injections in comparison to standard injections.&#xD;
