  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the prevalence of&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairment among HIV-infected patients continues to be an important issue.&#xD;
      Although severe forms of AIDS-related dementia have diminished, milder forms of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment have been noted among approximately 30% of asymptomatic HIV patients. Studies&#xD;
      among HIV-infected U.S. military personnel regarding neurocognitive function have largely&#xD;
      been limited to the early 1990s, before the advent of HAART. In these studies subtle&#xD;
      neurobehavioral changes were noted among asymptomatic HIV-positive military personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive deficits among HIV-positive&#xD;
      military beneficiaries during the era of HAART who are participants of the U.S. Military HIV&#xD;
      Natural History Study. The prevalence ascertained in this study will be compared to&#xD;
      HIV-negative military beneficiaries who are demographically similar to the HIV positive&#xD;
      group. The sample size of the study is to have complete testing on 200 HIV positive and 50&#xD;
      HIV-negative participants; due to the possibility of attrition before study completion, the&#xD;
      investigators will enroll up to 300 participants (240 HIV-positive and 60 HIV-negative) to&#xD;
      achieve this sample size. The investigators' rates among HIV-positive patients found in this&#xD;
      study will also be contextualized in the setting of the prevalence of prior neurocognitive&#xD;
      deficits seen in a HIV positive U.S. military population studied in the 1990s, contemporary&#xD;
      rates among civilian HIV-infected persons, and normative values in the general HIV-negative&#xD;
      population. Compared to other data in the field of neuropsychology, this study is novel in&#xD;
      that the HIV population studied is composed largely of HIV patients who have been diagnosed&#xD;
      early in their HIV infection; have open, free access to antiretrovirals to begin therapy&#xD;
      earlier than most other cohorts; and consists of highly-functioning, educated individuals.&#xD;
