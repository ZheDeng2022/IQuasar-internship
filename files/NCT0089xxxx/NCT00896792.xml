      RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with terminal metastatic cancer may help&#xD;
      doctors learn more about the effectiveness of a nurse practitioner hospice program. It is not&#xD;
      yet known whether a nurse practitioner program helps increase patients' length of stay in&#xD;
      hospice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized research study is evaluating a nurse practitioner hospice program&#xD;
      for patients with terminal metastatic cancer and their families or caregivers.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of the palliative advanced registered nurse practitioner liaison&#xD;
           program (PAL) on length of patient's enrollment in hospice care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the PAL program on patient's knowledge about hospice services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the PAL program on patient and family or caregiver's&#xD;
           psychological stress during palliative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (advanced registered nurse practitioner [ARNP] intervention): Patients and their&#xD;
           families or caregiver receive information from an ARNP about terminal cancer, resources&#xD;
           available for supportive care, and the benefits of palliative care. After transition to&#xD;
           hospice, patients receive pain and palliative medicine, psychology, social services,&#xD;
           chaplaincy, and patient support group intervention arranged by the ARNP. Patients&#xD;
           complete the Patient Questionnaire about overall quality of life and mental, emotional,&#xD;
           and physical well being at baseline and at 3 weeks after intervention or at time of&#xD;
           enrollment in hospice. Patients and their families or caregivers are contacted by the&#xD;
           ARNP weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (no ARNP intervention): Patients and their families or caregivers complete the&#xD;
           same Patient Questionnaire, administered by a clinical research assistant (CRA), as in&#xD;
           Arm I. Patients and their families or caregivers receive no ARNP intervention. After&#xD;
           transition to hospice, patients receive routine hospice care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in this study for a duration of 21 days while in hospice care. At the&#xD;
      completion of the study, patients in both arms complete questionnaires about pain management,&#xD;
      social, emotional, and spiritual and mental well-being. Patients' families or caregivers&#xD;
      complete the Caregiver Questionnaire and the Hospice Family Satisfaction Survey 3 weeks after&#xD;
      patient's death.&#xD;
