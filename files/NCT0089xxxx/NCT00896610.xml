      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes is a disease defined by abnormally high blood sugar (glucose) levels. Glucose&#xD;
           is an essential source of energy for the body s cells, but insulin is required to move&#xD;
           the glucose into the cells. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that allows&#xD;
           glucose to enter cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In diabetes, the body is unable to supply enough insulin to meet its demands. The&#xD;
           problem may be a low supply of insulin or a high demand for insulin. Someone who has&#xD;
           been diagnosed with diabetes has lost much of their insulin-producing capacity. Clinical&#xD;
           studies have shown that good control of blood sugar is essential to prevent diabetes&#xD;
           complications like damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a relationship with several individuals with diabetes caused by the immune&#xD;
           system attacking the body s insulin-producing cells in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore why the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand why some individuals develop diabetes-related complications and others do&#xD;
           not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop therapies to improve how patients can control their blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue to follow subjects who have completed or are considering other NIH&#xD;
           diabetes-related studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop improved tests for determining an individual s risk for developing diabetes&#xD;
           and/or to accurately diagnose the exact type of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with or are at risk for developing diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard physical examination and clinical tests to determine if the patient has&#xD;
           diabetes or to confirm a particular type of diabetes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  None of the treatment in this study is experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a separate consent form for any special tests needed to learn more&#xD;
           about their particular type of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be asked to provide additional urine and blood samples for use in&#xD;
           laboratory research about diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers may offer medical treatment advice for diabetes, or explain how to improve&#xD;
           patients diabetes management skills.&#xD;

      Individuals with known or suspected autoimmune mediated diabetes, or healthy individuals at&#xD;
      risk for developing the disease, will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center. Studies will&#xD;
      include characterizing the disease s clinical and laboratory features, observing the natural&#xD;
      history of the disease and its complications, evaluating responses to standard treatments.&#xD;
      Protocol enrollees may be asked to contribute blood and/or urine samples for immunological&#xD;
      research studies, and/or for studies designed to find parameters that increase a subject s&#xD;
      risk for diabetes and/or its associated complications.&#xD;
