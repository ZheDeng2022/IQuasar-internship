      This study will examine the use of prolonged exposure therapy on people who have recently&#xD;
      experienced a trauma to prevent them from developing post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that forms in response to a traumatic&#xD;
      event. The symptoms of PTSD, such as hyper-arousal and re-experiencing the traumatic event,&#xD;
      are common in all people who have recently experienced a trauma, but those who develop PTSD&#xD;
      continue to have these symptoms more than a month after the trauma. Some researchers believe&#xD;
      that developing PTSD is the result of a failure to adequately recover from the trauma. This&#xD;
      study will determine whether providing a common form of treatment for PTSD, prolonged&#xD;
      exposure (PE) therapy, to people who have recently experienced trauma will prevent them from&#xD;
      developing PTSD. The study will also seek to identify predictive markers, such as hormone&#xD;
      levels and genes, for developing PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 3 months. Participants will first undergo an evaluation&#xD;
      session that will include an interview, questionnaires, and a medical chart review for blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate measurements taken after their trauma. They will then be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either PE therapy or assessments only. Participants receiving PE therapy&#xD;
      will complete three weekly treatment sessions, with the first occurring immediately after the&#xD;
      evaluation session. Treatment will involve reviewing memories of a recent trauma out loud&#xD;
      with a therapist and audio-recording these discussions for review at home. All participants&#xD;
      will undergo assessments 1 and 3 months after the initial evaluation session. The 1-month&#xD;
      assessment will involve an interview and questionnaires similar to the evaluation session,&#xD;
      and the 3-month session will involve only a brief phone interview. Some participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete an optional part of the study in which they provide two saliva&#xD;
      samples to researchers: one to measure stress hormones and one to test for genetic bases of&#xD;
      trauma response.&#xD;
