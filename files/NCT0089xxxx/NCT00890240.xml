  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (process by which JNJ-31001074 is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the&#xD;
      body) after a single dose of JNJ-31001074. Up to three dose strengths will be tested in&#xD;
      patients 6-11 years old with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This will be an open-label (both the physician and patient know which treatment will be&#xD;
      administered), multicenter, sequential-group (one group after another), single-dose, Phase I&#xD;
      study in 6-11 year old patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
      Patients in the first group will be administered a single dose of JNJ-31001074 while they are&#xD;
      observed and tested (blood and urine samples collected) for a period of time. If they do not&#xD;
      exhibit any adverse side effects and the data collected is within the predicted safe values,&#xD;
      the dose will be increased for a new group of patients. Three dose groups are planned (0.015,&#xD;
      0.045 and 0.15 mg/kg) and up to 18 patients will complete the study. The study consists of a&#xD;
      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-study/early withdrawal&#xD;
      assessments. During screening, patients will be required to give their assent to participate&#xD;
      (agreement to participate) in the study and parents/guardians will be required to provide&#xD;
      their consent. Patients will be evaluated to see if they meet selection criteria specified in&#xD;
      the protocol. Patients who meet the selection criteria at screening will report to the study&#xD;
      center on the evening prior to Day 1 to confirm that they continue to meet the eligibility&#xD;
      requirements. If the patient is still eligible, they will be admitted to the study center and&#xD;
      will be required to fast (no food or beverages) for at least 4 hours prior to their dose. On&#xD;
      Day 1, a single dose of either 0.015, 0.045 or 0.15 mg/kg of JNJ-31001074 will be&#xD;
      administered at approximately 8 am, followed by multiple blood sampling and urine collection.&#xD;
      At the Investigator's discretion, patients may be discharged on Day 3 after the last blood&#xD;
      and urine samples are taken, or alternatively, they may be discharged on Day 1 after the&#xD;
      12-hour blood and urine samples are taken. In the latter case, patients will be required to&#xD;
      return to the study center on Day 2 and Day 3 for additional blood and urine samples.&#xD;
      Parent(s) may remain at the study center with their child. Patients in the first dose group&#xD;
      of the study will receive a single 0.015 mg/kg dose of JNJ-31001074. The data obtained from&#xD;
      the patients in the first dose group will be reviewed prior to the second dose group (0.045&#xD;
      mg/kg) being started. Data obtained from the patients in the second dose group will be&#xD;
      reviewed prior to the third dose group (0.15 mg/kg) being started. All patients will be&#xD;
      required to return to the study site for an end of study / early withdrawal assessment. The&#xD;
      maximum duration of participation for each patient is expected to be 24 days. Depending on&#xD;
      their body weight and which dose group they are participating in (0.015 mg/kg, 0.045 mg/kg or&#xD;
      0.15 mg/kg), patients will be dosed once with a combination of 0.25, 1, 3, and 5 mg tablets&#xD;
      of JNJ-31001074 administered orally.&#xD;
