  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, prospective, single institution dose-escalation study. The patient&#xD;
      population includes non-induction candidate elderly patients with AML or MDS and/or patients&#xD;
      with high-risk or relapsed/refractory AML or MDS. Five dose cohorts will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      fixed dose of ATRA in combination with an escalating dose of dasatinib. The investigators&#xD;
      will treat with an escalating dose of dasatinib from 70mg to 140mg daily. Dose escalation&#xD;
      will proceed in a standard 3+3 fashion. A de-escalation to a 50 mg total daily dose of&#xD;
      dasatinib is planned if DLT is greater than or equal to 33% is observed at the first dose&#xD;
      level. Once the MTD for the combination of the drugs has been established, up to 6 additional&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at the MTD level to obtain additional safety information about the&#xD;
      combination and to allow for preliminary laboratory correlate analysis.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of dasatinib and ATRA in&#xD;
      relapsed or elderly, non-induction candidate acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or MDS patients&#xD;
      and to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of dasatinib and ATRA when administered&#xD;
           as combination therapy for patients with AML or MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if the combination therapy of dasatinib and ATRA promotes differentiation&#xD;
           of AML or MDS .&#xD;
