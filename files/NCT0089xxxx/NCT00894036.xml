      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the molecular epidemiology and genetic variability of&#xD;
      ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae (E-ESBL) among children in Switzerland and to estimate the&#xD;
      associated clinical burden of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The genetic variability (and especially the distribution of strains harbouring the CTX-M&#xD;
           genes) among children is similar to that observed in adults;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The overall burden of disease is still low in Switzerland compared to neighbouring&#xD;
           countries. However, treatment of severe E-ESBL infections is challenging;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The recommended oral treatment procedure with 3rd generation cephalosporins for febrile&#xD;
           urinary tract infection may contribute to increased prevalence of E-ESBL in the long&#xD;
           term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is scheduled to start July 1st, 2008, and end June 30th, 2010.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing resistance to antibiotics is a growing problem in public health and is associated&#xD;
      with treatment failures, increased health care costs, and prolonged hospital stays. Over the&#xD;
      past years, one mechanism of resistance has been of particular concern: ESBL, which is&#xD;
      produced mainly by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species but also found in other gram&#xD;
      negative bacteria. ESBLs are plasmid-encoded ß-lactamases conferring resistance to&#xD;
      penicillins, cephalosporins and aztreonam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESBL-producing enterobacteria are usually susceptible to carbapenems, such as ertapenem,&#xD;
      imipenem or meropenem. Thus, treatment with carbapenems remains safe if the presence of ESBL&#xD;
      is recognized. However, the confirmation of ESBL is not always a routine procedure in all&#xD;
      laboratories. Furthermore, ESBL strains with high resistance to ertapenem and decreased&#xD;
      activity to imipenem and meropenem have already been described. The mechanism among these&#xD;
      strains however, appears to be a combination of the expression of ESBL and impermeability or&#xD;
      increased efflux for carbapenems. Infection with ESBL-producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae is&#xD;
      potentially hazardous for patients. Mortality is significantly higher following a bloodstream&#xD;
      infection caused by ESBL producing E. coli compared to non-ESBL producing strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESBLs are encoded on plasmids: classically, these plasmid mediated enzymes have been of the&#xD;
      TEM and SHV type. However, in recent years CTX-M-type ESBLs have been increasingly identified&#xD;
      worldwide throughout the world. CTX-M enzymes predominantly hydrolyze cefotaxime, but are&#xD;
      weakly active against ceftazidime. However, some ESBLs of the CTX-M family also display&#xD;
      increased hydrolytic activities against ceftazidime, as is the case for CTXM-15 and CTX-M-32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of ESBL producing enterobacteria and particularly E. coli has significantly&#xD;
      increased in recent years. This increase is primarily due to the spread of ESBL of the&#xD;
      CTX-M-type. Genes encoding CTX-M enzymes are associated with mobile genetic elements allowing&#xD;
      these enzymes to spread throughout the community. Well established primer sets are used in&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the detection of the blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M&#xD;
      genes, and are used to differentiate ESBL strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESBL-producing organisms were first detected in Europe in the 1980s. Although the initial&#xD;
      reports came from Germany, the vast majority of descriptions in that first decade came from&#xD;
      France. Consequently, it was not surprising that the first large outbreak occurred in France&#xD;
      in 1986. Other outbreaks with ESBL-producing organisms have now been reported from almost&#xD;
      every European country. In southern Europe, the prevalence of ESBL in hospitals is estimated&#xD;
      around 25% for Klebsiella species, while in the community it is 1.7% for E. coli, and 4% for&#xD;
      K. pneumoniae. In the USA, ESBL-producing organisms were first reported in 1988. Similarly to&#xD;
      Europe, these strains expanded over the following years, and in 2002, 6.1% of the K.&#xD;
      pneumoniae isolates were found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in at least one tenth of intensive care units, ESBL producing K. pneumoniae&#xD;
      quickly exceeded 25% of all isolated strains. In contrast, in regular inpatient areas&#xD;
      prevalence rates remained around 5.7% of all isolated K. pneumoniae. ESBL strains have also&#xD;
      been documented in South Africa, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and a variety of North African&#xD;
      countries. In South America, the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program recovered ESBL in&#xD;
      up to 10% of E. coli and 55% of K. pneumoniae. National surveys in Asia have revealed the&#xD;
      presence of ESBL-producers in 5 to 8% of E. coli in Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore and&#xD;
      in 12 to 24% in Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The prevalence in China&#xD;
      ranged between 27% and 34% for E. coli and up to 38.3% for K. pneumoniae already in 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This worldwide distribution is reflected by the fact that ESBL producing enterobacteria are&#xD;
      present in the community, and in adult as well as in children's hospitals. However, in this&#xD;
      younger population, ESBL-producing strains are isolated not exclusively but essentially in&#xD;
      neonatology, where various outbreaks have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in neonates in India revealed ESBL-strains in half of the infants with early-onset&#xD;
      sepsis, and in 82% with late-onset sepsis. A study of blood samples from suspected cases of&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis detected ESBL in 87% of Klebsiella spp., 73% of Enterobacter spp. and 64% of&#xD;
      E. coli strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If considering resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins as an indicator for ESBL, the&#xD;
      prevalence of ESBL producing E.coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae among children in Switzerland&#xD;
      was estimated 2.2% and 4.3% in 2006, respectively (www.search.ifik.unibe.ch). The frequency&#xD;
      of ESBL producing enterobacteria in Geneva in the same year was 1.8% for E. coli and 4.9% for&#xD;
      Klebsiella spp. (personal communication Dr. P. Rohner). In the Department of Paediatrics in&#xD;
      Geneva, the majority of ESBL producers were found among children from &quot;Terre des Hommes&quot;, a&#xD;
      non-profit humanitarian organization, which brings African children to Switzerland for&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. These children all had a history of multiple hospital stays in their country&#xD;
      of origin, and possibly repeated antimicrobial therapies. However, most ESBL strains can be&#xD;
      expected from urinary tract infections on a national basis. The new recommendations of the&#xD;
      entire oral treatment with 3rd generation cephalosporins without initial intravenous&#xD;
      application for uncomplicated febrile urinary tract infections in children will be effective&#xD;
      by 2008. Therefore, most children will be treated fully on an outpatient basis by their&#xD;
      paediatricians or general practitioners. Treatment over all might increase by the simplified&#xD;
      therapeutic procedure and some general practitioners might switch from&#xD;
      trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole to 3rd generation cephalosporins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for ESBL colonization or infection are well defined and similar to other&#xD;
      resistant microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): serious illness with&#xD;
      prolonged hospital stays, invasive medical devices (urinary catheters, endotracheal tubes,&#xD;
      central venous lines), and repeated or prolonged antibiotic use, especially 3rd generation&#xD;
      cephalosporins. Selective antibiotic pressure is clearly associated with the emergence and&#xD;
      dissemination of ESBL-producing enterobacteria. Children with bloodstream infections due to&#xD;
      ESBL producing K. pneumoniae were almost 6 times more likely of prior exposure to an&#xD;
      extended-spectrum cephalosporin in the 30 days before infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enterobacteria can be transferred by direct contact or through fomites. Various outbreaks&#xD;
      have been described incriminating sources such as other patients, artificial fingernails or&#xD;
      ultrasonography gel. The identification of ESBL-producing bacteria should prompt the use of&#xD;
      isolation and contact precaution measures. The application of such measures together with&#xD;
      antibiotic stewardship was successful to overcome most outbreaks with ESBL-producing&#xD;
      enterobacteria. However, the success of infection control measures depends largely on the&#xD;
      recognition of risk and of carrier states. Therefore, not only infected children should be&#xD;
      tracked but colonized patients as well, as they are capable of transmitting ESBL-producing&#xD;
      bacteria to vectors such as health-care workers, or directly to other patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, additional costs and use of resources are important and ESBL infections are&#xD;
      expensive. Average infection-related costs per patient are significantly greater for ESBL&#xD;
      patients than for control patients without ESBL. Additional costs attributed to the infection&#xD;
      of an ESBL producer were estimated to 16'450 $ per patient and hospital stay. This cost&#xD;
      increase was mainly due to increased length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective surveillance of ESBL-producing enterobacteria in Switzerland is essential&#xD;
      because ESBL-producing enterobacteria represent already a threat for the patients. This&#xD;
      includes delayed treatment and therefore cure, and increased health costs. ESBL will probably&#xD;
      be even more of a concern if no action is taken now in order to decrease its prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children aged 0 to 16 years admitted to a paediatric ward and either colonized or&#xD;
      infected with an ESBL-producing strain will be included in the study. Identification of&#xD;
      ESBL-producing strains will be performed in local microbiology laboratories using the local&#xD;
      available detection methods. All strains will then be collected at the investigation centre&#xD;
      for microbiological confirmation of ESBL-production and analysis of the genes associated with&#xD;
      ESBL phenotype by sequencing. Because microbiological methods differ between laboratories,&#xD;
      the investigation centre will therefore directly contact the local microbiology laboratories&#xD;
      in order to obtain information about specific methods used to isolate the ESBL strains and&#xD;
      feedback will be given after examination of the strains at the study centre. Hospitals&#xD;
      reporting cases to SPSU will receive a case report form (CRF) for each patient in order to&#xD;
      get patient data, medical history and implemented infection control measures. Strains&#xD;
      isolated as potential ESBL should be stored and some colonies be sent to the study centre for&#xD;
      microbiological analysis. The shipment will be organised and paid by the study centre. The&#xD;
      shipment of stains is on a voluntary basis but recommended for quality control and to analyse&#xD;
      the molecular resistance mechanisms. In order to ease logistic obstacles, hospitals are asked&#xD;
      to only provide contact information of their respective laboratories; these however will be&#xD;
      addressed directly by the study centre in order to obtain microbiological information and to&#xD;
      organize shipment of the strains. Data management and entry will be performed by the study&#xD;
      centre. This is an observational study. The study design with SPSU precludes any&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics will be reported by using standard descriptive statistics (mean, median,&#xD;
      percentage) for the following variables: age (gestational age), sex, country of origin, last&#xD;
      stay outside Switzerland, past hospitalisations, direct transfer from a hospital abroad,&#xD;
      prior antibiotic use, and history of urinary tract infections. Risk factor analysis for ESBL&#xD;
      infection vs. ESBL colonisation will be provided using standard statistical methods such as&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis for the following variables: age (gestational age), gender, main&#xD;
      diagnosis, comorbidity, immune-deficiency, length of hospital stay, length of neonatal stay,&#xD;
      length of intensive care unit stay, medical devices (central venous lines, endotracheal&#xD;
      tubes, urinary catheters), and antibiotic use (especially third generation cephalosporins).&#xD;
      Furthermore, information about isolation precaution measures and outbreak investigation will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children (age range: birth until 16 years of age) colonized or infected with any&#xD;
      ESBL-producing enterobacteria according to antibiotic testing of local microbiology&#xD;
      laboratory, will be included. All isolated strains will be sent to the University Hospitals&#xD;
      of Geneva's Microbiology Laboratory (Head: Prof. J. Schrenzel) for confirmation by specific&#xD;
      ESBL culture techniques (double disc diffusion technique) and for identification of&#xD;
      resistance genes by in-house sequencing. There are no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive study without having any direct effect on patient care. All information&#xD;
      obtained in this study is already documented in the patients' chart and therefore no signed&#xD;
      consent form will be asked. All data will be analysed anonymously and stored in a safe,&#xD;
      password-protected computer. We will obtain an approval from the Ethical Committee of the&#xD;
      University Hospitals of Geneva before the beginning of the study.&#xD;
