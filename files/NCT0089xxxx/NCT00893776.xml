  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small, pilot study consisting of twelve participants with subacute (6-12 months&#xD;
      post-stroke)and chronic stroke (1year+ post-stroke)living in and around Columbia area. The&#xD;
      twelve participants will randomly be selected to participate in either unilateral&#xD;
      (one-handed) task training (6 participants) or bilateral (two-handed) task training (6&#xD;
      participants) with the SaeboFlex orthosis. Each group will undergo six assessments to&#xD;
      establish pre-testing baseline and qualification, followed by a training session, four-week&#xD;
      combined home and clinic program, and post-testing to determine changes in affected arm use&#xD;
      and function. The hypothesis is that two-handed training will before effective than&#xD;
      one-handed training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SaeboFlex device is a mechanical orthosis that promotes grasp and release and functional&#xD;
      movement of an upper limb that has impaired movement due to a stroke. Many researchers have&#xD;
      found that incorporating both the affected and unaffected limb together during exercises&#xD;
      (bilateral task training) results in increased functional use of the affected limb as&#xD;
      compared to only performing exercises with the affected limb. Therefore, we want to determine&#xD;
      if bilateral task training is more effective than unilateral task training with the use of&#xD;
      the SaeboFlex device in subacute and chronic stroke rehabilitation. For the unilateral&#xD;
      training group, exercises will be completed with only the affected hand using the Saebo&#xD;
      device. For the bilateral group, the Saebo will be on the affected hand, no device on the&#xD;
      unaffected hand, and both arms will do the exact same movements/exercises at the same time.&#xD;
      The participants will be videotaped and photographed moving balls without the device, with&#xD;
      the device at the start of the study, with the device midway through the study, and at the&#xD;
      end of the study. This will be done for the purpose of providing participant feedback&#xD;
      regarding their progress and for report of outcomes upon completion of the project. Faces&#xD;
      will be omitted from all photographic media at the request of the participant, and the&#xD;
      participant may decline photographic media at any time without having to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>This group will wear the SaeboFlex orthosis on their affected extremity and do exercises with that extremity only. SaeboFlex exercises include moving the ball in high repetition of grasp and release while wearing the SaeboFlex orthosis to various positions individualized to each participant based on movement deficits, as well as Task Training (using the affected arm during specific functional activities to use newly acquired movement patterns)</description>
