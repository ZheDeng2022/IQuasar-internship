  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I study of a new cell based prostate cancer therapy (ALECSAT). In this&#xD;
      therapy specific cells from the patient's own immune system are isolated, activated and&#xD;
      re-administered to the patient to boost a specific immune response against the cancer cells.&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to show safety and tolerability for this type of therapy. It is the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the cells administered during the therapy will attack the tumour cells and in&#xD;
      this way stop or slow down the progression of disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective open phase I study to investigate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      administration of a single dose of a cell based medicinal product (CBMP) ALECSAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALECSAT is an autologous CBMP that is made from the patient's own blood cells. ALECSAT&#xD;
      contains a large amount of tumour specific cytotoxic Lymphocytes (CTL) and Natural Killer&#xD;
      (NK) cells that are isolated activated and amplified in number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBMP is given as a slow i. v. injection to patients with prostate cancer. The patients&#xD;
      are in the late stage of the disease where they have received hormone treatment but their&#xD;
      disease is progressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to observe if any side effects or tolerability issues&#xD;
      occur as a consequence of the cell administration, secondarily it will be observed if any&#xD;
      positive anti tumour effect may be observed. The study has the purpose to investigate whether&#xD;
      treatment with ALECSAT in any way is toxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: The study is an open, prospective phase I safety study of ALECSAT in prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group consisting of 6 patients will be treated with ALECSAT according to the protocol. Then&#xD;
      an interim analysis will be done. If there are no signs of significant toxicity related to&#xD;
      the treatment, the study will continue with 8 more patients that will be included and treated&#xD;
      with ALECSAT according to the phase I protocol. Thus this study will include a total of 14&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will after a single administration of ALECSAT be hospitalised for 3 days and&#xD;
      will furthermore be followed closely for 7 weeks by 5 planned study visits, by the&#xD;
      investigators at Urologisk Klinik at Fredrikssund Hospital.&#xD;
