      The objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      brompheniramine maleate (BROM) in children and adolescents, ages 2 to less than 18 years&#xD;
      following dosing in accordance with current weight-age dosing guidelines. Once characterized,&#xD;
      the PK data will be pooled with adult PK data from other studies and analyzed under a&#xD;
      separate analysis plan to confirm or refine the existing OTC doses in children aged 2 to &lt;12&#xD;
      yrs and adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 yrs.&#xD;

             pounds and within the 5th and 95th percentiles in height and weight, and BMI based on&#xD;
             age and gender&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic or asymptomatic children/adolescents as follows:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  No symptoms of an acute URI, but at risk for developing an acute URI as evidenced&#xD;
                  by the following frequency, crowding, and exposure criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Frequency: a history of frequent URIs defined as greater than 6&#xD;
                       infections/yr for children aged 2 to less than 6 yrs and as greater than 4&#xD;
                       infections per year for adolescents aged 6 to less than 18 yrs;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Crowding: living in a home with greater than 4 persons, or sleeping in the&#xD;

                       with a URI, or a child in the family that is attending preschool, or&#xD;
                       attending school with greater than 6 children in the class;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Except for allergic rhinitis or a URI, children/adolescents are in normal physical&#xD;
             health (i.e., no clinically significant systemic disease) as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator upon physical examination of the subject;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects do not require concomitant medication except for low-dose inhaled&#xD;
             glucocorticoids for allergic rhinitis or mild concomitant asthma, if dose is&#xD;
             stabilized before entry in the study (i.e., dose is not changed for one month prior to&#xD;
             or during the study), and inhaled short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists for&#xD;
             concomitant asthma, as needed;&#xD;
