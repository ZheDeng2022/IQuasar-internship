    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and side effects of zoledronic&#xD;
      acid (also known as Zometa) in patients before they have surgery to remove the cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the pancreas carries an ominous prognosis. The five-year overall survival rate of&#xD;
      this malignancy is less than 5%. Chemotherapy with gemcitabine carries a response rate of&#xD;
      approximately 25%. Resection offers the only potential for cure; however, even with&#xD;
      resection, the great majority of patients will die with metastatic disease. Substantial&#xD;
      improvements are needed in the treatment of this malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with this disease process have clearly developed a tolerance to their pancreatic&#xD;
      tumor. This is evidenced by an increased number and activity immunosuppressive cells&#xD;
      including MDSC and Treg in patients with pancreas cancer. An intervention that inhibits this&#xD;
      population of MDSC and Treg may be highly useful in the treatment of this disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel treatment of pancreas cancer, in this setting, would be to deplete circulating and&#xD;
      tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells prior to resection. This would facilitate the host&#xD;
      to mount a greater immune response against the tumor. The eventual goal would be to combine&#xD;
      neoadjuvant zoledronic acid with gemcitabine, another agent which synergizes with zoledronic&#xD;
      acid to target MDSC. When combined with current adjuvant chemoradiation, the use of&#xD;
      zoledronic acid in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, it is hoped that the patient could&#xD;
      mount a greater immune response leading to increased overall survival through the prevention&#xD;
      of local disease and distant metastasis.&#xD;
