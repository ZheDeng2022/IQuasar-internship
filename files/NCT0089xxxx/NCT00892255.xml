  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to pathologically evaluate the destruction by microwave&#xD;
      ablation of primary and metastatic liver tumors. The primary aim is to measure tissue&#xD;
      destruction with the MedWaves Microwave Ablation/ Coagulation Ablation System.&#xD;

      Minimally invasive surgical alternatives are becoming more attractive for the treatment of&#xD;
      malignancy.The goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase the ability to treat&#xD;
      patients in the outpatient setting. Image-guided ablation is becoming an attractive&#xD;
      alternative because of its relative low cost, its ability to provide large regions of&#xD;
      coagulative necrosis in a controlled fashion, and its relatively low toxicity. Although&#xD;
      image-guided ablative techniques have been extensively investigated for the treatment of&#xD;
      liver tumors, there has been limited experience with microwave ablation (MWA) in the liver.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the treatment effect of MWA in liver tumors. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      planned surgical removal of liver tumors will have the tumors intra-operatively treated with&#xD;
      MWA. The histological changes will be evaluated upon removal of the specimen.&#xD;
