  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to assess the sustained&#xD;
      effects on weight, selected risk factors and sense of well-being of offering individualized&#xD;
      weight management advice in the primary care setting to patients who wish to lose weight; and&#xD;
      to identify the key factors influencing the success of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary care could make a substantial impact on the increasing prevalence of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity and their associated adverse impact on health. The lack of a proven intervention may&#xD;
      deter health professionals in primary care from providing support to their overweight&#xD;
      patients as few obese people recall receiving weight control advice from a health&#xD;
      professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to conduct a large scale randomised controlled trial to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a longer-term structured lifestyle support programme provided by a research&#xD;
      nurse and the provision of pedometers compared to usual care in overweight/ obese adults who&#xD;
      wish to lose weight. We will assess the degree of weight loss over a period of 12 months as&#xD;
      well as related factors such as changes in waist circumference, quality of life and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is highly relevant to policy making at both national and local levels.&#xD;
