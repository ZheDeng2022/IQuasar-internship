  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs. Symptoms include repeated episodes of wheezing,&#xD;
      breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Some people with&#xD;
      asthma experience worse symptoms at night, which is known as nocturnal asthma (NA). The&#xD;
      reason for the decline in lung function at night in some asthmatics is not well understood,&#xD;
      but it may be linked to the human biological clock, which controls daily activity and sleep&#xD;
      rhythms. To determine whether differences in biological clocks relate to worsening nocturnal&#xD;
      lung function, this study will evaluate the circadian rhythms of people with NA, people with&#xD;
      non-nocturnal asthma, and healthy people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal worsening of asthma, frequently called NA, is a common problem among some people&#xD;
      with asthma and one that leads to increased morbidity and mortality. It is still unknown why&#xD;
      lung function worsens at night in some asthmatics and not others. There is a possible&#xD;
      relationship between NA, biological clocks, and circadian rhythms, but more research is&#xD;
      needed to understand this relationship. Although the diurnal nature of NA has been shown&#xD;
      repeatedly in studies, circadian rhythms have not yet been implicated as a related factor.&#xD;
      This study will examine the pathophysiology of NA as it relates to circadian biology and will&#xD;
      specifically explore physiological and molecular aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include people with asthma, people with NA, and healthy people. Potential&#xD;
      participants will attend a screening visit to assess general health and severity of asthma,&#xD;
      if present. They will also complete 2 weeks of diary recordings of their daily symptoms and&#xD;
      airway function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will then attend two study visits. The first study visit will last 1&#xD;
      hour and may include a methacholine challenge and bronchodilator testing, both of which will&#xD;
      measure lung function. For 2 weeks before the second study visit, participants will keep&#xD;
      records of their sleep patterns. The second study visit will be a hospital stay that will&#xD;
      last for 2.5 days. While in the hospital, participants will undergo periodic blood draws and&#xD;
      lung function testing. During waking hours, participants will remain quietly awake. During&#xD;
      the first night, participants will be monitored while they sleep. During the second night,&#xD;
      participants will stay awake for 28 hours, which will continue into the third day. Then, on&#xD;
      the third day, participants will sleep for 8 hours while again being monitored. Upon waking,&#xD;
      participants will be given a regular meal and discharged.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria for People with Asthma:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A physician diagnosis of asthma, consistent clinical history, and either 1) airway&#xD;
             hyperresponsiveness indicated by a 20% or greater decrease in forced expiratory volume&#xD;
             at one second (FEV1) in response to inhalation of methacholine at 8 mg/mL or less, or&#xD;
             2) bronchodilator-responsive expiratory airflow limitation (if FEV1 less than 70% of&#xD;
