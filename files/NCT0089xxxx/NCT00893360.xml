    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving cardiosphere-derived stem cells&#xD;
      (CDCs) to patients with decreased heart function and/or a large amount of damaged muscle&#xD;
      after a heart attack is safe. CDCs are cells grown from small biopsy samples taken from the&#xD;
      heart. Giving a patient their own CDCs is an investigational procedure that has been approved&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration for this study. In addition to determining whether this&#xD;
      treatment is safe, the study will also examine whether it can decrease the amount of heart&#xD;
      muscle damage and/or improve heart function after a heart attack. The amount of heart muscle&#xD;
      damage and the function of the heart directly affects prognosis (the predicted course of the&#xD;
      disease), and the development of heart failure and other complications some patients&#xD;
      experience after a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By way of background, scientists and physicians believed, until just a few years ago, that&#xD;
      heart muscle damaged after a heart attack could not be replaced. Recently, however,&#xD;
      scientists discovered that new heart muscle can form, or be regenerated, and that this&#xD;
      process can be enhanced (or increased) by the administration of large numbers of certain&#xD;
      cells isolated from the heart or bone marrow. These cells can be stem cells, or cells derived&#xD;
      from stem cells, and they may achieve their benefit by forming new heart muscle cells,&#xD;
      becoming heart muscle cells themselves, or releasing substances which increase the ability of&#xD;
      already existing stem cells to form new heart muscle. All of the studies conducted so far&#xD;
      have been experimental and no cell type is approved for routine clinical care of patients&#xD;
      with heart disease. However, studies involving bone marrow stem cells do indicate some small&#xD;
      improvement in heart function and one large study demonstrated a decrease in clinical events&#xD;
      in the group which received bone marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators of this study decided to study CDCs because they come from a person's own body,&#xD;
      and therefore have no foreign immune antigens which may be rejected. Since the cells come&#xD;
      from the person's heart, they are more likely to form heart tissue. In addition, animal&#xD;
      studies indicate no safety problems and that these cells are capable of forming heart muscle&#xD;
      and blood vessel cells after heart attacks. The investigators are now studying whether the&#xD;
      same is true in humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The type of study that is being proposed is called a prospective, randomized, dose escalation&#xD;
      study. This means that some of the patients will receive a solution which contains the cells&#xD;
      and some of the patients will receive conventional medical treatment. The ratio is 2:1, which&#xD;
      means that twice as many patients will receive cells as will receive conventional medical&#xD;
      treatment. The first 6 patients in each group will be randomized to receive the study drug at&#xD;
      a dose of 12.5 million cells or conventional medical treatment. The remaining 18 patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive study drug at a dose of 25 million cells or conventional&#xD;
      medical treatment. The DSMB will evaluate unblinded AE data (including SAEs) when the first&#xD;
      six patients have been enrolled and those receiving cells have been discharged. There are two&#xD;
      study sites. Each site will enroll 15 participants. The total number of subjects will be 30,&#xD;
      with an approximate 20% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be referred to participate in the study by physicians caring for them. The&#xD;
      target number of participants is 24 patients who have an open artery to inject the stem cells&#xD;
      and whose biopsy tissues have been grown to 12.5 million cells. If for some reason the cells&#xD;
      cannot be expanded to 12.5 million or the subject's artery is not open enough to allow proper&#xD;
      injection, the subject will be replaced in the study population of 24 patients but continue&#xD;
      to be followed. This means that the subject will undergo all tests, procedures (except cell&#xD;
      infusion) and follow-up visits that would have otherwise been required for participation in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject is determined to be eligible for the study, the protocol will be reviewed with&#xD;
      the subject and informed consent will be obtained by a physician participating in the study&#xD;
      prior to any testing or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted at the Cedars-Sinai Medial Center and The Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Hospital. The total length of a subject's participation in the study will be approximately 14&#xD;
      months, from enrollment to 12 month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING PHASE - Participants will undergo a screening evaluation. A physical examination&#xD;
      with medical history will be performed which includes medication review as well as alcohol or&#xD;
      drug use. A blood specimen will be obtained, approximately three teaspoons, to assess for&#xD;
      blood counts, chemistry, HIV, hepatitis and pregnancy test for females of childbearing age.&#xD;
      An MRI scan will be performed to determine whether the portion of the heart from which the&#xD;
      biopsy would be obtained was damaged from the heart attack. MRI will also detect if any&#xD;
      cardiac tumors are present. An electrocardiogram will be performed to assess your heart's&#xD;
      electrical activity. Additionally, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and&#xD;
      pelvis will be performed to detect any existing cancer or tumors. If any of the tests are&#xD;
      positive, the subject will not be able to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION - After the screening visit is completed, subjects will be randomized to either&#xD;
      cell infusion or conventional medical therapy. Randomization is 2:1, meaning that twice as&#xD;
      many subjects will be randomized to receive cell infusion as conventional medical therapy.&#xD;
      Conventional medical therapy after a heart attack can include beta blockers, aspirin,&#xD;
      diuretics, cholesterol lowering agents, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors or calcium channel&#xD;
      blockers and enrollment in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Depending on the degree of heart&#xD;
      damage and it's affects on the patient's heart rhythm, the patient may be eligible for&#xD;
      pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The specific medical management is&#xD;
      determined by the patient's primary care physician or cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE VISIT- At this visit several tests will be performed to assess the heart's baseline&#xD;
      function, i.e., the function before cells are infused. It will be conducted prior to the&#xD;
      biopsy. These include completion of a questionnaire about how much activity the subject can&#xD;
      perform; blood studies to measure blood count and the function of the liver and kidneys; an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram which measures the electrical activity of the heart; an exercise test which&#xD;
      will also measure blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, and the amount of oxygen and&#xD;
      carbon dioxide in the exhaled air; a test which measures how much distance the subject can&#xD;
      walk in six minutes; a test of lung function; a recording of the heart's rhythm over 48&#xD;
      hours; and an MRI to provide information about the baseline function and recovery of the&#xD;
      heart since the myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOPSY PHASE - For subjects randomized to receive stem cells, a biopsy of the heart will be&#xD;
      performed in the catheterization laboratory. In this test, a small amount of tissue is&#xD;
      removed from the internal lining of the heart. A long, flexible tube (catheter), called a&#xD;
      bioptome, is inserted into a vein and threaded into the right side of the heart. Most often&#xD;
      the catheter is threaded through the jugular vein of the neck under local anesthesia. The tip&#xD;
      of the catheter is fitted with tiny jaws that allow the doctor to take very small snips of&#xD;
      muscle for microscopic examination. The doctor will take 5-10 small pieces of heart tissue&#xD;
      from the right side of the wall that separates the right side of the heart from the left side&#xD;
      of the heart. This will be used to grow the cells over a four week period. Blood pressure and&#xD;
      vital signs status will be monitored during and for several hours following the procedure. An&#xD;
      electrocardiogram; blood (approximately 15 cc or 3 teaspoons) will be obtained to measure&#xD;
      your blood count, kidney and liver function; and urine specimen for urinalysis will be&#xD;
      collected. An echocardiogram will be performed before the patient leaves the hospital to&#xD;
      determine whether the instrument obtaining the biopsy caused a hole in the wall from which&#xD;
      the biopsy was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRACORONARY INFUSION PHASE - During this phase, subjects randomized to receive cells will&#xD;
      be brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to undergo a cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      procedure similar to the angioplasty performed to treat the heart attack. However, rather&#xD;
      than having an angioplasty, the cells will be injected into the coronary artery whose&#xD;
      blockage was responsible for the heart attack. The cells will be infused through a balloon&#xD;
      catheter inflated at the previously implanted stent. There will be no new stent implanted&#xD;
      unless it is felt clinically necessary. Following the procedure, the subject will remain in&#xD;
      the hospital for 24 hours at which time laboratory studies, including cardiac enzymes to rule&#xD;
      out cardiac injury, or a heart attack, as well as ECG monitoring will be performed. The&#xD;
      subject will be released from the hospital and asked to wear an ECG recording device for 48&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP VISITS - For all subjects enrolled in the study, there will be six follow-up&#xD;
      visits. This is necessary to obtain and compare information from both sets of study&#xD;
      participants. Additionally, it is necessary to obtain the information to determine the safety&#xD;
      of the cell infusion and whether it has decreased the amount of the heart which is damaged,&#xD;
      improved the blood flow and function of the heart and the portion of the heart which received&#xD;
      the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A history and physical will be performed at all of the 6 visits, asking the subject about any&#xD;
      side effects they may have had and what other medicines they are taking. Additionally, study&#xD;
      staff will perform an electrocardiogram, obtain blood and urine studies measuring blood&#xD;
      counts and kidney and liver function, and obtain a 48-hour recording of the subject's&#xD;
      electrocardiogram. During the six and twelve month visits, a cardiac MRI scan will also be&#xD;
      performed to measure the amount of the heart which is damaged and the blood flow and function&#xD;
      of the heart and to assess the portion of the heart which received the cells. It will also&#xD;
      determine whether any tumors have formed in the heart. At these visits, there will also be a&#xD;
      test of lung function, a six-minute walk test, and questions about how much activity the&#xD;
      subject can perform. Additionally, there will be an exercise test which will include&#xD;
      measuring heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and amount of oxygen and carbon&#xD;
      dioxide in exhaled air. Patients who receive an implantable cardio-defibrillator during the&#xD;
      study will have a cardiac CT instead of MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed in the study for a total of 12 months from the baseline visit&#xD;
      and any unexpected effects of the study will be reported to the hospital's institutional&#xD;
      review board, the study data safety monitoring board and the FDA, as appropriate, depending&#xD;
      on the severity of the adverse event.&#xD;
