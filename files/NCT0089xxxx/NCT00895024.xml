  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Objectives are to administer the Family Evaluation of Hospice Care (FEHC) questionnaire&#xD;
      and The Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (TRIG) to caregivers previously enrolled into the&#xD;
      parent grant and conduct supplemental analyses to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. examine cross-ethnic differences in the caregivers' quality of hospice care assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. investigate the association between parenteral hydration status of the patient and the&#xD;
           quality of care assessments provided by the caregivers after death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. examine the association between levels of grief (as measured by the TRIG) and the&#xD;
           quality of hospice care assessments provided by the caregiver.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the death of their loved-ones, caregivers will be asked to report on the care received&#xD;
      by their care recipient and the quality of practical and emotional care provided to them by&#xD;
      hospice by completing the 25-minute FEHC questionnaire over the phone. Caregivers will also&#xD;
      be asked 16 additional questions to assess their attitudes and beliefs about hydration at the&#xD;
      end of life, and a brief questionnaire to assess past and current levels of grief (TRIG). The&#xD;
      additional questions on hydration and grief can easily be completed in less than 10 minutes&#xD;
      over the phone. The entire interview should take no more than 35 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bereaved caregivers who have participated in the parent grant and have lost their loved one&#xD;
      within 3-23 months will be mailed a letter from Drs. Bruera and Torres inviting them to&#xD;
      participate in the voluntary supplemental after-death survey. The letter will include a brief&#xD;
      description of the research study and appropriate contact information for the caregiver to&#xD;
      call if she/he is interested in participating. The letters then will be followed up by a&#xD;
      phone call from Dr. Torres to verify receipt of the letter. If the caregivers express their&#xD;
      interest in participating in the study, they will be asked a few screening questions over the&#xD;
      phone to verify their eligibility. Once found eligible for the study, a telephone verbal&#xD;
      consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Isabel Torres will conduct the phone interviews with 128 primary caregivers who had&#xD;
      previously completed the parent grant protocol.&#xD;
