  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder that can cause organ damage. The BABY&#xD;
      HUG study is evaluating the use of the medication hydroxyurea at preventing organ damage in&#xD;
      children with SCA. The purpose of this follow-up study is to evaluate the long-term effects&#xD;
      of hydroxyurea in children who have participated in the BABY HUG study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCA is an inherited blood disorder in which the body makes sickle-shaped red blood cells that&#xD;
      contain abnormal hemoglobin. The sickled cells block blood flow in the vessels that lead to&#xD;
      limbs and organs. This can cause pain, serious infections, and organ damage. The BABY HUG&#xD;
      study (NCT00006400) is examining whether the medication hydroxyurea can prevent organ damage,&#xD;
      especially in the spleen and kidneys, in children with SCA. This study is a follow-up study&#xD;
      to the BABY HUG study and will enroll children who have participated in the BABY HUG study.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term effects of using hydroxyurea as a&#xD;
      treatment for SCA, including both the risks and benefits. Study researchers will also&#xD;
      investigate the optimal age to begin treatment with hydroxyurea in children with SCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll children between 2 and 7 years old who participated in the BABY HUG&#xD;
      study. Hydroxyurea will not be provided to participants as part of this study, but&#xD;
      participants may receive the medication from their own doctors. Parents of participants can&#xD;
      choose for their child to participate in this study in one of two ways-by enrolling in either&#xD;
      a passive follow-up group or an active follow-up group. For participants in the passive&#xD;
      follow-up group, study researchers will review participants' medical records every 6 months,&#xD;
      in addition to reviewing brain ultrasound tests and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans, if completed. Participants will have a blood and urine&#xD;
      collection at baseline and Year 4 (or at the end of the study, whichever comes first).&#xD;
      Participants in the active follow-up group will take part in the same study procedures as&#xD;
      participants in the passive follow-up group. In addition, at Year 2, participants in this&#xD;
      group will undergo an additional blood and urine collection, a scanning procedure to obtain&#xD;
      images of the liver and spleen, a kidney test, neuropsychological testing, and an ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging test to evaluate liver and spleen size.&#xD;

    <description>The change in splenic function from the randomized control trial baseline measurement was one of the primary outcomes. The change in splenic function (worse vs not-worse) was compared between the randomized treatment groups (hydroxyurea vs placebo). The change in splenic function from baseline to 48 months was defined as worse if it changed from normal to decreased or absent, or decreased to absent; and not worse if it changed from decreased to decreased, normal to normal, decreased to normal, absent to absent, or absent to decreased.</description>

          <description>An active follow-up involved the performance of many of the laboratory tests and procedures done during BABY HUG clinical trials study. These included, but not limited to, serial laboratory parameters that were not part of routine clinical care such as Hgb F levels, pitted cell count, Howell-Jolly Body determination, a liver-spleen scan, DTPA GFR measurement, creatinine clearance, Cystatin C, urine concentrating ability, transcranial Doppler, and neuropsychological testing. Patients could be on or off hydroxyurea at the start of Follow-Up Study I, and could change treatment during the study.</description>

          <description>A passive follow-up involved the abstraction of clinical data from the medical record. Results of physical examinations and laboratory tests performed as part of routine clinical care were recorded. Patients could be on or off hydroxyurea at the start of Follow-Up Study I, and could change treatment during the study.</description>

        <title>Change in Qualitative Spleen Function From Randomized Control Trial Baseline Measurement - Compared Between Children Randomized to Hydroxyurea vs Placebo</title>

The change in splenic function (worse vs not-worse) was compared between the randomized treatment groups (hydroxyurea vs placebo). The change in splenic function from baseline to 48 months was defined as worse if it changed from normal to decreased or absent, or decreased to absent; and not worse if it changed from decreased to decreased, normal to normal, decreased to normal, absent to absent, or absent to decreased.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Most children used hydroxyurea (HU) for at least part of the FUS-I observation period. This may dilute any effect of randomized group.&#xD;
Most children were on HU at the specified time points, which reduces power to compare on/off HU.</limitations_and_caveats>
