      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and breast tissue from healthy women in the laboratory&#xD;
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related&#xD;
      to breast cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at breast tissue in women not previously diagnosed&#xD;
      with breast cancer who are undergoing fine-needle aspiration.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if breast tissue DNA methylation profile and hormone concentration change&#xD;
           across follicular and luteal phase, or across menopause, in random fine needle&#xD;
           aspiration samples of women with no prior diagnosis or treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if DNA methylation profile and breast hormone levels correlate with&#xD;
           mammographic density, cytomorphology, or Gail risk estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a high throughput commercial assay for DNA methylation profiling for&#xD;
           assessing breast cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a highly sensitive, specific, and novel nanoassay for estradiol and&#xD;
           progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal women are stratified by menstrual cycle phase (mid-follicular [day 5-10] vs&#xD;
      mid-luteal [day 20-25]), based on an adjusted 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo breast density measurement by digital mammography. Blood samples are&#xD;
      obtained and analyzed for estradiol, progesterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
      measurements, to define menstrual/menopausal status, and for DNA extraction. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo random fine needle aspiration. Biopsy material from aspiration is analyzed for&#xD;
      cytomorphology, steroid radioimmunoassay (RIA), steroid nanoassay, and DNA methylation&#xD;
      studies (via polymerase chain reaction). The aspiration samples are also analyzed for&#xD;
      estradiol and progesterone levels using high-pressure liquid chromatography and RIA.&#xD;
