      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of the initial management of the critically injured&#xD;
      trauma patient yet there are numerous controversies surrounding this very common practice. As&#xD;
      a result, these controversies have been the subject of numerous clinical trials,&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines and systematic reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the publication of the landmark SAFE Study the equipoise between the 2 treatments (which&#xD;
      were representative solutions for colloid and crystalloids respectively), 4% albumin and&#xD;
      saline, was established. This has however been brought into further doubt by the paucity of&#xD;
      data on the use of hydroxyethylstarches (HES), which are less costly and have less side&#xD;
      effects than albumin, in trauma. More recent findings by Gruen and colleagues have shown that&#xD;
      as much as 5% of all trauma deaths are the result of fluid overload based on the North&#xD;
      American fluid management model for trauma (pure crystalloid fluid management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis done by Kern and Shoemaker found that supranormal fluid resuscitation with&#xD;
      crystalloids is beneficial when given before the onset of organ failure in critically ill&#xD;
      surgical patients. Balogh and colleagues found out that when supranormal fuid resuscitation&#xD;
      with crystalloids was applied to victims of severe trauma, this resulted in a statistically&#xD;
      significant increase in the incidence of mortality, multiple organ failure, intra-abdominal&#xD;
      hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). More recently, Kirkpatrick and&#xD;
      colleagues reviewed and defined a 'secondary' ACS as a direct result of fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
      They concluded that &quot;excess resuscitation with crystalloid fluids might be harming patients&#xD;
      and contributing to an increased occurrence of ACS.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as a pilot to test the hypothesis that there will be significant&#xD;
      differences in clinical outcomes for patients with severe trauma treated with colloid (HES)&#xD;
      plus crystalloid and crystalloid only fluid management regimens, most notably the incidence&#xD;
      of IAH and ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the hybrid colloid (HES) plus crystalloid fluid management regimen will&#xD;
      provide a means to avoid the untoward fluid overload and/or other complications of pure&#xD;
      crystalloid fluid management and the costs/complications of albumin administration.&#xD;
