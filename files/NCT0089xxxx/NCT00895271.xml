      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers have been studying immune cells (white&#xD;
           blood cells) to better understand how the human body s defense system works and adjusts&#xD;
           or regulates itself, and how changes in this system can make a person sick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the cells of patients who have problems with their immune systems, researchers&#xD;
           would like to collect samples of skin cells from patients with immune system disorders&#xD;
           and compare them with skin cells taken from healthy volunteers. By studying these cells,&#xD;
           researchers hope to determine whether these cells can be modified to create a new kind&#xD;
           of personalized gene therapy that would attempt to cure immune diseases in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain skin cells from patients with immune system disorders and from healthy&#xD;
           volunteers for research and comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients between the ages of 2 and 85 who have immune system disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both groups will be selected from the eligible participants of existing NIH studies into&#xD;
           immune system disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers may take up to two biopsies from participants arms, legs, abdomen, or back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsy site will be numbed with local anesthetic and cleaned before the sample is&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The punch skin biopsy needle will be inserted into the skin and rotated to remove a&#xD;
           small circle of skin (approximately 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch across). The area will be&#xD;
           closed with bandages or stitches, and then covered with a dressing. Any stitches will be&#xD;
           removed in 7 to 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue samples collected in the study will be stored for future research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed as an adjunct to other NIAID IRB approved protocols that allow for&#xD;
      genetic testing, which may include those that are screening protocols for patients with rare&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiency or immunodysregulation disorders. Patients deemed of sufficient&#xD;
      research interest after review of outside medical records, clinical evaluation, and testing&#xD;
      may be invited to participate in this study. Healthy volunteers will also be invited to&#xD;
      participate as a source of control samples for research testing. After consent and enrollment&#xD;
      into this study, skin punch biopsies will be obtained to establish dermal fibroblast cell&#xD;
      lines for research studies directed at understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of&#xD;
      these diseases. Cell lines will also be used to investigate the utility of induced&#xD;
      pluripotent stem cells (iPS) for lymphocyte derivation and targeted gene correction. The&#xD;
      nasal epithelial scrapings will be used for research purposes to grow out primary nasal&#xD;
      respiratory epithelial cell lines. These cell lines will be used for functional studies by&#xD;
      testing virus replication in them. These functional studies will allow us to identify new&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiencies that may present primarily as recurrent or persistent lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract virus infections.Results with the potential to impact medical care will be&#xD;
      relayed to the referring physicians and where applicable, patients will be referred to other&#xD;
      appropriate NIH protocols for additional clinical evaluation and treatment. The study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 200 patients and healthy volunteers over the next 5 years.&#xD;
