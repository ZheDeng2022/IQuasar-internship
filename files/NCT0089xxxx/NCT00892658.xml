  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. The incidence is&#xD;
      highest in Asia and it is increasing in North America, with a two to three fold increase in&#xD;
      mortality in North America expected over the next two decades. Previous research has shown&#xD;
      that tumours often have abnormal blood vessels that may reduce the effect of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. New drugs, known as &quot;anti-angiogenic&quot; drugs have been shown in animal and human&#xD;
      studies to damage or change tumour blood vessels in ways that may make tumors more sensitive&#xD;
      to radiation treatment. 38-44 patients diagnosed with HCC will be invited to take part in&#xD;
      this study. Upon completion, this study will establish the safety of the combination of&#xD;
      radiation and sorafenib in patients with HCC. This will also establish preliminary data&#xD;
      regarding efficacy of the combination and investigate potential imaging and serum/tissue&#xD;
      markers surrogates for tumor response and/or drug activity.&#xD;

      The study design will include 2 radiation strata of patients, with a constant radiation dose&#xD;
      for strata 1 requiring a low volume of liver to be irradiated, and a variable dose defined&#xD;
      based on the effective liver volume irradiated in the second strata, which will require more&#xD;
      liver volume to be irradiated, based on our prior experience. Both stratas one and two will&#xD;
      be accrued concurrently. Biologic response will be assessed using standard contrast CT scans.&#xD;
      Correlative studies of biological markers, perfusion CT, and microbubble contrast enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound will also be performed.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive sorafenib alone (following the dose escalation scheme) for one week, followed by 2 weeks of concurrent administration of sorafenib with conformal radiation therapy (6 fractions over two weeks). Sorafenib administration will continue for four weeks following completion of radiation. At three months following radiation, when liver toxicity is assessed, full dose sorafenib (400mg PO BID) will then be initiated and continued until disease progression or serious toxicity occurs, to a maximum time of 12 months.</description>

                  techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  diagnosed by showing vascular enhancement on a single technique if the AFP is&#xD;
                  over 200, in the setting of cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis.&#xD;
