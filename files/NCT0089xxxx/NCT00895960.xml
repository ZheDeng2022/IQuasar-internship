      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the effectiveness of dasatinib (Sprycel) with radiotherapy (RT) and 6 weeks of&#xD;
      concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) administered at 75 mg/m^2/day followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      temozolomide with concurrent dasatinib in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) as&#xD;
      measured by overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;

      PHASE I&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib is designed to change the function of certain genes. By changing the function of&#xD;
      these genes, it may prevent cancer from growing and spreading. It is also designed to block&#xD;
      or lower the activity of one or more tumor-causing proteins responsible for the uncontrolled&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, which may result in shrinking or stopping tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide is designed to kill cancer cells by damaging DNA (the genetic material of&#xD;
      cells). The damaged DNA may cause tumor cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of dasatinib based on when you joined this study. Up to 2 dose levels of dasatinib will&#xD;
      be tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of dasatinib given in combination with temozolomide is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the groups will take the same dose level of temozolomide for the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of study drugs you receive may change if you experience side effects. If at any&#xD;
      time you experience any intolerable side effects, tell the study doctor right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of standard of care, you will receive radiation therapy Monday-Friday for a total&#xD;
      of 30 radiation treatments (about 6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day while you are receiving radiation, you will take the temozolomide by mouth once a&#xD;
      day for up to a maximum of 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should swallow temozolomide whole, one right after the other, without chewing them. If&#xD;
      you vomit while taking temozolomide, you cannot take more capsules before the next scheduled&#xD;
      dose. They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after&#xD;
      eating) with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day while you are receiving radiation, you will take dasatinib by mouth 1 time a day&#xD;
      for up to a maximum of 7 weeks. You should take dasatinib without food (1 hour before or 2&#xD;
      hours after eating), with at least 1 cup (8 oz.) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the radiation therapy ends, every day, you will continually take dasatinib by mouth 1&#xD;
      time a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not take temozolomide for about 4 weeks after the radiation therapy ends. After 4&#xD;
      weeks, you will begin taking temozolomide 1 time a day, by mouth, on Days 1-5 of each 28 day&#xD;
      study cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) weeks after the end of radiation, then every 4 weeks after that, the following tests&#xD;
      and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your blood's ability to clot normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week for the first 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks after that, you will be asked if you&#xD;
      have experienced any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking an anti-seizure drug, every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks and then every 4&#xD;
      weeks after that, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the levels of anti-seizure&#xD;
      drug in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 6, then before each cycle after radiation for the first 6 cycles, you will have an&#xD;
      ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week for the first 6 weeks, then on Days 1 and 22 of every cycle after radiation, blood&#xD;
      (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) weeks after the end of radiation, then every 8 weeks after that, you will have an&#xD;
      MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking temozolomide for up to 12 cycles. You may continue taking dasatinib&#xD;
      for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or you experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you go off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 1/2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests and to check your&#xD;
           blood's ability to clot normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are taking an anti-seizure drug, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check&#xD;
           the level of anti-seizure drug in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end-of-study visit, the study team/staff will contact you by telephone every 3&#xD;
      months to check how you are doing. Each phone call will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Temozolomide is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of brain tumors. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the&#xD;
      treatment of some types of leukemia, but it is experimental for use in brain tumors. In&#xD;
      addition, the combination of temozolomide and dasatinib is experimental for use in brain&#xD;
      tumors. At this time, the combination is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 72 participants will take part in this study. Up to 72 will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

             3 months) significant gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with known HIV are ineligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must not have any disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter&#xD;
             drug metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients must not have received prior therapy with dasatinib for any indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Both men and women and members of all races and&#xD;
             ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients on the following medication will be excluded: a) Anticonvulsants: Patients on&#xD;
             Enzyme Inducing Anticonvulsants (EIAED) will be excluded. If patients were previously&#xD;
             on EIAEDs that have been discontinued, patients must have been off EIAEDs for &gt;/= 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to initiation of dasatinib. It should also be noted whether patients were&#xD;
             or were not previously receiving EIAEDs and the last date of administration of EIAEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. ( 15. continued) b) Antacids: Use of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors is&#xD;
             prohibited because systemic antacids (H2 inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors) decrease&#xD;
             dasatinib absorption. Patients who require antacids should use short acting, locally&#xD;
             active agents (e.g., Maalox, Mylanta etc.). However, these agents should not be taken&#xD;
             within either 2 hours before or 2 hours after the dasatinib dose. This is particularly&#xD;
             important in patients with glioblastoma who are frequently on dexamethasone and&#xD;
             prophylactic H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors.&#xD;
