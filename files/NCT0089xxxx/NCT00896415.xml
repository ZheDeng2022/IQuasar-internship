  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining strong muscles is important for the independence and quality of life in our older&#xD;
      population. Strong muscles provide mobility and reduce the chance of falls that lead to&#xD;
      injury. Many researchers are carrying out studies to examine different types of exercise and&#xD;
      drug treatments to prevent loss of muscle strength in older people. Often, these research&#xD;
      studies use x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans to measure the size and the amount of fat in&#xD;
      different muscles. These factors are known to reflect muscle health. Large studies can&#xD;
      involve many research subjects recruited at many different clinics with different CT&#xD;
      scanners. To ensure that these studies provide reliable results, the investigators must have&#xD;
      procedures to make sure that different CT scanners measure the same results for the same&#xD;
      amount of fat or muscle. The goal of our study is to develop these procedures. In this&#xD;
      project, the investigators will study women because they have the highest risk of bone&#xD;
      fractures resulting from falls. Thus, the subjects are being asked to volunteer for a study&#xD;
      where the subjects will be scanned on different scanners.&#xD;
