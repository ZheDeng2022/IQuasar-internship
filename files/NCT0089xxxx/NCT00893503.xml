  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a major public health concern in Alberta. Colorectal Cancer is the&#xD;
      fourth most common diagnosed cancer and second overall in terms of cancer deaths in Canada.&#xD;
      One in 14 males and 1 in 16 females aged 50-74 will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      will have an overall 1 in 28 chance of dying from colorectal cancer. While colorectal cancer&#xD;
      is surgically curable if diagnosed in the early stages, with five year survival rates of 90%&#xD;
      versus 10% if detected at more advanced stages, less than 20 % of all individuals in this age&#xD;
      bracket traditionally have undergone colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer often&#xD;
      presents with non-specific symptoms where non-cancerous polyps are commonly found. If these&#xD;
      polyps are left in place, they may grow over time and progress from a non-cancerous mass to&#xD;
      symptomatic cancerous tumors; therefore, early screening in those patients without symptoms&#xD;
      may thereby prevent the progression from a non-cancerous to cancerous finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis, or theory being studied in the SCOPE Pilot research study, is that&#xD;
      implementation of a colorectal screening program would decrease colorectal cancer prevalence,&#xD;
      increase the long-term survival ratio for patients, and decrease burden on the health care&#xD;
      system. Moreover, early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer has the potential to&#xD;
      increase the lifespan of patients and decrease health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCOPE Pilot Research study will recruit 1000 individuals between the ages of 50 - 74 of&#xD;
      average to high risk for developing colorectal cancer as determined by their referring&#xD;
      Gastroenterologists. Those patients who are ages 40-50 will also be eligible if they have a&#xD;
      personal or family history of colorectal cancer. Patients referred to the SCOPE Pilot program&#xD;
      will be further screened for eligibility, and if no exclusion criterion is present, will be&#xD;
      invited to attend an education session and research program. The SCOPE Pilot research study&#xD;
      will compare the current fecal occult blood testing (FOBT - Hemoccult II) with newly&#xD;
      available FOBT blood testing along with colonoscopy therapy. It will also encompass&#xD;
      educational information, risk stratification, screening for both average and high risk&#xD;
      patients, and colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Capital Health Region, 18.6% of colorectal cancers are detected at stage 1, while&#xD;
      22.4% are already at stage IV. The Capital Health Region has 340,000 individuals aged 50-74,&#xD;
      yet only 14.3% receive any colorectal cancer screening. These low screening rates may be&#xD;
      attributed to lack of awareness, the limitations of the fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and&#xD;
      the unpleasant associations with both the FOBT and the colonoscopy. The limitations of the&#xD;
      FOBT include low sensitivity for detection of adenomas and small cancers, the cumbersome&#xD;
      method of stool collection on multiple days and the dietary restrictions, which make patient&#xD;
      compliance low and introduce high probability of false positive tests and unnecessary&#xD;
      colonoscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two screening modalities available. The fecal occult blood testing&#xD;
      (FOBT: Hemoccult II) detects blood in the stool that may be due to colonic adenomas or&#xD;
      cancer. The second is colonoscopy, which is the gold standard in detecting colorectal&#xD;
      lesions; however it carries the risks of bleeding and bowel perforation. FOBT is the&#xD;
      recommended primary screening tool for patients at average risk for developing colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Large population-based randomized controlled trials have consistently demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant survival benefit in patients who undergo annual or biannual screening with FOBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, newer generation FOBT techniques, the FOBT immunochemical (FIT) has become&#xD;
      available. These tests are more sensitive in detecting specifically human blood in the stool&#xD;
      and do not require dietary restrictions. Recent studies have suggested the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of the FIT may be superior to standard Hemoccult II rates because of simplified&#xD;
      sampling. As well, economic analysis have suggest that the use of FIT is superior to FOBT in&#xD;
      diagnostic performance at a reasonable cost to a European population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A urine specimen will also be obtained and analyzed for metabolomics for each subject.&#xD;
      Metabolomics is the study of the global chemical composition of an organism. It utilizes&#xD;
      technologies such as a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the metabolite /&#xD;
      chemical composition, interactions, and changes in these levels in response to disease or&#xD;
      environmental factors. By analyzing urine samples, it has been possible to identify the&#xD;
      metabolite patterns characteristic of various diseases. In addition, the metabolite patterns&#xD;
      of liver disease caused by cirrhosis and hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer&#xD;
      have been identified. Urine metabolomics analysis may offer a new sensitive, yet inexpensive&#xD;
      screening tool for colorectal cancer.&#xD;

        Family practitoners will refer patients to Gastroenterologist physicians for consideration&#xD;
        into the SCOPE Pilot Research program. They will be evaluated for suitability initially by&#xD;
        gastroenterologists who will then refer them directly to the SCOPE Pilot research program&#xD;
        to further assess suitability. Those patients who meet the inclusion criteria with no&#xD;
        exclusion criteria present will be invited to an education session and invited to partake&#xD;
        in the research program if willing.&#xD;
