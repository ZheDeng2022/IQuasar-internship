  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases happen when the&#xD;
      immune system does not identify part of the body as belonging to it. The immune system then&#xD;
      destroys that part as if it were an unknown tissue in the body. In T1DM, the body kills the&#xD;
      cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin is the hormone that &quot;unlocks&quot; the cells&#xD;
      of the body. It allows glucose to enter and fuel them. Special cells in the body called&#xD;
      islets make the insulin. Since glucose cannot enter the cells, it builds up in the blood. The&#xD;
      body's cells literally starve to death. Children are at risk of developing T1DM and the risk&#xD;
      is much higher than other severe, chronic childhood diseases. The only treatments are a&#xD;
      careful diet, planned physical activity, and testing blood sugar levels several times a day.&#xD;
      The patient must also inject insulin each day or use an insulin pump. There is no cure for&#xD;
      T1DM. Insulin injections are considered life support, because going without insulin for just&#xD;
      a few days causes the blood to have too much acid in it and that can lead to death. On the&#xD;
      other hand, taking too much insulin makes blood sugar levels go too low, and if untreated,&#xD;
      can lead to death as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DiaKine is developing Lisofylline to treat the failed immune system. This is what caused T1DM&#xD;
      in the first place and it does not go away. The purpose of this study is to see how safe the&#xD;
      study drug is. The study is also going to compare the levels of study drug in the blood and&#xD;
      to measure the effect of the study drug on other substances in the blood that are linked to&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. These levels will be measured after the study drug is given as an injection&#xD;
      under the skin and an injection into the vein. To date, Lisofylline has been tested when&#xD;
      given as an injection in the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that Lisofylline will be safe when given as an injection under&#xD;
      the skin and in the vein and that levels of study drug will be very similar when given as an&#xD;
      injection under the skin and in the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also hypothesize that Lisofylline will have a positive effect on the&#xD;
      substances in the blood that are linked to type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      Compound: Lisofylline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Number and Title: DT-002: A Safety, Tolerability and Bioavailability Study of&#xD;
      Lisofylline After Continuous Subcutaneous (12 mg/kg) and Intravenous (12 mg/kg)&#xD;
      Administration in Healthy Subjects and in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trial Phase: Phase 1 / Phase 2A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Lisofylline (LSF) in healthy adult subjects and in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM) following a single dose of LSF 12 mg/kg administered as a continuous&#xD;
      subcutaneous (s.c.) infusion over 24 hours, versus a single dose of LSF 12 mg/kg administered&#xD;
      as a continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are (1) to determine the bioavailability of a single&#xD;
      dose of LSF 12 mg/kg administered as a continuous s.c. infusion over 24 hours compared to&#xD;
      that of a single dose of LSF 12 mg/kg administered as a continuous i.v. infusion over 24&#xD;
      hours; and (2) an exploratory evaluation of the early efficacy of LSF based upon evaluation&#xD;
      of pharmacodynamic (PD) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator and Study Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benno G. Roesch, MD Advanced Biomedical Research, Inc. Clinical Research Center 241 Main&#xD;
      Street Hackensack, New Jersey 07601 USA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects and Subject Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 8 male or female subjects (up to 4 healthy adult male or female subjects and up to 4&#xD;
      male or female subjects with type 1 DM) will be enrolled as two separate cohorts into the&#xD;
      study to ensure a total of at least 6 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male or female subjects between 18-45 years of age, inclusive, and male or female&#xD;
      subjects, 18-45 years of age, inclusive, with a clinical diagnosis of type 1 DM for a minimum&#xD;
      of 2 years, requiring treatment with insulin, and no other clinically significant&#xD;
      exclusionary disease or conditions, are eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-period, two-treatment,&#xD;
      crossover study in healthy subjects and in subjects with type 1 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the Clinic the evening prior to dosing (Day -1, Day 6)&#xD;
      during each treatment period, receive their assigned dose of study drug on Day 1 and Day 7,&#xD;
      and will remain confined to the Clinic until approximately 48 h following the start of study&#xD;
      drug administration (Day 3, Day 9). A washout period of three days will separate the two&#xD;
      treatment periods. All subjects will receive a single dose of LSF 12 mg/kg administered via&#xD;
      continuous i.v. infusion over a 24-hour period during one treatment period and a single dose&#xD;
      of LSF 12 mg/kg administered via continuous s.c. infusion over a 24-hour period during the&#xD;
      alternate treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects and subjects with type 1 DM will comprise two separate cohorts. All subjects&#xD;
      will be assigned a treatment sequence according to a randomization schedule that will balance&#xD;
      sequence assignments within the two cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: The overall duration of the study for each subject is approximately 30 days.&#xD;
      This includes a 21-day screening period, two active treatment periods of three days each&#xD;
      separated by a 3-day washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug: The drug product, LSF for injection, will be supplied by the Sponsor or designee&#xD;
      as a 120 mg/mL sterile solution (600 mg LSF/5 mL) in USP type 1 molded clear glass vials.&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a single dose of LSF 12 mg/kg as a continuous s.c. infusion over 24&#xD;
      hours during one period, and a single dose of LSF 12 mg/kg as a continuous i.v. infusion over&#xD;
      24 hours during the alternate period in a randomized fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups: There will be two treatment groups: LSF 12 mg/kg as a continuous s.c.&#xD;
      infusion over 24 hours and LSF 12 mg/kg as a continuous i.v. infusion over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: After providing written informed consent, subjects will undergo a complete&#xD;
      medical history, medication history, physical examination, vital signs evaluation, resting 12&#xD;
      lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests [chemistry, hematology, urinalysis,&#xD;
      HIV, Hepatitis B &amp; C diagnostic profile and urine drug, alcohol and pregnancy (females only)&#xD;
      screen,] within 21 days prior to receiving the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 7, eligible subjects will receive a single dose of LSF 12 mg/kg administered&#xD;
      via continuous i.v. infusion over a 24-hour period during one treatment period and a single&#xD;
      dose of LSF 12 mg/kg administered via continuous s.c. infusion over a 24-hour period during&#xD;
      the alternate treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seated blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured on Days 1-3 and 7-9 within 15 min prior&#xD;
      to the start of infusion and 1, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h following the start of infusion. A&#xD;
      resting 12-lead ECG will be performed on Days 1-2 and Days 7-8 at 1, 8 and 24 h following the&#xD;
      start of infusion, and prior to discharge from the Clinic on Day 9. An abbreviated physical&#xD;
      examination will be performed on Day 3, prior to discharge from the Clinic and a complete&#xD;
      physical examination will be performed on Day 9, prior to discharge from the study. Adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) will be monitored by nursing and medical observations and spontaneous reporting&#xD;
      throughout the study. In addition, skin irritation assessments will be performed on Days 1-2&#xD;
      and Days 7-8 within 15 min prior to the start of infusion and 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h following&#xD;
      the start of infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected for determination of plasma LSF concentration on Days 1-2 and Days&#xD;
      7-8 within 0.5 h prior to the start of infusion (time 0) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6,&#xD;
      8, 10, 12, 18 and 24 h following the start of infusion. On Day 2 and Day 8, blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected 5, 10, 15 and 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 h following&#xD;
      completion of the 24-h infusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected for evaluation of cytokine, chemokine, insulin and free fatty acid&#xD;
      (FFA) serum levels, and for evaluation of STAT4 phosphorylation status of monocytes, on Days&#xD;
      1-2 and Days 7-8 within 0.5 h prior to the start of infusion (time 0) and 24 h following the&#xD;
      start of infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints Plasma LSF concentrations and PK assessments: Blood will be collected for&#xD;
      determination of plasma LSF concentration at time points noted previously. PK parameters will&#xD;
      include AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, kel, CL, Vdss and F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD assessments: Blood will be collected for determination of serum cytokine, chemokine,&#xD;
      insulin and FFA levels at time points noted previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcome measures: Safety will be based on AEs, vital signs assessments, resting&#xD;
      12-lead ECG evaluations, physical examination findings and clinical laboratory test results.&#xD;
