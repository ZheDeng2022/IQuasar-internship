      Background. Patients with chronic low back pain display hyperexcitability of the central&#xD;
      nervous system (central hypersensitivity). Such hypersensitivity may occur in the acute phase&#xD;
      and represent a risk factor for the development of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To determine the prognostic value of central hypersensitivity for the development&#xD;
      of chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting. Primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients. 140 individuals with acute low back pain and no history of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. Primary prognostic variable will be the pain tolerance threshold at the second toe&#xD;
      (the pressure intensity at which a further increase in pressure is deemed intolerable).&#xD;
      Exploratory secondary prognostic variables are measures of mechanisms related to central&#xD;
      hypersensitivity: stimulus-specific hypersensitivity (pressure, electrical, heat and cold&#xD;
      stimulation); tissue-specific hypersensitivity (skin vs. muscle stimulation); localized vs.&#xD;
      widespread hypersensitivity; spinal cord modulation (electrophysiological measures of&#xD;
      hypersensitivity and changes in receptive fields); modulation at brain level (descending&#xD;
      modulation of nociceptive input and cortical plasticity). Clinical primary outcome will be&#xD;
      the occurrence of chronic low back pain at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main analysis. The investigators will use least square logistic regression models to&#xD;
      determine the association of central hypersensitivity with prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance. An understanding of the prognostic value of central hypersensitivity may allow an&#xD;
      early stratification for treatment of individuals at risk of developing chronic low back&#xD;
      pain. Subgroups of patients may be selected for clinical trials on novel pharmacological&#xD;
      approaches for the prevention and treatment of central hypersensitivity.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged afferent nociceptive input induces an increase in the excitability of central&#xD;
      sensory neurons and plasticity changes that cause hyperexcitability of the central nervous&#xD;
      system (central hypersensitivity. The hyperexcitable central nervous system amplifies the&#xD;
      nociceptive signal, thereby producing an exaggerated pain response even in the presence of&#xD;
      limited tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using quantitative sensory tests, central hypersensitivity has been detected in different&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Patients with chronic low back pain display increased&#xD;
      pain sensitivity and enlargement of the areas of referred pain after stimulation of tissues&#xD;
      around and distant from the site of pain (i.e. the leg or the thumb), suggesting that&#xD;
      widespread central hypersensitivity is associated with this condition. Functional&#xD;
      reorganization of the cortex has been detected in different pain conditions, including low&#xD;
      back pain. Using equal levels of sensory stimulation in patients and pain-free controls,&#xD;
      patients with chronic low back pain showed more extensive patterns of neuronal activation in&#xD;
      pain-related cortical areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An investigation on patients after a whiplash injury found that those patients with&#xD;
      persistent moderate or severe symptoms at 6 months had displayed, soon after injury,&#xD;
      widespread hypersensitivity. Therefore, central hypersensitivity may be an indicator of poor&#xD;
      prognosis. An acute peripheral lesion may induce plasticity changes leading to central&#xD;
      hypersensitivity in a subset of individuals. Such a hypersensitivity would facilitate the&#xD;
      transition from acute to chronic pain and disability. This hypothesis has been investigated&#xD;
      using a limited number of tests only in a limited number of individuals with whiplash injury,&#xD;
      but not in any other condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the prognostic value of different measures of mechanisms of central&#xD;
      hypersensitivity in patients with acute low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      140 consecutive Patients with acute low back pain, referred by general practice, will be&#xD;
      studied prospectively. Primary prognostic variable will be the pain tolerance threshold at&#xD;
      the second toe (the pressure intensity at which a further increase in pressure is deemed&#xD;
      intolerable). Exploratory secondary prognostic variables are measures of mechanisms related&#xD;
      to central hypersensitivity: stimulus-specific hypersensitivity (pressure, electrical, heat&#xD;
      and cold stimulation); tissue-specific hypersensitivity (skin vs. muscle stimulation);&#xD;
      localized vs. widespread hypersensitivity; spinal cord modulation (electrophysiological&#xD;
      measures of hypersensitivity and changes in receptive fields); modulation at brain level&#xD;
      (descending modulation of nociceptive input and cortical plasticity). Clinical primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the occurrence of chronic low back pain at follow-up. The investigators will&#xD;
      use least square logistic regression models to determine the association of central&#xD;
      hypersensitivity with prognosis.&#xD;
