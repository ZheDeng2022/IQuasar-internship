      RATIONALE: Exercise may change the risk of developing breast cancer. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether low-intensity exercise or high-intensity exercise is more effective in lowering the&#xD;
      risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well exercise programs work in&#xD;
      healthy young women at increased risk of developing breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct a dose response study of low- or high-dose exercise over 5 menstrual cycles,&#xD;
           with no concomitant dietary changes producing a caloric deficit, in healthy younger&#xD;
           women with ≥ 18% lifetime risk for developing breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of this exercise regimen on variables known to be associated&#xD;
           with breast mitotic activity in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in other physiologic parameters associated with breast mitotic&#xD;
           activity (i.e., urinary progesterone [pregnanediol-glucuronide, PdG] from daily first&#xD;
           morning urine samples; follicular phase circulating [serum] levels of estradiol,&#xD;
           progesterone, testosterone, and prolactin; follicular phase breast density&#xD;
           [fibroglandular tissue volume] from magnetic resonance imaging; estrogen metabolites&#xD;
           [estrone, estradiol, estriol, 2-OHE_1, 2-OHE_2, 4-OHE_1, 4-OHE_2, 16-OHE_1 and ratios];&#xD;
           adipokines [i.e., adiponectin and Leptin]; and body composition [i.e., % body fat, lean&#xD;
           mass, fat mass, total mass]) in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the extent to which changes in body composition and/or body mass mediate&#xD;
           observed changes in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the relationship between estrogen and progesterone from daily urinary&#xD;
           measurements with observed menstrual cycle alterations such as follicular and luteal&#xD;
           phase length changes, and ovulatory status in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare levels and exercise-induced changes in urinary estrogens, estrogen&#xD;
           metabolites, circulating hormones, adipokines, and body size across two groups of women&#xD;
           who differ as to breast cancer risk in an exploratory manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to body mass index (21-29.9 vs 30-50) and&#xD;
      gynecologic age (&lt; 10 vs ≥ 10 years since start of menstruation). Participants are randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 3 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (control): Participants are placed on a waiting list to receive the exercise&#xD;
           intervention at completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Participants undergo a low-intensity exercise program comprising 150 minutes of&#xD;
           exercise per week for 20 weeks. They are given a treadmill at the beginning of the study&#xD;
           and offered ongoing support from a certified exercise professional. Participants may&#xD;
           exercise at home on the provided treadmill or at a gym of their choosing. Participants&#xD;
           must maintain weekly contact with the exercise professional for the duration of the&#xD;
           study, either by phone for brief phone counseling or at a weekly group exercise session&#xD;
           at a participating YMCA. The exercise professional visits the participant's home for the&#xD;
           first exercise session of each of the first 5 weeks to help individualize the intensity&#xD;
           and duration of the exercise session and to instruct participants on the use of the&#xD;
           exercise logs and on injury prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise intensity is measured by a Polar Heart Rate monitor worn by the participant to&#xD;
      record heart rate response during exercise. Every two weeks, the exercise professional&#xD;
      reviews downloadable heart-rate data from the monitor during the home or group exercise&#xD;
      session, to objectively measure exercise adherence and provide guidance and emotional support&#xD;
      to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III: Participants undergo a high-intensity exercise program that begins with 150&#xD;
           minutes of exercise per week and then gradually builds to 300 minutes per week over 10&#xD;
           weeks. Participants continue to exercise at the higher level until the end of the&#xD;
           20-week intervention period. Participants also undergo exercise and heart rate&#xD;
           monitoring and brief phone counseling as in arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples are obtained from participants periodically before and/or during&#xD;
      study to evaluate factors associated with breast mitotic activity and linked to breast cancer&#xD;
      risk: urinary conjugates (i.e., E1G and PdG) by enzyme immunoassays; urinary estrogen&#xD;
      metabolites by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; circulating hormones (i.e., estradiol,&#xD;
      progesterone, testosterone, and prolactin) by radioimmunoassay; and adipokines (i.e.,&#xD;
      adiponectin and leptin) by sandwich ELISA. Participants also undergo physical assessments,&#xD;
      including periodic measures of body composition by DEXA, follicular phase breast density&#xD;
      (fibroglandular tissue volume) by MRI, and height and weight. Aerobic fitness and physical&#xD;
      activity levels are also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete surveys and questionnaires periodically during study to obtain&#xD;
      information on demographics, health history, medication use, eating disorders, dietary&#xD;
      intake, and menstrual history.&#xD;
