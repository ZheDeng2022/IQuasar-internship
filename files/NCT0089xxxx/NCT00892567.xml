    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate T cell responses against a peptide-based vaccine in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer and to determine whether peptide-specific T cells can be found at&#xD;
      the site of breast tumors following vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Just under 200,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. Standard&#xD;
      breast cancer therapies have long included surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, and hormonal therapy. However, other immune therapies are now being explored for the&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer, including peptide-based vaccines. In support of directed T cell&#xD;
      therapies for breast cancer, antigenic epitopes from breast cancer-associated proteins such&#xD;
      as Her-2/neu and the MAGE gene family have been identified, and vaccines containing peptides&#xD;
      derived from these proteins have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from successful immune therapy approaches, for various human and murine cancers, have&#xD;
      shown that antitumor effects can be mediated by T cells, which is proof-of-principle that the&#xD;
      immune system, and in particular, T cells, can reject tumor. Overall, however, the complete&#xD;
      clinical response rate for T cell mediated immunotherapies has been low. There are at least&#xD;
      two possibilities to explain why this may be the case. First, tumor reactive T cells may not&#xD;
      traffic to tumors. Second, tumor reactive T cells may not have adequate effector function&#xD;
      within the tumor microenvironment. Neither of these hypotheses has been adequately explored,&#xD;
      though there are data suggesting that either or both may represent obstacles to successful&#xD;
      immune therapy. In order to improve upon the clinical response rate with vaccines, we need to&#xD;
      address the questions of whether vaccine-induced T cells traffic to tumor and exhibit&#xD;
      effector function within the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically for breast cancer, there are opportunities for targeting T cells against primary&#xD;
      tumors with the intent of providing immune protection early in the disease course. In the&#xD;
      proposed clinical trial we will be administering a peptide-based vaccine and monitoring&#xD;
      responses to the vaccine at the site of primary tumor. Peptide vaccines are unique in that&#xD;
      they provide an opportunity to monitor directly the T cell response to defined antigens,&#xD;
      enabling dissection of the immune response pre- and post-vaccination. The proposed analyses&#xD;
      are designed to test the hypotheses that vaccination 1) enhances T cell infiltration into&#xD;
      tumor and 2) induces T cells to become activated and fully differentiate into effector cells.&#xD;
      The goals of this proposal are to define the extent to which these two processes occur&#xD;
      following vaccination and to identify opportunities for improving tumor targeting and T cell&#xD;
      effector function in human breast cancer.&#xD;
