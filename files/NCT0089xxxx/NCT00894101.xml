      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical value of serial quantitative [F-18]&#xD;
      FLT as a PET imaging tool in head and neck cancer patients clinically scheduled with&#xD;
      radiation or radiation-chemotherapy combination in terms of safety and efficacy. Standard&#xD;
      [F-18] FDG PET will be the active comparator.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient provides written Informed Consent and is willing to comply with protocol&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is at least 18 years of age on the day of dosing (male or female of any race&#xD;
             or ethnicity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is capable of lying still in the PET scanner for the protocol required time&#xD;
             frame(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has a diagnosis of one of the following malignancies (TNM Staging System):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lung cancer (T3 grade up, node positive, but no metastatic disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Head and neck cancer (T3 grade up, node positive, but no metastatic disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has undergone a comparative, diagnostic procedure with lesion(s) visible,&#xD;
             other than ultrasound, that includes, but is not limited to computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine imaging, endoscopy, laparoscopy,&#xD;
             standard abdominal x-ray, biopsy and/or surgery for one of the above mentioned areas&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is scheduled to start radiotherapy or a chemoradiotherapy regimen for curative&#xD;
             intent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. As a part of his/her standard radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy regimen, patient is&#xD;
             scheduled to have clinical [F-18] FDG PET scans pre treatment and post treatment (at&#xD;
             about 4 weeks (±1 week) after the start of therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient is scheduled to have the investigational, pre treatment [F-18] FLT PET scan&#xD;
             recommended to be within ± 2 days of the clinical, pre treatment [F-18] FDG PET scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has not received or intends to receive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU-chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             agent)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has a score of greater than or equal to (≥) 60% on the Karnofsky Performance&#xD;
             Status Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclude a patient from this study if the patient does not fulfill the inclusion criteria,&#xD;
        or if any of the following conditions are observed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is a pregnant or lactating female. These methods will be used to exclude the&#xD;
             possibility of pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  by testing on site at the institution (serum or urine βHCG) within 48 hours prior&#xD;
                  to the start of each investigational product administration,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  by surgical history (eg, tubal ligation or hysterectomy),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  by patient's history of being post menopausal with a minimum 1 year without&#xD;
                  menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is undergoing treatment with palliative intent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has received an investigational compound and/or medical device within 14 days&#xD;
             before admission into this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has any medical condition or other circumstances which would significantly&#xD;
             decrease the chances of obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives, or&#xD;
             completing the study and/or post-dose follow-up examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is determined by the Investigator that he/she is clinically unsuitable for the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
