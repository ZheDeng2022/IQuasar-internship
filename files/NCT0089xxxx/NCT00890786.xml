  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome for children with high-grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas&#xD;
      remains poor despite the use of multi-modal therapy with surgery, radiation therapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Novel therapies are needed to improve the outcome of these children. Recent studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated very promising results of treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent high grade gliomas. Based on these promising results, and the tolerability of the&#xD;
      irinotecan and bevacizumab in children with recurrent CNS malignancies both anecdotally and&#xD;
      in a study conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, we have designed a novel study&#xD;
      incorporating concurrent radiation therapy with bevacizumab ± temozolomide followed by&#xD;
      bevacizumab, irinotecan ±temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas and&#xD;
      diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.&#xD;
