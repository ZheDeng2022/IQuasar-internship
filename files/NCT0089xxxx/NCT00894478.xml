  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focal cortical dysplasia is one of the most common lesions responsible for medically&#xD;
      refractory epilepsy in the pediatric population. In patients with medically intractable&#xD;
      epilepsy, surgery is the only treatment that will lead to seizure freedom. The outcome of&#xD;
      epilepsy surgery is worse in patients when there is no lesion identified on routine&#xD;
      structural MRI, also known as MRI-negative partial epilepsy. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),&#xD;
      a novel MRI technique, can be used to evaluate the integrity of the microstructure of the&#xD;
      white matter, even when the white matter appears normal on routine MRI.&#xD;

      The aims of this study are firstly to identify DTI abnormalities in the white matter of&#xD;
      children with MRI-negative partial epilepsy and MRI-visible FCD compared to normal controls;&#xD;
      and secondly to determine if the location of DTI identified abnormalities correlate with the&#xD;
      epileptogenic zone as defined using magnetoencephalography (MEG) dipole clusters. Our&#xD;
      hypotheses are firstly DTI can demonstrate the anatomic delineation of white matter&#xD;
      abnormalities in MRI-negative partial epilepsy and the alteration in DTI indices are similar&#xD;
      in MRI-negative partial epilepsy and MRI-visible FCD, which is the positive control; and&#xD;
      secondly the anatomical location of DTI identified abnormalities correlate with the&#xD;
      epileptogenic zone as defined by MEG dipole clusters. The long-term goal of this study is to&#xD;
      improve detection of subtle lesions in children with MRI-negative partial epilepsy so as to&#xD;
      improve the surgical outcome of these patients who undergo epilepsy surgery for seizure&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

    <description>MR and DTI: MRI and DTI will be done using 3.0T Philips MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using an eight channel head coil. DTI and axial 3D T1 will be performed on patients and controls.&#xD;
DTI will be performed using single shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging, b=1000s/mm2 and 15 noncollinear directions (TR/TE=10,000/60 ms, slice thickness=2mm, field of view=22cm, matrix=112x112, NEX=2)&#xD;
Axial 3D T1 (TR/TE=4.9/2.3 ms, slice thickness=1 mm, field of view = 24 cm, matrix=220x220, NEX=1) Patients will have additional sequences (axial and coronal T2, proton density and FLAIR) as part of their clinical scan</description>

        for Sick Children.&#xD;
&#xD;
