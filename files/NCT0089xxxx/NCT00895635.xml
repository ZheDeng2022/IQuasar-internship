  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a disorder that affects more than 8 million people in&#xD;
      the United States. As a result of decreased blood flow to the legs, people with PAD may&#xD;
      experience leg pain and difficulty with walking. This study will examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      two exercise programs-a treadmill walking program and an aerobic arm exercise program-at&#xD;
      increasing walking distance and decreasing leg pain in people with PAD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAD is a condition that occurs when atherosclerotic plaque builds up in the peripheral&#xD;
      arteries and restricts blood flow. People with PAD often experience reduced blood flow to the&#xD;
      legs, which may cause painful leg cramping while walking, known as intermittent claudication.&#xD;
      Claudication affects over 4 million people in the United States, and many people with this&#xD;
      condition can walk only Â½ to 2 blocks before leg pain begins to occur. Regular treadmill&#xD;
      walking has been shown to be effective at increasing walking distance and reducing&#xD;
      claudication in people with PAD. However, walking on a treadmill may prove difficult for some&#xD;
      people with PAD and usually causes increased leg pain, both of which may reduce exercise&#xD;
      frequency. Aerobic arm exercises do not cause leg pain and may be an effective way for people&#xD;
      with PAD to improve overall cardiovascular fitness and increase the amount of exercise they&#xD;
      do. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a treadmill exercise program&#xD;
      and an aerobic arm exercise program at reducing symptoms of claudication and improving&#xD;
      walking ability in people with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people with PAD and claudication. At a baseline study visit,&#xD;
      participants will complete a treadmill walking test; a blood collection; and questionnaires&#xD;
      to assess walking status, daily activity levels, quality of life, and mood. One week after&#xD;
      the baseline visit, participants will attend a study visit for an assessment of forearm and&#xD;
      leg muscle blood flow and a hand-bike test that will measure upper body strength using an arm&#xD;
      cycle ergometer. The ergometer is a device with bicycle pedals that people move using their&#xD;
      arms. Participants will then be randomly assigned to either a treadmill exercise training&#xD;
      program, an arm ergometry exercise program, or a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the treadmill exercise training program will attend a supervised program at&#xD;
      one of four study sites and exercise on a treadmill for 1 hour three times a week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Participants in the arm ergometry exercise program will attend a supervised program at&#xD;
      one of four study sites and exercise using an arm cycle ergometer (hand-bike) for 1 hour&#xD;
      three times a week for 12 weeks. Participants in both groups will also receive written&#xD;
      instructions about exercising on their own. Participants in the control group will continue&#xD;
      to receive usual care from their regular doctor for the treatment of PAD and will be provided&#xD;
      with written exercise instructions. Once a week for 12 weeks, participants in the control&#xD;
      group will attend study visits to discuss any health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to monitor their daily exercise for 3 separate weeks during&#xD;
      the 12-week period by wearing an accelerometer, which will measure and record physical&#xD;
      activity. They will also record their exercise habits in a written diary. All participants&#xD;
      will attend study visits on 2 separate days at Weeks 6 and 12 for repeat baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Weeks 12 to 24, all participants will be encouraged to continue to exercise on their own&#xD;
      at least three times a week for 30 minutes. Every 4 weeks, study researchers will call&#xD;
      participants to offer encouragement and answer questions. At Week 23, participants will again&#xD;
      wear an accelerometer and keep an exercise diary for 1 week. All participants will attend a&#xD;
      final study visit at Week 24 for repeat baseline testing.&#xD;
