      RATIONALE: Screening may help doctors find colorectal cancer sooner, when it may be easier to&#xD;
      treat. Finding out what affects a patient's decision to undergo screening tests may help&#xD;
      increase the number of patients who undergo regular screening for cancer. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether personalized invitations to undergo colorectal cancer screening are more effective&#xD;
      than standard screening reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying ways to increase colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening in African Americans.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the intervention impact on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening utilization over&#xD;
           a 6-month observation period in African-American participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the intervention impact on CRC screening preference, classified into three&#xD;
           levels (i.e., &quot;decided not to screen or never heard of,&quot; &quot;undecided,&quot; or &quot;decided to&#xD;
           screen&quot;), based on data obtained from both the endpoint chart audit and the endpoint&#xD;
           survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess intervention impact on population health-management representations related to&#xD;
           CRC screening, as assessed by perceived salience and coherence and self-efficacy related&#xD;
           to CRC screening measured with 6 to 10 Likert-type items on both the baseline and&#xD;
           endpoint surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze intervention cost-effectiveness, from the societal perspective and from the&#xD;
           more limited perspective of the provider and payer, focusing on the average and&#xD;
           incremental cost per additional person who is compliant (i.e., has a CRC screening test&#xD;
           during the observation period) for each alternative intervention and estimate the cost&#xD;
           per life-year saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to practice.&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (standard-intervention group): Participants receive a personalized screening&#xD;
           invitation letter encouraging selection and performance of one of the screening tests, a&#xD;
           generic colorectal cancer (CRC) screening informational booklet, stool blood testing&#xD;
           (SBT) cards, and instructions for arranging a colonoscopy screening appointment. After&#xD;
           45 days, participants who have not been screened receive a reminder letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (tailored-navigation intervention group): Participants receive a CRC screening&#xD;
           invitation letter and materials that are tailored to the individual's preferred&#xD;
           screening test strategy (i.e., SBT; SBT and instructions for arranging flexible&#xD;
           sigmoidoscopy, instructions for arranging flexible sigmoidoscopy; or instructions for&#xD;
           arranging colonoscopy). After 30 days, participants who have not been screened will&#xD;
           receive a reminder by telephone. Those participants who have undergone screening will be&#xD;
           congratulated for taking the time and preventative action, and be encouraged to continue&#xD;
           future screenings. After 45 days, participants who have not been screened receive a&#xD;
           reminder letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assessed by a baseline survey consisting of personal background, cognitive&#xD;
      and psychological representations, social support and influence, intention, and decision&#xD;
      stage related to screening SBT and colonoscopy preference. Data obtained from the endpoint&#xD;
      survey assessing whether participants and their providers discussed CRC screening before the&#xD;
      study and opinions about the intervention, and an endpoint chart audit to gather data on&#xD;
      participant CRC screening exam dates and exam results (i.e., screening SBT, flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, double-contrast barium enema [DCBE] x-ray) are assessed for group&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
