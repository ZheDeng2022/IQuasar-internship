  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers that have spread to the liver from the primary cancer location (liver metastases)&#xD;
      that cannot be removed surgically (unresectable) can be treated with chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Previous research has shown that tumours often have abnormal blood vessels&#xD;
      that may reduce the effect of radiation therapy. New drugs, known as &quot;anti-angiogenic&quot; drugs&#xD;
      have been shown in animal and human studies to damage or change tumour blood vessels in ways&#xD;
      that may make tumors more sensitive to radiation treatment. 32- 44 Patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      unresectable liver metastasis will be invited to take part in this study. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the use of a new anti-angiogenic drug called Sorafenib, in&#xD;
      combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The study will test how effective the new&#xD;
      treatment is, the side effects associated with the new treatment, and to help establish safe&#xD;
      dosages of the study medication.&#xD;

      In this study, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy(SBRT) and Whole Liver Radiotherapy (WLRT)&#xD;
      will be used concurrently with sorafenib at 3 different dosages to determine the tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of this combined treatment. Sorafenib doses will be 200mg twice daily orally for&#xD;
      28 days in level I, 400 mg in the morning and 200mg in the evening in level II, and 400mg&#xD;
      twice daily orally for 28 days in level III . Radiotherapy will be started at day 8, patients&#xD;
      will receive a total of 6 fractions over 2 weeks. Patients will be assessed weekly during&#xD;
      treatment, 1 month post-tx, then at 3-month intervals for up to a year after tx, and then&#xD;
      followed-up at 6-month intervals up to 3 years. Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      established, an expanded cohort for each stratum will accrue such that a total of 10 patients&#xD;
      per strata. This will allow us to gain further experience with this regimen and consolidate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy data. Quality of Life (QOL) assessment will be carried out at&#xD;
      baseline and 1/3/6/9 mos post-tx. Patients will also be offered correlative studies looking&#xD;
      at biomarkers through tissue, blood, and urine samples, and an imaging study looking at&#xD;
      tissue perfusion.&#xD;
