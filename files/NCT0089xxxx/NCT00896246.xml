  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 1, open-label, randomized study, designed to assess the impact of Moviprep®&#xD;
      or Klean-Prep® on gastrointestinal transit. It was performed in two parallel groups with Part&#xD;
      A in two groups of four subjects preceding Part B, which was performed in two groups of 12&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects attended a pre-study medical within 28 days of dosing and a post-study&#xD;
      medical 5-10 days after the final dose. Within both Part A and Part B, subjects were required&#xD;
      to attend the clinical unit for 2 study periods. Part A consisted of a baseline period to&#xD;
      determine individual reference times for gastrointestinal transit. Part B was the test period&#xD;
      in which gastrointestinal transit following the administration of the test preparations was&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
