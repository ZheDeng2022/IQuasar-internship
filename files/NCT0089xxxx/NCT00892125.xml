  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the effects of a potent metabolic enzyme inducer,&#xD;
      carbamazepine, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of orally administered paliperidone ER&#xD;
      and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatments in clinically stable patients&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.&#xD;

      The current study is designed as an open-label, multiple-center, multiple-dose, 2 treatment,&#xD;
      2 period sequential drug interaction study. It consists of 3 phases: a screening phase&#xD;
      beginning within 21 days before the first study drug administration; an open label treatment&#xD;
      phase consisting of 2 treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2), during which patients will&#xD;
      receive multiple oral doses of 6-mg paliperidone ER alone or in combination with multiple&#xD;
      oral doses of carbamazepine, and end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study&#xD;
      procedures in Period 2 or at early withdrawal. There is no washout period between treatment&#xD;
      periods. Given the potential concomitant use of carbamazepine with antipsychotics, such as&#xD;
      paliperidone ER, in the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, this study is&#xD;
      designed to investigate the effect of carbamazepine on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      paliperidone ER. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.. Period 1: 6&#xD;
      mg paliperidone ER once daily from Day 1 through Day 7, route oral; Period 2: 6 mg&#xD;
      paliperidone ER once daily and carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily from Day 8 through Day 28,&#xD;
      route oral.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of schizophrenia of any subtype (295.10&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  295.20&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  295.30&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  295.60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  295.90) or bipolar I disorder (296.0x, 296.4x, 296.5x, 296.6x or 296.7), according to&#xD;
             the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically stable with no psychiatric hospitalization or change in existing mood&#xD;
             stabilizers, antipsychotic, or anti-manic drugs for 3 months before screening. A&#xD;
             reduction in the dose of existing medication is acceptable if the subject remained&#xD;
             clinically stable throughout the 3 month period. In addition, an increase or decrease&#xD;
             in the dose of a mood stabilizer on the basis of therapeutic drug monitoring or the&#xD;
             substitution of a specific mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, or anti-manic drug for&#xD;
             another because of poor tolerability will be allowed within 3 months before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CGI-S score of 3 or less at baseline and at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI, weight [kg]/height [m2]) of 18 to 35 kg/m2, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between 100 and 140 mmHg systolic,&#xD;
             inclusive, and 50 and 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Apart from the above-mentioned diagnosis, otherwise healthy on the basis of a prestudy&#xD;
             physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG, and the laboratory results of&#xD;
             serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed within 21 days before the first&#xD;
             dose. For renal function tests, the values must be within the normal laboratory&#xD;
             reference ranges&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be postmenopausal for at least 2 years, surgically sterile, abstinent, or&#xD;
             practicing or agree to practice an effective method of birth control if they are&#xD;
             sexually active before entry and throughout the study (effective methods of birth&#xD;
             control include intrauterine devices, double-barrier method, and male partner&#xD;
             sterilization). Prescription hormonal contraceptives must be used in combination with&#xD;
             another method of birth control (e.g., double-barrier method) throughout the study.&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at&#xD;
