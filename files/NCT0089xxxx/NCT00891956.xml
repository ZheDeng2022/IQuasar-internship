      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rett syndrome (RS) is a panethnic (affecting all ethnicities) neurodevelopmental&#xD;
           (impairment of the growth and development of the brain) disorder affecting primarily&#xD;
           females. RS is characterized by the loss of intellectual functioning, fine and gross&#xD;
           motor skills, and communicative abilities after a period of seemingly normal&#xD;
           development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregivers of individuals with RS face many psychosocial challenges. The stressors can&#xD;
           be grouped into the following six categories: emotional difficulties, health-related&#xD;
           stressors, uncertainty about their daughter s illness, rejection by their social&#xD;
           environment, lack of available or competent experts, and unfavorable comparison with&#xD;
           healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are making a significant contribution to the adaptation literature with a&#xD;
           focus on family functioning and to the little psychosocial research that exists on&#xD;
           families with RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers hope to narrow down the most important areas on which to focus for&#xD;
           intervention strategies in families with RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe family functioning, perceived illness burden, self-efficacy, types of coping&#xD;
           methods, and adaptation in caregivers of individuals with RS to examine the&#xD;
           relationships between these variables and the outcomes of family functioning and&#xD;
           adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the extent to which appraisals of being a caregiver of an individual with RS&#xD;
           and methods of coping are associated with family functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the extent to which appraisals of being a caregiver of an individual with RS,&#xD;
           methods of coping, and family functioning are associated with caregiver adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Eligibility is based on answering yes to the following three questions: Are you 18 years&#xD;
      old or older? Are you the caregiver of a child diagnosed with Rett Syndrome? and Does the&#xD;
      child with Rett Syndrome currently reside in your home with you?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in this cross-sectional research design will answer a quantitative survey&#xD;
           that includes some open-ended questions. The cross-sectional study involves a one-time&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaire that takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The survey will be available in paper and electronic versions and includes demographics&#xD;
           questions, measures of perceived illness burden, parental self-efficacy, coping methods,&#xD;
           family functioning, and adaptation. Participants also will answer open-ended questions&#xD;
           related to the individual s diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may withdraw from the study at any point up until submission of the survey&#xD;
           and may skip any question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who experience psychological distress as a result of taking the survey are&#xD;
           advised to contact the researcher. Study coordinators at the various clinics from which&#xD;
           participants will be recruited will be notified of the possibility of adverse events and&#xD;
           instructed to direct any members who experience distress to the appropriate professional&#xD;
           services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a small financial compensation for completing the survey.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the predictors of family functioning and adaptation in&#xD;
      caregivers of individuals with Rett Syndrome (RS), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting&#xD;
      primarily females. After an apparently normal prenatal and postnatal period of development,&#xD;
      individuals with RS lose intellectual functioning, fine and gross motor skills including&#xD;
      purposeful hand use, and communicative abilities. Individuals with RS also experience a host&#xD;
      of other medical problems including seizures and respiratory dysfunction. Prior research&#xD;
      demonstrates that caregivers of individuals with RS experience more stress than normative&#xD;
      samples and that family functioning plays a role in maternal mental health. However, there is&#xD;
      much that is not understood about how cognitive appraisals (thoughts that assess the&#xD;
      circumstances), coping methods, and family functioning are related to caregiver adaptation in&#xD;
      this population. This study is based on Thompson and colleagues Transactional Stress and&#xD;
      Coping Model which conceptualizes family functioning and adaptation to being a caregiver of&#xD;
      an individual with RS. A cross-sectional research design using quantitative methodology will&#xD;
      explore the relationships between perceived illness burden, self-efficacy, coping methods,&#xD;
      family functioning and adaptation. In addition, an open-ended section will be included to&#xD;
      qualitatively describe the role of family relationships on the caregivers perception of their&#xD;
      ability to care for their child with RS. Caregivers of individuals with RS will be recruited&#xD;
      through an international RS organization, a national RS educational meeting, and several&#xD;
      national RS clinics. Eligible participants will be able to complete a paper or online version&#xD;
      of the survey.&#xD;
