  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza, a highly communicable acute respiratory disease, is one of the major infectious&#xD;
      disease threats to the human population. In Africa, information on the occurrence of&#xD;
      influenza and its disease burden is seriously lacking. Such data would be important in&#xD;
      determining the contribution of influenza to the more than two million annual pneumonia&#xD;
      deaths among children globally, mostly in the developing world, and the potential number of&#xD;
      deaths that could be prevented by influenza vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) is 70 to 90 percent effective&#xD;
      in preventing influenza in healthy older children and young and middle-aged adults, but is&#xD;
      less efficacious in young children and the elderly. Young children who suffer substantial&#xD;
      influenza morbidity and are unlikely to have pre-existing immunity should receive two doses&#xD;
      of TIV to provide adequate immunity. Because family studies of influenza transmission&#xD;
      conducted during the 1970's found children to be the main introducers of influenza into&#xD;
      households, vaccination of children may decrease the chances of spreading influenza to&#xD;
      contacts. Mass vaccination of schoolchildren has been correlated with reduced respiratory&#xD;
      illness in unvaccinated persons suggesting that immunization of children on a larger scale&#xD;
      can affect community epidemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In temperate industrialized countries with seasonal disease, influenza vaccine is given&#xD;
      annually, prior to the influenza season, and generally targeted to individuals with the&#xD;
      highest risk of severe disease. Influenza prevention strategies may need to differ in&#xD;
      tropical developing countries due to a variety of reasons. Given the varying influenza&#xD;
      circulation patterns, it is unknown which hemisphere vaccine formulation will provide&#xD;
      year-round protection against the diverse strains that may exist in tropical countries.&#xD;
      Persons residing in developing countries also may have nutritional deficiencies or underlying&#xD;
      diseases and infections that affect vaccine immunogenicity. Consideration must be given to&#xD;
      programmatic issues as well. Adolescent and adult preventive health services are poorly&#xD;
      developed in many countries, and thus a strategy that targets children may be the most&#xD;
      feasible option. In addition, vaccinating children may be the most cost-effective option, as&#xD;
      it has the potential to provide direct benefit to those vaccinated, as well as indirect&#xD;
      benefits to unvaccinated members of the population. Thus, an influenza vaccine effectiveness&#xD;
      study in a tropical developing country population will help to elucidate burden of seasonal&#xD;
      influenza and may inform optimal use of vaccine for either seasonal and pandemic situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study in Senegal will to evaluate the direct effects of TIV in reducing the&#xD;
      occurrence of laboratory-confirmed influenza among children who receive it as well as the&#xD;
      potential indirect effects experienced by the population as a result of reducing transmission&#xD;
      among children.&#xD;

      The trial will take place in the study area of the Niakhar demographic surveillance system in&#xD;
      Senegal, a population representative of rural impoverished Africa. Villages will be&#xD;
      randomized to TIV or a beneficial control vaccine-inactivated polio vaccine-and children 6&#xD;
      months to 10 years of age will be targeted for vaccination. Four hundred children will be&#xD;
      further enrolled into an immunogenicity and safety substudy which will measure their immune&#xD;
      response to vaccination and assess in detail reactions and adverse events to the vaccines in&#xD;
      these populations. For evaluation of effectiveness, passive and active surveillance will be&#xD;
      conducted to identify laboratory-confirmed influenza among enrolled children and in the&#xD;
      population in which they live. Such surveillance will also allow a determination of the rates&#xD;
      of influenza and a description of the clinical characteristics of the disease in an African&#xD;
      population. With such epidemiologic data, national and global public health officials will&#xD;
      have better data for developing future influenza control strategies for either seasonal or&#xD;
      pandemic influenza.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male or female child at least 6 months of age and no older than 10 years of age (has&#xD;
             not yet reached 11 years of age) at the enrollment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A child whose parent or guardian's primary residence, at the time of study&#xD;
             vaccinations, is a village compound selected to receive TIV or IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's parent or legal guardian is willing to provide written informed consent&#xD;
             prior to the subject's first study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any component in either TIV (which&#xD;
             includes egg protein) or IPV. (Please see information on composition of vaccines.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity after previous administration of any influenza or polio vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute severe febrile illness. (Administration of TIV or IPV should be postponed until&#xD;
             after recovery. Minor illnesses, such as mild upper respiratory infection, with or&#xD;
             without low grade fever, are not reason for postponing vaccination. Acute severe&#xD;
             febrile illness is only a temporary exclusion.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to&#xD;
             the participant or interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.&#xD;
