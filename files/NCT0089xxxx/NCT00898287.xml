      The purpose of this study is to identify a dose of P276-00 that can be safely administered&#xD;
      along with Gemcitabine and to examine safety and efficacy of the combination in treatment of&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an open label multicenter trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of P276-00 in&#xD;
      combination with Gemcitabine in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. Primary objective in part A is to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of P276-00&#xD;
      in combination with Gemcitabine and in part B to evaluate efficacy of this combination in&#xD;
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. In part A, cohort of 3&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at starting dose level of P276-00 which is 100 mg/m2/ day to be&#xD;
      given intravenously (IV) from day 1 to day 5 every 21 days. This constitutes one cycle of&#xD;
      P276-00. If this dose is well tolerated then next cohort will be enrolled at higher dose&#xD;
      level of P276-00. P276-00 dose escalation will continue until MTD of P276-00 in combination&#xD;
      with Gemcitabine is determined. The subsequent dose levels of P276-00 will be 140 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      and 185 mg/m2/day. In part B ten subjects will be evaluated at the MTD of P276-00 in&#xD;
      combination with Gemcitabine to evaluate efficacy of the combination. Dose of Gemcitabine&#xD;
      will be same in both parts of the study which is 1000mg/m2 over 30mins every week for 7 weeks&#xD;
      followed by a gap of one week and then 3 weekly doses every 4 weeks. Subjects will be treated&#xD;
      for six cycles of P276-00 in combination with Gemcitabine or until evidence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety evaluations will be performed at regular&#xD;
      intervals by means of record of vital parameters, physical examination and laboratory&#xD;
      investigations for hematology and biochemistry. Efficacy assessment will be performed by&#xD;
      means of weekly record of pain intensity, analgesic consumption, change in weight and&#xD;
      performance status for evaluation of clinical benefit response and by means of CT scans at&#xD;
      the end of every 2 cycles for evaluation of tumor response by RECIST (Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors)&#xD;
