    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Tarceva&#xD;
      (erlotinib hydrochloride) that can safely be given in combination with Velcade (bortezomib).&#xD;
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride and bortezomib are both designed to block proteins that are thought&#xD;
      to cause cancer cells to grow. These drugs may help slow the growth of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of erlotinib hydrochloride and bortezomib based on when you join the study. Up to 4&#xD;
      dose levels of this study drug combination will be tested. There will be 3-6 participants&#xD;
      enrolled at each dose level of the study drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of erlotinib hydrochloride&#xD;
      (Group 1). If all of Group 1 tolerate that dose level, the next group (Group 2) will receive&#xD;
      a higher dose. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen (Groups 2-4). This will continue until the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found. However, if Group 1 did not tolerate&#xD;
      the first dose level, the next group will receive a lower dose (called Dose Level -1). If&#xD;
      that dose level is still intolerable, the third group will receive an even lower dose (called&#xD;
      Dose Level -2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of bortezomib will be based in which group you in. Groups 1 and 2 will receive the&#xD;
      same dose, Group 3 will receive a higher dose, and Group 4 will receive an even higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the highest tolerable dose is found, up to an additional 10 participants, called the&#xD;
      &quot;expansion group,&quot; will receive the study drug combination at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride will be taken by mouth 1 time every day for 21-days, called a study&#xD;
      &quot;cycle.&quot; You should take erlotinib hydrochloride on an empty stomach either 1 hour before&#xD;
      eating or 2 hours after eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which dose level you are assigned to, you will receive bortezomib by vein over&#xD;
      about 1-5 minutes on Days 1 and 8, or on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a single study visit just before each cycle. At these visits, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to list any drugs you may be taking, including over-the-counter drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD testing&#xD;
           is used to look at how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every 2 cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), you will have a CT or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken&#xD;
      off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs, you will have a follow-up visit. You will&#xD;
      be asked to return any unused study drug. At this visit, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to list any drugs you may be taking, including over-the-counter drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bortezomib and erlotinib hydrochloride are both FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available. Bortezomib is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. Erlotinib hydrochloride is FDA approved for the treatment of lung cancer and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. The use of these drugs together is investigational and authorized for use&#xD;
      in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 48 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
