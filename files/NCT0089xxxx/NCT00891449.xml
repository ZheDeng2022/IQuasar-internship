      Flight Analogs/Bed Rest Research Project (FA/BRRP) provides NASA with a ground-based research&#xD;
      platform to complement space research. By mimicking on Earth the conditions of weightlessness&#xD;
      experienced by the human body in space, NASA can test and refine scientific theories and&#xD;
      procedures to develop countermeasures to protect humans from the effects of the space travel.&#xD;
      The use of ground analogs, such as bed rest, are essential because access to the resources&#xD;
      required to conduct studies in space is very limited, and the expense of studies&#xD;
      significantly greater than those conducted using flight analogs. Future space exploration&#xD;
      will challenge NASA to answer many critical questions about how humans can live and work for&#xD;
      extended missions away from Earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flight analog testing is critical to NASA to validate countermeasures, given the few&#xD;
      opportunities to use flight platforms as the Shuttle retires; also, the US has only 1-2&#xD;
      International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers per Expedition. The Flight Analogs/Bed Rest&#xD;
      Research Project is one way NASA will devise ways to ensure astronaut safety and productivity&#xD;
      on extended missions to the moon and Mars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Flight Analogs Project (FAP), volunteers spend many days in a controlled research&#xD;
      environment in the Flight Analog Research Unit (FARU) in Galveston, TX. In the current&#xD;
      campaigns, volunteers will undergo three phases in the bedrest projects: 1) pre-bedrest&#xD;
      baseline testing, 2) a bedrest phase, and 3) the recovery period. Bed rest results in many&#xD;
      physiologic changes similar to those seen in astronauts. Pre bed rest is used to gather&#xD;
      baseline data against which the bed-rest phase data will be compared. Researchers then&#xD;
      monitor how the volunteers' bodies change over the course of the study and how quickly they&#xD;
      recover once they are allowed to resume normal activities. Post bed rest is used to monitor&#xD;
      recovery from bed rest. In longer campaigns, return to the unit for follow-up testing may be&#xD;
      requested after 1, 3, 6, and/or 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE COUNTERMEASURE AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING STUDY (CFT) will test the effectiveness of exercise&#xD;
      on loss of muscle, bone and cardiovascular function. Participants will perform an exercise&#xD;
      program in a system called the standalone Zero Gravity Locomotion Simulator (sZLS), a&#xD;
      &quot;vertical treadmill&quot; that removes the weight from the long axis of the body to simulate&#xD;
      exercise as it is done in space. Resistance (weight lifting) exercise will be performed on&#xD;
      special weight machines. Before and after 70 days of bedrest, participants will be tested on&#xD;
      a corresponding set of physiological measures. Specific exercises and intensities are rotated&#xD;
      such that each workout is different, with some days being heavier and some lighter. Results&#xD;
      of the study will help understand which mission tasks might be affected by changes in&#xD;
      physiology during space flight and design countermeasures to prevent or minimize impairment&#xD;
      to these physiological systems&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ALTERNATE COMPRESSION GARMENT STUDY (ACG) will determine effectiveness of compression&#xD;
      garments on regulating blood pressure and other body systems after extended periods of&#xD;
      head-down bed rest. Participants in the experimental group will wear custom-fit compression&#xD;
      garments and undergo evaluation on their response to an upright tilt test and a corresponding&#xD;
      set of physiological measures before and after 14 days of bed rest. These participants will&#xD;
      be compared to another group of participants who did not wear the compression garments.&#xD;
      Results of the study will help scientists determine the time it takes for the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system to re-adapt to upright posture, determine whether wearing compression garments during&#xD;
      recovery is necessary to protect against dizziness and loss of consciousness often&#xD;
      experienced after space missions, and determine the effect of wearing custom fit compression&#xD;
      garments on the amount of time needed to readjust to a normal, upright posture.&#xD;
