  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who usually have abnormal&#xD;
      electrical EEG responses when shown flashing lights will show a reduction in abnormal&#xD;
      electrical activity when they take a single dose of 2 marketed drugs (carbamazepine and&#xD;
      levetiracetam). If so, a similar study in the future may be able to identify promising new&#xD;
      drugs for epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who successfully complete the screening visit, will return 4 additional times and&#xD;
      will receive either placebo (2 times) or a single oral dose of both carbamazepine 400mg and&#xD;
      levetiracetam 1000mg in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of the study days, several procedures and intermittent photosensitivity (IPS)&#xD;
      assessments will be performed at 5 pre-determined times over the course of the day, one&#xD;
      pre-dose and 4 post-dose.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female age 18-60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis and history of a photoparoxysmal response on EEG with or without a&#xD;
             diagnosis of epilepsy for which patients are on 0-1 concomitant antiepileptic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A reproducible IPS-induced photo-paroxysmal response (PPR) on EEG of at least 3 points&#xD;
             on a frequency assessment scale in at least one eye condition and no change of more&#xD;
             than 3 frequencies in 2 repeated measurements recorded at screen in at least one eye&#xD;
             condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in otherwise good health (with the exception of epilepsy), as determined by&#xD;
             the PI via the medical history, a physical examination and screening laboratory&#xD;
             investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study in&#xD;
             accordance with the ICH, GCP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of non epileptic seizures (e.g. metabolic, structural or pseudo-seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of reproductive potential who do not agree to use effective birth-control&#xD;
             methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, will exclude the patient from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease or&#xD;
             any CNS disease deemed to be progressive during the course of the study that may&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant psychiatric illness, psychological or behavioral problems&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the patient's ability&#xD;
             to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of seizure worsening in response to narrow spectrum drugs&#xD;
             (including carbamazepine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are suffering from clinically significant active liver disease, porphyria&#xD;
             or with a family history of severe hepatic dysfunction indicated by abnormal liver&#xD;
             function tests greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (AST and ALT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of alcoholism, drug abuse, or drug addiction within the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in any other trials involving an investigational&#xD;
             product or device within 30 days of screening or longer as required by local&#xD;
             regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving more than 1 background AED for their epilepsy. Patients receiving&#xD;
             carbamazepine for their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are allergic to levetiracetam or carbamazepine.&#xD;
