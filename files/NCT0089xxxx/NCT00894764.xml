      This study will follow 1000 refugee infants from birth for two years. The aim of the study is&#xD;
      to better understand why some children develop infections caused by the bacterium&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae whilst others merely carry this organism asymptomatically at the&#xD;
      back of the nose (in the nasopharynx). The investigators will also define which&#xD;
      micro-organisms cause lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia) in this population&#xD;
      in order to implement appropriate interventions (e.g., vaccines). Infants will be reviewed&#xD;
      monthly and a nasopharyngeal swab will be taken. A group of 250 mother-infant pairs will be&#xD;
      studied in greater detail, to improve our understanding of the frequency and outcomes of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Monthly nasopharyngeal swabs will be&#xD;
      collected from mothers and infants. The investigators will measure the infant immune response&#xD;
      to Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage or disease by taking monthly blood samples. The&#xD;
      investigators will make an assessment of the protective effect of antibodies acquired from&#xD;
      the mother during pregnancy by taking blood from the mother and placenta at birth. An&#xD;
      assessment of pneumococcal carriage in mothers will also be made to determine how frequently&#xD;
      the bacterium is transmitted between family members. All lower respiratory tract infections&#xD;
      will be documented, and the causative micro-organisms identified.&#xD;

      This project's central hypothesis is that acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are a&#xD;
      common and significant cause of morbidity and mortality in young children living in Maela&#xD;
      refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border, and that this is reflective of the general situation&#xD;
      in the developing world. Therefore, we aim to define the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of&#xD;
      acute lower respiratory infections in this population. This will focus on Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae and the factors associated with colonisation and invasive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterise the interaction between bacterial and viral pathogens and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the dynamics of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, including transmission of&#xD;
           strains between infants and their mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effect of the non-pathogenic members of the nasopharyngeal flora on&#xD;
           colonisation with potential pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the role of passively transferred maternal pneumococcal antibodies in subsequent&#xD;
           pneumococcal colonisation and disease in the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Document the development of pneumococcal antibodies in the infants over time and&#xD;
           correlate these with pneumococcal carriage and infection episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Determine the risk factors associated with respiratory infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Characterise the bacteria causing invasive non-respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Conduct surveillance for influenza and in particular avian influenza A (H5N1) infection.&#xD;

        Maela is a densely populated camp predominantly inhabited by refugees of the Karen ethnic&#xD;
        group. It is located in hills adjoining the Burmese border 50 km north of Mae Sot. It is&#xD;
        the largest of the camps on the Thai-Burmese border, housing around one-third of the total&#xD;
        refugee population. Maela has a population of approximately 43,000 people, of which 20% are&#xD;
        females of child bearing age. Women presenting for antenatal care at SMRU's clinic will be&#xD;
        asked to take part in the study.&#xD;
