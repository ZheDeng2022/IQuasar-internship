      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients with current or previous&#xD;
      cancer may help doctors learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples in women with breast cancer or a&#xD;
      history of breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare peripheral blood (PB) concentrations of circulating endothelial cells (CEC)&#xD;
           in women with measurable, active breast cancer to PB concentrations of CEC in a control&#xD;
           population of women with a history of breast cancer who are currently without evidence&#xD;
           of active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare in women with measurable breast cancer the relationship between PB&#xD;
           concentrations of CEC prior to and at 3 and 6 weeks following initiation of a new&#xD;
           chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, and correlate these values with clinical response to&#xD;
           treatment to determine if CEC can be used as a tumor marker or indicator of disease&#xD;
           burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare PB concentrations of CEC to levels of plasma proteins associated with&#xD;
           angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor, in women with active or a&#xD;
           prior history of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood and plasma samples are collected for analysis of circulating&#xD;
      endothelial cells (CEC) and angiogenic growth factor levels. Blood samples from patients&#xD;
      initiating a new chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer are collected at baseline&#xD;
      and at 3 and 6 weeks following the start of treatment. CEC are quantified via flow cytometry&#xD;
      and plasma angiogenic markers are assessed via ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients with active, measurable breast cancer and 100&#xD;
      patients with a prior history of breast cancer will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
