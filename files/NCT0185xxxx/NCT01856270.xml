      The investigators propose to conduct a 2-arm, open-label pilot study to determine if early&#xD;
      treatment with amitriptyline will decrease the frequency and severity of headaches after mild&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is commonly&#xD;
      available and inexpensive. It is used as a first-line drug for primary headache prevention in&#xD;
      a very low dose range of 10-50 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a 2-arm open-label study to examine the effect of&#xD;
           preventive treatment with amitriptyline on the frequency and severity of headache after&#xD;
           mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2 is to collect data needed for design of a Phase 3 study, including an&#xD;
           estimate of effect size, headache variability, and desirable drug treatment start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 3 is to examine the feasibility of using headache diaries with individuals&#xD;
           with mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 4 is to establish the safety and tolerability of amitriptyline for the&#xD;
           prevention of headache after mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that early preventive treatment with amitriptyline will avert&#xD;
      the development of chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) as compared to rates of headache&#xD;
      from a recent natural history study on PTH after mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to enroll inpatient subjects from a Level I trauma center as well&#xD;
      as from outpatient clinics and from the general community with a diagnosis of mild TBI.&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for current headache. After baseline assessment, 72 subjects with&#xD;
      current headache will be randomized to one of 2 groups. Group 1 will immediately begin&#xD;
      amitriptyline and or Group 2 will be followed and begin amitriptyline at Day 30. All subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a daily headache diary beginning on Day 1 of the study. A detailed&#xD;
      medical history and headache survey will be completed. Subjects will have a scheduled stepped&#xD;
      increase in the drug dosage every week for 3 weeks to the maximum study dosage of 50 mg.&#xD;
      Weekly telephone calls will monitor for adverse events and compliance with the drug and&#xD;
      headache diary. Clinic visits will occur at 30, 60 and 90 days. The 30 day clinic visit will&#xD;
      include cognitive testing to assess for differences between groups and initiation of drug&#xD;
      treatment for Group 2. Both 30 and 60 day visits will include review of headache diary,&#xD;
      potential adverse effects, and pill counts. The 90 day visit will be for outcome assessment.&#xD;
      In addition, the headache survey will be repeated by telephone at Day 180.&#xD;

      Research Hypothesis and Aims: The ultimate aim of this research is to determine whether early&#xD;
      treatment using amitriptyline can prevent the development of chronic headache after TBI. This&#xD;
      proposal is for preliminary work that will give some indication of the effect of&#xD;
      amitriptyline and provide information needed to design a definitive study of the efficacy of&#xD;
      amitriptyline for the prevention of chronic post-traumatic headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a two-arm open-label study to examine the effect of preventive&#xD;
      treatment with amitriptyline on the frequency and severity of headache after mild TBI&#xD;
      compared to that seen in our observational study on the natural history of headache after&#xD;
      mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 is to collect data needed for design of a Phase III study, including an&#xD;
      estimate of effect size, the variability in the number of headache days in those with mild&#xD;
      TBI, and determining a desirable initiation date for preventive treatment (e.g., week 1 or&#xD;
      month 1 after injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 is to examine the feasibility of headache diary use in individuals with mild&#xD;
      TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4 is to establish the safety and tolerability of amitriptyline for the&#xD;
      prevention of headache after mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Preventive treatment of early headaches with amitriptyline after mild TBI results&#xD;
      in decreased prevalence of recurrent headache (percent of participants having at least 1&#xD;
      headache/week) and severe headaches (percent of participants having headaches with an average&#xD;
      pain of 5 or higher) at three months as compared to the frequency and severity of headache in&#xD;
      those followed in the natural history study who received usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Measures: Data collection will occur at enrollment, at each clinic visit,&#xD;
      and at Day 180. An examiner blinded to group assignment will administer all measures at&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 1 as cognition will be compared between groups at that time point; other&#xD;
      assessment points will be unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure: Frequency and severity of headaches at 90 days after study&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Measures: Secondary measures are the Brief Pain Inventory, Analog Pain Scale, Pain&#xD;
      Sites, Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder - 7 Item Scale (GAD-7), Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire (RPQ), EuroQol, Health Survey Short Form-12Â® (SF-12), and Satisfaction with&#xD;
      Life Scale. Caffeine use and drug use questions will be asked that will model the AUDIT&#xD;
      questions. Additional measures will be obtained at baseline to characterize injury type and&#xD;
      severity, medication use, and accompanying disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache Diary: The subject will be asked to fill out a headache diary each day during the&#xD;
      study to rate the frequency and severity of headache as well as some simple headache&#xD;
      characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and Randomization: Informed consent will be obtained from the participant as&#xD;
      approved by the Human Subjects Division of the University of Washington. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups (Group 1: early start vs. Group 2: delayed start) using a&#xD;
      computerized blocked randomization, stratified on headache severity (average severity of &lt;4&#xD;
      vs. &gt;5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication administration and dosing adjustments: The study drug, amitriptyline, will be&#xD;
      dispensed in medication containers clearly marked with the dosage and instructions to take at&#xD;
      bedtime daily (separate containers for 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg). Once randomized, Group 1&#xD;
      participants will be started on one 10 mg capsule each evening. The dosage will be adjusted&#xD;
      upwards to 25 mg daily for Week 2 to a maximum of 50 mg daily by Week 3. Group 2 participants&#xD;
      will be assessed on Clinic Visit 1 (Day 30) for current headache. If the participant has&#xD;
      continued to have headaches (new or worse than pre-injury), he/she will have the same ramp-up&#xD;
      schedule when the study drug is started at Day 30. Those in group 2 who do not have headaches&#xD;
      at day 30 will be followed by phone and with headache diaries throughout the study including&#xD;
      outcomes. If the perceived side effects of the study drug are intolerable at any time during&#xD;
      the study, subjects will be asked to decrease the dosage to half a pill until a new&#xD;
      prescription arrives. If side effects remain intolerable after 3 days on the lower dose, that&#xD;
      subject will be discontinued from the study drug but followed in the study. Regardless of&#xD;
      dose, the schedule for visits and testing will continue. Participants will be allowed to use&#xD;
      rescue medications as needed for headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance: Each dosage will be in a separate pill container and clearly marked. Compliance&#xD;
      will be assessed during the weekly telephone follow-up calls and at the follow-up clinic&#xD;
      visits. Pill counts will be performed at each visit. Adequate compliance will be considered&#xD;
      80% medication consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Visits: Baseline Hospital Visit. Measures administered will include an interim&#xD;
      medical history form (diagnoses, current medications), headache survey, pain measures, HIT-6,&#xD;
      PHQ-9, ISI, RPQ, and SF-12. After completion of baseline assessments, the research assistant&#xD;
      will instruct the participant in the use of a daily headache diary. The research assistant&#xD;
      will distribute the labeled study drug to each Group 1 participant and will instruct on use.&#xD;
      Participants will be given a schedule for increasing the dose weekly. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to keep their pill containers to turn in at the next clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Follow-Up Calls 1-9 (between clinic visits). The research assistant will contact&#xD;
      the participant weekly (Telephone Follow-Up Calls 1, 2, 3) after enrollment to check on&#xD;
      completion of headache diary and to confirm frequency and severity of headaches during the&#xD;
      preceding week, study drug use, and use of rescue medications. In the case of adverse effects&#xD;
      which are bothersome to the patient (e.g., mild sedation, dry mouth, constipation), the&#xD;
      dosage will be decreased by one dosage level or by Â½ pill per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 1 (Day 30). For all participants on this visit, vital signs will be obtained.&#xD;
      Drug containers will be collected from Group 1 and headache diaries will be collected from&#xD;
      all subjects. Measures administered on this visit will include an interim medical history&#xD;
      form (new diagnoses, changes in medications), headache survey, pain measures, HIT-6, PHQ-9,&#xD;
      ISI, RPQ,and SF-12. Neuropsychological tests will be given on this visit only. For Group 1,&#xD;
      if the dosage was decreased secondary to minor adverse events in the interim, one of the&#xD;
      study physicians will meet with the participant to decide whether to maintain a lower dose or&#xD;
      have a second trial of returning to a higher dose of the study drug. The second month's&#xD;
      supply of study drug will be dispensed at this visit. For Group 2 participants with headache,&#xD;
      medications for the first month of treatment will be distributed along with a ramp-up&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 2 (Day 60). Vital signs will be obtained. Drug containers and headache diaries&#xD;
      will be collected from all subjects. Measures administered on this visit will include an&#xD;
      interim medical history form (new diagnoses, changes in medications), headache survey, pain&#xD;
      measures, HIT-6, PHQ-9, ISI, RPQ, and SF-12. If the dosage was decreased secondary to minor&#xD;
      adverse events in the interim, one of the study physicians will meet with the participant to&#xD;
      decide whether to maintain a lower dose or have a second trial of returning to a higher dose&#xD;
      of the study drug. The final month's supply of study drug will be dispensed at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 3 (Day 90). This will be the final visit for the subjects. Vital signs will be&#xD;
      obtained. Drug containers and headache diaries will be collected from all subjects. Measures&#xD;
      administered on this visit will include an interim medical history form (new diagnoses,&#xD;
      changes in medications), headache survey, pain measures, HIT-6, PHQ-9, ISI, RPQ,and SF-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Follow-Up Call 10. The research assistant will call the subject at Day 180 to&#xD;
      administer the headache survey (which includes the HIT-6) and record current medications&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal: Subjects may be discontinued from the study drug on their request or if&#xD;
      the subject experiences an adverse effect sufficient to warrant withdrawal from the study&#xD;
      drug, In the case of discontinuation, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded and the&#xD;
      subject will be asked to continue to monitor their headaches with use of the headache diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Study Sample Size and Rationale: In a recent observational study, the&#xD;
      investigators observed that of people with new or worse headaches at baseline assessment&#xD;
      after mild TBI, 35% had 1 or more headaches per week at 3 months and a similar fraction had&#xD;
      average headache pain severity of 6 or more on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)&#xD;
      scale. The study's two end points are: 1) reduction in the percent of people with baseline&#xD;
      headaches that has one or more headaches per week at 3 months; and 2) the reduction in the&#xD;
      percent of people with baseline headaches that experience headache severity of 6 or more on a&#xD;
      scale from 0 to 10 at 3 months. It will be necessary for 65 cases to be followed to 3 months&#xD;
      in order to have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of a 35% headache rate if&#xD;
      amitriptyline taken as a preventive yields 21% of subjects having 1 or more headaches per&#xD;
      week (a 40% reduction in the percentage of people with frequent headaches at 3 months).&#xD;
      Similar numbers are needed to confirm a like reduction in the percent of participants with&#xD;
      severe headaches (average pain of 6 or greater). These are based on a 1-sided significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05. Allowing for up to 10% attrition (7 subjects), the investigators will recruit&#xD;
      and randomize 72 participants. Based on the previous natural history study, the investigators&#xD;
      expect about 104 cases per year to have new or worse headaches at baseline assessment. The&#xD;
      investigators expect 60% to meet the eligibility criteria and 60% of those to consent to&#xD;
      participate, yielding 37 cases per year to randomize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. The primary intent-to-treat analysis will determine the proportion of participants&#xD;
      with frequent (1 or more headaches per week) or severe (with average pain of 6 or higher)&#xD;
      headaches combining both arms at 3 months. Each of these proportions will be compared to the&#xD;
      rate of each recorded in our observational study using a normal approximation to the binomial&#xD;
      (one-sided chi-squared test). In the previous observational study, the investigators observed&#xD;
      35% with at least 1 headache per week and 36% with headaches having average pain of at least&#xD;
      6 on a scale from 0 to 10. A one-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used. The&#xD;
      investigators will also examine evidence for any differential benefit for amitriptyline&#xD;
      started at baseline or 1 month to help decide which to use for the Phase III trial if this&#xD;
      pilot suggests that is worthwhile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Descriptive statistics will be used (means, standard deviations, proportions) to help&#xD;
      in the planning of the Phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (feasibility of use of a headache diary). This will be addressed by examining the&#xD;
      number of participants who do not use their diary at all, have over 10% missing data, or who&#xD;
      report different values on the phone calls than is shown in the diary. Different modes of&#xD;
      completing the diary (paper, smart phone or web application) will be studied to see if any&#xD;
      are more user friendly for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the occurrence of adverse events. The&#xD;
      investigators will estimate the impact of amitriptyline on cognition by comparing the&#xD;
      neuropsychological performance at 1 month of those started on the drug at baseline to those&#xD;
      who start drug after the 1-month assessment. The mean difference on each test will be&#xD;
      calculated with a 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
