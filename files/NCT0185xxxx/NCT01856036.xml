  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will study the impact of cryoablation on immune response in patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with invasive breast cancers smaller than 1.5 cm. It will profile the immune response to&#xD;
      cryoablation of invasive breast cancers. The intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to&#xD;
      cryoablation will be determined and compared to pre-ablated breast cancer specimens and&#xD;
      historical control specimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with small breast cancers will undergo cryoablation of their breast cancer.&#xD;
      Approximately six weeks after cryoablation, definitive breast surgery will be performed.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for research before cryoablation and surgery and at regular follow-up&#xD;
      visits. Blood and tissue samples will be used to determine immune responses.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with an invasive breast cancer 1.5 cm or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The breast cancer must be of ductal histology, unifocal, estrogen receptor positive&#xD;
             and her2/neu negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The tumor must be visible by ultrasound and the subject must not have had prior&#xD;
             surgical resection of the primary lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A clip marking the breast cancer must have been placed at the time of initial&#xD;
             diagnosis or will be placed prior to cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The breast cancer must be amenable to cryoablation (visible by ultrasound and more&#xD;
             than 2 mm from skin or chest wall).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with metastatic disease at diagnosis who elect to have their primary tumor&#xD;
             excised are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For subjects with breast implants, the treating physician must document that adequate&#xD;
             distance exists between the lesion and the implant to ensure that the ablated lesion&#xD;
             with not contact or jeopardize the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must be able to provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with breast cancers of lobular histology, with lymph vascular invasion or&#xD;
             extensive intraductal component will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with multi-centric or multi-focal breast cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with breast cancers that have invaded skin or have significant skin tethering&#xD;
             (assessed clinically).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects receiving chemotherapy within one year or undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
             are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with metastatic disease at diagnosis will be excluded unless they elect&#xD;
             definitive surgical therapy for their primary lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with breast cancers not amenable to cryoablation (lesions not visible by&#xD;
             ultrasound, against the chest wall or within 2 mm of skin) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects diagnosed with another malignancy in the preceding 5 years will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects diagnosed with simultaneous bilateral breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapy within 6 months including oral steroids&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
