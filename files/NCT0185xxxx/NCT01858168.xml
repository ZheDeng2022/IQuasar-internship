    <textblock>
      This research study is a Three arm Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug or combination of drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of&#xD;
      the combination of investigational drugs to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means&#xD;
      that the combination of drugs is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet&#xD;
      approved the combination of drugs for your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib works by blocking the activity of a protein called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP) which is involved in DNA repair. Cancer cells rely on PARP to repair their DNA and&#xD;
      enable them to continue dividing. Olaparib has been used in research studies with other&#xD;
      cancers. Information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to&#xD;
      treat patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The investigational drug olaparib is not approved for&#xD;
      any use outside of research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide (Temodar) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of a type of brain tumor,&#xD;
      glioblastoma. It has been studied in Ewing sarcoma in previous research studies. While it is&#xD;
      not approved by the FDA for Ewing sarcoma, it is considered part of standard treatment for&#xD;
      relapsed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irinotecan is approved by the FDA for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. It has been&#xD;
      studied in Ewing sarcoma in previous research studies. While it is not approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for Ewing sarcoma, it is considered part of standard treatment for relapsed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies suggest that the combination of olaparib and temozolomide and/or&#xD;
      irinotecan may help kill Ewing sarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination&#xD;
      of olaparib and irinotecan and/or temozolomide that can be given safely. The investigators&#xD;
      will also begin to collect information about the effects of the combination on Ewing sarcoma&#xD;
      and rhabdomyosarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the patient agrees to participate in this research study they will be asked to undergo&#xD;
      some screening tests and procedures to confirm that they are eligible. Many of these tests&#xD;
      and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns&#xD;
      out that they do not take part in the research study. If they have had some of these tests&#xD;
      and procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures&#xD;
      will include: a medical history, complete physical examination, performance status, tumor&#xD;
      assessment, EKG, blood tests, pregnancy test, confirmation of pathology report and obtain&#xD;
      insurance approval to receive temozolomide. If these tests show that the patient is eligible&#xD;
      to participate in the research study, they will begin the study drug administration. If they&#xD;
      do not meet the eligibility criteria, they will not be able to participate in this research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers are substances such as genes and proteins that are important biological&#xD;
      &quot;indicators&quot; that can be measured in tumor tissue. The investigators would like to look at&#xD;
      biomarkers before and after patients receive study drug administration. Comparing the&#xD;
      biomarkers from tissue collected before and after receiving study treatments may help us find&#xD;
      biomarkers that are associated with response to study treatment or lack of response to study&#xD;
      drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the patient starts study drug administration, if the investigators determine that the&#xD;
      patient is healthy enough for a biopsy, the patient will undergo a biopsy to provide tumor&#xD;
      tissue for the research tests described above. (If it is determined that the patient should&#xD;
      not have a biopsy, they can still take part in this research study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are looking for the highest doses of olaparib and irinotecan and/or&#xD;
      temozolomide that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects to&#xD;
      participants that have Ewing's sarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. Therefore, not everyone who&#xD;
      participates in this research study will receive the same doses of olaparib, irinotecan,&#xD;
      and/or temozolomide. The doses the patients get will depend on the number of participants who&#xD;
      have been enrolled in the study before them and how well they have tolerated their doses. The&#xD;
      investigators will tell patients how the dose level you receive compares to doses given&#xD;
      previously in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib and irinotecan and/or temozolomide will ge given in cycles of 21 days (3 weeks).&#xD;
      Both olaparib and temozolomide are drugs that are taken by mouth. Patients will take olaparib&#xD;
      and temozolomide on days 1-7 (week 1) of each cycle. Irinotecan is given by IV, once per day,&#xD;
      on days 1-7 of each cycle. Patients will take olaparib twice per day and temozolomide once&#xD;
      per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will give patients a drug diary to record the doses of olaparib and&#xD;
      temozolomide that they take each day. The diary will also include special instructions for&#xD;
      taking olaparib and temozolomide. A member of the study team will show patients how to enter&#xD;
      their doses in the diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cycle 1 patients will come to the clinic on Days 1 and 8 (weeks 1 and 2). During&#xD;
      cycles 2-6 they will come to the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle. During cycles 8 and beyond&#xD;
      they will come to the clinic every 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit patients will undergo the following procedures: a physical exam,&#xD;
      questions about their health (problems, medications, side effects), performance status and&#xD;
      blood tests. Additionally, during the visit on Cycle 1, Day 8 patients will have an EKG. 4-6&#xD;
      weeks after starting study drug administration their blood will be tested for its clotting&#xD;
      ability on Day 1 of Cycle 2. They will also undergo a biopsy to provide tumor tissue for&#xD;
      biomarker research tests. Every 9 weeks they wil have a CT scan or MRI to measure your tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to return to the clinic about 30 days after stopping study drug. At&#xD;
      this visit the following will be done: physical exam, questions about their health,&#xD;
      performance status and blood tests. Patients will be asked to return study drug bottles and&#xD;
      any unused study drug at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to keep track of the patients' medical condition for as long as&#xD;
      they allow. The investigators would like to do this by either calling patients on the&#xD;
      telephone or following them at clinic visits every 3 months. Keeping in touch with patients&#xD;
      and checking their condition helps the investigators look at the long-term effects of the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
