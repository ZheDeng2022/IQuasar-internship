  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing incidence of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) affecting the premature&#xD;
      infant population, principally those with associated risk like extreme prematurity, extreme&#xD;
      low birth weight, associated co-morbidities (Congenital heart disease, perinatal asphyxia)&#xD;
      and those born in hospitals with limited resources for optimal neonatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), has been used in premature infants to evaluate changes in&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. (1) It provides real time insight into the oxygen&#xD;
      delivery.(3) In the premature patient population, many neurologic injuries occur as a result&#xD;
      of prenatal (pre-existing) and/or postnatal disturbance on oxygen delivery. NIRS has been&#xD;
      focused in cerebral monitoring. Light easily penetrates through neonatal bone and skin&#xD;
      tissue, and allows to monitor the subjacent oxygen content. Early studies were performed to&#xD;
      validate NIRS measurements and have established normative data.(4-6) The non-invasive method&#xD;
      of monitoring cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation has revolutionized the intensive care&#xD;
      units in patients at risk for neurological injuries. This method has been successfully&#xD;
      validated to monitor neonatal cerebral oxygenation in different clinical settings and study&#xD;
      protocols. (7) NIRS provides non-invasive, continuous information on tissue perfusion and&#xD;
      oxygen dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the biggest challenges of NEC spectrum diseases is in the making of early diagnosis.&#xD;
      It is important to monitor not just cerebral perfusion but also the intestinal&#xD;
      oxygenation.(8,9) Previous studies with NIRS have demonstrated that premature infants change&#xD;
      their cerebral - splanchnic oxygenation ratios during feedings.(10) Guy et al. performed NIRS&#xD;
      in premature piglets to demonstrate association of perfusion change with NEC spectrum(11,12);&#xD;
      these studies suggest evidence that NIRS could be a useful diagnostic tool in the premature&#xD;
      infant population trough abdominal NIRS (a-NIRS) measurement capable of detecting alterations&#xD;
      in intestinal oxygenation and perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, a-NIRS could be use in the premature infant population to define reference&#xD;
      values, especially in patients at risk, which would then facilitate the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      NEC spectrum diseases.&#xD;

      We will include, 10 premature infants from 32 to 36 weeks of post menstrual age, within the&#xD;
      first week of life, that are clinically stable without diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease,&#xD;
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis, Sepsis or having been transfused less than three days before the&#xD;
      evaluation. Infants with abdominal injuries, omphalocele, gastroschisis and abdominal skin&#xD;
      irritation that does not permit the application of the probes will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 premature infants from 32 to 36 weeks of post menstrual age will be included, after their&#xD;
      first week of life, clinically stable status, and without diagnosis of Congenital Heart&#xD;
      Disease, Necrotizing Enterocolitis, Sepsis or blood transfused less than three days before&#xD;
      the moment of the evaluation. Infants with abdominal injuries, Omphalocele, Gastroschisis,&#xD;
      skin irritation also will be excluded. NIRS device will record and monitor the Regional&#xD;
      Oxygen Saturation (rSO2) in the infant during one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will take place ar the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), 6th floor at the&#xD;
      Mary Horrigan Connors Center for Women's Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
      (http://www.brighamandwomens.org/newbornmedicine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device the INVOS 5100c (Covidien), catalogued&#xD;
      under de Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) as 'non-significant risk device' (21 CFR&#xD;
      812.2) in order to perform monitoring as well as record-keeping with non-risk for the&#xD;
      subject. No need Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of the INVOS 5100c (Covidien) sensor optodes will be positioned in four&#xD;
      locations (four channels), these will be in the lower abdomen, taking place bellow the&#xD;
      umbilicus, with care, flush against the skin; in the submandibular region; upper left abdomen&#xD;
      as well as in the thigh either left or right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the clinical status change during the monitoring, this could be discontinued under the&#xD;
      criteria of the attending neonatologist in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once included, the sensors will be placed in the described areas and the team will reassure&#xD;
      the quality of the lecture obtained. The rSO2 recordings will be continuously monitored for&#xD;
      seven days, after this period of time, prospective observational following of patient data&#xD;
      and outcomes will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcome data will be correlated with tissue oxygen saturation, other outcome&#xD;
      variables will include length of NICU stay, morbidity, mortality, laboratory studies, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation by standard pulse oximetry and continuous outcome variables will be analyzed using&#xD;
      the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) formula; mortality will be analyzed using Student's t-test.&#xD;
      For the remaining variables (vital signs, lab values, oxygen saturation, morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality), data will be extracted from clinical records and entered it into the electronic&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff, principal investigator, and co-investigators will identify potential&#xD;
      subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Potential subjects will be identified by&#xD;
      talking to the attending in charge at the NICU. Cases will be identified by communicating&#xD;
      with the NIRS/NICU research team at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the parent(s) or guardian(s) under the Research&#xD;
      involving no greater than minimal risk condition (46.404) where at least one of the parents&#xD;
      must provide the permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases we will approach the attending physician of prospective subjects to describe the&#xD;
      study and obtain verbal consent to approach patients for recruitment; the attending physician&#xD;
      or medical staff caring for the patient will be the first to make contact with the patients&#xD;
      parents or guardian to describe the study briefly and ask permission for us to explain the&#xD;
      study in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the data will be conducted by a physician and a clinical review team. The&#xD;
      principal investigator and study staff will be constantly monitoring and reviewing the&#xD;
      rights, safety and welfare of all subjects in this trial through out the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the principal investigator will review any adverse events and report in&#xD;
      accordance with the Partners Human Research Committees (PHRC) regulations.&#xD;
