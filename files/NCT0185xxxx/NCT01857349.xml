    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the superiority of surgical scrub preparations in&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty based on the bacterial counts present on the skin surface and in the&#xD;
      deep joint tissues. These counts will be obtained by culturing the skin prior to any scrub&#xD;
      preparation, post preparation after the application of the sterile drapes, deep joint tissue&#xD;
      sample prior to wound closure, and immediately post wound closure. This study will provide an&#xD;
      assessment of the management of sterility by comparing quantitative and qualitative cultures&#xD;
      immediately after surgical scrub preparation and the maintenance of sterility throughout the&#xD;
      procedure. This study will enhance prior research efforts by contributing quantitative&#xD;
      bacterial load and bacterial load within the surgical wound at closure.&#xD;

      Prospective randomized study of commonly used surgical prep solutions comparing superiority&#xD;
      of Chloraprep to Duraprep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome Measure: Quantitative and qualitative bacterial load pre-surgical&#xD;
           preparation, post-surgical preparation, and post-wound closure to be obtained by skin&#xD;
           cultures and one deep joint tissue culture from the joint space prior to wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcome Measure: Rates of surgical site infection in ChloraPrep and DuraPrep&#xD;
           groups to be outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;

      Subject recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 120 patients will be recruited to participate in the study upon consent for&#xD;
      surgical intervention based on the calculation to see a statistical difference in culture&#xD;
      results between duraprep and chloraprep. Please see the statistical analysis section for&#xD;
      details on the justification of recruiting 120 patients. All patients undergoing total knee&#xD;
      primary operation will be considered consecutively for the study. Patients will receive no&#xD;
      undue influence or incentive to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be sent to the OR with a randomized folder pre-made by a computer program&#xD;
      (Stata Version 12 College Station, TX) that will provide randomization after the patient is&#xD;
      enrolled in the study containing a paper stating the surgical prep solution to be used. On&#xD;
      the cover of the folder will be a sheet of paper with the following information to be filled&#xD;
      out and returned to the research coordinator. See Attachment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient randomized identification number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check box for Chloraprep or Duraprep - to be checked after opening sealed folder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start time of prep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End time of prep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instructions on how, where and when to take the 8 separate cultures and 1 tissue sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check boxes to ensure that cultures were finished and sent to the lab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incision start time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery end time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloraprep vs. Duraprep&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Pre Operative standard of Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative Antibiotics: All patients to receive Standard preoperative antibiotics per&#xD;
      institution protocol and the same type of non-microbial drape will be used for all cases&#xD;
      according to Dr. Brindley's standard protocol for surgery. Patients will receive 1 or 2g of&#xD;
      cefazolin (based on weight) prior to surgery unless they have an allergy to penicillin, in&#xD;
      which case they will receive 900mg of clindamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Skin Preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized at the time of enrollment for surgery&#xD;
           to be treated with one of two widely used Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved,&#xD;
           surgical skin preparation solutions: ChloraPrep (2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70%&#xD;
           isopropyl alcohol; Enturia, El Paso, Texas) or DuraPrep (0.7% available iodine and 74%&#xD;
           isopropyl alcohol; 3MHealthcare, St. Paul, Minnesota). The agent used for each patient&#xD;
           will be determined immediately prior to skin preparation by opening a sealed,&#xD;
           randomly-assigned envelope that will state the prep to be used. Due to the unique shapes&#xD;
           and colors of each scrub it is not feasible to cover the label of each prep used for&#xD;
           randomization. The surgical site will be prepped in the usual sterile fashion using 2&#xD;
           sticks of either ChloraPrep or DuraPrep. Each operating room will contain enough for 4&#xD;
           sticks for unforeseen errors (dropping the prep solution during surgical site&#xD;
           preparation or patients' body habitus, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization Folders will have a label including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Patient randomized ID ii. Check box for Duraprep or Chloraprep iii. Starting time of prep&#xD;
      and end time of prep iv. Time of start of surgery (Each scrub solution has a set time to dry&#xD;
      on it's label and this will document that each scrub was allowed to dry for the appropriate&#xD;
      time before the start of surgery. Chloraprep 3 min::::Duraprep 3 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Knee sites: 1. Midline anterior patella 2. Midline - popliteal area Please See Attachment&#xD;
      - Flyer for instruction on culture sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First Culture from native skin (specimens from sites 1 and 2) - To be taken at time of&#xD;
           consent at the History and Physical pre-surgery visit by those educated on the study&#xD;
           which includes residents, research coordinator, or holding room/pre-op nurses/ staff&#xD;
           prior to any sterile agents being used including alcohol wipes and chlorhexidine baths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second culture(specimens from sites 1 and 2)- to be taken in the OR before the surgical&#xD;
           prep solutions are applied, but after the pre-op surgical scrub is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Third Culture (specimens from sites 1 and 2) - To be taken after application of Duraprep&#xD;
           or Chloraprep after waiting appropriate timing (3 minutes) and before application of the&#xD;
           sterile drapes Tissue Culture (one specimen) - To be taken as a tissue sample from&#xD;
           within 1 cm of the lateral side of the patella/patellar implant. Will be excised using a&#xD;
           scalpel. This tissue sample will be weighed and homogenized to provide quantitative and&#xD;
           qualitative cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fourth Culture (specimens from sites 1 and 2) - To be taken after the final closure of&#xD;
           the wound and before removal of the sterile drapes. Culture must be taken within 1cm of&#xD;
           the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 9 cultures per participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method to Obtain Cultures - Primary surgeon, resident surgeons and holding room nurses will&#xD;
      be educated and utilized to obtain cultures. Each culture will be taken from a 17x17mm square&#xD;
      area (The length of the culture brush) area on the skin at each site to provide a&#xD;
      standardized area for quantitative cultures. A neutralizing solution will be used prior to&#xD;
      taking the culture to stop the killing action of the chlorhexidine and duraprep in order to&#xD;
      provide accurate results at the time of culture. The neutralizing solution formula is based&#xD;
      from the study by Savage et al [10] and is outlined below. Cultures will be marked for&#xD;
      identification based on site and time of culture, then placed in an envelope with the&#xD;
      patient's randomized ID. The culture folder will then be delivered to Dr. Hamood's&#xD;
      microbiology lab located on the TTUHSC campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutralizing solution quoted from Savage et al [10]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The swab was then placed in a sealed sterile transport container and was immediately&#xD;
           brought to the microbiology laboratory at our institution. All cultures were monitored&#xD;
           for seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ChloraPrep sampling (neutralizing) solution consisted of 0.04% monobasic potassium&#xD;
           phosphate, 1.01% dibasic sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.0% polyoxyethylene&#xD;
           sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), 0.3% lecithin, and 1.0% Tamol. The DuraPrep sampling&#xD;
           (neutralizing) solution consisted of 0.04% monobasic potassium phosphate, 1.01% dibasic&#xD;
           sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% sodium thiosulfate. The pH of each&#xD;
           solution was adjusted to 7.9 ± 0.1 prior to dispensing into water dilution bottles and&#xD;
           steam sterilizing for twenty minutes at 121_C. An independent contract laboratory&#xD;
           (Microbiotest, Sterling, Virginia) formulated and tested the neutralization solutions&#xD;
           and found that they were both effective and nontoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Culture Analysis Dr. Colmer-Hamood and/or student to be trained by Dr. Colmer-Hamood will&#xD;
      receive the samples, prepare the specimens for quantitative culture, and plate each specimen&#xD;
      for quantitation of aerobic and anaerobic growth. Tissue samples will be ground in 1 ml of&#xD;
      sterile broth to evenly distribute any microorganisms present and allow quantitative culture.&#xD;
      Cultures will be monitored for 7 days post-inoculation, due to the average time required for&#xD;
      detection of Propionibacterium acnes first growth being 5.1 days [1]. All colonies will be&#xD;
      counted and each morphotype will be sub-cultured for identification. Standard Total bacterial&#xD;
      load in colony forming units (CFU) will be calculated per mm2 of skin swabbed or gm of&#xD;
      tissue. CFU for individual species will also be calculated. Results will be documented on our&#xD;
      data collection form and reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Data Reporting Data will reported from Dr. Colmer-Hamood's lab including quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative bacteria connected to the patient's randomized number. This data will be stored&#xD;
      on a password protected workstation at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center&#xD;
      campus in Lubbock, Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will also be taken from the medical record based of on history and physical preoperative&#xD;
      and postoperative evaluations. Patients will be monitored for 3 months post operatively for&#xD;
      wound infections. These wound infections will be reported in the study, but the incidence&#xD;
      between the two surgical prep solutions will not be calculated due to the number of patients&#xD;
      required to meet statistical power. We will follow the CDC's definitions of surgical site&#xD;
      infections (SSIs) in reporting data [12].&#xD;
