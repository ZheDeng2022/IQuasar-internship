  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is a curative therapy for a variety of&#xD;
      hematologic disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Even when it is clear&#xD;
      that alloBMT can give to these patients an improvement in their disease, myeloablative&#xD;
      transplants have important toxicities and mortalities associated. The lack of suitable donors&#xD;
      continues to be a limit to access to transplantation. Substantial progress has been made&#xD;
      recently in the development of pre-treatment regimens that facilitate the sustained&#xD;
      engraftment of donor marrow with reduced toxicity. Most of these regimens incorporate highly&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs, which allow the reduction or elimination of myeloablative agents or&#xD;
      total body irradiation without endangering the sustained engraftment of HLA-identical&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cells. Preliminary results of non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation suggest that the procedure can be performed in patients who are ineligible&#xD;
      for myeloablative alloBMT, and that sustained remissions of several hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      can be obtained.&#xD;

             preclude giving informed consent or assent will not be excluded, if they have a family&#xD;
             member or significant other with Power of Attorney to also consent of their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CRITERIA FOR DONOR ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight ≥ 20kg and age ≥ 18 years or per institutional guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the&#xD;
             Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FAHCT) and will be screened per the&#xD;
             American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). (AABB guidelines and the recipients will&#xD;
             be informed of any deviations.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-haploidentical first-degree relatives of the patient. Participants must be HLA&#xD;
             typed at high resolution using DNA based typing at HLA-A, -B, -C and DRB1 and have&#xD;
             available: An HLA haploidentical first degree relative donor (parents, siblings or&#xD;
             half siblings, or children) with 2, 3, or 4 (out of 8) HLA-mismatches who is willing&#xD;
             and able to donate bone marrow. A unidirectional mismatch in either the graft versus&#xD;
             host or host versus graft direction is considered a mismatch. The donor and recipient&#xD;
             must be HLA identical for at least one antigen (using high resolution DNA based&#xD;
             typing) at the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment&#xD;
             of this criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient&#xD;
             share one HLA haplotype, and typing of additional family members is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        When more than one donor is available, the donor with the lowest number of HLA allele&#xD;
        mismatches will be chosen, unless there is HLA cross-match incompatibility or a medical&#xD;
        reason to select otherwise, in which case donor selection is the responsibility of the PI,&#xD;
        in consultation with the immunogenetics laboratory. In cases where there is more than one&#xD;
        donor with the least degree of mismatch, donors will be selected based on the most&#xD;
        favorable combination of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA compatibility in cross-match testing and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ABO compatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donor age &lt;40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Avoid female donors for male recipients and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Avoid CMV mismatched donor-recipient transplants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HLA cross-matching (in order of priority):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mutually compatible (no cross-matching antibodies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recipient non-cross-reactive with donor, donor cross-reactive with recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mutually cross-reactive&#xD;
&#xD;
        ABO compatibility (in order of priority):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Compatible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major incompatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minor incompatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major and minor incompatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors will be selected to minimize HLA mismatch in the Host-versus-graft direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors fulfilling the following criteria are ineligible for registration onto this&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All donors will be screened by hemoglobin electrophoresis; donors with a clinically&#xD;
             significant hemoglobinopathy are ineligible. Sickle trait is acceptable.&#xD;
