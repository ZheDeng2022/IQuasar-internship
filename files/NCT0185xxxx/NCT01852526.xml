  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, parallel-group, therapy-controlled trial in a&#xD;
      clinical care setting at a university hospital. Patients presenting to our outpatient clinic&#xD;
      with degenerative disc disease or spondylolisthesis will be assessed against study inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. After informed consent and randomization of patients, surgery will be&#xD;
      performed. Follow-up examinations will take place immediately after treatment during hospital&#xD;
      stay, and then after another 6 and 24 weeks, for a total study duration of 6 months. Data&#xD;
      will be assessed after 12, 24 and 36 months for a supplemental investigation. A further&#xD;
      assessment will be performed every year, owing to the possibility that a statement regarding&#xD;
      ASD cannot be given after 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental research in this trial will be performed with the approval of the ethics&#xD;
      committee of the medical faculty of the University of Cologne and of the university of Halle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients over 30 years of age presenting to our outpatient clinic with degenerative disc&#xD;
      disease or spondylolisthesis and indications for monosegmental lumbar spine fusion are&#xD;
      eligible for trial inclusion. Indication for the fusion procedure will not be stated earlier&#xD;
      than after 6 months of conservative therapy. Patients with spondylolisthesis have to respond&#xD;
      positively to facet joint injection. Radiologic inclusion criteria are summarized in the&#xD;
      appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisite to inclusion is the presence of radiologic degeneration of the adjacent segment&#xD;
      (Pfirrmann grades II-IV in MRI findings) without signs of instability. Definition of&#xD;
      radiologic and clinical instability as well as further inclusion criteria are summarized in&#xD;
      the appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be approached and recruited by experienced spine surgeons. A number of&#xD;
      150 patients per year, who undergo primary monosegmental fusion in the department, is&#xD;
      estimated for the screening procedure. A recruitment rate of 30 patients per year is&#xD;
      anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive one of two treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional monosegmental posterior lumbar intervertebral fusion (PLIF) Hybrid system (PLIF&#xD;
      + flexible pedicle screw system above the fusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group - conventional PLIF The control group will receive a monosegmental posterior&#xD;
      lumbar spine fusion with an intervertebral cage (PLIF). This is the current well-established&#xD;
      therapy for several pathologies of the lumbar spine (e.g. spondylolisthesis, degenerative&#xD;
      disc disease). Thus, the control group will receive the standard of care. This is the only&#xD;
      acceptable control/comparison in a trial of this kind. Surgery will be performed using the&#xD;
      following devices: S4® AESCULAP AG, Cage: Wave® Cage, Fa. AMT®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group - hybrid system The intervention group will receive a hybrid system with&#xD;
      PLIF and a flexible pedicle screw system above the fusion. Surgery will be performed using&#xD;
      the following devices: S4® Dynamic rod: AESCULAP AG (Tuttlingen)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only skilled spine surgeons (experience of at least 30 fusion-procedures) will participate in&#xD;
      the trial. Intraoperative photo documentation will help preventing variations of the&#xD;
      procedure (e.g. enlargement of decompression/approach). We will also provide an instructional&#xD;
      movie on the standards of the procedures and the rating of the x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a surgical drain, to be removed 2 days post-surgery. Both groups of&#xD;
      patients will receive physical therapy, beginning on the day after surgery. Patients will be&#xD;
      discharged only after sufficient convalescence with unremarkable wound healing. Hospital&#xD;
      admission lasting 8-10 days will be necessary. Physical therapy will be performed during the&#xD;
      inpatient period. After hospital discharge, physical therapy will be continued under&#xD;
      outpatient conditions. This therapy will not be standardized in order to reflect reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse and Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient that may&#xD;
      or may not have a causal relationship with the study treatment. Abnormal laboratory test&#xD;
      values will be recorded as AE only if they require treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Concomitant Diseases In this context, deterioration of a pre-existing disease is also to&#xD;
           be regarded as an Adverse Event. But it will not be regarded as an Adverse Event if it&#xD;
           is due to a treatment that was already planned before the patient was enrolled in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnancy In this study, the occurrence of pregnancy is considered as an Adverse Event.&#xD;
           Before surgery, laboratory tests will be conducted to exclude pregnancy in women below&#xD;
           50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory Test Values Any abnormal laboratory test values during the study will be&#xD;
           checked for plausibility and evaluated for clinical relevance by the responsible&#xD;
           investigator. If during the study, an abnormal test value is found that, in the baseline&#xD;
           visit, was not considered to be clinically relevant, but is now considered to be&#xD;
           clinically relevant, it must be recorded as an AE in the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event The present clinical study is not subject to the Sections 20-23a of the&#xD;
      German Medical Product Law (Medizinproduktgesetz - MPG), but its definitions will apply here.&#xD;
      A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward occurrence in a clinical trial or in a performance&#xD;
      evaluation text subject to approval that&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  directly or indirectly leads to death; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have led, could have led, or could lead to a serious deterioration in the state of&#xD;
           health of a study subject, of a user or of another person, irrespective of whether the&#xD;
           occurrence has been caused by the medical product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This definition of a SAE will serve as basis for the documentation of Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
      during the study. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascertainment of AE and SAE The study centre concerned is responsible for recording and&#xD;
      reporting AEs and SAEs. The study director/main investigator will ensure that all persons&#xD;
      involved in the treatment of the study patients are fully aware of their responsibilities in&#xD;
      the event of Adverse Events. At each visit, the patients will be asked if they have&#xD;
      experienced any Adverse/Serious Events. The Adverse Events will be recorded both in the&#xD;
      patients' medical record and in the survey questionnaires. At each visit, the physician will&#xD;
      review the patients' medical records to determine whether Adverse Events have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an Adverse Event occurs, the patient in question, irrespective of the causal relationship&#xD;
      between the Adverse Event and the study treatment, must be kept under constant supervision.&#xD;
      In any case, the patient must remain under observation until the symptoms have subsided, or&#xD;
      the laboratory test values have returned to acceptable levels, or a plausible explanation has&#xD;
      been found for the Adverse Event, or until the patient has died, or has been discharged from&#xD;
      the study (last visit after 6 months or 36 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Adverse Events will be recorded in the CFR, including the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time and date of start and end&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gravity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship to the study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious or not serious&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected or not expected&#xD;
