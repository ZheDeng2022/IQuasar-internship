      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Idebenone in Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS) trial tested&#xD;
      a new drug for multiple sclerosis. In the IPPoMS trial, participants took either idebenone or&#xD;
      placebo. Researchers want to give idebenone to all participants for 1 year. It is still not&#xD;
      certain whether idebenone can slow the progression of multiple sclerosis, but this study may&#xD;
      help answer that question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide idebenone to all participants on the IPPoMS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect data on the safety and effectiveness of idebenone for primary progressive&#xD;
           multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have completed 3 years in the IPPoMS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first study visit for this trial will happen on the same day as the last visit for&#xD;
           the IPPoMS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood samples and will have a lumbar puncture. They will&#xD;
           also receive a new supply of idebenone to take three times a day with food. They will&#xD;
           keep a diary to report on any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this first treatment visit, participants will have two follow-up visits to the NIH&#xD;
           6 months apart. These visits may be scheduled over multiple days. Participants will&#xD;
           provide blood and urine samples. They will also have imaging studies of the brain and&#xD;
           spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have phone calls with the study researchers to provide updates on&#xD;
           their condition and any side effects.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I/II clinical trial is being conducted to investigate the safety, therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy and mechanism of action of idebenone in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (PP-MS) patients (IPPoMS (Protocol Number 09-N-0197). Patients who have completed the 2-year&#xD;
      treatment period of IPPoMS, may enter into this open-label extension study (IPPoMS-E) if they&#xD;
      are found to be eligible by the Investigator and desire treatment with idebenone despite&#xD;
      remaining blinded as to their allocation to active treatment versus placebo during the IPPoMS&#xD;
      trial. The aim of this open-label extension study is gather additional data on safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and effects of idebenone on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in these patients&#xD;
      over a period of 1 year. This study will provide open-label idebenone for patients with&#xD;
      PP-MS, previously randomized to idebenone or to placebo in the blinded phase of IPPoMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were previously enrolled in the IPPoMS (Protocol Number 09-N-0197) will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the trial. The same idebenone dose used in the randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial (2250 mg/day) will be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single group, open-label safety and efficacy extension trial with a one year&#xD;
      treatment period. Patient-specific biomarkers of disease progression, CSF biomarkers of&#xD;
      oxidative stress, longitudinal neuroimaging including quantitative measures of CNS tissue&#xD;
      destruction and clinical data will be collected as in the randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement and collection of data will be performed as in the randomized trial.&#xD;
      Quantitative neuroimaging measures of central nervous system (CNS: i.e. brain and spinal&#xD;
      cord) tissue destruction and clinical and functional measures of neurological disability will&#xD;
      be collected every 6-12 months. Additionally, biomarkers focusing on analysis of reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress will be collected every 12 months. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure defined in the IPPoMS trial will be also utilized in IPPoMS-E. For patients&#xD;
      originally randomized to placebo, patient-specific slopes of disease progression during 2&#xD;
      years of placebo therapy (as measured by primary and secondary outcomes) will be compared to&#xD;
      patient-specific slopes of disease progression during 1 year of open label idebenone therapy.&#xD;
      Combination of IPPoMS and IPPoMS-E trials will significantly expand paired no therapy vs.&#xD;
      idebenone therapy CSF samples for biomarker studies. It will also provide (for the subgroup&#xD;
      of subjects who were originally randomized to idebenone) longitudinal CSF samples on&#xD;
      idebenone therapy (collected 2 years apart). This will allow calculations of intra-individual&#xD;
      changes in CSF biomarkers on and off idebenone therapy, which may provide important insight&#xD;
      into the mechanism of action of idebenone in PP-MS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1-year pre-treatment baseline vs 2-year randomized double-blind phased vs 1-year treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>CombiWISE is a composite scale derived from Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) , Scripps Neurological Disability Scale (SNRS), times 25 foot walk (25FW), and non-dominant hand of 9 hole peg test (9HPT) with a minimum value of 0 (no disability) and maximum value of 100 (maximum disability).&#xD;
The AUC values were calculated for both study groups (Active treatment group in the 09-I-0197 trial and Placebo group in the 09-I-0197) as follows:&#xD;
pre-treatment baseline during the 09-I-0197 trial (from Months -12, -6, and 0)&#xD;
double-blind phase during the 09-I-0197 trial (from Months 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24)&#xD;
extension phase during the 13-I-0088 trial (from Months 24, 30, and 36)&#xD;
Because the follow-up times varied from patient to patient, the AUC values were made comparable by scaling them by dividing the AUC value by the square of the actual duration (in years) of each of the phases.</description>

    <measure>Slopes of 25 Foot Walk (25FW) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>3-years double-blind phase and 1-year extension phase</time_frame>
    <description>slopes of measured times of 25FW during the 3-year 09-I-0197 trial (one year of pre-treatment baseline and two years of double-blind randomized treatment) and during one year extension phase of the 13-I-0088 trial. The slopes were measured separately for placebo and active treatment arm as randomized in the the 09-I-0197 trial.&#xD;
Lower extremity disability was measured by an average of two trials of timed 25 foot walk assessed every 6 month.&#xD;
The maximum time assigned for a trial is 180s. Patients unable to complete the 25 foot trial within this time limit are coded as &quot;179.9&quot;</description>

    <measure>Slopes of 9 Hole Peg Test (9HPT) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>3-years double-blind phase and 1-year extension phase</time_frame>
    <description>Slopes of measured times of 9HPT during the 3-year 09-I-0197 trial (one year of pre-treatment baseline and two years of double-blind randomized treatment) and during one year extension phase of the 13-I-0088 trial. The slopes were measured separately for placebo and active treatment arm as randomized in the the 09-I-0197 trial.&#xD;
Upper extremity/fine motor movements disability was measured as an average of left and right hand time, with each hand assessed as an average of two trials with upper limit of 5 (300s) per trial. Patients unable to complete the task within this time are coded as &quot;777&quot; The outcome was assessed every 6 months.</description>

    <measure>Slopes of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3-years double-blind phase and 1-year extension phase</time_frame>
    <description>Slopes of measured EDSS scores during the 3-year 09-I-0197 trial (one year of pre-treatment baseline and two years of double-blind randomized treatment) and during one year extension phase of the 13-I-0088 trial. The slopes were measured separately for placebo and active treatment arm as randomized in the the 09-I-0197 trial.&#xD;
EDSS scale combines various elements of neurological exam. EDSS is a discrete scale ranging from 0 to 10 with 0.5 point increments. EDSS of 0 means no neurological disability, while EDSS of 10 marks death due to Multiple Sclerosis (MS). EDSS was assessed every 6 months.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Combinatorial Weight-Adjusted Disability Score (CombiWISE)</title>
        <description>CombiWISE is a composite scale derived from Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) , Scripps Neurological Disability Scale (SNRS), times 25 foot walk (25FW), and non-dominant hand of 9 hole peg test (9HPT) with a minimum value of 0 (no disability) and maximum value of 100 (maximum disability).&#xD;
The AUC values were calculated for both study groups (Active treatment group in the 09-I-0197 trial and Placebo group in the 09-I-0197) as follows:&#xD;
pre-treatment baseline during the 09-I-0197 trial (from Months -12, -6, and 0)&#xD;
double-blind phase during the 09-I-0197 trial (from Months 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24)&#xD;
extension phase during the 13-I-0088 trial (from Months 24, 30, and 36)&#xD;
Because the follow-up times varied from patient to patient, the AUC values were made comparable by scaling them by dividing the AUC value by the square of the actual duration (in years) of each of the phases.</description>

        <title>Slopes of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score</title>
        <description>Slopes of measured EDSS scores during the 3-year 09-I-0197 trial (one year of pre-treatment baseline and two years of double-blind randomized treatment) and during one year extension phase of the 13-I-0088 trial. The slopes were measured separately for placebo and active treatment arm as randomized in the the 09-I-0197 trial.&#xD;
EDSS scale combines various elements of neurological exam. EDSS is a discrete scale ranging from 0 to 10 with 0.5 point increments. EDSS of 0 means no neurological disability, while EDSS of 10 marks death due to Multiple Sclerosis (MS). EDSS was assessed every 6 months.</description>
