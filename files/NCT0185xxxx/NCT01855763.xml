      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical study comparing metformin and insulin in the treatment of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy was conducted between December 2008&#xD;
      till December 2012 in the tertiary care university hospital of Lyari General Hospital and Dow&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences and in four other private obstetric (maternity) hospitals of&#xD;
      Karachi. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Dow University of Heath Sciences.&#xD;
      A written informed consent was taken from the participants of the study and the consequences&#xD;
      and suspected outcomes were informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were selected from those attending the antenatal clinic with previously&#xD;
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes or were screened in antenatal clinic due to presence of high risk&#xD;
      factors for diabetes mellitus and were found to have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women were subjected to screening after evaluation of high risk factors at their&#xD;
      first antenatal visit irrespective of gestational age in order to pick undiagnosed type 2&#xD;
      diabetes early in pregnancy. Women who were screen negative at first antenatal visit were&#xD;
      subjected to repeat screening at 24-28 weeks and 32-36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 50gm oral glucose challenge test (GCT) was done as an initial screening test irrespective&#xD;
      of the fasting status and a blood sugar level of 140gm/dl was considered as a positive GCT.&#xD;
      Gestational diabetes was then diagnosed by a 2 hour 75gm oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
      after an over night fast of 10 hours. Diagnosis of GDM was made with at least two out of&#xD;
      three abnormal high plasma glucose levels in a 75gm OGTT FBS&gt; 95, 1 hour ≥180 and 2 hour&#xD;
      ≥155.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and screen positive of gestational diabetes with&#xD;
      pregnancy beyond first trimester and having FBS &gt;100mg/dl and 1 ½ hour postprandial glucose&#xD;
      of &gt;126mg/dl were advised for dietary modifications and life style counseling including&#xD;
      exercise. Women with blood glucose levels being too high and those who do not maintain the&#xD;
      required blood glucose levels on diet and exercise were included in the study and randomized&#xD;
      for treatment with metformin or insulin along with diet and exercise advice. Randomization&#xD;
      was done as the patients were divided into two groups as they enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patients with gestational diabetes. Group B: Patients with type 2 diabetes. Each&#xD;
      group was further subdivided into two sub groups. Group A1: Received metformin treatment.&#xD;
      Group A2: Received insulin treatment. Group B1: Received metformin treatment. Group B2:&#xD;
      Received insulin treatment. Odd numbers in each group were assigned for metformin treatment&#xD;
      and even numbers in each group for insulin treatment. Blinding of the treatment was not&#xD;
      possible because of the different routes of administration. Patients not fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and controlled on diet alone were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the women were provided with standard nutritional instructions for three meals and three&#xD;
      snacks daily. Adherence to the dietary regimen was evaluated and reinforced at weekly or&#xD;
      fortnightly antenatal visits. The diets were designed to provide 25kcal/kg of body weight for&#xD;
      non obese women with 40-45% calories from carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin was started at dose of 500mg daily and increased up to 2500mg daily in divided&#xD;
      doses as tolerated by patient and depending on maternal glucose levels. Target blood glucose&#xD;
      values are taken as FBS of less than or equal to 100mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l) and RBS ≤ 126mg/dl&#xD;
      (7mmol/l). If blood glucose levels were higher than the cut off values after one to two weeks&#xD;
      of treatment and in spite of achieving the maximum dose of metformin, insulin was added as&#xD;
      supplementary treatment with metformin continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin was added as supplementary treatment in patients not controlled with metformin alone&#xD;
      in 1-2 weeks or at any time when glycemic targets were not achieved with metformin alone.&#xD;
      Insulin was given as a combination of short acting and intermediate acting Human insulin&#xD;
      twice daily before meals. Patients were followed in outpatient clinic at 1-2 weeks interval&#xD;
      depending on blood glucose control till blood glucose levels were stabilized. However they&#xD;
      were provided the phone number to contact the researcher in case of any emergency or&#xD;
      otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin was prescribed as a combination of short acting and intermediate acting human insulin&#xD;
      twice daily before meals. For estimation of starting dose of insulin a combination of&#xD;
      maternal weight in kg and pregnancy trimester was used. A 24-hour total insulin dose was&#xD;
      calculated using 0.7 units/kg in first trimester, 0.8 units/kg in second trimester and 0.9&#xD;
      units/kg in third trimester. Two thirds of the total dose was given in the morning before&#xD;
      breakfast and one third at night before dinner. Two thirds of the morning insulin dose was&#xD;
      given as intermediate acting insulin (Humulin N) and one third as short acting insulin&#xD;
      (Humulin R) with both given as single injection. Half of the night insulin is intermediate&#xD;
      acting and half was short acting insulin given in a single injection.&#xD;
