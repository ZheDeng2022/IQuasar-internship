      AVMs are abnormal collections of blood vessels which can occur in any part of the body&#xD;
      including the lungs. These blood vessels are weakened and can rupture anytime causing&#xD;
      bleeding which can be massive, leading to life-threatening conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary AVMs occur in about 40% of patients with HHT. Each patient may have an average of 5&#xD;
      AVMs .Rupture of the AVM can lead to massive bleeding in the lung, stroke and infection of&#xD;
      the brain. In order to prevent these complications, patients with HHT are routinely examined&#xD;
      for pulmonary AVMs and treatment with embolization is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVMs have a main blood vessel or artery supplying blood to the collection of blood vessels.&#xD;
      The way to treat AVMs is cut off their blood supply through a process called embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embolization is a standard medical procedure which is done to stop or prevent hemorrhage&#xD;
      (bleeding) from an AVM. It involves blocking the artery that supplies blood to the AVM by&#xD;
      inserting a foreign body, into the blood vessel supplying blood to the AVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard devices used for embolization include coils (made of stainless steel or platinum).&#xD;
      These devices usually have a good success rate for blocking the artery that supplies blood to&#xD;
      the AVM. However, a few AVMs that are embolized by standard devices may reopen over time.&#xD;
      This is called reperfusion and will require repeat embolization procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For embolization of pulmonary AVMs at St. Michael's Hospital, the Nester coil is used. In&#xD;
      this study, we would like to compare the Nester coil with a new coil device called the&#xD;
      Interlock Fibered IDC Occlusion System. Both coils are approved for use in Canada, however&#xD;
      the cost of the IDC coil limits its use at this hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the Nester coil, the IDC coils are made so that they can be removed or&#xD;
      repositioned if they are not placed correctly. The coil also allows tighter packing which&#xD;
      helps prevent reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the success rate of embolization between the Interlock™ Fibered IDC™&#xD;
      Occlusion System (IDC coil) and the Nester coil.&#xD;

      Introduction Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can lead to life-threatening&#xD;
      complications. These complications can be prevented with pre-symptomatic embolization. The&#xD;
      Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System coil (IDC) is a new device which might be more&#xD;
      effective for embolizing pulmonary AVMs. This study will investigate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System and compare rates of reperfusion using Nestor coils&#xD;
      (standard coils used at participating centre) versus Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion,&#xD;
      randomizing by AVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Reperfused AVMs put the patient at risk of pulmonary AVM complications. As such,&#xD;
      these AVMs require repeat embolotherapy and therefore patients are subjected to further&#xD;
      radiation, contrast and hospitalization. A number of devices have been studied and are&#xD;
      currently being used for embolization of pulmonary AVMs including coils (stainless steel,&#xD;
      platinum) and plugs (Amplatzer plugs). The immediate technical success rate is nearly 100%,&#xD;
      but long-term reperfusion occurrence is approximately 15% of treated AVMs and up to 30% of&#xD;
      patients. The IDC coil characteristics may lead to reduced reperfusion rates. No studies of&#xD;
      IDC coils have been reported to date in the management of pulmonary AVMs. Safety of IDC coils&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in other organs. Embolization procedure with IDC coils is similar to&#xD;
      embolization with other devices, in terms of fluoroscopy time use and contrast load, as are&#xD;
      procedural complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Pulmonary AVMs are present in approximately 40% of patients with hereditary&#xD;
      hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), with a mean of five pulmonary AVMs per patient. Pulmonary&#xD;
      AVMs can lead to life-threatening and debilitating complications, such as massive&#xD;
      haemoptysis, spontaneous haemothorax, stroke and cerebral abscess. Fortunately, these&#xD;
      complications are preventable, through screening of HHT patients and preventative treatment&#xD;
      of pulmonary AVMs, as summarized in a recent decision analysis. The International HHT&#xD;
      Guidelines recommends routine screening of all HHT patients for pulmonary AVMs, with&#xD;
      preventative transcatheter embolotherapy of all significant pulmonary AVMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most published data have reported outcomes with stainless steel or platinum coils, and fewer&#xD;
      with detachable balloons or Amplatzer plugs. Even with good success rates, reperfusion has&#xD;
      generally been reported in the range of 15% of embolized AVMs with routine embolization using&#xD;
      stainless steel or platinum coils. To date, comparative studies between stainless steel and&#xD;
      platinum coils have not shown significant differences in outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN OF INVESTIGATION Study Hypothesis The device of interest has local characteristics&#xD;
      including better positioning and controlled release, together with tighter packing, which may&#xD;
      lead to superior outcomes and reduce costs as well as radiation time. Therefore it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the IDC coil will be associated with less reperfusion than standard Nestor&#xD;
      coils, and will present a therapeutic advantage over Nestor coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Objective Reperfusion for each AVM will be assessed at 1-year follow-up&#xD;
      post-embolization. If there is insufficient involution (&lt;70% by volume) of the lesion, then&#xD;
      the AVM will be considered to be reperfused and care will be according to best clinical&#xD;
      practice. Follow up imaging will be as per usual practice/guidelines. If the participant&#xD;
      develops complications suspected to be due to pulmonary AVMs during the first year follow-up&#xD;
      period, then reassessment will be arranged according to current clinical practice protocols.&#xD;
      If there is evidence at early follow-up of ongoing AVM perfusion or of lack of aneurismal&#xD;
      involution, the AVM will be considered to be &quot;reperfused&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective Reported secondary outcomes include fluoroscopy time, contrast volume&#xD;
      required, procedural time and complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Study Population All adult patients who attend the Hereditary Hemorrhagic&#xD;
      Telangiectasia (HHT) clinic, require embolization procedures for their pulmonary AVMs, who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be considered eligible for this study. The&#xD;
      Toronto HHT Centre has a large well-characterized HHT population (approximately 1000&#xD;
      patients), the largest such population in Canada, allowing for feasible recruitment. It is&#xD;
      estimated that approximately 30 new patients undergo embolization per year, comprising&#xD;
      approximately 150 AVMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Potential study participants will be identified from the Toronto HHT Centre&#xD;
      Database, an IRB approved comprehensive database capturing clinical information of patients&#xD;
      who have expressed an interest to participate in HHT related research studies and/or from the&#xD;
      HHT Clinic. Potential participants will be pre- screened for eligibility and upon&#xD;
      determination be approached for study participation. The study will initially be presented to&#xD;
      the eligible patient by the treating physician or a member of the HHT clinic team, who will&#xD;
      then introduce study personnel to the patient in order to give any additional information&#xD;
      including obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive a unique randomization list. The Investigators will first&#xD;
      determine the number of pulmonary AVMs for which embolotherapy is required per participant.&#xD;
      Each treatable AVM will be referenced anatomically and assigned a number starting from one&#xD;
      and continuing up in sequential order. The Study Coordinator will then match this list to a&#xD;
      pre determined randomization list. Each AVM will be randomized into one of the two following&#xD;
      treatment allocations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AVM Allocation I: Standard embolization procedure with Nestor Coil&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AVM Allocation II: Standard embolization procedure with The Interlock™ Fibered IDC™&#xD;
           Occlusion System coil Unused randomizations will be discarded and will not be carried&#xD;
           over to the subsequent enrolled participant. The Investigators will not have access to&#xD;
           the randomization lists but will be informed by the Study Coordinator as to which AVM&#xD;
           will acquire which allocated treatment device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of the Principal Investigator is not possible since the Primary Investigator is also&#xD;
      the treating Interventional Radiologist responsible for the embolotherapy procedure.&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded to the type of coil they receive (Group Allocation) for each&#xD;
      particular treatable aneurysm. Outcome ascertainment bias will be minimized by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Coil allocation will be performed by the Study Coordinator during randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Final analysis results are non-subjective and obtained from concrete values acquired&#xD;
           from imaging data such as reperfusion rate per coiled aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VISITS Visit I - Screening and Baseline The study will be explained in detail to the&#xD;
      eligible participant. They will be given as much time as needed to review the informed&#xD;
      consent form (ICF) and ask any questions they may have regarding the study. It will be&#xD;
      ensured that all questions regarding the study are answered to satisfaction of the eligible&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once satisfied and prior to commencement of any study related procedures, the participant&#xD;
      will be asked to sign the Research Ethics Board-approved written consent form for this study.&#xD;
      A copy of the informed consent form will be provided to the patient to take and look over at&#xD;
      their leisure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, the Study Coordinator will screen patients for study&#xD;
      eligibility using the inclusion/exclusion criteria defined in this protocol and will document&#xD;
      them on a screening log. Reasons for non-participation will be identified based on inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit II - Procedure Pulmonary angiography and embolotherapy will be performed using standard&#xD;
      clinical technique. Using standard aseptic technique the right common femoral vein is&#xD;
      punctured under direct sonographic guidance. A 7 French sheath is placed and connected to a&#xD;
      continuous saline irrigation. The right heart and then pulmonary arteries cannulated using a&#xD;
      7 French Van Aman catheter. Pulmonary artery pressures are obtained; followed by pulmonary&#xD;
      angiography, either unilateral or bilateral depending on the site of the PAVMs. Once&#xD;
      confirmed the feeding arteries are cannulated using the Lumax catheter. After confirming&#xD;
      position the coils are deployed until complete occlusion of the feeding artery is achieved.&#xD;
      Similar procedure repeated for the other PAVMs. The catheter and sheath are then removed and&#xD;
      haemostasis is obtained. The participant is sent to the ward for monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit III - Post Procedure Post procedure, the participant will follow standard clinical&#xD;
      practice recommendations. The participant will be admitted overnight and will undergo a&#xD;
      routine chest X-Ray 1-day post embolization, before discharge from the hospital. The&#xD;
      participant will be assessed for the presence of post-procedure complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit IV - Month 1-3 Follow-Up As per standard clinical practice, the participant will be&#xD;
      required to visit Dr. Faughnan at the HHT Clinic 1-3 months post-procedure. This visit will&#xD;
      also include a single view chest X-Ray and standard oxygen shunt test. If there is any&#xD;
      suspicion of reopening of the embolized artery, it will be managed as per usual clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit V - Month 10-14 Follow-Up As per usual clinical practice, the participant will be&#xD;
      re-assessed at 10-14 months post-procedure with an unenhanced low-dose CT scan of the chest.&#xD;
      If there is any suspicion of reopening of the embolized artery, this will be managed as per&#xD;
      usual clinical practice.&#xD;
