  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor graft function (PGF) is a common complication after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, which was associated with high mortality. The pathogenesis fo PGF was poorly&#xD;
      understood. Infusion of donor peripheral cell harvest was effective for some patients with&#xD;
      PGF in our preliminary study. This present study aimed to explore the efficacy of peripheral&#xD;
      cell harvest for poor graft function.&#xD;

      Poor graft function (PGF) is a common complication after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, which was associated with high mortality. The pathogenesis fo PGF was poorly&#xD;
      understood. Infusion of donor peripheral cell harvest was effective for some patients with&#xD;
      PGF in our preliminary study.The peripheral cell harvest was aphaeresis on the fourth or&#xD;
      fifth day after mobilization with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor.&#xD;
      Hematogical response was assessed at 30 days after infusion. Good response was defined as&#xD;
      neutrophil &gt; 1.0×109/l without G-CSF support for at least 3 consecutive days, and persistent&#xD;
      platelet &gt;20×109/l without transfusion for at least 7 days. Otherwise, poor response was&#xD;
      defined.&#xD;
