      The objective of this study is to determine for previously healthy children who present to a&#xD;
      Canadian Emergency Department (ED) with acute gastroenteritis (infection or irritation of the&#xD;
      digestive tract); if compared with placebo, the administration of a probiotic agent&#xD;
      (Lacidofil) will result in a significantly lower proportion of children developing moderate&#xD;
      to severe disease over the subsequent 2 weeks and will not be associated with a significantly&#xD;
      greater occurrence of side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The burden of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) on children and their families continues to be&#xD;
      enormous. It accounts for 1.7 million pediatric emergency department (ED) visits annually in&#xD;
      the United States and nearly 240,000 in Canada. Children often suffer from prolonged and&#xD;
      severe illness; amongst hospitalized Canadian children, 19% have clinical sepsis, 7% seizures&#xD;
      and 4% require intensive care unit admission.3 In a study that we conducted at 11 Canadian&#xD;
      EDs, 51% of children experienced moderate to severe disease. Parents rate such episodes as&#xD;
      being equivalent to a 10 day admission (moderate) and persistent moderate hearing loss&#xD;
      (severe). The burden is augmented by the 50% household transmission rate2, 6 and 42%&#xD;
      prolonged work absenteeism rate. Apart from supportive care, health-care providers have&#xD;
      little to offer to relieve suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics, which are defined as viable microbial preparations that have a beneficial effect&#xD;
      on the health of the host, represent a rapidly expanding field. While they are available as&#xD;
      over-the-counter products, according to the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration has not yet approved a single agent for any health claims. Further, a 2012&#xD;
      meta-analysis concluded that there is limited data to support their indications and no&#xD;
      published pediatric gastroenteritis trials reported on side effects. Thus, understanding the&#xD;
      benefits and side effects of probiotics is crucial before widespread use can be endorsed.&#xD;
      Although probiotic clinical trials have been performed, only one (still unpublished) has been&#xD;
      ED based. Most studies to date have been significantly flawed and guidelines do NOT endorse&#xD;
      their use stating that well-controlled human trials are needed. Consequently, we and others&#xD;
      have found that they are rarely used in clinical practice. Reasons cited include (1)&#xD;
      questionable clinical meaning to the outcomes evaluated thus far; (2) absence of studies in&#xD;
      the appropriate patient population, and (3) a lack of confidence in the quality of probiotic&#xD;
      agents studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address (1) the needs of the medical community, which is aware of the&#xD;
      widening gap between the number of important pediatric and adult trials and (2) the interest&#xD;
      of caregivers in &quot;probiotics&quot; - 71% are aware of the term; 31% believe they may be beneficial&#xD;
      in children with diarrhea, and &gt; 90% would administer a probiotic if it could make their&#xD;
      child better. Furthermore, our pilot study has provided promising preliminary data and has&#xD;
      proven the feasibility of our methods. Thus we are poised to conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT)that will definitively determine if meaningful benefits are derived from probiotic&#xD;
      use and will provide critical information regarding their mechanism of action. This&#xD;
      information will impact on practice, the burden of disease, and ensure that children receive&#xD;
      the best care possible. The results of our proposed RCT will enable guidelines to either&#xD;
      clearly endorse or recommend against the routine use of a probiotic agent in children with&#xD;
      Acute Gastroenteritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also hypothesize that the therapeutic benefits of probiotics in children with AGE vary by&#xD;
      infecting pathogen. We have assembled a team to bridge the gap between the clinical RCT team,&#xD;
      molecular diagnostics, and immunologic to quantify the pathogen-specific effects of&#xD;
      probiotics. The latter is likely because there are distinct mechanisms (e.g. invasive,&#xD;
      inflammatory, non-inflammatory) by which pathogens cause clinical symptoms. Similarly,&#xD;
      probiotic effects are exerted through multiple modes-of-action (e.g. direct antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity, competitive exclusion, immune response stimulation, inhibition of virulence gene or&#xD;
      protein expression). The simultaneous evaluation of pathogen-specific effects on clinical,&#xD;
      microbiological and immunological levels has not previously been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gained through this multi-faceted approach will inform understanding of the&#xD;
      probiotic-host-pathogen interactions that are responsible for improved clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      children with AGE. Our study population, outpatient children, is both the main group of&#xD;
      patients who suffer from AGE as well as the main consumer of probiotics. Thus, our findings&#xD;
      will be relevant and ready for translation into clinical care while simultaneously opening up&#xD;
      avenues for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal questions to be addressed are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: In children aged 3-48 months presenting to an ED with less than 72 hours of AGE&#xD;
      like symptoms, compared with placebo, the administration of a probiotic agent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will result in a significantly lower proportion of children developing moderate to&#xD;
           severe disease over the subsequent 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will not be associated with a significantly greater occurrence of minor side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will be associated with a greater increase in secretory IgA (sIgA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Will have varying effects based on the etiologic pathogen, given the diverse underlying&#xD;
           pathophysiologic processes induced by the causative agents and the multiple mechanisms&#xD;
           of action of probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Question: For previously healthy children, ages 3-48 months, who present to an ED&#xD;
      with less than 72 hours of AGE like symptoms, is the proportion who develop moderate to&#xD;
      severe disease [Modified Vesikari Score (MVS) â‰¥ 9] following ED evaluation, significantly&#xD;
      different in those who receive a probiotic agent (Lacidofil) compared to those who receive&#xD;
      placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Questions: In this group of patients, amongst those receiving active treatment&#xD;
      versus placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a difference in the (a) duration of diarrhea or (b) duration of vomiting?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a difference in the proportion who require an unscheduled health care provider&#xD;
           visit?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a difference in the effectiveness of treatment based on the infecting pathogen?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side Effect Profile:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question: In this group of patients, is the proportion that experiences a side effect (e.g.&#xD;
      bloating, fever, abdominal distention, rash) significantly different in those who receive&#xD;
      Lacidofil compared to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of Action:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question: In this group of patients, are fecal sIgA levels 5 days and 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      initiation of treatment higher in those who receive Lacidofil compared to those who receive&#xD;
      placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiologic - Stool Pathogen-Specific Load:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question: In this group of patients, is there a difference in the pathogen specific reduction&#xD;
      in stool pathogen load in those who receive Lacidofil compared to those who receive placebo?&#xD;
