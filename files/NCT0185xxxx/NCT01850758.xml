  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the improvement in subject-reported&#xD;
      clinical outcomes for Regenexx SD vs. Exercise Therapy treatment of partial and complete,&#xD;
      non-retracted knee ACL ligament tears, from baseline to 3 months, with continued evaluation&#xD;
      of efficacy and durability up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluation of MRI evidence of tendon repair; incidence of&#xD;
      post-operative complications, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical intervention;&#xD;
      change in pain score and use of pain medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, controlled to include 25 subjects treated with Regenexx SD and 25&#xD;
      subjects treated with exercise therapy alone with the exercise group crossing over to the&#xD;
      injection group at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a partial or complete, non-retracted ACL ligament tear as evidenced with&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to Regenexx-SD injection or initiation of&#xD;
      exercise therapy and take part in follow-up visits for two years following treatment. A&#xD;
      preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the&#xD;
      clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted once all subjects reach the 3 month endpoint.&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to be followed through the 2 year endpoint with data analysis&#xD;
      performed at the 1 year and 2 year time points.&#xD;
