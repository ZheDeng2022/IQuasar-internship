      The overall aim of this project is to improve the quality of the handoffs between&#xD;
      hospitalists on the general medicine service at Durham Regional Hospital with the intent of&#xD;
      improving transitions of care. The intervention will be an improved and more structured face&#xD;
      to face sign-out process using a standardized admission sign-out sheet, which is not part of&#xD;
      the official medical record. Daytime admitting physicians will assign an acuity score to&#xD;
      their patients in which the severity of illness will be scored from 1-7, with 7 being the&#xD;
      most sick / likely to have rapid response team (RRT) or adverse event. The assignment of this&#xD;
      score would be based off of the clinician's judgment in the patient's overall assessment. All&#xD;
      patients, age &gt;18 years, admitted to the non-resident hospital medicine general medicine&#xD;
      service at DRH will be study eligible. Data analysis will examine aggregate hospitalist&#xD;
      perception of sign-out practice before and after intervention, total number of RRTs,&#xD;
      unplanned transfers, and rapid responses pre and post intervention, percentage of hospitalist&#xD;
      based patients of overall rapid responses pre and post intervention, percentage of&#xD;
      hospitalists using acuity scores, and average and mean severity score of patients with rapid&#xD;
      responses compared with those admitted. Patients have a risk of loss of confidentiality.&#xD;
