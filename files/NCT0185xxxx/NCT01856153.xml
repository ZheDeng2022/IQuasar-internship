  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to determine if the efficacy of strawberries delivering polyphenols to&#xD;
      prevent metabolic inflammation will be influenced by timing of consumption relative to meal&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to characterize the relative bioavailability and absorption profile of&#xD;
      strawberry polyphenols consumed with meal or at alternatives times around a meal (2 hours&#xD;
      before the meal ad 2 hours after the meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third objective is to determine the bioavailability/absorption profile of strawberry&#xD;
      polyphenols and its relationship with the anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of strawberry&#xD;
      constituents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single blinded, 3 -arm, within-subjects, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      design utilizing a multiple sampling, and repeated measures paradigm to evaluate timing&#xD;
      influence of consumption of strawberry-anthocyanin-associated acute effect on inflammatory&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 18 will be recruited into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit, one pre-study visit, and 3 study visits. The study will take 4-5&#xD;
      weeks per subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject informed consent document and determine&#xD;
      subject eligibility through height and weight measurements, vital signs, blood glucose test&#xD;
      (finger prick), and completion of a survey related to general eating, health, and exercise&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day)&#xD;
      will be instructed at initial screening visit and collected at a pre-study visit to assess&#xD;
      subjects' baseline dietary intake pattern. After reviewing baseline food records, subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to avoid any berry products throughout the study and follow a strictly&#xD;
      limited polyphenolic diet for 3 days prior to the study visit, while maintaining their usual&#xD;
      diet pattern and physical activity. Prior each study visit, a dinner meal will be provided&#xD;
      the day before the study visit to control the second meal effect from the food and beverage&#xD;
      intake of the night before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will arrive at the study visits fasted for at least 10 hours, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After pre-study&#xD;
      procedures (height, weight, waist circumferences, vital sign, and blood glucose measurements)&#xD;
      , a registered nurse will place a catheter in subject's arm for the purpose of multiple blood&#xD;
      sample collections and take the initial blood draw at fasting. Thereafter, blood sample&#xD;
      collection will occur every 1 hour for the next 10 hours. During each study visit, subject&#xD;
      will drink one of 3 drinks at fasting (right after fasting blood draw), 2nd drink with the&#xD;
      breakfast meal (2 hrs after fasting blood draw) and the 3rd drink at 2 hours after the&#xD;
      breakfast meal (4 hrs after fasting blood draw), based on randomization (1&#xD;
      strawberry-containing beverage and 2 identical placebo beverages). The sequences of receiving&#xD;
      the beverage treatments at each visit will be randomized to one of three:&#xD;
      strawberry-placebo-placebo, placebo-strawberry-placebo, or placebo-placebo-strawberry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal female subjects will be studied during the follicular phase of their menstrual&#xD;
      cycle because food intake tends to be more stable during the follicular phase (days 1-13)&#xD;
      than during the luteal phase (days 14-28) when the rise in progesterone levels decrease&#xD;
      satiety often resulting in increased intake.&#xD;
