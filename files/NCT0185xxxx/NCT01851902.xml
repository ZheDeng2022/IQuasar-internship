      The purpose of this study is to determine, through continuous monitoring with a cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring device placed under the skin, the incidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter&#xD;
      (AF). The cardiac monitor will be placed in patients without symptoms but at risk for AF. It&#xD;
      is hoped that this information may assist health care professionals in treatment decisions&#xD;
      related to the early identification of patients at high risk for AF.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (AF) are common cardiac arrhythmias that&#xD;
      confer a substantial stroke burden largely because the vast majority of AF is asymptomatic&#xD;
      and identified after a stroke has occurred. Until recently, only intermittent cardiac&#xD;
      monitors were available, with most AF episodes remaining undetected due to poor sensitivity.&#xD;
      Health care providers estimate the risk of stroke in AF patients using a patient's&#xD;
      comorbidity profile to determine who should be treated with oral anticoagulant therapy for&#xD;
      stroke prevention. The incidence of AF in patients with high stroke risk comorbidities is not&#xD;
      known. The Medtronic Reveal insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) is a continuous monitoring&#xD;
      device with excellent AF detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Study Objectives: The purpose of the PREDATE AF study is to determine the&#xD;
      incidence of AF in asymptomatic patients at high risk for having AF in order to determine&#xD;
      which patient characteristics are most predictive of the development of AF. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the AF incidence rate; secondary objectives include identifying the&#xD;
      most important predictors of AF onset and identifying how physicians respond once AF has been&#xD;
      discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The trial is a prospective, single arm, open-label, single center clinical&#xD;
      study which will enroll up to 360 patients at high risk of having AF based upon their&#xD;
      comorbidity profile, who will then receive an ICM. Enrolled subjects will be followed for a&#xD;
      minimum of 18 months to monitor for the detection of AF. Monthly ICM data transmissions will&#xD;
      be the mechanism of AF detection, and this information will be utilized to determine the AF&#xD;
      incidence rate&#xD;
