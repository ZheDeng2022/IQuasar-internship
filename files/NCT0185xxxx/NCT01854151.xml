  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Variable and poor-quality drug labeling has been cited as a leading cause of medication&#xD;
      errors and adverse drug events, especially in the context of low health literacy. This is a&#xD;
      particularly important issue in pediatrics as more than half of US children are exposed to&#xD;
      one or more outpatient medications in a given week, and studies suggest that over half of&#xD;
      caregivers make errors when dosing liquid medications for children. Our study objective is to&#xD;
      identify evidence-based strategies for labeling and dosing prescription and over-the-counter&#xD;
      pediatric liquid medications in order to promote safe, appropriate use, as well as to inform&#xD;
      state and federal policy standards. We hypothesize that a health literacy-informed labeling&#xD;
      and dosing strategy will result in improved parent ability to administer medications&#xD;
      prescribed to their young children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Administering pediatric medications is frequently a difficult task for parents, in large part&#xD;
      due to reliance on liquid formulations requiring the use of confusing, and often complex,&#xD;
      measurement devices. Use of different units of measurement (milliliter, teaspoon, and/or&#xD;
      tablespoon units) with variations in associated abbreviations, and the variability of&#xD;
      measuring devices (type, markings, capacity), are sources of parent confusion. Low health&#xD;
      literacy is linked to caregiver misunderstanding. Despite high error and utilization rates&#xD;
      for outpatient pediatric medications, research examining strategies to prevent medication&#xD;
      errors have focused largely on adults and on inpatient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to understand pediatric medication instructions is a critical health literacy and&#xD;
      patient safety concern. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration recognized the&#xD;
      importance of this issue and released new guidelines to promote improved labeling and&#xD;
      measuring devices for pediatric liquid medications. While these recommendations are an&#xD;
      essential first step, evidence is needed to support the development of 'best practices' for&#xD;
      designing optimal instructions and devices, especially for parents with limited literacy&#xD;
      and/or limited English proficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study objective is to identify evidence-based 'best practices' for labeling and dosing&#xD;
      prescription and over-the-counter pediatric liquid medications in order to promote safe,&#xD;
      appropriate use. A series of experiments will first be conducted to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      specific dosing and measurement strategies for improving parent understanding and use of&#xD;
      pediatric liquid medications, including examining the impact of milliliter-only label&#xD;
      instructions and devices, as well as the potential role for pictographic dosing diagrams.&#xD;
      Findings will be merged with existing evidence-based health literacy 'best practices' for&#xD;
      medication labeling to develop a comprehensive, patient-centered strategy for the labeling&#xD;
      and dosing of pediatric liquid medications. The effectiveness of the patient-centered&#xD;
      strategy will then be evaluated as part of a randomized controlled trial among English and&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking parents whose children have been newly prescribed oral liquid antibiotics in&#xD;
      a pediatric emergency department setting. Secondary aims of the study include extending the&#xD;
      body of literature on health literacy and pediatric medication use, and generating a policy&#xD;
      road map for achieving and implementing labeling and dosing standards for pediatric liquid&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
