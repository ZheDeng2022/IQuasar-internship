    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and that&#xD;
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the&#xD;
      side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of&#xD;
      cancer. It also means that the FDA has not approved this drug for use patients undergoing&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment for HER2+ breast cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a drug that may&#xD;
      stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in other research studies and&#xD;
      information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent the&#xD;
      recurrence of breast cancer in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of T-DM1 in this research study is experimental, which means it is not approved by&#xD;
      any regulatory authority for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However,&#xD;
      it FDA-approved for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. T-DM1 has caused cancer cells to&#xD;
      die in laboratory studies. In preclinical studies, this drug has prevented or slowed the&#xD;
      growth of breast cancer. The breast cancer treatments (paclitaxel and Trastuzumab) used in&#xD;
      this study are considered part of standard-of-care regimens in early breast cancer. A&#xD;
      standard treatment means that this is a treatment that would be accepted by the majority of&#xD;
      the medical community as a suitable treatment for your type of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if the study drug T-DM1 will&#xD;
      have less side effects than traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment of trastuzumab&#xD;
      and paclitaxel. The investigators are also hoping to learn about the long term benefits and&#xD;
      disease-free survival of participants who take the study drug T-DM1 in comparison to those&#xD;
      participants to take the combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel.&#xD;

      If a participant agrees to participate in this study she will be asked to undergo some&#xD;
      screening tests or procedures to confirm that she is eligible. Many of these tests and&#xD;
      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if turns out&#xD;
      that she does not take part in this research study. If she has had some of these tests or&#xD;
      procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures will&#xD;
      include: a medical history, performance status, assessment of your tumor, blood tests,&#xD;
      cardiac tests, pregnancy test and a collection of tumor tissue. If these tests show that she&#xD;
      is eligible to participate in the research study, she will begin the study treatment. If she&#xD;
      does not meet the eligibility criteria, she will not be able to participate in this research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because no one knows which of the study options is best, the participant will be &quot;randomized&quot;&#xD;
      into one of the study groups after she has had her breast surgery: Group 1 or Group 2.&#xD;
      Randomization means that she is put into a group by chance. Neither the participant nor the&#xD;
      research doctor will choose what group she will be in. The participant will have a one in&#xD;
      three chance of being placed in any group. Approximately 375 study participants will receive&#xD;
      the study drug, while 125 study participants will receive the standard therapy of trastuzumab&#xD;
      and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 participants will receive the study drug T-DM1 every three weeks by IV (intravenous&#xD;
      injection) for 17 treatments (total of 51 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 participants will receive the FDA-approved drugs Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab once per&#xD;
      week by IV for 12 weeks. Then beginning week 13, participants will receive Trastuzumab only&#xD;
      by IV injection every three weeks for the next 13 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all cycles the participant will have a physical exam and tumor assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to keep track of the participant's medical condition for the&#xD;
      next five years after the final dose of study drug. The investigators would like to do this&#xD;
      by regular visits every 6 months for 3 years after completion of study treatment, and then&#xD;
      once a year for the next two years. The investigators may ask for additional follow-up by&#xD;
      phone after completion of these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who undergo lumpectomy (breast conserving surgery) need to receive breast&#xD;
      radiation therapy to participate in this study. Participants who have undergone a mastectomy&#xD;
      may receive chest wall and lymph node radiation (as determined by discussion with their&#xD;
      physician). Radiation Therapy will begin after the conclusion of all study paclitaxel doses,&#xD;
      and after 12 weeks fo the study drug T-DM1.&#xD;
