      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Uveitis is a general term describing a group of inflammatory diseases of the eye. The&#xD;
      causes of uveitis are not fully understood. Researchers want to look at bacteria in the body&#xD;
      that might be related to the inflammation. They will study the natural bacteria present in&#xD;
      the gut and intestines of people with and without uveitis to understand their potential role&#xD;
      in these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the intestinal bacteria in people with and without uveitis or ocular inflammatory&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have uveitis or ocular inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age without uveitis or ocular inflammatory disease to&#xD;
           serve as healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have more than one study visit (approximately 2-4) to assess possible&#xD;
           changes in microbiome composition associated with treatment or disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, participants will have a full eye examination, including vision and eye&#xD;
           pressure tests. They will provide blood samples for testing. Participants will also be&#xD;
           provided a stool collection kit to take home. The samples may be sent or brought back to&#xD;
           the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objective: What precipitates ocular inflammatory episodes remains unknown, but a possible&#xD;
      potentiating factor is the microbiome. The microbiome has become increasingly studied with&#xD;
      the advent of new techniques, but these have not been applied to uveitis. We wish to evaluate&#xD;
      microbiome composition in patients with the ocular inflammatory diseases uveitis who may be&#xD;
      on standard therapy or receiving orally-administered tolerizing antigen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: A total of 200 participants may be enrolled in this study. Of those&#xD;
      participants, the goal is to enroll 50 healthy controls and 150 with various types of&#xD;
      uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is an observational, prospective, single-center study. Participants will receive&#xD;
      a complete ocular examination with clinical testing as determined clinically and will provide&#xD;
      stool and blood samples using a standardized method. Participants may have multiple visits&#xD;
      and may provide multiple samples in order to evaluate changes in microbiota composition with&#xD;
      disease status or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Alterations in bacterial diversity, microbiota composition and changes in&#xD;
      relative abundance of various taxa or species will be analyzed between healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      participants and between various types of uveitis. In addition, comparisons will be made&#xD;
      between these findings and the immunome and metabolome.&#xD;
