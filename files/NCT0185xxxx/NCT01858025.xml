  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study. Pilot studies are conducted to see if it is practical&#xD;
      to do this type of research ona larger scale in the future. The pilot part of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the possibility of using pencil beam proton radiation to treat your type of cancer.&#xD;
      Proton radiation is used for many other types of malignancies, but its use for the treatment&#xD;
      of anal cancer has been limited. The treatment is still being studied as research doctors are&#xD;
      trying to find out more about its use in the treatment of anal cancer. Proton beam radiation&#xD;
      therapy is an FDA approved radiation delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to participate in this study because you have cancer in the anal canal.&#xD;
      Conventional radiation therapy with photons in combination with 5-FU and mitomycin-C is used&#xD;
      as standard treatment for many patients with anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study we are looking at another type of radiation called proton radiation,&#xD;
      which is known to spare surrounding tissue and organs from radiation. Proton radiation&#xD;
      delivers radiation to the area requiring radiation but delivers no dose beyond the region&#xD;
      requiring treatment. There are several techniques that can be used to deliver proton&#xD;
      radiation therapy. One of the newer techniques, called pencil beam scanning, allows for more&#xD;
      accurate delivery of radiation to your tumor and further reduces the amount of normal tissue&#xD;
      exposed to radiation. Most proton patients are treated with a number of beams that study&#xD;
      doctors conform to the shape of your tumor. Pencil beam scanning delivers radiation with a&#xD;
      single, narrow proton beam that is swept over the area of your tumor. This may reduce side&#xD;
      effects that patients would normally experience with conventional radiation therapy or other&#xD;
      means of delivering proton radiation therapy, and also minimizes treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, we are evaluating the effectiveness of using pencil beam proton&#xD;
      radiation delivered to reduce side effects associated with radiation treatment.&#xD;

      If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests&#xD;
      or procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely&#xD;
      to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take&#xD;
      part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they&#xD;
      may or may not have to be repeated. The screening will include the following: a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, biopsy of your tumor, anal and groin exam, archival tumor&#xD;
      tissue, CT or PET-CT, MRI, blood tests and a serum pregnancy test. If these tests show that&#xD;
      you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If&#xD;
      you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton Radiation will be delivered daily for 5-6 weeks, depending on the dose prescribed by&#xD;
      your physician. Treatment is delivered (Monday-Friday) for 5 days (no weekends or holidays).&#xD;
      Each treatment will require that you lie on a table for 25-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive radiation therapy as an outpatient at the Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will start receiving chemotherapy within 5 days of starting radiation treatment. The day&#xD;
      you start chemotherapy will be considered Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive Mitomycin-C on Days 1 and 29 of chemotherapy. Mitomycin-C will be delivered&#xD;
      via IV infusion over a period of 10-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive 5-fluorouracil on Day 1 and 29 of chemotherapy. You will be fitted with an&#xD;
      ambulatory infusion pump that will administer 5-FU via IV infusion continuously over a period&#xD;
      of 96 hours. The infusion pump will be about the size of a paperback book that can fit into a&#xD;
      front-pack or &quot;fanny-pack&quot; around your waist. This pump will be connected to your body. The&#xD;
      nurses in the infusion room will start the pump and disconnect it after 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your 6 and 12 week follow up visits, a physical examination and the tests and procedures&#xD;
      you receive will tell your study doctor whether your disease has gotten better, worse or&#xD;
      stayed the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your cancer has gotten better, you will continue to be monitored at your follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your cancer is suspected to have gotten worse, you will need to have a biopsy to confirm.&#xD;
      If the biopsy is negative, you will need to come back for re-evaluation at 16 weeks (about 4&#xD;
      months) after completing radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the biopsy confirms that your cancer has gotten worse, your doctor will recommend that you&#xD;
      have surgery for the removal of your tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your cancer has stayed the same, your doctor will recommend that you have additional&#xD;
      procedures done to develop a plan for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete radiation therapy, you will be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
