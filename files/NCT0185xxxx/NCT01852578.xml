      The investigators propose to study the single agent activity of Cabazitaxel in a Phase II&#xD;
      trial of subjects with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer pretreated with&#xD;
      docetaxel, given the fact of its significant activity and its acceptable toxicity profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non small cell lung cancer represents the second most common type of cancer in both men and&#xD;
      women in the Western world. The availability of new active regimens in the first line setting&#xD;
      has prompted several investigators to consider second line therapy for patients with advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC, since a substantial percentage of patients maintain a good PS upon recurrence. On the&#xD;
      basis of the results of phase III trials docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib, or pemetrexed are&#xD;
      considered as &quot;standard&quot; choices for second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the increased availability of different drugs, NSCLC remains a devastating&#xD;
      disease with median OS which rarely exceeds 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data of cabazitaxel have demonstrated antitumor activity in models resistant to&#xD;
      paclitaxel and docetaxel. In cell lines resistant to cytotoxic agents, cabazitaxel induced&#xD;
      further tumor regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended phase 2 doses for Cabazitaxle were 20 and 25 mg/m2. Cabazitaxel showed&#xD;
      antitumor activity in solid tumors including docetaxel-refractory metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer and breast cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age&gt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  PS 0-2 (WHO scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (at least&#xD;
             one measurable lesion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented disease progression to previous treatment with docetaxel regimen in 1st or&#xD;
             2nd line setting assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors with at&#xD;
             least one visceral or soft-tissue metastatic lesion.&#xD;

             metastases, is allowed provided that the measurable lesions are outside the radiation&#xD;
             fields. Patients who were irradiated to ≥ 40% of bone marrow are not eligible for the&#xD;
