      physiological and biochemical instability that premature babies are exposed to during&#xD;
      inter-hospital transport.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neonatal intensive care has advanced significantly in recent years resulting in a marked&#xD;
      decrease in mortality, especially in the extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (&lt;1000g).&#xD;
      However, we have not observed a parallel improvement in long term outcomes such as&#xD;
      neurological disability as observed with the EPICure and EPICure 2 data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to explore new avenues in neonatal care that can reduce the long term&#xD;
      neurodevelopment complications of extremely preterm birth. One area that has received little&#xD;
      attention is that of inter-hospital transfer of these preterm babies. In the UK, like other&#xD;
      countries such as USA and Australia, the centralisation of neonatal intensive care in large&#xD;
      tertiary units (NICU's) has resulted in reduced mortality but not significant morbidity. Data&#xD;
      from Australia suggests there is 4-fold increase in death for those ELBW infants transferred&#xD;
      between tertiary neonatal units within the same city (Melbourne). Furthermore, data from the&#xD;
      USA, where 69,000 neonatal transports occur each year, have demonstrated a significant&#xD;
      increase in severe intraventricular haemorrhages (IVH) in transported infants. Severe IVH is&#xD;
      associated with a poor neurological outcome including cerebral palsy. Many of the ELBW&#xD;
      infants are transferred within a few hours of life in order to receive specialist care and&#xD;
      services. However, it is the first few days of life that represent the greatest risk of&#xD;
      developing an IVH with up to 50% developing IVH before 3 days and if severe 75% could go on&#xD;
      to develop cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No causation has been identified for the associated significant increase in risk of IVH and&#xD;
      it is likely to be multifactorial. Such factors could include resuscitation at birth and&#xD;
      early care on the NICU. However, in developed countries some of these factors are likely to&#xD;
      be less important with the establishment of neonatal networks (sharing common practice and&#xD;
      guidelines) and international and national guidelines/training programmes for newborn&#xD;
      resuscitation. This raises the actual transfer of the preterm infant which could represent a&#xD;
      significant stress to the infant. Inter-hospital transfer, usually many miles away from the&#xD;
      birth hospital, is at a time during early life when transition from fetus to newborn is still&#xD;
      occurring and there is often cardiorespiratory instability. The combination of these factors&#xD;
      can increase the risk of neurological injury to the immature developing brain, especially&#xD;
      during the period of greatest risk of IVH. Although IVH is easy to identify and define as a&#xD;
      risk to the long term neurodevelopment of the baby there is also the possibility that more&#xD;
      subtle neurological injury can occur. Such injury may not be detectable from ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging alone but may require novel biochemical markers that can be detected in the bodily&#xD;
      fluids (blood, urine) or by more detailed imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging -&#xD;
      MRI). A recent study has highlighted this with early markers of stress correlating with poor&#xD;
      neurological predictors, such as regional alterations in brain volume (on MRI) and functional&#xD;
      motor deficits, in ex-preterm infants at term corrected gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As more ELBW infants are reaching school age, there are growing concerns surrounding the&#xD;
      increased in incidence of neurodevelopmental problems in these children. Many predict that&#xD;
      such problems may stem from early life exposure to environmental stressors which could&#xD;
      potentially have adverse effects on the infant's physiological and neurological stability.&#xD;
      The presence of these stressors is very much evident during inter-hospital transportation and&#xD;
      on neonatal units where preterm infants are exposed to noise and mechanical vibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On all neonatal units, the characteristic loud noises contributed by alarms, ventilators,&#xD;
      phones and even conversations often exceed the recommended hourly level of 45 decibels on an&#xD;
      A-weighted scale. Excessive noise levels have been shown to increase heart rate in both&#xD;
      preterm and term infants. A maturing biphasic pattern with initial cardiac acceleration and&#xD;
      rebound deceleration has been observed in higher birth weight infants, this which was absent&#xD;
      or milder in ELBW infants. Noise has also been shown to increase blood pressure, increase&#xD;
      respiratory rates, and affect sleep cycles. Decreased autonomic and self-regulatory abilities&#xD;
      make these ELBW infants vulnerable to high noise levels due to their inability to filter and&#xD;
      process noxious stimuli. This could potentially hinder neurodevelopment during such a&#xD;
      critical time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During inter-hospital transfers, infants are continually exposed to prolonged, low-frequency,&#xD;
      high amplitude mechanical vibration. This mechanical vibration has been shown to exceed the&#xD;
      maximum recommended limit (0.31m/s) for adults. In adult humans and experimental animals this&#xD;
      vibration was found to have adverse effects on the cardiovascular function, the nervous&#xD;
      system, the thermoregulatory functions, metabolic and endocrine function, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system. In animal models, short periods of vibration, similar to those&#xD;
      experienced by transported infants, there is a deleterious effect on surfactant and&#xD;
      respiratory function which is again often requiring support in the early part of a preterm&#xD;
      infants life. The implications of vibration may be especially relevant when transporting ELBW&#xD;
      infants as it could compromise the stability and observation of the infant in transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the focus on transport is to ensure the safety of the infant we must also explore&#xD;
      interventions that can increase comfort, reduce physical stress and improve outcomes. No&#xD;
      studies have detailed the combined physical, physiological and biochemical effects of&#xD;
      inter-hospital transfer on these infants and their outcomes. Indeed, many studies have&#xD;
      documented sound exposure and a limited number have documented vibration (albeit of the&#xD;
      transport incubator rather than the baby). None of these studies have addressed this in a&#xD;
      detailed and structured way that will allow us to plan interventional strategies aimed at&#xD;
      reducing these stressors. Until such detailed data is available it is not possible to&#xD;
      undertake trials aimed at reducing the impact of inter-hospital transfer with the aim of&#xD;
      improving outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be the first to examine the physical forces the baby is exposed to&#xD;
      during transfer. We will also combine this with measures of physiological stability (i.e.&#xD;
      monitor vital signs and correlate these with physical stressors) as well as measure key&#xD;
      biochemical markers in the newborn. These biochemical markers include cortisol (a well&#xD;
      described marker of short-term stress)32, copeptin (a marker of newborn stress) and s100b&#xD;
      protein in the urine (a marker of neurological injury). Outcome data will also be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Hypothesis Inter-hospital transfer of the ELBW infant in the&#xD;
      first days of life will adversely impact on measures of neonatal stress in the short-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary aim is to quantify:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) physical stresses experienced by preterm infants during inter-hospital transfer in early&#xD;
      life,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to quantify:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) the physiological and biochemical disruption caused by transfer, (iii) central nervous&#xD;
      system dynamics using advanced computational modelling to ascertain the potential impact on&#xD;
      brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is an observational study that will provide feasibility data for a larger&#xD;
      interventional trial with appropriate sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A. Using infant mannequins we will undertake standard inter-hospital journeys similar&#xD;
      to those currently undertaken by neonatal transport teams. The mannequin will be equipped&#xD;
      with motion detection equipment (accelerometers), positioning devices (GPS) and noise meters.&#xD;
      We will examine a number of interventions aimed at reducing transport associated motion. This&#xD;
      work will allow us to plan future trials aimed at improving transport comfort, safety and&#xD;
      practicality in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B. Establish the motion experienced by neonatal patients during current transport&#xD;
      methods. This element of the study will quantify multi-directional forces experienced by&#xD;
      babies during their transfer. Whilst data is available on vibration of the transport&#xD;
      incubator, no study has quantified the actual effects on the baby and the response of key&#xD;
      physiological observations (e.g. heart rate and oxygen saturation). Data from this element&#xD;
      will capture a range of clinical variables such as gestation, weight and level of support.&#xD;
      This data, along with that gathered in Study C, will allow us to develop a computational&#xD;
      model of the physical stresses experienced and design better transport systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study C. To quantify, correlate and assess the physiological and biochemical disturbance&#xD;
      experienced by preterm infants undergoing inter-hospital transfer. Preterm infants undergoing&#xD;
      inter-hospital transfer will be included in this element.&#xD;
