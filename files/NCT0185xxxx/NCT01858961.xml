      The aim of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of treatment with 600 mg of BID BI&#xD;
      207127 in combination with 120 mg QD Faldaprevir and RBV compared to a Telaprevir-based&#xD;
      regimen along with PegIFN and RBV in chronically infected HCV GT1 treatment naïve patients,&#xD;
      including patients with compensated cirrhosis.&#xD;

               1. positive anti-HCV antibodies or detected HCV RNA at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
                  screening, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. liver biopsy indicating chronic HCV infection, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. history of elevated ALT levels at least 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HCV infection of sub-GT1b confirmed by genotypic testing at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. no prior treatment with any interferon, pegylated interferon, and /or ribavirin&#xD;
                  and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. no prior treatment with at least one dose of any other licensed or&#xD;
                  investigational antiviral agent for acute or chronic hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Availability of a liver biopsy within three years or fibroscan within 6 months prior&#xD;
             to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: patients who do not have a liver biopsy (nor fibroscan) due to contraindication&#xD;
             of the procedure should not be excluded for this reason. The decision on the inclusion&#xD;
             of these patients should be discussed with the CML. Patients with a liver biopsy&#xD;
             performed 3 or more years (or fibroscan performed 6 months or more) prior to&#xD;
             randomisation, demonstrating cirrhosis do not need to repeat a liver biopsy or&#xD;
             fibroscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age 18 - 70 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female patients&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. with documented hysterectomy, or&#xD;

               5. of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and&#xD;
                  on Day 1 (Visit 2), who agree to use two non-hormonal methods of birth control&#xD;
                  from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin. They&#xD;
                  must not breast-feed at any time from the date of screening until 7 months after&#xD;
                  the last dose of ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Accepted methods of contraception for females in this trial are diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide substances, intrauterine devices, cervical caps and condoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Systemic hormonal contraceptives may not be as effective in women taking BI&#xD;
             207127/FDV combination therapy and are not accepted methods of contraception in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  methods of birth control from the date of screening until 7 months after the last&#xD;
                  dose of ribavirin, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. without pregnant female partners. It is in the responsibility of the male patient&#xD;
                  to ensure that his partner (or partners) is not pregnant prior to enrolment into&#xD;
                  the study or becomes pregnant during the treatment and follow-up phase. Female&#xD;
                  partners of childbearing potential must perform monthly pregnancy tests from the&#xD;
                  date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin (tests will be&#xD;
