      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 0.1% formulation of&#xD;
      rapamune cream in children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), ages 3 years and older, who&#xD;
      have facial angiofibromas that would benefit from treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, prospective single center study. Patients that are seen in our&#xD;
      regional Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Clinic and have facial angiofibromas that would benefit&#xD;
      from this cream and who wish to be involved in this study would be enrolled. We anticipate&#xD;
      enrolling 12-15 patients the first year. Patients will have pictures of their facial&#xD;
      angiofibromas taken immediately prior to entry into the study. They will then be prescribed&#xD;
      0.1% rapamune topical formulation to apply twice daily to their skin for the first two weeks&#xD;
      and then once daily. If level is above 0, will re-check serum lipids, cbc, and repeat levels&#xD;
      every three-four months and monitor the patient for symptoms. Patients will return at one&#xD;
      month and three months to obtain serum rapamune levels along with pictures, then they will be&#xD;
      seen intermittently throughout the first year with photographs of their face taken at the one&#xD;
      month visit, 3 month visit, six month visit and twelve month visit. We will ask the parents&#xD;
      about any side effects from the medication during the entire time patients are using the&#xD;
      topical rapamune. We will monitor the facial lesions as well. We will assess for skin&#xD;
      sensitivity, pain, erythema, or pruritus. If skin irritation results from the drug, then we&#xD;
      will stop use of the drug. Parents will sign an informed consent allowing their child's&#xD;
      picture to be taken and allowing us to summarize the data for publication at the end of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first study using a consistent formulation to make a 0.1% rapamune&#xD;
      cream, and this will be performed under the direction of myself and Dr. Almoazen in the&#xD;
      University of Tennessee Health Science Center(UTHSC) College of Pharmacy compounding&#xD;
      laboratory. Only patients who are thought to be reliable for the follow up visits and to use&#xD;
      the cream appropriately will be enrolled in the study. This study meets the FDA criteria for&#xD;
      an Investigational New Drug(IND) exemption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse events noted in the package insert for rapamune cream are all based on systemic&#xD;
      administration of the medication, primarily to adults with other diseases. In our clinical&#xD;
      experience, with topical use there is no absorption and we have not noted any side effects.&#xD;
