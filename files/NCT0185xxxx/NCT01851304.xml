  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A diet high in easily obtained energy-dense foods leads to the problems of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity common in the developed world. Foods enriched with fiber or bitter compounds may&#xD;
      increase satiety and decrease energy intake. This intervention will measure the effectiveness&#xD;
      of coffee melanoidins, bread melanoidins, beta-glucans, and a Gentiana lutea L. extract in&#xD;
      both a free or encapsulated form to decrease energy intake and modify the physiological&#xD;
      markers of satiety in the short term. In particular bread (fiber) and a pudding (Gentiana&#xD;
      lutea L. extract) will be used as tasty food matrices in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are health problems of utmost importance to the world population. The&#xD;
      continuous development and consumption of high-energy foods at a low cost is correlated with&#xD;
      an increased risk of diabetes and insulin resistance in addition to weight gain. To maintain&#xD;
      body weight, a balance between energy intake and energy expenditure must be obtained. Since&#xD;
      weight gain is a common outcome with an energy-dense diet, the best approach to reduce&#xD;
      caloric intake is through the consumption of fruits and vegetables. However, this approach is&#xD;
      usually unsatisfactory in the long-term as the loss of tasty food and the low reward of&#xD;
      healthy meals often undermines the nutritionally prudent diet. A possible alternative&#xD;
      approach is to produce tasty foods with low caloric density and satiety-inducing compounds&#xD;
      that can reduce caloric intake and increase the sensation of satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human body regulates energy intake through a complex and interconnected biological system&#xD;
      involving gut-brain axis, the endocannabinoid system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal&#xD;
      axis. Biomarkers in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulate food intake and the&#xD;
      physiological response to stress. In the absence of food, the brain senses hunger through the&#xD;
      elevation of the gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin. Once food is ingested, ghrelin levels&#xD;
      decrease while other biomarkers in the gut-brain axis are released to increase feelings of&#xD;
      satiety through the delay of gastric emptying, decrease in appetite and the decrease in food&#xD;
      intake. Recent studies in mice have linked the endocannabinoid system with the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through physiological stress and energy homeostasis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are both elevated&#xD;
      during hunger but decrease after feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural foods with low energy density, such as fruits and vegetables, usually contain a high&#xD;
      amount of dietary fiber. Dietary fiber is classified as either soluble fiber (beta-glucans)&#xD;
      or insoluble fiber (wheat bran) but both soluble and insoluble fiber have been strongly&#xD;
      linked to increased satiety sensation. Dietary fiber is important for a properly functioning&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract by providing a nutrient source for bacteria in the large intestine.&#xD;
      When a 3% portion of barley beta-glucans were added to a fruit drink or to bread and consumed&#xD;
      at breakfast, a reduction in energy intake of 30% over 24 hours was observed along with&#xD;
      beneficial changes in post-prandial gastrointestinal hormones involved in the biological&#xD;
      control of hunger and satiety. Intake of insoluble fiber improves insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      enriched barley fiber bread or wheat fiber bread improved ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY)&#xD;
      hormone response compared to control bread. A recently characterized class of food compounds,&#xD;
      melanoidins, have been found to exhibit similar properties to dietary fiber in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. Melanoidins are formed by the Maillard reaction process through the&#xD;
      reaction of proteins with reduced carbohydrates and sugars during the cooking of heat-treated&#xD;
      foods. Melanoidins are large insoluble or partially insoluble complexes that are present in&#xD;
      coffee, bread, cocoa, and beer. However, the main sources of melanoidins in the diet are from&#xD;
      coffee and bread with a contribution of 0.5-2.0 g/day of coffee melanoidins and 1.8-15 g/day&#xD;
      of bread melanoidins. Research has shown that coffee melanoidins are fermented in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract while bread melanoidins stimulate bifidobacteria in the large&#xD;
      intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bitter compounds have also been recently implicated in increasing satiety and having a&#xD;
      beneficial effect on gastrointestinal tract hormones. Recent research in animals indicates&#xD;
      that several bitter compounds can reduce the rate of gastric emptying, induce the secretion&#xD;
      of satiety-inducing hormones cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and&#xD;
      decrease food intake. However, the animal experiments required the bitter compounds to be&#xD;
      delivered directly to the stomach for action. A few bitter tasting vegetables, including&#xD;
      broccoli and chicory, show beneficial health effects. Some natural phytochemicals are&#xD;
      polyphenols known to possess different biological mechanisms and to have a bitter taste. The&#xD;
      plant species Gentiana lutea L. produces several biologically active bitter phytochemicals,&#xD;
      including the iridoid (loganic acid) and the secoiridoids (swertiamarin, gentiopicroside,&#xD;
      amarogentin, sweroside). Gentiana lutea L. is used most often for the production of herbal&#xD;
      teas and liqueurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, crossover trial, the hunger and satiety feelings will be measured while&#xD;
      blood will be collected at specific time points during the seven arms. Since this&#xD;
      intervention is to develop tasty foods that both increase satiety and decrease energy intake&#xD;
      in the short term, the bitter compounds will also be encapsulated in a protective coating.&#xD;
      Encapsulation is commonly used to protect pharmaceuticals during passage through the oral&#xD;
      cavity or stomach to enable the active compounds to be properly absorbed in the body. The&#xD;
      coating used in one arm will allow the Gentiana lutea L. extract to pass through the oral&#xD;
      cavity, allowing the volunteers to not taste the bitter compounds, for target in the stomach&#xD;
      and duodenum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will participate in the seven arms of the study. Three different&#xD;
      fiber-enriched breads and a control bread will be consumed in addition to skim milk at&#xD;
      breakfast in four interventions. In the other three interventions, participants will consume&#xD;
      a control pudding, Gentiana lutea L. extract pudding and the encapsulated Gentiana lutea L.&#xD;
      extract pudding. A one-week washout period will be included between two separate&#xD;
      interventions. The hedonic feelings of satiety, hunger, and appetite will be measured with a&#xD;
      questionnaire at time 0 (baseline) and at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours after breakfast. After 3&#xD;
      hours, the volunteers will consume lunch until they are satiated and then keep a food diary&#xD;
      to record their intake throughout the rest of the day. In addition, blood will be collected&#xD;
      at each time point and the amount of the specific hormones, neuropeptides, and&#xD;
      endocannabinoids will be measured as part of the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
