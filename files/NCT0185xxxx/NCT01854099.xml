    <textblock>
      Eligible adult patients with new diagnosis of gliobastoma are enrolled to receive 3 weekly&#xD;
      vaccinations of the study drug PEP-CMV 1-3 days following standard of care chemoradiation.&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomized to one of three arms: 1). standard temozolomide&#xD;
      (TMZ)(200mg/m^2 for 5 days) with vaccine on day 6-8 of each monthly TMZ cycle. 2). standard&#xD;
      TMZ (200mg/m^2 for 5 days) with vaccine on day 22-24 of each monthly TMZ cycle. 3).&#xD;
      dose-intensified TMZ (100 mg./m^2 for 21 days) with vaccine on day 22-24 of each monthly&#xD;
      cycle. All vaccines will be given intradermally (i.d.) and will be given with monthly TMZ&#xD;
      cycles and continue after TMZ cycles until progression or death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be screened and enrolled prior to completion of post-surgical&#xD;
      chemoradiation. Final eligibility to remain on study for safety endpoint will occur after&#xD;
      completion of chemoradiation and prior to initiation of adjuvant TMZ regimen. Immediately&#xD;
      post-chemoradiation and prior to initiation of cycle 1 of adjuvant TMZ, all patients will&#xD;
      receive 500 µg of PEP-CMV vaccine weekly for a total of 3 vaccines starting 1-3 days after&#xD;
      chemoradiation is complete. Prior to initiation of TMZ cycle 1, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of three arms (1:1:1) to receive (1) standard TMZ (200 mg/m^2/day x 5 days) with&#xD;
      vaccination on Day 6-8 of each monthly TMZ cycle, (2) standard TMZ (200 mg/m^2/day x 5 days)&#xD;
      with vaccination on Day 22-24 of each monthly TMZ cycle, or (3) dose-intensified TMZ (100&#xD;
      mg/m^2/day x 21 days) with vaccination on day 22-24 of each monthly TMZ cycle. Each cohort&#xD;
      will have 20 patients. Up to 150 patients will be consented in order to obtain 60 evaluable&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety assessment for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be determined one week&#xD;
      after the third weekly vaccine. A DLT will be defined as any irreversible Grade 3 toxicity,&#xD;
      any Grade 4 toxicity, or any life threatening-event not attributable to concomitant&#xD;
      medication, co-morbid event, or disease progression. Initially 6 patients will be accrued to&#xD;
      the study (2 per arm) after which accrual will be suspended to review the toxicity&#xD;
      experienced by these patients during the first 3 weekly vaccinations. If 0 or 1 of these&#xD;
      patients experience DLT, accrual of the remaining patients will commence. Otherwise,&#xD;
      modifications of the protocol will be considered before accruing additional patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of DLT occurring during the initial 3 weekly vaccinations or the vaccinations&#xD;
      administered concurrently with temozolomide will be continuously monitored. If more than 25%&#xD;
      of accrued patients experience DLT, then accrual will be suspended and reported toxicity will&#xD;
      be carefully reviewed to determine if modifications to the protocol treatment should occur.&#xD;
      Peptide vaccinations employing GM-CSF and Montanide ISA-51 as adjuvants have generally been&#xD;
      well tolerated in human patients in numerous phase I-III trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan: One week after the 3rd weekly vaccination, cycles of TMZ will begin. The&#xD;
      start of all subsequent cycles will be scheduled every 4 weeks after the first daily dose of&#xD;
      the preceding cycle. During monthly TMZ cycles, vaccinations will occur on day 6-8 or day&#xD;
      22-24 of each cycle, depending on randomization arm. All vaccines will be given i.d.&#xD;
      approximately 10cm below the inguinal ligament bilaterally. A target of six cycles with&#xD;
      maximum of twelve cycles of TMZ may be given if the patient demonstrates continued&#xD;
      improvement on MRI scan, decreased corticosteroid requirement, improvement in performance&#xD;
      status, or improvement in neurologic function at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      neuro-oncologist. Vaccines will continue monthly after TMZ cycles until tumor progression or&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be imaged with contrast-enhanced MRI pre &amp; post-surgical resection (prior to&#xD;
      initiation of chemoradiation), post-chemoradiation and prior to TMZ cycle 1, prior to TMZ&#xD;
      cycle 4, 7 (if administered), and 10 (if administered). MRI imaging every 3 months during&#xD;
      post-chemoradiation is preferable, but every 2 months is allowed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating neuro-oncologist. MRI imaging will be conducted every 3 months after completion of&#xD;
      TMZ for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter, or at frequency indicated by clinical&#xD;
      presentation. The modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria will be used&#xD;
      for assessment of pseudoprogression and patients demonstrating definitive progression will be&#xD;
      removed from study. Any patient removed for definitive tumor progression prior to receiving&#xD;
      third vaccine and post vaccination immune monitoring blood draw will be replaced for safety&#xD;
      and immunologic endpoints. Clinical endpoint comparisons will be made amongst patients&#xD;
      successfully randomized to adjuvant TMZ treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for immune monitoring will be obtained prior to vaccines 1-4, 7 and 13, and at tumor&#xD;
      progression. Patients seen by the Duke neuro-oncology team between these vaccine visits may&#xD;
      have blood drawn for immune monitoring at the discretion of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure, consent will be&#xD;
      obtained separately. Patients that have this procedure done here at Duke University Health&#xD;
      System, may be approached to participate in the Duke Brain Tumor Center Biorepository study.&#xD;
      Tissue obtained from patients who consented to the Duke Brain Tumor Center Biorepository will&#xD;
      be used to assess immunologic cell infiltration, antigen expression, and biomarkers for&#xD;
      immunologic response.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the optimal &amp; safe peptide vaccination regimen with TMZ through dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) measurements. The primary safety assessment for DLT will be determined 1 week after the 3rd weekly vaccine. A DLT will be defined as any irreversible Grade 3 toxicity, any Grade 4 toxicity, or any life threatening-event not attributable to concomitant medication, co-morbid event, or disease progression. Initially 6 patients will be accrued to the study (2 per arm) after which accrual will be suspended to review the toxicity experienced by these patients during the first 3 weekly vaccinations. If 0 or 1 of these patients experience DLT, accrual of the remaining patients will commence. Otherwise, modifications of the protocol will be considered before accruing additional patients.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not&#xD;
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is&#xD;
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly&#xD;
             teratogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women, due to possible adverse effects on the developing fetus&#xD;
             or infant due to study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allergic reaction to temozolomide or Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated on any other therapeutic clinical protocols within 30 days prior to&#xD;
