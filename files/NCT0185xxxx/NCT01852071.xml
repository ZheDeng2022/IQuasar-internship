  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous transplantation of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+ cells) from the bone marrow (BM) of ADA-deficient SCID&#xD;
      infants and children following human ADA cDNA transfer by the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector. The&#xD;
      level of gene transfer in blood cells and immune function will be measured as endpoints.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is open to twenty (20) infants and children diagnosed with ADA-deficient SCID who&#xD;
      did not have a medically eligible, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor for&#xD;
      bone marrow transplantation. The EFS-ADA lentiviral vector with the human ADA cDNA will be&#xD;
      used to transduce autologous CD34+ cells from the bone marrow of these subjects. The subjects&#xD;
      will receive 4 mg/kg busulfan prior to re-infusion of their gene-modified cells. Safety is&#xD;
      the primary endpoint. During the follow-up phase, the investigators aim to determine whether&#xD;
      the cells could engraft and produce mature cells that contain and express the corrected ADA&#xD;
      gene in the absence of pegademase bovine (PEG-ADA) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which&#xD;
      will be withheld at Day +30 following transplant. Efficacy studies to evaluate the level of&#xD;
      immune reconstitution, will be performed in the first and second years of the study.&#xD;
