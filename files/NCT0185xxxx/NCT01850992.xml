      The purpose of this study is to identify the mechanism(s) by which OSA exacerbates the&#xD;
      age-linked decline in systemic testosterone concentrations by conducting a randomized order&#xD;
      sham-controlled crossover study that dynamically evaluates the entire hypothalamic-pituitary&#xD;
      testicular axis across a wide age range.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Hypothesis 1: Reduced hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) outflow in&#xD;
           older men underlies the reduced mass of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses, and is further&#xD;
           reduced in men with untreated OSA. The investigator aim to test hypothalamic function by&#xD;
           examining the decrement of pulsatile LH secretion to a submaximally inhibitory dose of a&#xD;
           selective GnRH-receptor antagonist, ganirelix, in men with untreated (i.e. active) and&#xD;
           treated OSA. This decrement will be regressed on age, and a significant reduction in&#xD;
           slope with active OSA (vs treated OSA) indicates disease attenuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Untreated OSA further attenuates the age-related erosion of testosterone's&#xD;
           negative-feedback control of LH. The investigators aim to assess pituitary function by&#xD;
           quantitating LH secretion under enforced androgen deprivation, in men with active and&#xD;
           treated OSA. Slopes obtained by age regressions will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: Impaired Leydig-cell steroidogenesis causes hypoandrogenemia in older men,&#xD;
           but the effect of untreated OSA in humans is entirely unknown. Hence the investigators&#xD;
           aim to assess testicular function by examining testosterone secretion during&#xD;
           experimentally controlled pulsatile i.v. infusion of recombinant human LH under maximal&#xD;
           GnRH-receptor blockade, in men with active and treated CPAP. Slopes will again be&#xD;
           compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly the immediate goal is to characterize all four of hypothalamic, pituitary,&#xD;
      testicular and feedback-dependent control of LH and testosterone secretion to determine which&#xD;
      primary mechanism(s) occur(s) and drive(s) alterations at the other loci, in any given&#xD;
      subject. To meet this challenge, the investigators will implement an innovative comprehensive&#xD;
      analytical platform, that correctly embodies time-lagged, dose-dependent and nonlinear&#xD;
      signaling among GnRH, LH and testosterone. To ensure the necessary age continuum, volunteers&#xD;
      whose ages span 30-70 years will be study with 3-4 men per decade of life (16 men in total).&#xD;
      To assess disease effects, the investigators will compare age regressions between men with&#xD;
      active OSA (on sham therapy) against these same men being treated with real CPAP, and if&#xD;
      feasible, with a convenient sample of 16 other individually age- and BMI- matched (±2.5 years&#xD;
      and ±2.5 kg/m2) normal controls that will be selected from a larger cohort of 100 men being&#xD;
      identified in Rochester -Minnesota (MN). The within subject cross-over design controls for&#xD;
      possible known and unknown confounders, however BMI will be also restricted and exclude men&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus (by HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subject Recruitment: 16 men with OSA will be recruited aged 30-70 years, using the same&#xD;
      entry criteria and age range utilized to generate our preliminary data 42. Additionally, body&#xD;
      mass index will be restricted to 30-35 kg/m2. Volunteers will be recruited from clinics at&#xD;
      University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) -affiliated medical centers at Harbor and Santa&#xD;
      Monica and by advertisement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized sham-controlled cross-over trial, each period of 3 months duration&#xD;
      and with one month washout. This design replicates a recently completed study. Another&#xD;
      comparable study recently completed in California (and elsewhere in the USA) involved 6&#xD;
      months sham treatment, and many of the 1105 adults recruited had severe OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic Testing of the Male Gonadal Axis: Enrolled subjects undergo repetitive sampling of&#xD;
      peripheral blood (1.5 mL) every 10-min for 5 hr from 0800-1300 h [2 outpatient protocols],&#xD;
      for 15 hr overnight (2200 - 1300h) and for 22 hr overnight (1500 - 1300h). Polysomnography&#xD;
      (2200-0600h) is performed during the 2 inpatient visits. A terminal i.v. bolus injection of&#xD;
      GnRH (100 ng/kg) is given at 1100h during all 4 visits to calibrate endogenous GnRH response.&#xD;
      Ganirelix (or saline) is given at 2000h or 1500h: hypothalamic function is tested by partial&#xD;
      (submaximal) ganirelix blockade of endogenous GnRH. Oral medications (Δ) are placebo except&#xD;
      during pituitary testing when response of LH to androgen depletion is enforced by&#xD;
      ketoconazole (KTCZ) with adrenal rescue with dexamethasone (DEX). Here, KTCZ (1000mg) and DEX&#xD;
      (0.75mg) are given at 2000h, KTCZ (400mg) at 0800h and DEX (0.75mg) at 1300h. Testis function&#xD;
      is assessed by testosterone response to a fixed exogenous LH stimulus: 6 pulses of rh LH&#xD;
      (18.75 IU each) every 2 hrs. from 2300h under maximal ganirelix blockade of endogenous LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The effect of age and disease on each mechanistic outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed by constructing a repeated measures mixed model which includes OSA (treated versus&#xD;
      untreated), age and the OSA*age interaction. The statistical significance of the interaction&#xD;
      term indicates whether the disease process (OSA) alters the age related decline in these&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e. assesses difference in the slopes under the two conditions). The&#xD;
      within-subject design should reduce variance and increase power. Assuming that a suitable&#xD;
      convenient control group can be assembled in Rochester MN, the investigators will&#xD;
      additionally construct between-subject mixed models where the disease effect will be&#xD;
      untreated OSA versus normal controls, and the treatment effect will compare treated OSA&#xD;
      versus normal controls. The former will affirm disease effects and the latter whether&#xD;
      treatment for 3 months with CPAP fully reverses deficits to normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis: Preliminary data suggest that untreated OSA attenuates testosterone feedback,&#xD;
      resulting in impaired unleashing of LH pulse. Under ketoconazole castration, the correlation&#xD;
      between LH pulse frequency and age in normal men is -0.50. A sample size of 16 men has 80%&#xD;
      power with two-tailed á=0.05 to detect an attenuation of this correlation by 1.00. By way of&#xD;
      comparison, the investigators observed a one-third greater attenuation of correlation of&#xD;
      1.35. Hence, power is adequate. This estimate is conservative since the within-subject study&#xD;
      design, which reduces variability, was not incorporated and the ketoconazole-induced&#xD;
      testosterone depletion paradigm to assess pituitary function should further sharpen age&#xD;
      regressions as the variability of each individual's blood testosterone concentration is&#xD;
      reduced. The latter has been verified in normal men, and should also be true in men with OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: To appraise GnRH outflow (Aim 1), the response variable is the ganirelix-suppressed&#xD;
      (analytically reconstructed) basal LH secretion. To assess gonadotrope responsiveness, the&#xD;
      pertinent end point is the mass of LH secreted following the exogenous GnRH stimulus. The&#xD;
      degree of feedback unleashing is inferred by the degree of elevation of LH pulse frequency&#xD;
      elicited by androgen withdrawal (Aim 2). And, Leydig-cell sensitivity is defined by&#xD;
      analytical reconstruction of rate of testosterone secretion achieved in response to the last&#xD;
      two of six (pseudosteady-state) pulses of recombinant human LH (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcomes: GnRH outflow will be reconstructed and simultaneously calculate hypothalamic&#xD;
      and pituitary testosterone feedback, as previously described. These data can be analyzed by&#xD;
      mixed model as described in statistical analysis (before). Pulsatile LH secretion aligns with&#xD;
      slow wave sleep at the onset of puberty, implicating sleep architecture in the timing of&#xD;
      puberty. The investigators will perform the same analysis described, by comparing (by&#xD;
      Student's t-test) the proportion of LH pulses that occur during slow wave versus non-slow&#xD;
      wave sleep, normalized for the amount of time spent in each sleep stage. The final additional&#xD;
      outcome will be to examine total testosterone secretion overnight during the control&#xD;
      condition in the first phase of the study, separately and after combining with findings from&#xD;
      the original 18 men described in preliminary data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated and Alternate Results: It is expected to be showed that OSA impairs testosterone&#xD;
      feedback (i.e. pituitary dysfunction), specifically that androgen depletion (Aim 2), will&#xD;
      increase LH pulse frequency and reduce basal LH secretion. Although It is postulated that&#xD;
      reduced basal LH secretion is due to attenuated testosterone feedback at the pituitary, an&#xD;
      unexpected but plausible alternate finding would be that altered GnRH outflow is responsible&#xD;
      - which It is assessed in Aim 1 by graded GnRH receptor blockade. Additionally, due to recent&#xD;
      analytical innovations, the investigators can also reconstruct hypothalamic versus pituitary&#xD;
      feedback effects of testosterone (Aim 2) whilst simultaneously assessing GnRH outflow (Aim&#xD;
      1). This is particularly pertinent since preliminary data of brain permeant versus brain&#xD;
      impermeant androgen receptor blockade suggests specific brain effects. Specific brain effects&#xD;
      are plausible because the intermittent hypoxia of OSA is already known to alter&#xD;
      neurocognition. Another inexplicable finding is that the relative reduction in LH with OSA&#xD;
      seems to be greater than the corresponding fall in testosterone, which might suggest&#xD;
      relatively enhanced Leydig cell responsiveness. Indeed, intermittent hypoxia increases&#xD;
      testosterone production from primary rat Leydig cell cultures in response to human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotropin (hCG), but the effect of OSA on testicular steroidogenesis in humans is not&#xD;
      known. Aim 3 will address this possibility for the first time using a physiological rh LH&#xD;
      probe. Testosterone secretion is expected to increase with CPAP. If it does not, in the&#xD;
      presence of preserved or enhanced Leydig cell responsiveness to rh LH (Aim 3), then this&#xD;
      would motivate a future longer duration study of CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Problems and Alternate Strategies: the investigators do not anticipate recruitment&#xD;
      problems since our study requires enrolling a single individual each month for 16 months,&#xD;
      however recruitment could be broadened to the Westwood and other UCLA-affiliated clinics, if&#xD;
      needed. If the cross-over design proves problematic, then the investigators can convert to a&#xD;
      3 month parallel group study of 32 men without loss of power. The study includes a run-in&#xD;
      period wherein CPAP compliance will be monitored by direct CPAP machine download and subjects&#xD;
      excluded if non-compliant, since intensive endocrine testing is not performed until after 3&#xD;
      months of established therapy. Our study is not dependent upon being able to include a&#xD;
      convenient control group where each control is within ±2.5 years and ±2.5 kg/m2 of each case.&#xD;
      Finding 16 controls from the 100 men aged 18-80 years, with BMI of 18-35 kg/m2 and without&#xD;
      significant illnesses (including diabetes mellitus) being identified should be possible. If&#xD;
      not, the investigators will loosen the matching criteria (by doubling intervals to ±5.0 years&#xD;
      or kg/m2), and simultaneously match 2 controls for every case. A further problem might be if&#xD;
      LH and testosterone assays are not aligned, however the investigators will test this directly&#xD;
      by assaying a single pooled sample from each individual (16 men in total) for testosterone by&#xD;
      tandem mass spectroscopy and for LH by immunoassay and against external standards to ensure&#xD;
      comparability.&#xD;
