      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled in 1:1 ratio to receive ixazomib or placebo in addition to the background therapy of Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (LenDex) in this study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Placebo + LenDex</title>
          <description>Participants received ixazomib 4.0 mg placebo matching capsule single oral dose on Days 1, 8 and 15 along with standard regimen of LenDex (lenalidomide 25 mg capsules orally on Days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg tablets orally on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) for the first 18 cycles (each cycle was of 28 days). Following Cycle 18, participants received 3.0 mg ixazomib matching placebo capsule as single oral dose on Days 1, 8 and 15 along with lenalidomide 10 mg capsules orally on Days 1-21 in each 28-day cycle until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first up to data cut-off date 2 December 2019.</description>

      <desc>Safety population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of any drug. 4 participants who were randomized to the placebo received ixazomib during the study and were included in the ixazomib arm for the safety population. 1 participant randomized to each arm withdrew from the study and were not included in the safety population. Data for safety is summarized as per the duration of exposure to study treatment (exposure up to 18 cycles; exposure ≥19 cycles).</desc>
