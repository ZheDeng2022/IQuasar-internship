  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess: the incidence of abnormal partial thromboplastin time in&#xD;
      patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 U 2 times a day versus 3 times a day 72&#xD;
      hours after administration of the first dose of heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The basic hypothesis of this study is that patients receiving UFH 5000 U&#xD;
      subcutaneously 3 times a day will have a higher proportion of elevated partial thromboplastin&#xD;
      time than patients receiving UFH 5000 U subcutaneously twice a day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Administration of subcutaneous UFH for antithrombotic prophylaxis is standard therapy in the&#xD;
      postoperative setting. Often, a dosage of 5000 U twice a day has been used, with a&#xD;
      demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and an acceptable hemorrhagic complication profile.&#xD;
      However, recent surgery guidelines regarding antithrombotic prophylaxis with UFH 5000 U&#xD;
      suggest that a thrice daily regimen should be used following major oncologic surgeries. These&#xD;
      new guidelines have raised some concerns in anesthesiology, particularly regarding the safety&#xD;
      of epidural catheters combined with thrice daily heparin. Optimal analgesia during the early&#xD;
      postoperative period following some types of major oncologic surgery involves the placement&#xD;
      of epidural catheters. Epidural analgesia provides the best relief of the significant pain&#xD;
      which may be present after thoracotomy or supraumbilical laparotomy during the early&#xD;
      postoperative period, improving ambulation, coughing, pulmonary function, bowel function as&#xD;
      well as short and long-term quality of life. However, the benefits of epidural catheters must&#xD;
      outweigh the risk of complications, the most feared being spinal hematoma. Recent guidelines&#xD;
      in anesthesiology support the placement of epidural catheters with the concomitant&#xD;
      administration of UFH 5000 U two times a day. However, these guidelines do not clearly&#xD;
      support the placement of an epidural catheter if a three times a day regimen is used, very&#xD;
      little data being available to assess the risk of this practice. Older studies (1973) suggest&#xD;
      that a significant proportion of patients (15%) will develop abnormal partial thromboplastin&#xD;
      times using a three times a day regimen. However, it is not known if these results are still&#xD;
      consistent with more recent laboratory technologies, or how they compare to twice daily&#xD;
      heparin. In the absence of even basic data regarding systemic effect on coagulation, it is&#xD;
      difficult at this time to begin to determine safe practice regarding the placement of an&#xD;
      epidural catheter in presence of a three times a day UFH 5000 U regimen. A recent pilot study&#xD;
      conducted in our center showed that 20% (4/20) of patients receiving the thrice daily regimen&#xD;
      will develop abnormal partial thromboplastin times at 72 hours following the first dose&#xD;
      compared to 5% (1/20) in patients receiving the twice a day regimen. This larger scale study&#xD;
      is designed to establish the incidence of abnormalities in partial thromboplastin times 72&#xD;
      hours following the administration of the first dose of heparin for both regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 130 patients will be enrolled and divided in two equal groups (Group 1: to receive&#xD;
      UFH 5000 U subcutaneous two times a day or Group 2: to receive UFH 5000 U subcutaneous three&#xD;
      times a day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As needed for standard anesthesia, surgical and post-operative care, an arterial line will be&#xD;
      placed. Immediately prior the first UFH dose, a blood sample for partial thromboplastin time&#xD;
      will collected through the arterial line. Since nutritional status may affect the patient's&#xD;
      coagulation a blood sample to measure albumin and transthyretin will be collected&#xD;
      simultaneously. The first dose of UFH will be given in the operating room by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second blood sample will be collected by venipuncture at 72 hours following the&#xD;
      administration of the first dose of heparin.&#xD;
