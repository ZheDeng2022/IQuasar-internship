    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about the best way to treat pilonidal cyst wounds and&#xD;
      learn which type of bandage (or dressing) can help the wound heal faster after having&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      This pilot study is a prospective randomized open-label study examining the efficacy of&#xD;
      Drawtex® Hydroconductive wound dressing and negative pressure wound therapy(NPWT) in&#xD;
      pilonidal cystectomy wound healing by secondary intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilonidal disease has a significant impact on the active duty demographic and the treatments&#xD;
      for this disease result in a substantial cost to the military in both duty days lost and for&#xD;
      the medical care provided. This study examines Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) and the&#xD;
      Drawtex® Hydroconductive Dressing for the treatment of surgical wounds resulting from limited&#xD;
      excision of pilonidal disease. This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized open label&#xD;
      examination of two standard wound therapy modalities with the goal of determining which&#xD;
      treatment promotes the most rapid wound healing by secondary intention. Secondary goals&#xD;
      include determining which treatment is most cost effective and is most acceptable to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active duty, retired, and dependent adults (age 18-60 years) who are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      limited surgical cyst excision will be recruited from patients who are referred to the&#xD;
      General Surgery Department at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). Health&#xD;
      care providers in the General Surgery Department will be informed about the study and&#xD;
      requested to refer appropriate patients to the study Investigators for evaluation and&#xD;
      potential inclusion in the study. The informed consent process will occur at WRNMMC, General&#xD;
      Surgery Clinic during the pre-operative clinic visit(s). If the patient consents to screening&#xD;
      for inclusion in the study, then they will be assigned a subject number and randomly assigned&#xD;
      to a study arm, either NPWT or Drawtex®, preoperatively. The subject will then undergo a&#xD;
      limited excision of the pilonidal cyst. If the resulting wound post-surgery meets enrollment&#xD;
      criteria, then the subject will be enrolled in the study. At this point, the randomization&#xD;
      arm will be revealed either NPWT or Drawtex® dressing. Wound care will be done at the wound&#xD;
      care clinic two times a week (biweekly) for approximately 4 weeks or until there is 75%&#xD;
      epithelialization, and then on a weekly and then on a monthly basis until 100%&#xD;
      epithelialization of the wound or 270 days of follow up are reached. Wound healing progress&#xD;
      will be evaluated objectively using a digital planimetry analysis system and blinded&#xD;
      evaluators. Secondary objectives include adverse events, bacterial load, expression of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, cost to military and patient satisfaction assessments,&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy adult male or non-lactating female age 18 to 60 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of pilonidal disease with cyst requiring surgery, with undermining to remove&#xD;
             the cyst and requiring limited excision with healing by secondary intension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of chronic symptomatic pilonidal disease defined as at least one pilonidal&#xD;
             sinus and a history of at least two acute pilonidal abscesses or persistent symptoms&#xD;
             altering patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        (cm x 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm)greater than or equal to 3 cm in length, greater than or equal to 1.5&#xD;
        cm in width, and greater than or equal to1.5 cm in depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rationale: satisfies the minimum size wound that NPWT may be employed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Known HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known immunodeficiency or currently receiving immunosuppressive therapy (inhaled and&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Known documented history of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Non-ambulatory or limited mobility. Rationale: non ambulatory patients may have&#xD;
             altered wound healing in the sacral area due to constant pressure from positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of current tobacco use: defined as cigarette smoking greater than or equal to&#xD;
             one half pack (10 cigarettes) per day:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Rationale: confounding factor prolonging wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Complex pilonidal disease determined by the surgeon to require a procedure other than&#xD;
             the study procedure for appropriate treatment of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Acute pilonidal abscess or infection within 6 weeks of planned operative date.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Concerns for arterial bleeding or cancer in the wound bed or in the vicinity of the&#xD;
             dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any other significant finding which, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             increase the subject's risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Lack of or unwillingness to provide/sign informed consent. Post Surgery Exclusion&#xD;
             Study Criteria&#xD;
