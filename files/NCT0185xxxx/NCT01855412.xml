      The purpose of this study is to evaluate acute and long term clinical and economic outcomes&#xD;
      of endovascular procedures to treat Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center, clinical study examining predictors of&#xD;
      clinical outcomes for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of lesions within or&#xD;
      extending into the target area (10 cm above the medial epicondyle to the digital arteries).&#xD;
      This includes disease in a vessel located within or extending into the distal superficial&#xD;
      femoral artery (SFA), popliteal (POP), tibial peroneal trunk (TPT), anterior tibial (AT),&#xD;
      posterior tibial (PT), and peroneal tibial (PR) arteries.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject's age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject presents with a Rutherford classification of 2 to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject presents with clinical evidence of PAD requiring endovascular intervention on&#xD;
             one or both limbs that includes a target lesion in a native vessel located within or&#xD;
             extending into 10 cm above the medial epicondyle to the digital arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If subject presents with bilateral disease, the first limb treated with a lesion&#xD;
                  in the target area will be considered the target limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For subjects with one or more wounds on the target limb, the target lesion(s)&#xD;
                  should be considered the lesion(s) in the vessel(s) that provide(s) blood flow to&#xD;
                  the wound(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has at least one lesion in a native vessel located within or extending into&#xD;
             the target area that is crossed and treated with an endovascular device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is unwilling or unable to sign the IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is unable to understand or comply with the study protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study&#xD;
             that can clinically interfere with the endpoints of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject requires a conversion from endovascular intervention to a surgical bypass&#xD;
             graft for any lesion(s) in the target area, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has an in-stent restenosis in the target area, and this lesion is the only one&#xD;
             requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has an anticipated life span of less than one (1) year.&#xD;

          <title>Baseline Rutherford Classification (RC)</title>
          <description>Rutherford Classification (RC) is a commonly used clinical grading system for describing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) on a scale of 0 to 6. RC 6 is the most severe form of PAD.&#xD;
There are seven Rutherford categories used to grade the severity of peripheral artery disease; 0: asymptomatic, 1: mild claudication, 2: moderate claudication, 3: severe claudication, 4: ischemic rest pain, 5: minor tissue loss, 6: major tissue loss.</description>
