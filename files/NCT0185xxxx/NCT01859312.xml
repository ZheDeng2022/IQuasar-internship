      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic disorder of the adrenal gland. The&#xD;
           adrenal gland is located in the abdomen and produces small amounts of hormones such as&#xD;
           cortisol, aldosterone, and androgen. These hormones help control blood pressure, protect&#xD;
           the body, and maintain good health, especially during development. People with CAH do&#xD;
           not make enough cortisol and aldosterone, and make too much androgen. This can lead to&#xD;
           serious medical problems. The standard treatment is to take pills that mimic the effects&#xD;
           of cortisol and aldosterone. However, treatment with pills can have long-term side&#xD;
           effects because of the higher doses needed, and may not work well for some people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A possible new treatment for CAH is to use a pump to deliver cortisol under the skin.&#xD;
           Similar pumps are often used to give insulin to people with diabetes. Researchers think&#xD;
           that a cortisol pump might be able to help the body use the cortisol more effectively&#xD;
           than taking pills. They want to compare the results of a cortisol pump and standard pill&#xD;
           treatments for CAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the effectiveness of a cortisol pump with standard cortisol pill therapy for&#xD;
      CAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men and women at least 18 years of age who have CAH (see more details in Eligibility&#xD;
      section below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve four inpatient hospital stays at the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health in Bethesda, MD over 6 months (spaced 2 months apart). The first and last stays&#xD;
           will last about 5 days. The second and third stays will last about 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will provide regular blood and urine samples.&#xD;
           They will also have imaging studies. These studies will look at the bones, fat, and&#xD;
           muscles in the abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a cortisol pump during the first visit. They will be shown how&#xD;
           to use the pump. They will also learn what to do, if they need to take extra &quot;stress&#xD;
           dose&quot; cortisol pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second and third visits, the cortisol dose given with the pump will be adjusted&#xD;
           as needed. Blood and urine samples will also be collected. No imaging studies are&#xD;
           scheduled for these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The last study visit will have the same tests as the first visit. Participants will be&#xD;
           offered the chance to continue with the pump treatment for 1 more year, or go back to&#xD;
           their standard pill treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type: Interventional non-randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Official title: A Pilot Study Assessing the use of Continuous Subcutaneous Hydrocortisone&#xD;
      Infusion In the Treatment of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common genetic endocrine disorder, with&#xD;
      21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency accounting for 95% of the cases. 21-hydroxylase deficiency&#xD;
      presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from salt-wasting and&#xD;
      virilization of female neonates (classic CAH) to symptomatic (precocious puberty, short&#xD;
      stature, acne) or asymptomatic hyperandrogenemia (non-classic CAH). Classic CAH is&#xD;
      characterized by impaired cortisol and mineralocorticoid biosynthesis, which triggers&#xD;
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) hyper-secretion and accumulation of adrenal androgens.&#xD;
      Glucocorticoid treatment of patients with classic CAH focuses on cortisol replacement and&#xD;
      prevention of the ACTH-driven androgen excess. Current conventional glucocorticoid treatment&#xD;
      regimens (short or long-acting agents dosed once, twice or thrice daily) have failed to&#xD;
      simulate physiological cortisol secretion and suppress adrenal androgen overproduction,&#xD;
      without supraphysiologic replacement. Short-term overtreatment with glucocorticoids can lead&#xD;
      to iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and long-term use has been associated with the development of&#xD;
      obesity, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance and osteoporosis. Isolated case reports have&#xD;
      provided evidence that continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI) can mimic&#xD;
      physiologic cortisol release and lead to improved CAH control at doses similar to or lower&#xD;
      than the traditional treatment. This pilot study aims to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat adult patients with classic CAH will have better adrenal androgen control&#xD;
      and improved CAH and glucocorticoid-related comorbidities, when they receive near-physiologic&#xD;
      cortisol replacement therapy via CSHI compared to conventional glucocorticoid treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, this study will provide information on the safety and tolerability of CSHI, and&#xD;
      will generate data that will be used in the design of future pediatric studies.&#xD;

        <description>17-OHP (17-hydroxyprogesterone) is a laboratory blood test to test for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. AUC was calculated using the linear-up log-down trapezoidal rule for the 8 hour nighttime level, samples were obtained every 2 hours beginning at 2300, 0100, 0300, 0500, 0700. Actual collection times were used to define peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax).</description>
