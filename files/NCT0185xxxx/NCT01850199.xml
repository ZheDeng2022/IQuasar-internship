  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes, diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy, affects 8.8% of pregnancies in&#xD;
      Spain that means more than 40,000 women per year. This prevalence is based on the National&#xD;
      Diabetes Data Group criteria, previous to the 4th workshop on Gestational Diabetes (1998),&#xD;
      but, if the new diagnosis criteria proposed by the International Associations of Diabetes and&#xD;
      Pregnancy Study Groups, based on the most important study never made before on this topic,&#xD;
      prevalence would increase to the double. When a women is diagnosed, the risk of complications&#xD;
      for her and the child increases and, therefore, she has to start an specific diet and&#xD;
      frequent visits to the diabetes center in order to check that glucose values do not exceed 95&#xD;
      mg/dl before or 140 mg/dl 1-hour after meals. In other case, she should start insulin&#xD;
      treatment. Our project is aimed to develop intelligent tools based on neuro-diffuse&#xD;
      techniques and integrated in a telemedicine system that allows control of gestational&#xD;
      diabetes automatically, guaranteeing glucose control objectives consecution and avoiding&#xD;
      face-to-face visits to the health care center. Furthermore, educational and motivation tools&#xD;
      for a healthy behaviour will be included. At the end of the study efficacy and security about&#xD;
      insulin management will be compare with the recommendations proposed by the diabetes team and&#xD;
      data about direct and indirect costs will be calculated. The investigators anticipate that&#xD;
      the smart telemedicine system can allow us to detect high blood glucose values earlier than&#xD;
      in-person scheduled visits.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the safety and usability of a telemedicine system which includes&#xD;
      intelligent tools for blood glucose analysis and supporting routine clinical monitoring&#xD;
      carried out by nurses and endocrinologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Prospective, controlled, randomized (2:1) Participants: pregnant women&#xD;
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes according to the National Diabetes Data Group criteria&#xD;
      between 14 and 34 weeks of gestation. Patients with suspected clinical diagnosis of type 1 or&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the signed acceptance to participate in the study, requirements are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Availability of a desktop computer or laptop with an internet connection and USB port.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sufficient knowledge of Catalan and/or Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A mobile phone Objective: To technically evaluate the SineDie telemedicine system and&#xD;
           also the users' degree of satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology of the study: Once signed consent for participation the patient will be&#xD;
      randomized either to continue regularly scheduled visits (33% chance) or to use the&#xD;
      Telemedicine system (66% chance). The randomization will be done using a system of allocation&#xD;
      based on random numbers. The SINEDiE system includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational Program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automatical Evaluation of glucose data -immediately after each download (frequency not&#xD;
           exceeding 72 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alerts in case of failure of receiving information at the scheduled time or in case of&#xD;
           incompleteness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alerts for glucose values higher than desirable but which could be corrected by diet&#xD;
           changes and / or exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alerts for high glucose values which cannot be corrected with the previous mentioned&#xD;
           changes. In this case an appointment for face-to-face visit would be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All warnings are also reported as an email to the endocrinologist and nurse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis of data: blood glucose, standard deviation, number of preprandial&#xD;
           values&gt; 90, the number of postprandial values of&gt; 140 messages and warnings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analytical variables: HbA1c at the start and every 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications of pregnancy and childbirth if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal Complications if any&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey of satisfaction with telemedicine tool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected duration of the study: 6 months Number of patients included 20 patients&#xD;
