    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - GI-6207 is an experimental cancer vaccine made with baker's yeast. The yeast has been&#xD;
      modified to help the immune system target a protein called CEA. CEA is found on the surface&#xD;
      of some kinds of tumor cells, including thyroid cancer cells. Researchers want to see if&#xD;
      GI-6207 can encourage the body's immune system to attack and kill tumor cells that contain&#xD;
      the CEA protein. They will test to see whether this vaccine is a safe and effective treatment&#xD;
      for medullary thyroid cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of the GI-6207 vaccine for advanced medullary thyroid&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have medullary thyroid cancer that has not&#xD;
      responded to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           provide blood and tumor samples and have an imaging study of the neck and chest. They&#xD;
           will also have a skin test to make sure that they are not allergic to the yeast in the&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will start to take GI-6207&#xD;
           immediately for 1 year. The second group will have 6 months of monitoring and tests with&#xD;
           no vaccine, and then will take GI-6207 for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GI-6207 will be given every other week for the first seven visits (about 3 months), and&#xD;
           then monthly for the remaining year of treatment. It will be given as injections beneath&#xD;
           the arm and in the upper thigh. These locations will help the vaccine enter the lymph&#xD;
           nodes and reach the immune system more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with frequent blood and urine tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits after their year of study vaccines.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CEA is overexpressed in multiple malignancies, including medullary thyroid cancer where&#xD;
           CEA is universally expressed on tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no standard treatment for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic,&#xD;
           metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. The only effective FDA-approved therapy&#xD;
           (vandetanib) comes with significant toxicity, so it is not used until patients have&#xD;
           symptomatic or rapidly progressing disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical studies have shown that GI-6207 can induce a strong immune response to CEA&#xD;
           as well as therapeutic anti-tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A previous Phase I GI-6207 study has demonstrated safety and enhanced immune response in&#xD;
           some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary data suggests that tumor growth rates can be calculated in medullary thyroid&#xD;
           cancer patients within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective data from prostate cancer studies suggest that vaccines can alter tumor&#xD;
           growth rates within 3-4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the effect of GI-6207 on calcitonin growth rate kinetics after 6 months of&#xD;
      therapy in patients with medullary thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will have evidence of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer including disease&#xD;
           that is evaluable on bone or CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with minimal or no disease related-symptoms (minimal symptoms will include&#xD;
           those that do not affect activities of daily living or pain that does not require&#xD;
           regularly schedule narcotics.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous vandetanib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no serious&#xD;
           inter-current medical illness; no cardiac disease; no prior splenectomy. (History of&#xD;
           previous thyroid autoimmune disease will be allowed as these patients will have had&#xD;
           total thyroidectomy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No pericardial-based masses greater than 1 cm or thoracic lesions larger than 2 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized, phase 2 study to determine the effect of GI-6207 on calcitonin growth rate&#xD;
           after 6 months of GI-6207&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomized to either initial GI-6207 therapy or 6 months of&#xD;
           surveillance followed by GI-6207 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GI-6207 will be administered subcutaneously at 4 sites at dose of 10 yeast units per&#xD;
           site, biweekly for 7 visits (day 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85), then monthly up to 1 year&#xD;
           of treatment. (For patients randomized to surveillance and then GI-6207, they will get a&#xD;
           full year of GI-6207 after a 6 month surveillance period.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once patients have completed one year of therapy with GI-6207, patients without&#xD;
           radiographic progression will have the option to receive vaccine every 3 months for an&#xD;
           additional 12 months. Patients who remain on vaccine will continue to be scanned every 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune monitoring via apheresis will be done prior to enrollment and at 6 months for all&#xD;
           appropriate and consenting patients. Patients who are evaluable for immunologic response&#xD;
           by the ELISPOT Assay (HLA 02, 03 and 24) will have apheresis at start of GI-6207 therapy&#xD;
           and then every 3 months while on GI-6207 treatment when feasible.&#xD;

    <description>GI-6207 is a heat-killed, recombinant yeast-based vaccine engineered to express the full length human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), with a modified gene coding sequence to code for a single amino acid substitution (asparagine to aspartic acid) at the native protein amino acid position 610, which is designed to enhance immunogenicity. A plasmid vector containing the modified human CEA gene is used to transfect the parental yeast strain (S. cerevisiae W303 - a haploid strain with known mutations from wild-type yeast) to produce the final recombinant vaccine product.</description>

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria for participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis: Patients must have histologically confirmed medullary thyroid cancer by the&#xD;
             Laboratory of Pathology or a pathology report and history consistent with medullary&#xD;
             thyroid cancer. It is not uncommon for a secondary, minor pathologic focus of another&#xD;
             form of thyroid cancer to be coincidentally found in 15-20% of patients with medullary&#xD;
             thyroid cancer. In such cases, eligibility is based on the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer including disease&#xD;
             that is evaluable on bone, CT scan or MRI. (Patients who are surgical candidates and&#xD;
             potentially rendered disease free with surgical resection are not eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have elevated calcitonin levels, greater than 8 pg/mL in females and 16&#xD;
             pg/mL in males&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following will not be eligible for participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have no evidence of immune dysfunction as listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity due to the potential for&#xD;
                  decreased immune response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a recent history of autoimmune&#xD;
                  disease requiring therapy, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
                  disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or active diverticulitis. This&#xD;
                  requirement is due to the potential risks of exacerbating autoimmunity. However,&#xD;
                  patients with vitiligo may be enrolled. (Patients with history of autoimmune&#xD;
                  thyroid conditions will be allowed as these patients will be on replacement&#xD;
                  medications.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic&#xD;
                  steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, eye drops or inhaled) steroid use.&#xD;
                  Limited doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of&#xD;
                  reactive airway disease or to prevent IV contrast allergic reaction or&#xD;
                  anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women, due to the unknown effects of GI-6207 on the fetus&#xD;
             or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious inter-current medical illness which would interfere with the ability of the&#xD;
             patient to carry out the treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain metastases (or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6&#xD;
             months) due to the poor prognosis of these patients and difficulty ascertaining the&#xD;
             cause of neurologic toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pericardial masses &gt;1 cm or thoracic lesions larger than 2 cm will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic hepatitis infection, including B and C, because potential immune impairment&#xD;
             caused by these disorders may diminish the effectiveness of this immunologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the&#xD;
             patient's tolerance of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would&#xD;
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment; patients treated&#xD;
             surgically with a curative intent, such as non-melanoma skin cancers, localized kidney&#xD;
             cancer or carcinoma in situ of the bladder, are not excluded. Patients with MEN2 and a&#xD;
             history of pheochromocytoma will also not be excluded. In addition patients with&#xD;
             prostate cancer who do not require systemic therapy will not be excluded. (A&#xD;
             secondary, minor pathologic focus of another form of thyroid cancer may be&#xD;
             coincidentally found in 15-20% of patients with medullary thyroid cancer. In such&#xD;
             cases, eligibility is based on the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
