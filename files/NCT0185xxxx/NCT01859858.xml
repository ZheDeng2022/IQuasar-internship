  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Curcumin is an extract of the tumeric root that has been shown to have anti-tumor properties&#xD;
      in laboratory studies. Curcumin, and its parent spice, turmeric (curcuma longa), are the 4th&#xD;
      most commonly purchased dietary supplement in the U.S. Many cancer patients take curcumin&#xD;
      during their treatment for cancer because of the purported health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is designed to learn more about the safety, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      effectiveness of irinotecan when given in combination with curcumin in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer. The study of how the body absorbs, processes and eliminates&#xD;
      drugs is called pharmacokinetics (PK). One of the main purposes of this study is to better&#xD;
      understand the interaction between curcumin and irinotecan by measuring levels of irinotecan&#xD;
      in the blood (ie. measure irinotecan PK) when a patient also takes curcumin. Information&#xD;
      collected from this study could result in improved dosing guidelines and lead to more&#xD;
      effective treatment of your cancer with less toxicity.&#xD;

      Treatment Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, two-part, open label prospective study to define the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of curcumin plus irinotecan and the pharmacokinetic effects of curcumin&#xD;
      on irinotecan metabolism in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Each cycle of&#xD;
      irinotecan is defined as 28 days, with a dose of irinotecan administered on D1 and D15. The&#xD;
      study will have two parts: Part 1 comprises the dose escalation portion of the study and Part&#xD;
      2 comprises the MTD expansion and pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the GI oncology clinic of the North Carolina Cancer Hospital.&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patients will be entered into Part 1 of the study until the&#xD;
      MTD has been defined. During study Part 1, patients will be given a 4 day run-in of curcumin&#xD;
      prior to irinotecan dosing. The planned dose levels of curcumin will be 1, 2, 3, and 4 grams&#xD;
      per day. Irinotecan will be dosed at 200 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 15.46 Additional&#xD;
      antineoplastic agents will not be allowed during the trial. Two patients will be enrolled at&#xD;
      each dose level until a DLT occurs, beginning with the lowest dose level and increasing the&#xD;
      level only after 2 patients have successfully completed a full irinotecan cycle at that dose&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will investigate the effect of curcumin on irinotecan and SN-38 pharmacokinetics. We&#xD;
      will expand the cohort of patients at the defined MTD in part 1. Patients will receive&#xD;
      irinotecan alone for a single dose (D1). Curcumin, at the MTD, will be started on D11 and&#xD;
      continued until the end of the cycle (D28). Irinotecan will be administered again on D15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected on the days of irinotecan infusion (D1 and D15) as follows:&#xD;
      prior to treatment with irinotecan (baseline), immediately following the end of irinotecan&#xD;
      infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours following the end of the irinotecan&#xD;
      infusion for irinotecan and SN-38 PK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will continue on curcumin + irinotecan for further cycles until disease&#xD;
      progression or toxicity occurs at the discretion of the treating physician (see section 5.6).&#xD;
      For patients in study Part 1, we will offer to escalate the curcumin dose to the highest dose&#xD;
      level that has been safely completed until an MTD has been estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Assignment Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the screening period, eligible patients are assigned in cohorts of 2 at&#xD;
      escalating doses until the first Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT) is observed. DLT determination&#xD;
      will be made based on one cycle in initial cohorts of 2. As much information as possible is&#xD;
      used in the initial cohorts of 2. After the first DLT is observed, DLT rates at each dose are&#xD;
      estimated using isotonic regression. For that, proportions of DLTs are computed at each dose&#xD;
      first, then, if there is a violation of monotonicity, data at the violating dose levels are&#xD;
      pooled and new proportions computed. The estimated DLT rate at the current dose is used to&#xD;
      determine whether the dose will be increased, decreased or remained unchanged. The dose is to&#xD;
      remain unchanged if the estimated DLT rate at the current dose is between [0.17, 0.33]; the&#xD;
      dose is decreased if the estimated DLT rate is higher than 0.33; and the dose is increased if&#xD;
      the estimated DLT is lower than 0.17. Dose assignment will progress with successful&#xD;
      completion of two participants at each dose level until DLT occurs. Dose assignment after the&#xD;
      first DLT will be made in collaboration with the study statistician for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 1, up to 20 patients will be assigned using the algorithm above. The MTD will be&#xD;
      estimated when either the highest dose is reached with no DLTs or after 20 patients have&#xD;
      completed the algorithm above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: After the MTD has been estimated, 10 new patients will be assigned to the &quot;expanded&#xD;
      MTD cohort&quot; to estimate PK parameters for irinotecan and SN-38 (active metabolite of&#xD;
      irinotecan) with and without curcumin. . The &quot;expanded MTD cohort&quot; might have more than 10&#xD;
      patients if Part 1 sample size is smaller than 20, as long as the total number of patients in&#xD;
      the trial does not exceed 30. The estimated MTD might be re-evaluated if the estimated DLT&#xD;
      rate at that dose is outside [0.17, 0.33].&#xD;
