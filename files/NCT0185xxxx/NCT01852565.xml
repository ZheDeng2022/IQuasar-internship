  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Darapladib (SB-480848) is a novel, selective, orally active inhibitor of lipoprotein&#xD;
      associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) currently under clinical development by GlaxoSmithKline&#xD;
      as a potential anti-atherosclerosis agent for reduction of major adverse cardiovascular (CV)&#xD;
      events in patient populations with chronic coronary heart disease and after an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the effect of repeated administration of diltiazem on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a repeated administration of darapladib. A drug interaction study with a&#xD;
      moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted to provide guidance to prescribing physicians.&#xD;
