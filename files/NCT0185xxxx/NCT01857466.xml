  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of benign ovarian cysts&#xD;
      and is usually performed by stripping the ovarian cyst wall, followed by bleeding control of&#xD;
      the ovarian wound ground using bipolar coagulation. However, the hemostasis with bipolar&#xD;
      coagulation could result in the damage of ovarian reserve and decrease the response of the&#xD;
      ovaries to hormonal stimulation for assisted reproductive technologies. The possible&#xD;
      mechanism may contribute to thermal destruction of ovarian follicles by excessive use of&#xD;
      bipolar coagulation for hemostasis purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid additional ovarian tissue damage by conventional bipolar coagulation being&#xD;
      potentially important ovarian reproductive function, hemostasis using various topical&#xD;
      hemostatic agents has introduced to control post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding. Among&#xD;
      them, FloSeal (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) is a hemostatic matrix&#xD;
      sealant composed of a gelatin-based matrix and thrombin solution. On coming into contact with&#xD;
      blood after application at a bleeding site, the gelatin particles swell and tamponade&#xD;
      bleeding. The bulk of the gelatin matrix-thrombin composite has the effect of slowing blood&#xD;
      flow and providing exposure to a high thrombin concentration, thus hastening clot formation.&#xD;
      Therefore, it may more suitable for use in post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding, where&#xD;
      there is superficially pervasive focus of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian reserve is defined as the functional potential of the ovary, which reflects the&#xD;
      number and quality of antral follicles left in the ovary, and is correlated with the response&#xD;
      to ovarian stimulation using exogenous gonadotropin. Serum anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) has&#xD;
      been accepted as the most reliable and easily measurable marker for postoperative assessment&#xD;
      of ovarian reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a multicenter, large-scale, randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      investigate whether hemostasis by Floseal was superior to that by bipolar coagulation in&#xD;
      preserving ovarian reserve by assessing serial AMH levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
      ovarian cystectomy for benign ovarian cysts.&#xD;

    <description>In the Floseal group, the sites of bleeding were covered with Floseal under direct vision with a laparoscopic applicator and ovarian cortex was closed on itself and waited for 2 minutes for Floseal to act. Then, subsequently bleeding sites were reexamined with irrigation.</description>
