    <textblock>
      Many patients suffer from devastating injuries to vascularized composite tissues.&#xD;
      Vascularized composite tissues are blocs of functional tissue that can contain multiple&#xD;
      tissue types such as bone, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and others.&#xD;
      Examples of patients with severe vascularized composite tissue defects include limb amputees,&#xD;
      patients with third-degree burns to the face or extremities, soldiers with&#xD;
      improvised-explosive-device blast injuries to the face, and others. These patients cannot be&#xD;
      helped satisfactorily with conventional reconstructive surgery; however, recently&#xD;
      vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) such as transplantation of faces and limbs&#xD;
      became available to this patients. Unfortunately, at this juncture, patients who receive VCA&#xD;
      must submit to life-long regime of immunosuppressant drugs with serious side effects such as&#xD;
      infection, renal toxicity and cancer. Immune tolerance is the absence of a destructive immune&#xD;
      response from the recipient's body to the transplant, while otherwise maintaining sufficient&#xD;
      immune function to fight infections and other threats. Transplant recipients with immune&#xD;
      tolerance do not need to take immunosuppression drugs. The investigators believe that they&#xD;
      can achieve immune tolerance in recipients of face and limb transplants.&#xD;
