    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a radiofrequency (RF) source,&#xD;
      the TriActive+ RF handpiece, for treatment of wrinkles and rhytides after multiple&#xD;
      treatments. The primary endpoint is observation of changes to the surface by visual and&#xD;
      photographic analysis. Secondary endpoints: measurement of patient satisfaction and comfort&#xD;
      of the treatment and the measurement of adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collagen varies genetically and structurally. Collagen breakdown increases with chronological&#xD;
      age and photoaging. While fibroblasts normally replace damaged collagen fibers with new ones,&#xD;
      the ability of fibroblasts to replace collagen is compromised by natural aging and&#xD;
      environmental stress. Although collagen fibers form a loose interlacing network that is&#xD;
      deformable, increased collagen breakdown leads to thinning and loss of the elastic fiber&#xD;
      network in the dermis. This breakdown results in the formation of wrinkles, especially in&#xD;
      areas of the skin exposed to the sun, which are most prone to wrinkles and imperfections.&#xD;
      Nonablative dermal remodeling has gained tremendous popularity among patients and&#xD;
      practitioners, offering a low incidence of adverse effects and modest improvement in the&#xD;
      various signs of cutaneous photoaging, including rhytides, dyschromias and telangiectasias.&#xD;
      Controlled thermal skin injury has been shown to effect a conformational change in the&#xD;
      structure and length of collagen and may also induce fibroblast response for long-term&#xD;
      collagen remodeling. Interest in utilizing radiofrequency energy to enhance deep tissue&#xD;
      tightening and thus improve skin laxity has grown, as radiofrequency energy has been shown in&#xD;
      multiple studies to tighten tissue, producing a noticeable skin lifting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to evaluate the clinical performance of a radiofrequency (RF) source&#xD;
      as engendered in the TriActive+ RF for the non-invasive treatment of wrinkles and rhytides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects who have signed an ICF will receive up to 8 treatments on at least two&#xD;
      facial sub areas (left peri-orbital, right peri-orbital and peri-oral). Up to 25 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study at two sites. Treatments will start at a low power and then&#xD;
      gradually increase, based on tolerability and tissue reaction. The goal is to progressively&#xD;
      reach and maintain an epidermal temperature end-point. The site will use an IR thermometer to&#xD;
      ensure the rise in temperature does not exceed 43° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be once a week with follow-up visits at one week, one month, and three months&#xD;
      following the final treatment. Clinical assessments by the investigator and digital&#xD;
      photographs will be taken prior to the baseline treatment, immediately prior to the 5th&#xD;
      treatment, and at the 1 week, 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits.&#xD;

            <description>Radiofrequency (RF) treatment with the TriActive+ RF device on the peri-oral and/or peri-orbital areas of the face once a week for eight weeks.&#xD;
TriActive+ RF: Radio frequency handpiece uses a multi-polar technology with a particular electrical frequency of 1MHz. The handpiece has a special &quot;skin contact identification&quot; system which delivers energy only when electrodes are adherent to the skin surface in order to avoid the prickling sensation when the treatment starts.</description>

          <title>Changes to the Surface by Visual and Photographic Analysis.</title>
          <description>At each of the specified time points, photographs of the treated areas will be taken. The photography angles will include a global frontal photo and the right and left sides of the face at 45° and/or 90°. In addition, close up photos will be taken of specific facial zones, e.g., the peri-orbital wrinkles.&#xD;
