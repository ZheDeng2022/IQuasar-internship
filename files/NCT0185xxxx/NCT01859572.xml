  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to facilitate future Phase II/III clinical trials and improve&#xD;
      outcome for patients suffering residual disability after an ischaemic stroke. Main study&#xD;
      objectives are to document and better define the prognostic characteristics of residual&#xD;
      disability in patients following an ischaemic stroke, to inform the design of small efficient&#xD;
      Phase II studies when screening potentially efficacious interventions for signals of activity&#xD;
      which merit further development and to establish a pool of patients who may be approached to&#xD;
      participate in future clinical trials in the ischaemic stroke setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experience of conducting a Phase I study of an advanced medicinal therapy for ischaemic&#xD;
      stroke and planning a Phase II efficacy study for this indication has revealed a number of&#xD;
      opportunities to facilitate future clinical trials for this important indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key issues were identified which could be easily addressed with forward planning of&#xD;
      future trials in the ischaemic clinical setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The population readily available for clinical trials of potentially useful new agents is&#xD;
           limited, as many patients presenting with a stroke are treated in an acute unit but then&#xD;
           may &quot;drop-out&quot; of the acute neurology or academic catchment populations when they are&#xD;
           transferred to a variety of settings for subsequent management, such as long-term&#xD;
           hospital care in a geriatric ward, residential care or home care by relatives with&#xD;
           assistance from social support. Thus, establishing a pool of patients willing to be&#xD;
           contacted about future clinical trials after they leave the acute stroke facility would&#xD;
           facilitate future stroke studies. It would ensure such patients were offered the&#xD;
           opportunity to participate in relevant clinical trials and any additional related care&#xD;
           (e.g. additional physiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite a substantial amount of literature on the management of stroke, planning of&#xD;
           Phase II studies is still handicapped by insufficient information to clearly identify&#xD;
           which patients will be left with residual disability and the time-course of any&#xD;
           improvement with current standards of care. Optimal populations and clinical trial&#xD;
           methodology for screening potential new interventions for stroke have not been&#xD;
           established. Building a robust dataset to better identify such populations would: 1)&#xD;
           improve the speed and reduce the cost of screening candidates, 2) permit use of more&#xD;
           efficient statistical methods to screen for activity, and 3) increase the opportunity to&#xD;
           identify new treatments for post stroke disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A core dataset will be recorded including the patient's National Health Service number, age,&#xD;
      gender and stroke outcome measured by four standard validated rating scales; Action Research&#xD;
      Arm Test (ARAT), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
      (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI). All patients consenting to participate in the program would&#xD;
      also consent to being contacted to determine their interest in participating in future&#xD;
      regulated clinical trials of interventions for patients with a history of ischaemic stroke.&#xD;
      The consent form for this study would make it clear that the patient is under no obligation&#xD;
      to participate in any other study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the core dataset, participating centres may elect to add additional&#xD;
      sub-protocols to this study to collect additional non-core data: for example, assessment of&#xD;
      cognitive or visual function, mood, fatigue or other measures of performance, structural or&#xD;
      functional MRI imaging or other investigations related to the patient's progress following&#xD;
      the presenting stroke. Additional assessment criteria outside the core dataset of this study&#xD;
      would be the subject of centre-specific sub-protocols and must be approved as required by&#xD;
      national and local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-recruitment of patients into other studies is allowable, if permitted within the other&#xD;
      study protocol.&#xD;
