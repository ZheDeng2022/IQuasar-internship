  <brief_summary>

      skeletal muscle function in Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept phase 1/2a pilot and endpoint development study that is designed&#xD;
      to provide initial evidence of biological activity of (-)-epicatechin. Primary endpoints&#xD;
      include initial assessment of tissue-specific evidence of efficacy from muscle biopsy&#xD;
      samples. Secondary endpoints include measures of strength and physical function, and safety&#xD;
      and adverse event data. Pilot endpoints include assessment of mRNA and miRNA peripheral blood&#xD;
      profiles and validation of non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) muscle perfusion&#xD;
      studies during exercise and a recumbent cycle exercise test that may be employed as endpoints&#xD;
      in future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center open-label pilot study will enroll 10 adults with genetically-confirmed&#xD;
      Becker muscular dystrophy, who will receive the purified nutritional extract (-)-epicatechin&#xD;
      100mg/day orally for 8 weeks. After screening visits, participants will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study if they meet all inclusion criteria. They will be evaluated at baseline and at&#xD;
      screening, day 1, and weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8.&#xD;
