  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal androgens are serum biomarkers of interest that may help guide abiraterone acetate&#xD;
      treatment, particularly at the time of progression. Biomarkers may also help identify&#xD;
      pathways to resistance of abiraterone acetate treatment. The most practical way of&#xD;
      approaching this question is to explore surrogate biomarkers of prostate cancer including&#xD;
      quantification of pharmacodynamic endocrine biomarkers.&#xD;

      Goals of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore which circulating endocrine markers or endocrine related markers have the best&#xD;
           potential to predict clinical response to abiraterone acetate in CRPC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the utility of microRNA, circulating DNA and exosome analyses in complementing&#xD;
           the previous objective&#xD;

    <time_frame>Patients will be followed from Day 1 (date of initiation of Abiraterone treatment) until the date of first documented progression (estimated to be 1 year). PSA will be assessed every 30 days (approximately) until the time of PSA/clinical progression</time_frame>
    <description>PSA nadir samples will be assessed and compared to pre-Abiraterone treatment samples post completion of study</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed written informed consent. Before any study procedures are performed, subjects&#xD;
             (or their legally acceptable representatives) will have the details of the study&#xD;
             described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to read.&#xD;
             If subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by&#xD;
             signing and dating the informed consent document in the presence of study personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be suitable for receiving treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not receive any other investigational agent or dose escalation of&#xD;
             abiraterone acetate during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient consents to comply to treatment with abiraterone acetate as directed by their&#xD;
             physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking a dose of abiraterone acetate other than 1g daily or lack of compliance to&#xD;
             daily dosing of abiraterone acetate and prednisone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving spironolactone or any other steroidogenic compounds in excess of&#xD;
             the associated prednisone 5mg bid are excluded due to the potential for androgen&#xD;
             receptor agonism&#xD;
