  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the improvement in subject-reported&#xD;
      clinical outcomes for Regenexx PL-Disc vs. steroid epidural for treatment of lumbar&#xD;
      radiculopathy, from baseline to 3 months, with continued evaluation of efficacy and&#xD;
      durability up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include incidence of post-operative complications, adverse events,&#xD;
      re-injections, and surgical intervention; change in pain score and use of pain medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled to include 25 subjects treated with&#xD;
      Regenexx PL-Disc and 25 subjects treated with steroid epidural injection with the steroid&#xD;
      epidural group crossing over to the PL-Disc injection group at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy confirmed by physical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to injection and take part in follow-up visits&#xD;
      for one year following treatment. A preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment;&#xD;
      follow-up visits will occur at the clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
      post injection. Subjects will remain blinded to the treatment allocation through at least the&#xD;
      3 month primary endpoint. Control subjects not improving after the 3 month visit will be&#xD;
      unblinded and given the opportunity to cross-over to the PL-Disc group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the study following the 1 year follow-up visit.&#xD;
