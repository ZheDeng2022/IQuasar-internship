      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Scientists are studying medications that may be useful in treating cocaine addiction. It is&#xD;
      important in these studies to know whether study participants are always taking their&#xD;
      medications as directed. This study will look at two chemicals to see if they can be used to&#xD;
      determine whether participants are taking their medications as directed. Because&#xD;
      acetazolamide and quinine can be measured in plasma and urine, they are good test subjects&#xD;
      for this study. They will be given alone, and combined with intravenous cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how they body handles acetazolamide and quinine alone, and when combined with&#xD;
      cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have smoked or used IV cocaine for at least&#xD;
      one year and at least three times per month during the three months prior to screening. Urine&#xD;
      test positive for cocaine within the prior 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve a 12-day inpatient stay at the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On days 1, 5, and 10, participants will receive a dose of cocaine. Blood, urine, breath,&#xD;
           and saliva samples will be collected up to 18 times a day for up to about 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On days 2, 3, 4, and 5, participants will receive acetazolamide. Regular blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected on Day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 6 is a wash-out day with no drugs or blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On days 7, 8, 9, and 10, participants will receive quinine. Regular blood samples will&#xD;
           be collected on Day 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 11, blood, urine, breath, and saliva samples will be collected in the early&#xD;
           morning. Participants will be able to leave later in the day.&#xD;

      Background: Cocaine dependence is a public health concern worldwide, with no FDA-approved&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment for this condition. Thus, there is a need for controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials to evaluate potential new pharmacological treatments. Adherence to a medication regime&#xD;
      is a major factor in the success of treatment. In controlled clinical trials, medication&#xD;
      adherence is often monitored by measuring specific markers ingested with the medication. No&#xD;
      such markers are validated for use in studies of cocaine dependence treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate the feasibility of oral acetazolamide and quinine as adherence markers in&#xD;
      trials of cocaine dependence treatment by determining their pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic interactions with intravenous (IV) cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 30 healthy cocaine users aged 18-50 years who smoked or used IV&#xD;
      cocaine for at least one year and at least three times per month during the three months&#xD;
      prior to screening and had a positive urine test for cocaine within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods: Participants are admitted to a secure residential research&#xD;
      unit on and undergo baseline assessments on Day -1, receive training on Day 0, and receive&#xD;
      single doses of IV cocaine (25 mg) on Days 1, 5 and 10. On Days 1, 5, and 10, dried blood&#xD;
      spot specimens are collected up to 3 times daily over 1.5 h. Single oral doses of&#xD;
      acetazolamide (15 mg) are given on Days 2-5 and quinine (80 mg) on Days 7-10. Blood, oral&#xD;
      fluid, and breath specimens are collected for up to 71 h, 70 h, and 22 h, respectively, after&#xD;
      drug administration on Days 1, 4, 5, 9 and 10. Participants will wear the AutoSense device on&#xD;
      Days 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 for up to 12 hours each day. All voided urine is collected&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary outcome measures include cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine&#xD;
      methylester, norcocaine, acetazolamide, and quinine pharmacokinetics in plasma and urine and&#xD;
      whether subjective and cardiovascular responses to IV cocaine are changed when coadministered&#xD;
      with oral acetazolamide or quinine. Secondary outcome measures include cocaine&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in oral fluid and breath, plasma activity of BChE and carboxylesterase&#xD;
      (enzymes which metabolize cocaine), and basal and post-cocaine administration serum&#xD;
      concentrations of leptin and other appetitive peptides (e.g. ghrelin, GLP-1, insulin, PYY,&#xD;
      amylin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: There is no direct benefit to participants, but the study is likely to yield&#xD;
      generalizable knowledge about the feasibility of acetazolamide and quinine as markers of&#xD;
      medication adherence in future studies of pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: &lt;TAB&gt;This study poses greater than minimal risk for participants because of IV cocaine&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
