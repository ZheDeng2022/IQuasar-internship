    <textblock>
      Respiratory-gated, volumetric-modulated arc therapy will be used for the clinical development&#xD;
      of high dose rate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in inoperable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC). These treatments should enhance local control, progression-free survival and&#xD;
      potentially overall survival in HCC patients. The investigators will also examine the&#xD;
      mechanism of tumour and microenvironmental response to high dose radiation, and search for&#xD;
      potential biomarkers to optimize and individualize therapy. Pre-treatment and follow-up&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging with 11C-choline, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and CT perfusion will examine&#xD;
      in-vivo changes in proliferation, glycolysis, and the tumour vasculature, respectively, and&#xD;
      blood samples will look for immunologic biomarkers of tumour response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is not considered standard of care practice for patients for inoperable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma despite the tumour's inherent radiosensitivity. The major challenge&#xD;
      has been improving radiation delivery without exceeding dose limits of the surrounding normal&#xD;
      liver. Recent technological advances with tumour localization and targeting, imaging,&#xD;
      treatment planning and delivery have allowed for safe delivery of radiation with tumorcidal&#xD;
      effect and minimal treatment-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To develop, validate, and quality test HDR Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) Gated&#xD;
      RapidArc technique for application in human liver tumours. And furthermore, to test whether&#xD;
      HDR SBRT Gated RapidArc can be efficiently and safely delivered to a very large patient&#xD;
      population previously ineligible for any therapy (HCC patients with tumours &gt;5cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To determine if 11C-choline/18F-FDG CT-PET or perfusion CT imaging (that characterize&#xD;
      changes in tumour proliferation, glycolysis, and vasculature, respectively) can provide&#xD;
      practical non-invasive biomarkers of tumour response, local tumour control, or normal tissue&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. To determine if immunologic studies of pre- and post-treatment blood samples can provide&#xD;
      biomarkers of tumour response, local and systemic tumour control, or triggers for normal&#xD;
      tissue toxicity.&#xD;
