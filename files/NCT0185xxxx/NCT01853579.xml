  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild thyroid failure is a common condition among older adults and has been associated with&#xD;
      numerous adverse effects on health, such as cardiovascular disease, cognition disturbances&#xD;
      and muscular problems. Mild thyroid failure has also been associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of developing depression. To date, only few studies have investigated the effect of thyroid&#xD;
      hormone replacement on depression in patients with mild thyroid failure. This study therefore&#xD;
      aims to assess whether thyroid hormone replacement in older adults with mild thyroid failure&#xD;
      is associated with a decrease in the presence of depressive symptoms. This study forms a&#xD;
      substudy of a large international study on thyroid hormone replacement in older adults with&#xD;
      mild thyroid failure (the TRUST study).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common condition among older adults, particularly above the&#xD;
      age of 65 years, with a prevalence reaching 10 to 15% of the population. This condition has&#xD;
      been associated with numerous adverse outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, cognition&#xD;
      disturbances and muscular problems. All of these potential outcomes will be assessed in the&#xD;
      TRUST study. Subclinical hypothyroidism has also been associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing depression. It has been suggested that subclinical hypothyroidism may lower the&#xD;
      threshold for the development of depression. The prevalence of depression among&#xD;
      community-dwelling elderly ranges from 2 to 10%. Patients with depression have been shown to&#xD;
      have a lower response to anti-depressive drugs when they have subclinical hypothyroidism.&#xD;
      Only a few randomized studies in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism have studied the&#xD;
      effect of thyroid hormone replacement on depression, with conflicting results: the studied&#xD;
      populations were often small (maximal number of participants: 143), using different scales to&#xD;
      measure the presence of depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether thyroid hormone replacement in older adults with subclinical&#xD;
      hypothyroidism is associated with a decrease in the presence of depressive symptoms in a&#xD;
      sub-study of the TRUST study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Use of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) to measure depressive symptoms&#xD;
      in all 450 patients included in the TRUST study in Switzerland and the Netherlands, the most&#xD;
      validated test for depression screening, with validity to measure longitudinal changes.&#xD;
      GDS-15 will be applied at baseline and after 1 year to compare changes in depression scores&#xD;
      between placebo and thyroxin arms. Power calculation (ANCOVA method) with 225 participants&#xD;
      per treatment group, assuming a standard deviation of 3 and a baseline to follow up&#xD;
      correlation of 0.7, results in 99.9% power for detecting a mean difference of 1.0 points at a&#xD;
      two-sided alpha-level of 0.05. Depending on recruitment for the main trial&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01660126) in respective countries, a lower number of participants&#xD;
      may be included, retaining a very large power for this continuous outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Experimental: Drug: Levothyroxine The intervention will start with Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily (reduced to 25 mcg in subjects &lt;50 kg of body weight or if known coronary heart disease - previous myocardial infarction or symptoms of angina pectoris) vs. matching placebo; at 3 months, if the serum TSH level is &lt;0.4 mU/L, dose will be reduced by 25 mcg; TSH &gt;=0.4 and &lt;4.6 mU/L, no change to dose; TSH &gt;=4.6 mU/L, additional 25 mcg. The process will be repeated at 12 months, then annually; mock titration will be performed in the placebo group. The maximum possible dose of Levothyroxine which will be prescribed is 150 mcg (after 4 increments of 25 mcg at 3 months, 1, 2, 3 years; from the starting dose of 50 mcg).</description>
