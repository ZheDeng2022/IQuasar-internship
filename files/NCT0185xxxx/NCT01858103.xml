    <textblock>
      The Expanded Access Program (EAP) is an open-label, multicenter program to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide patients who have been diagnosed with Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) access&#xD;
           to BMN 110 until commercial product is available&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect additional information on the safety and tolerability of BMN 110 administration&#xD;
           in patients with MPS IVA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the EAP will receive 2.0 mg/kg intravenous infusions of BMN 110 every&#xD;
      week during the program.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with MPS IVA as confirmed by either N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase&#xD;
             (GALNS) enzymatic test (GALNS activity in affected range, beta-galactosidase and a&#xD;
             second lysosomal sulfatase activity within normal range) or molecular diagnostic test&#xD;
             (two mutations in GALNS identified that have previously been associated with an enzyme&#xD;
             defect).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent, or in the case of&#xD;
             patients under the age of 18, provide written assent (as required by the IRB) and&#xD;
             written informed consent by a legally authorized representative after the nature of&#xD;
             the program has been explained, and prior to any program assessments or evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active patients must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception&#xD;
             while participating in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Baseline and&#xD;
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with all program procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Baseline or planning to become pregnant (self or partner)&#xD;
             at any time during the program. Patients who become pregnant during the program will&#xD;
             be discontinued from the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in an ongoing clinical study of BMN 110.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discontinued from a BMN 110 clinical study secondary to a safety-related event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational product (other than BMN 110 in a clinical study) or&#xD;
             investigational medical device within 30 days prior to Baseline, or requirement for&#xD;
             any investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled program assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not a current US resident or expecting to have travel plans outside the US during the&#xD;
             planned period of participation in the Expanded Access Program (EAP) that may&#xD;
             interfere with dosing regimen, scheduled program visits and safety monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the view of the Investigator or sponsor, places the patient at&#xD;
             high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the EAP.&#xD;
