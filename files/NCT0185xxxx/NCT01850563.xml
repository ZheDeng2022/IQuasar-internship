  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with brain metastases who are candidates for treatment with stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery (SRS) are potential study participants. SRS delivers high-energy,&#xD;
      precisely-focused radiation to each brain metastasis to shrink the tumor, and is the&#xD;
      standard-of-care for patients with these tumors. Oxygen enhances the damaging effects of&#xD;
      radiation on tumor cells. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy increases oxygen levels in all&#xD;
      kinds of tissues, including tumors. The purpose of this trial is to study whether it is&#xD;
      feasible to treat patients with HBO just prior to receiving SRS, given the timing constraints&#xD;
      of treating sequentially with HBO and then SRS. Patients will undergo HBO treatment followed&#xD;
      by the placement of a Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame then transported ,via stretcher, to&#xD;
      receive SRS. The transfer and placement of the head frame needs to be completed within the&#xD;
      15minute time frame. The trial's secondary objectives are to determine whether it has any&#xD;
      effects on outcomes and quality of life. As part of study participation patients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete quality of life questionnaires as well as mini mental status&#xD;
      questionnaires. These will be done prior to treatment and at follow up appointments&#xD;
      throughout the next 3 years while participating in the study. Patients will be given the&#xD;
      option to participate in the optional bio marker blood draw study which would require&#xD;
      patients to have blood drawn at three time points, pre-treatment, the day after treatment and&#xD;
      at their first follow up visit.&#xD;

EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 (QLQ C-30): 30-item self-report questionnaire rating items on a 4-point scale (1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;very much&quot;) It measures several domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning, fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting) and several single items. Scores are averaged for each scale and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score indicates better QoL on global health status and functional scales and worse QoL on symptom scales and financial difficulty scale.&#xD;
EORTC QLQ BN-20 (BN-20): 4 scales comprised of multiple items and 7 single items. All items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale, 1=not at all' to 4=very much, and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.&#xD;

          -  Metastatic brain tumor referred to radiation oncology for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Size of the presenting metastatic lesion up to 5.0 cm diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must give informed consent indicating they are aware of the investigational&#xD;
             nature of this treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70% (Zubrod score 0 to 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 14 days to start of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CBC and CMP within 30 days to start of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chest imaging (Chest Xray or Chest CT) within past 12 months, that does not show any&#xD;
             contraindication to hyperbaric therapy (if patient has had any thoracic surgery or&#xD;
             other significant event that might have affected the thorax such as trauma,&#xD;
             pneumothorax, chest tube insertion, pleurodesis, or thoracentesis and has not had&#xD;
             imaging since that event, then the imaging should be repeated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurosurgery Consult&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or women of childbearing potential without adequate contraception.&#xD;
             Contraception, which can include abstinence, is required since the last menstrual&#xD;
             period until completion of SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of pneumothorax (Untreated pneumothorax risks tension pneumothorax during&#xD;
             ascent in HBO chamber)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  COPD with C02 retention (Such patients can develop respiratory depression as HBO&#xD;
             reduces their hypoxemic drive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder (Note that patients on adequate antiepileptic&#xD;
             medications may receive HBO)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia resistant to medication (Pre-medication with anxiolytics is generally&#xD;
             sufficient for almost all anxious patients undergoing HBO treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of middle ear surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Failure to equalize pressure in the middle ear can cause displacement of middle&#xD;
                  ear structures with consequent hearing loss&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  To clarify: placement of a tympanostomy tube is not a contraindication to HBO,&#xD;
                  and in fact may improve tolerability of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleomycin administration (HBO can exacerbate interstitial pneumonitis in&#xD;
             such patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current cis-platinum chemotherapy, i.e. therapeutic levels in the bloodstream at the&#xD;
             time of HBO therapy. (HBO can increase cytotoxicity of cis-platinum)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled high blood pressure (HBO can increase systemic vascular resistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months (Increased&#xD;
             afterload due to HBO can increase myocardial workload)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac EF ≤ 35%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary edema can arise with HBO in certain patients with severe heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In patients with prior history of CHF, subsequent echocardiogram and ECG are&#xD;
                  required to establish EF&gt;35%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with disulfiram (Disulfiram inhibits superoxide dismutase and is not&#xD;
             approved for use concomitantly with hyperbaric oxygen therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug/alcohol dependence or abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of adequate social support structures, e.g. homelessness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors with potential confounding results on serum marker studies&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Small cell (neuroendocrine) carcinomas&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Carcinoid tumors&#xD;
