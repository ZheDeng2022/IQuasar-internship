  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study is designed to&#xD;
      determine whether injection of autologous fibroblasts can increase the mobility (decrease the&#xD;
      restriction) of burn scars. The study will assess the effects of azficel-T (autologous&#xD;
      fibroblasts) in subjects who have a unilateral burn scar that is no deeper than the fascia&#xD;
      (i.e., underlying structures including ligament, tendon, muscle, and bone must not contribute&#xD;
      to the restriction) and that is either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An axillary scar causing 20-60% restriction of shoulder adduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An anterior elbow scar causing 20-60% restriction of elbow extension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A dorsal or palmar lesion of a single finger causing 20-60% restriction of flexion or&#xD;
           extension&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will each receive 2 injections of azficel-T or placebo administered 14 days (± 7&#xD;
      days) apart (depending on cell availability) and will be followed for efficacy (including&#xD;
      range of motion measurements, scar pain and ability to perform activities) to Visit 7 and for&#xD;
      safety to Visit 9 at 1 year.&#xD;
