  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor nutritional status as evidenced by low body mass index, low muscle mass or low serum&#xD;
      albumin is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients.&#xD;
      Hypercatabolism induced by inflammation is widely considered the cause of uremic malnutrition&#xD;
      even though there is no clear evidence that hemodialysis patients with elevated C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) levels are at greater risk of losing weight or muscle mass. Conversely, there&#xD;
      is little data on whether dialysis patients with malnutrition and elevated C-reactive protein&#xD;
      levels would gain muscle mass with protein supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that protein supplementation during dialysis will improve muscle mass,&#xD;
      functional status and quality of life in inflamed malnourished hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, the objectives of the current proposal are to examine in malnourished (body mass&#xD;
      index &lt; 23 kg/m2 or serum creatinine &lt; 8 mg/dL) hemodialysis patients with inflammation (high&#xD;
      sensitivity CRP &gt; 3 mg/dL), the effects of protein supplementation on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Muscle mass as determined by creatinine kinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional status as assessed by 6 min walk&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality of life as assessed by Short Form -12 survey&#xD;

      Design: Open labeled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Randomization: Men and women aged 18 or older receiving care at the&#xD;
      University of Utah dialysis centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: Men and women on hemodialysis for at least for 3 months with malnutrition&#xD;
      (defined as Body Mass Index less than 23 kg/m2 or serum creatinine &lt; 8 mg/dL) will be&#xD;
      approached to determine whether they want to participate in the study. If they are&#xD;
      interested, the study purpose and procedures will be explained and informed consent obtained.&#xD;
      5 ml of screening blood will be obtained before dialysis to measure CRP. If it is greater&#xD;
      than &gt; 3 mg/dL, that individual will be eligible to participate in the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire on demographics (age, gender, race,&#xD;
      education), comorbid conditions, physical activity level and quality of life. Height, weight,&#xD;
      and waist circumference will be measured. Relevant data on dialysis, medications, laboratory&#xD;
      markers will be obtained from the electronic medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate to obtain screening blood draw in about 80 participants and that&#xD;
      about half of these will have elevated CRP and qualify to participate in the study. The 40&#xD;
      participants will receive dietary advice to increase protein intake to 1.2 g/kg/day and&#xD;
      monitored for 12 weeks. Then, each participant will receive 45 grams of liquid protein&#xD;
      supplement at each dialysis treatment for additional 12 weeks for total study duration of 24&#xD;
      weeks. Compliance and tolerance of the supplement will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein supplementation such as Boost, Procel or liquid supplements is used regularly in&#xD;
      dialysis patients. The protein supplement used in the study is Provide Sugar Free produced by&#xD;
      Provide Nutrition LC. The Food and Drug Administration regulates it as a nutrition&#xD;
      supplement. It is a liquid supplement made from enzyme hydrolyzed collagen protein. This&#xD;
      supplement is used in malnutrition, bariatric surgery, dialysis, poor appetite, and wound&#xD;
      care. The investigators chose this supplement because the investigators were able to get it&#xD;
      at a reduced cost. There is no data available to show that this supplement is better or worse&#xD;
      than any other supplements currently available. The manufacturer states that the sugar free&#xD;
      Provide is phosphorous free. However, the investigators will monitor phosphorous levels in&#xD;
      the study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-dialysis blood sample (15 ml in lithium heparin tube) and post dialysis blood sample (5&#xD;
      ml in lithium heparin tube) will be drawn at baseline, 4, 12, 16 and 20 weeks. Pre and post&#xD;
      dialysis creatinine along with 44-hour urine collection for creatinine will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks for estimating muscle mass using creatinine kinetics. Short&#xD;
      Form -12 survey for quality of life will be obtained at baseline 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Distances walked during in 6-minutes will be recorded at baseline, 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays of Serum analytes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interleukin-6 (IL-6): The measurement of serum IL-6 will be performed using an IMMULITE&#xD;
           1000 analyzer and reagents from Diagnostic Products Corporation. The performance&#xD;
           characteristics of this immunoassay include an analytic measurement range of 2 to 1000&#xD;
           pg/mL, imprecision of &lt;7.6% from 88 to 1000 pg/mL, and a reference interval of &lt;6 pg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha): The measurement of serum TNF- alpha will be&#xD;
           performed using an IMMULITE 1000 analyzer and reagents from Diagnostic Products&#xD;
           Corporation. The performance characteristics of this immunoassay include an analytic&#xD;
           measurement range of 2 to 1000 pg/mL, imprecision of &lt;6.6% from 17 to 788 pg/mL, and a&#xD;
           reference interval of &lt;8 pg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. high sensitivity CRP: The measurement of serum C-reactive protein will be performed&#xD;
           using the FDA-cleared Roche Tina-quant latex high sensitivity kit on a Roche MODULAR P&#xD;
           analyzer. The performance characteristics of this turbidimetric assay include an&#xD;
           analytic measurement range of 0.1 to 20 mg/L and imprecision of &lt;5.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Insulin: The measure of insulin will be performed using a Diagnostic Products&#xD;
           Corporation kit on an IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The performance characteristics of this&#xD;
           immunoassay include an analytic measurement range of 2 to 300 mIU/L , imprecision of&#xD;
           &lt;7.4% from 8 to 291 mIU/L, and a fasting reference interval of &lt;29 mIU/L.&#xD;
