  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tivozanib works in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Tivozanib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical activity of tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant,&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determining the potential survival advantage and characterizing the safety of single agent&#xD;
      tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tivozanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>ORR is defined as the number of patients with complete response plus those with partial response as measured by RECIST 1.1 where:&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Adverse events will be assessed by NCI CTCAE v 4.03. Adverse event that were determined to be serious adverse events (either grade 3, 4, or 5) related to study drug were collected. Grading is as follows:In general the following severity definitions are true:&#xD;
Mild (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities.&#xD;
Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities.&#xD;
Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.&#xD;
Life-threatening (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death.</description>

        <title>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</title>
        <description>CBR is defined as the number of patients with Complete Response (CR) plus those with Partial Response (PR) plus those with Stable Disease (SD) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 where:&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).&#xD;
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
