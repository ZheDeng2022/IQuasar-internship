    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study to characterize utilization&#xD;
      patterns of the FoundationOne™ test by oncologists under conditions of routine clinical&#xD;
      practice in the US. The study will also examine impact of test results on subsequent clinical&#xD;
      decisions regarding choice of therapy. The planned duration of the study is at least 2 years&#xD;
      with 1 year for patient recruitment and a minimum 1-year follow-up period for each patient.&#xD;
      Any patient for whom the treating physician has ordered a FoundationOne™ test and a report is&#xD;
      delivered is eligible for participation on the study. Eligible patients from participating&#xD;
      sites will be enrolled sequentially during the 1-year enrollment period. Sites will be&#xD;
      required to maintain an enrollment log of all patients for whom the FoundationOne™ test has&#xD;
      been ordered and document patient disposition and reasons for non-participation. All&#xD;
      treatment decisions and clinical assessment will be made at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician per usual care and are not mandated by study design or protocol. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from eligible patients prior to study entry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Molecular testing of tumors, using techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS),&#xD;
      facilitates an individualized approach to cancer treatment by sub-classifying diseases on an&#xD;
      individual basis. Physicians can utilize an in depth understanding of disease at a molecular&#xD;
      level to optimize therapy by selecting the most appropriate drugs and therapeutic targets.&#xD;
      Genomic profiling has identified multiple genomic aberrations that are predictive markers for&#xD;
      treatment response with targeted therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FoundationOne™ is a commercially available molecular diagnostics test, for all solid tumor&#xD;
      types, that analyzes routine clinical specimens for somatic alterations in relevant&#xD;
      cancer-related genes. This validated in vitro diagnostic test, is performed in a single&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified and College of American&#xD;
      Pathologists (CAP) approved laboratory at Foundation Medicine, Inc. It provides&#xD;
      individualized, potentially actionable information regarding a patient's molecular cancer&#xD;
      subtype that can be used by physicians to tailor treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the recent commercial availability of the FoundationOne™ test, knowledge gaps exist&#xD;
      regarding practice patterns associated with the use of this test in routine clinical practice&#xD;
      and the impact of this test on clinical decision making. There is limited information&#xD;
      regarding physician and patient characteristics that determine which patients receive the&#xD;
      test, rationale for patient selection, and how physicians interpret and use the test results.&#xD;
      Findings from this study will help to optimize patient selection and maximize the clinical&#xD;
      impact of the test in terms of guiding therapy.&#xD;

        This Pilot Study will aim to enroll approximately 500 patients from a total of 40 oncology&#xD;
        centers in the US over a 1-year time period. Any patient for whom the treating physician&#xD;
        has ordered the FoundationOne test is eligible for inclusion in the study. In order to&#xD;
        capture real-world treatment patterns, site recruitment will aim to include approximately&#xD;
        80% of sites (and 80% of patients) from the community oncology setting. Enrollment will be&#xD;
        competitive and each site will be capped at a maximum of 15 patients.&#xD;
