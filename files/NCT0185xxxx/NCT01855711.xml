    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory study aiming (i) to obtain clinical experience of GR68755 in&#xD;
      Japanese subjects with severe d-IBS to explore the feasibility of the next phase study and&#xD;
      (ii) to obtain reference data for endpoints and dosage and administration of a next phase&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to obtain the clinical experience of GR68755 1 mg QD in Japanese&#xD;
      female subjects with severe d-IBS who have frequent bowel urgency and to obtain exploratory&#xD;
      efficacy and safety data that can be used as reference for endpoints and dosage and&#xD;
      administration of a next phase clinical study in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving a written informed consent, subjects will undergo essential observation and&#xD;
      examinations during the screening phase and subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      enter into the treatment phase. When subjects enter into the treatment phase, the subjects&#xD;
      will administer GR68755 1 mg tablets QD in the morning every day for 28 days from the next&#xD;
      day of receiving the investigational products.&#xD;
