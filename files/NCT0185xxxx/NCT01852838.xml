    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer, killing ~1.3 million people worldwide every year.&#xD;
      Early diagnosis could increase its survival by 3-4 folds. Therefore the yield of screening&#xD;
      for lung cancer is not a question anymore and the urgent unmet need is to define the group&#xD;
      that is under a high risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our lab is focusing on revealing non-invasive biomarkers as for early detection of lung&#xD;
      cancer. This study specifically focuses on biomarkers that are found in exhaled breath. These&#xD;
      biomarkers are known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs).The VOCs' profile can discriminate&#xD;
      between those who suffer from lung cancer and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that a cancer cell can activate their glycolysis (glucose degradation)&#xD;
      pathway in order to survive. This links malignant processes with this basic biochemical,&#xD;
      metabolic cycle. This study will focus on the unique processes incurred by glycolysis in the&#xD;
      tumor cells and its effect on the surrounding environment. By better understanding and&#xD;
      revealing the exact mechanism, it will become possible to identify the biomarkers released by&#xD;
      malignant cells that use glycolysis as a source of energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's goal is to identify and analyze those distinguishing VOCs. The hope is that&#xD;
      these VOCs will provide a new innovative possibility of developing the so desperately needed,&#xD;
      early-detection lung cancer screening method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will collect and analyze the exhaled breath of participants. The exhaled breath&#xD;
      will be obtained before and after a glucose challenge test, in which the participant is asked&#xD;
      to drink a solution containing water and glucose. This study will involve a total of seventy&#xD;
      participants, fifty of which currently suffer from active lung cancer, while the remaining&#xD;
      participants belong to a high-risk group.&#xD;

      The Contribution of induced Glycolysis to the Exhaled Volatile Organic Compounds' (VOCs)&#xD;
      Signature in Lung Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer is infamous for its cruel mortality rates as it is the most lethal cancer in both&#xD;
      men and women. Unfortunately, most lung cancers are detected and diagnosed at a very advanced&#xD;
      stage and this complicates treatment options. Therefore, there is dire, unmet need to develop&#xD;
      an effective, highly sensitive, highly specific and non-invasive screening method. The&#xD;
      solution to this problem may be found in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are organic&#xD;
      molecules identified in exhaled breath. These VOCs differ between those individuals who&#xD;
      suffer from lung cancer and healthy individuals. Seeing as increased glycolysis is one of the&#xD;
      characteristic patterns of malignancies, the purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      contribution of induced glycolysis to these exhaled VOCs. Therefore, this study will compare&#xD;
      exhaled breath samples in individuals who suffer from lung cancer before and after a glucose&#xD;
      challenge test. This study aims to better understand the mechanisms involved in order to&#xD;
      identify the distinguishing VOCs. This may aid in developing the so necessary diagnostic&#xD;
      means for lung cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lung cancer is the moth lethal cancer in both men and women. [1] There are two main&#xD;
           classes of lung cancer: the first, Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) which is often referred&#xD;
           to as Oat Cell Cancer, and the second being Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), which&#xD;
           constitutes the majority of cases of lung cancer. [2] Unfortunately, most lung cancer&#xD;
           detection and diagnosis is performed when the cancer is in an advanced, metastatic stage&#xD;
           in which surgery is not a viable treatment option. [3] Thus, detection and diagnosis its&#xD;
           early stages may significantly improve the five year survival rate as well as provide&#xD;
           the possibility of a cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An effective, non-invasive lung cancer screening method for distinguishing biological&#xD;
           markers found in high-risk groups has yet to be developed. Lately, researchers have&#xD;
           begun considering Volatile Organic Compounds' (VOCs) templates as a possible means for&#xD;
           early detection. These VOCs can be retrieved and isolated from exhaled breath samples.&#xD;
           The VOCs reflect the unique metabolic and biochemical activity in malignant cells. This&#xD;
           association has been proven in several researchers as well as in our own group [4] who&#xD;
           has shown that not only can VOCs distinguish between healthy and affected individuals,&#xD;
           but they can even discern between SCLC and NSCLC. [5, 6] The current research will focus&#xD;
           on the detection, identification and the characterization of these unique biological&#xD;
           markers found in the exhaled breath of those who suffer from lung cancer. Amongst those&#xD;
           VOCs which are detected, this research will specifically focus on those VOCs which hold&#xD;
           the potential to be incorporated into an effective, non-invasive screening method for&#xD;
           lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Carcinogenesis is a process that is bound to somatic evolution. One of the most popular&#xD;
           evolutionary advantages found in malignant, metastatic cells is the increased uptake of&#xD;
           glucose through the process of glycolysis. This glycolysis process is unique to&#xD;
           malignant cell because it is most pronounced in anaerobic conditions, whereas healthy&#xD;
           cells most often perform glycolysis in aerobic conditions. Anaerobic glycolysis- the&#xD;
           process of the conversion of glucose to lactic acid in the presence of oxygen- is also&#xD;
           known as the &quot;Warburg Effect&quot; after Otto Warburg who discovered this characteristic. [7]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, some of the distinguishing processes found in malignant cells are the exceeded&#xD;
           rate of substance exchange and increased glucose degradation (Warburg Effect). These&#xD;
           processes release organic compounds, some of which are released into exhaled breath.&#xD;
           Therefore, this research will examine the relationship between a glucose challenge test&#xD;
           and its effect on the pattern on VOCs in exhaled breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The template for organic particles in exhaled breath discriminates between those&#xD;
           individuals who suffer from active lung cancer from those individuals who are considered&#xD;
           healthy. The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of the process of&#xD;
           glycolysis to this unique template. Being that the process of glycolysis is accelerated&#xD;
           in malignant cells, we hypothesize that the glucose challenge test will express VOC in&#xD;
           those individuals who suffer from the disease. These findings can contribute to the&#xD;
           development of diagnostic tools for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that the Warburg Effect is an essential component in the creation of VOCs&#xD;
           that are unique to lung cancer, and therefore, that the glucose challenge test will&#xD;
           increase the production of these VOCs. These markers hold the potential to create a more&#xD;
           effective, non-invasive screening method with improved sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Research Design: This research is an observational case-control study assesses the&#xD;
      comparison between the VOCs samples obtained from exhaled breath samples and blood tests&#xD;
      taken before and after a glucose challenge test. The glucose challenge test involves drinking&#xD;
      a solution which contains 75 grams of glucose and a waiting period of 90 minutes between the&#xD;
      collection of exhaled breath and blood samples. There is a need to fast for six hours before&#xD;
      this test. In addition, a clinical assessment will be performed based on the medical&#xD;
      anamnesis and on existing, current medical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Study Population: The goal of this research is to determine if the process of glycolysis&#xD;
      contributes to the unique VOC pattern in the exhaled breath of those who are affected with&#xD;
      lung cancer. The participants will be chosen from individuals that are currently being&#xD;
      treated in pulmonology clinics for various reasons. The control group will include&#xD;
      participants that have been identified as high-risk individuals for lung cancer, whereas the&#xD;
      study group will include participants who suffer from active lung cancer but have not yet&#xD;
      begun any form of medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment process will be performed in two consecutive stages. In the first stage,&#xD;
      twenty patients from the study group will be compared to the twenty participants from the&#xD;
      control group. At this point, a preliminary assessment of the data will be performed to find&#xD;
      differences in the VOCs between these two groups. Only in the event that these differences&#xD;
      are found will the research go on to the second stage, in which 30 more participants will be&#xD;
      recruited and tested for the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group as previously mentioned will include 20 participants that do not have lung&#xD;
      cancer, but are similar to the research group in terms of age, gender, medical history, and&#xD;
      history of smoking. This classification will be performed based off the self-report surveys&#xD;
      completed by the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criterions for the study population are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients that are uninterested to participant and/or unable to sign a consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lung Cancer patients who have begun treatment prior to this research&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who are unable to complete this research and/or the follow up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Individuals that suffer from diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Research Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variables which will be used to test our hypothesis are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological variables of the participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative data defining the malignant cells ( TMN, the size of the tumor, number of&#xD;
           metastases and their location)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The glucose levels( via a dipstick) before and after the glucose challenge test&#xD;
           (requires a fast of 6 hours prior to the test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VOCs pattern obtained from the exhaled breath samples and the characterization of&#xD;
           these molecules via the GCMS method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Anamnesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A collection of the details of the patient's medical history will be obtained. Information&#xD;
      such as gender, age, medical history, consumption of tobacco and family history will be&#xD;
      noted. In addition, information which quantifies and qualifies the malignant cells (if&#xD;
      present) will be collected and recorded. This includes details such as the type of tumor as&#xD;
      well as its place, volume, histological characteristics and imaging results. Some of the&#xD;
      medical information will be obtained from pre-existing updated medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled Breath Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo an exhaled breath test before and after the glucose challenge&#xD;
      test with a lay period of 90 minutes in between the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed explanation regarding the process of collection of the exhaled breath samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will exhale 3 breaths (with 750 ml in each exhaled breath) into appropriate Mylar&#xD;
      bags in a sterile area with technology that ensures that the exhaled breath is isolated and&#xD;
      unaffected from the external environment. The contents of the Mylar bags will be stored in&#xD;
      TENAX samples which preserves the samples for a period of six months. The samples will&#xD;
      undergo additional analysis at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) under the&#xD;
      auspices of Professor Haim Hussam. Each sample will be analyzed for the purposes of&#xD;
      identifying VOCs via the GC-MS method. The sample will undergo additional processing such as&#xD;
      SPME (pre-concentration into solid-phase micro extraction). The SPME will be transferred to&#xD;
      the GC-MS. The GC-MS method allows for the identification of the compounds in a short period&#xD;
      of time via the use of chromatographic and spectroscopic instruments. The spectroscopic&#xD;
      instrument will undergo additional analysis via the AOS instrument. The AOS includes&#xD;
      detectors which are conjugated to nano-particles of gold. Each detector identifies a wide&#xD;
      variety of VOCs in accordance to their location and concentration which cause varying levels&#xD;
      of resistance. This response is recorded and will undergo statistical analysis via PCA to&#xD;
      focus on the specific VOC patterns found in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed explanation of the process of the glucose challenge test is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant is requested to drink a sugary solution (273 ml) constituted from 75 grams of&#xD;
      glucose and water. The test requires that the participant fast for a period of 6 hours before&#xD;
      the test. After drinking the solution, the participant must wait a lay period of 90 minutes&#xD;
      before the retest of his or her exhaled breath. In addition, the level of glucose will be&#xD;
      tested by a dipstick before drinking the solution, and after the 90 minute lay period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Statistical Analysis: The sample size is 70 persons ( 40 persons in the first stage, and&#xD;
      an additional 30 participants in the second stage as explained above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expectation is that there will be a significant difference between the VOC template&#xD;
      before and after the glucose challenge test. The estimated difference of effect is around&#xD;
      30%, with the assumption that the sampling error stands at around 10% and with a confidence&#xD;
      interval of 95%. The number of necessary participants needed in order to achieve results with&#xD;
      statistical significance and size effect ranges from approximately 20-25 persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information from the AOS which recorded the changes in resistance will be analyzed via&#xD;
      PCA to focus on the specific VOC pattern changes obtained in each sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining variables which were measured quantitatively will be presented in averages with&#xD;
      their corresponding standard deviations. Those variables that were obtained quantitatively&#xD;
      will be presented as percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for significance will be performed by the following statistical tests:&#xD;
      Student's T Test, Chi-Square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and the Kruskal-Wallis test. All&#xD;
      statistical tests will be performed on the SPSS computer program.&#xD;
