    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are early onset chronic conditions coined by deficits in&#xD;
      social reciprocity, communication and stereotypic interests and activities. Other functional&#xD;
      impairments such as mental retardation, ADHD, known genetic syndromes and epilepsy are&#xD;
      frequent coexisting problems. ASD cause considerable suffering for the affected individuals&#xD;
      and burden for their families. With an estimated prevalence exceeding 1%, recent&#xD;
      population-based studies suggest that ASD are no rare phenomena. Lifetime societal costs for&#xD;
      services and support, together with the opportunity costs of lost productivity in a&#xD;
      prototypic developed country are estimated SEK 15.6 million for someone with and SEK 10.3&#xD;
      million for a person without co-existing mental retardation. Despite ongoing efforts, no&#xD;
      diagnostically informative biomarker has yet been identified for ASD. The development,&#xD;
      refinement and evaluation of behavioral assessment tools has therefore been decisive to&#xD;
      progress and quality assurance in ASD clinical practice and research. The most widely used&#xD;
      and thoroughly evaluated instruments for ASD in international child mental health are the&#xD;
      Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule&#xD;
      (ADOS). The ADI-R and ADOS are deemed highly by the ASD expert community and thus commonly&#xD;
      labeled as being the &quot;gold standard&quot; in ASD diagnostics. Although, Swedish translations of&#xD;
      the ADI-R and ADOS exist, a Swedish standardization and cross-cultural validation is still&#xD;
      lacking, impeding good clinical practice and research prerequisites for ASD in Sweden. The&#xD;
      applied project seeks to broadly establish reliability and validity of the Swedish&#xD;
      translations of the ADI-R and ADOS in order to enhance evidence-based clinical practice and&#xD;
      stimulate internationally competitive ASD research in Sweden.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study seeks to determine for the first time the reliability and validity of the&#xD;
      Swedish versions of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)and Autism Diagnostic&#xD;
      Observation Schedule (ADOS). The combination of these two assessments is deemed the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; of diagnosing ASD in international practice and research. ADI-R and ADOS are widely&#xD;
      used (translated into 15 languages) and have been rigorously and convincingly evaluated in&#xD;
      other countries. The Swedish translations of the ADI-R (interview schedule, algorithms) and&#xD;
      ADOS (observation schedules, algorithms) have not yet been tested for scientific properties&#xD;
      and feasibility, hampering best clinical practice, evidence-based diagnostics and research&#xD;
      premises for ASD in Sweden. Therefore, this study aims at standardizing the Swedish forms of&#xD;
      the ADI-R and ADOS to and ensure their cross-cultural validity and clinical utility. A&#xD;
      particular objective of the study is to establish the agreement of ADI-R and ADOS with&#xD;
      register-based diagnoses. The latter is of paramount importance for judging the significance&#xD;
      and generalizability of findings from large scale register research, which is a specific&#xD;
      strength of Swedish science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADI-R is a clinical diagnostic instrument for assessing ASDs in children, adolescents and&#xD;
      adults. The ADI-R provides a diagnostic algorithm for autism as described in both the ICD-10&#xD;
      and DSM-IV-TR and necessary information for making a diagnosis of other ASD in accord with&#xD;
      the classification manuals. The ADI-R is appropriate for children and adults with mental ages&#xD;
      from about 18 months and above. It is a standardized, semi-structured clinical review for&#xD;
      caregivers of children, adolescents and adults. The interview contains 93 items on three&#xD;
      content areas: quality of social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive,&#xD;
      restricted and stereotyped interests and behavior. The measure also includes other items&#xD;
      relevant for treatment planning, such as self-injury and over-activity. Responses are scored&#xD;
      by the clinician based on the caregiver's description of the child's behavior. All questions&#xD;
      ask about current behavior, with the exception of a few behaviors that only occur during&#xD;
      specific age periods. In addition to asking about current behavior, each question focuses on&#xD;
      the time period when the behaviors were likely to be most pronounced - generally, between the&#xD;
      ages of 4 and 5 years. The interview starts with an introductory question followed by&#xD;
      questions about the subject's early development. The next 41 questions cover verbal and&#xD;
      nonverbal communication. Questions 50 through 66 ask about social development and play. The&#xD;
      next 13 questions deal with interests and behaviors. The final 14 questions ask about&#xD;
      &quot;general behavior,&quot; including questions about memory skills, motor skills, over-activity and&#xD;
      fainting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADI-R interview generates scores in each of the three content areas. Elevated scores&#xD;
      indicate problematic behavior in a particular area. Scores are based on the clinician's&#xD;
      judgment following the caregiver's report of the child's behavior and development. For each&#xD;
      item, the clinician gives a score ranging from 0 (not autistic) to 3 (severely autistic). A&#xD;
      classification of autism is given when scores in all three content areas of communication,&#xD;
      social interaction, and patterns of behavior meet or exceed the specified cutoffs, and onset&#xD;
      of the disorder is evident by 36 months of age. For other ASD information from the ADI-R is&#xD;
      used informally: e.g. a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome is indicated, if the criteria for&#xD;
      autism are fulfilled in face of normal language development, or a diagnosis of PDD-NOS, if&#xD;
      social interaction deficits and another behavior domain exceed the cut-offs. This&#xD;
      interviewer-based instrument requires substantial training in administration and scoring. A&#xD;
      trained clinician can administer the ADI-R to the parent of a child suspected of autism in&#xD;
      approximately 2 ½ hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADOS is a semi-structured assessment of communication, social interaction and play or&#xD;
      imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism or other ASD. It&#xD;
      consists of four modules (plus a new toddler module), each of which is appropriate for&#xD;
      children, adolescents and adults of differing developmental and language levels, ranging from&#xD;
      no expressive or receptive language to verbally fluent adults. The ADOS builds on standard&#xD;
      activities that allow the examiner to observe the occurrence or non-occurrence of behaviors&#xD;
      that have been identified as important to the diagnosis ASDs across developmental levels and&#xD;
      chronological ages. The examiner selects the module that is most appropriate for a particular&#xD;
      child, adolescent and adult on the basis of his/her expressive language level and&#xD;
      chronological age. Structured activities and materials, and less structured interactions,&#xD;
      provide standard contexts in which social, communicative and other behaviors relevant to ASDs&#xD;
      are observed. In effect, the ADOS provides a 30 to 60 minute observation period during which&#xD;
      the examiner presents the individual being assessed with numerous opportunities to exhibit&#xD;
      behaviors of interest in the diagnosis of ASD through standard 'presses' for communication&#xD;
      and social interaction. Module 1 is intended for individuals who do not consistently use&#xD;
      phrase speech Module 2 is intended for individuals with some phrase speech who are not&#xD;
      verbally fluent. Module 3 is intended for children for whom playing with toys is age-&#xD;
      appropriate who are verbally fluent. Module 4 is intended for verbally fluent adolescents and&#xD;
      adults. Though the superficial appearance of the different modules is quite varied, the&#xD;
      general principles involving the deliberate variation of the examiner's behavior using a&#xD;
      hierarchy of structured and unstructured social behaviors are the same. The standardization&#xD;
      of the ADOS lies in the hierarchy of behavior employed by the examiner and the kinds of&#xD;
      behaviors taken into account in each activity during the overall ratings. The activities&#xD;
      serve to structure the interaction; they are not ends in themselves. The object is not to&#xD;
      test specific cognitive abilities or other skills in the activities, but to have tasks that&#xD;
      are sufficiently intriguing that the child or adult being assessed will want to participate.&#xD;
      What the examiners not do is often as important as what they do. The ADOS is not trivial to&#xD;
      administer, so that priori training is advised even for experienced clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modules consist of between 10 to 15 activities with up to 31 accompanying items to code.&#xD;
      Comparable to the ADI-R, items are scored 0 to 3 depending on the presence and severity of&#xD;
      observed symptoms. Subsets of items in each module are used to generate diagnostic algorithms&#xD;
      for each module. Items and the thresholds for classification of autism and other ASDs differ&#xD;
      for each module. In the new diagnostic algorithms, classification is made on the basis of&#xD;
      exceeding thresholds for social affect (social and communication domain combined), restricted&#xD;
      and repetitive behaviors and a total score of both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on the reliability (e.g. internal consistency, inter rater, retest) and validity&#xD;
      (e.g. diagnostic) of the original and many international adaptations of the ADI-R and ADOS&#xD;
      have been satisfactory to excellent throughout. For instance, the initial work on the&#xD;
      psychometric properties of the English ADI-R showed multi rater weighted Kappas almost&#xD;
      exclusively exceeding .65 for all algorithms items, internal consistency ranging from .69&#xD;
      (stereotypies) to .95 (social interaction domain) and item retest reliabilities of mean&#xD;
      weighted Kappa = .72. Diagnostic validity studies showed a classification accuracy of 94%&#xD;
      compared to clinical expert consensus diagnosis. Comparable data is available for example for&#xD;
      the German, Bulgarian, Greek and Dutch versions. The recently presented revised diagnostic&#xD;
      algorithms of the ADOS showed sensitivities of &gt;.91 and specificities of &gt;.84 for the&#xD;
      discrimination of autism and non-spectrum conditions in N = 1630 individuals with at least&#xD;
      some words speech. The diagnostic validity of the new algorithms has been cross-validated and&#xD;
      also demonstrated excellent psychometric values in independent cross-cultural studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and complementary assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Located at the clinical sites or Karolinska Institute Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders&#xD;
      (KIND), we will examine subjects with suspicion of ASD, other mental disorders and typically&#xD;
      developing using the ADI-R and the ADOS. Testing for general intellectual abilities will also&#xD;
      be carried-out using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV, a multidimensional IQ&#xD;
      test-battery to determine general IQ, performance and verbal IQ as well as a profile of&#xD;
      intellectual capacities. They comprises core and supplemental subtests forming composite&#xD;
      neuropsychological scores. In addition, the Raven matrices are collected, especially to cover&#xD;
      ASD cases who show problems with IQ testing using the Wechsler's, e.g. due to low IQ or low&#xD;
      verbal skills. Before using the instruments, involved researchers will receive extended&#xD;
      training for these scales by the applicant, who is a certificated clinical neuropsychologist&#xD;
      and recognized ADI-R and ADOS trainer. Other Swedish trainers for the ADI-R and ADOS&#xD;
      (Vivianne Nordin, Eric Zander, Karin Olafsdottir) are included in these assessments. For&#xD;
      subsequent inter rater reliability analyses all administrations are videotaped. Up to 10&#xD;
      independent raters skilled on the ADI-R and ADOS, but blind to the children's diagnoses or&#xD;
      history, rate these videos in the course of the study. In order to determine retest&#xD;
      reliability half of the participants re-examined after three months by an independent&#xD;
      examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent DSM-IV-TR/ICD-10 consensus diagnoses on all participants are established by&#xD;
      experienced clinicians (child psychiatrists, clinical child psychologists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Reliability ADI-R&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Internal consistency will be calculated for the three ADI-R algorithm behavior domain&#xD;
           scales: social interaction, communication, repetitive-stereotyped behavior using&#xD;
           Cronbach's alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Multirater reliability is determined for the ADI-R between four independent raters for&#xD;
           all algorithm items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement,&#xD;
           (weighted) Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retest reliability for the ADI-R is computed for a three-month interval on all algorithm&#xD;
           items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement, (weighted)&#xD;
           Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Reliability ADOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Internal consistency will be calculated for the three ADOS algorithm behavior domain&#xD;
           scales: social interaction, communication, repetitive-stereotyped behavior using&#xD;
           Cronbach's alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ADOS multi-rater reliability is determined between four independent raters for all&#xD;
           algorithm items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement,&#xD;
           (weighted) Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retest reliability for the ADOS is computed for a three-month interval on all algorithm&#xD;
           items, the three behavior domains and overall diagnosis using % agreement, (weighted)&#xD;
           Kappa and Pearson product moment correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/patient gain/impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value and impact of the study for clinical practice and research on ASD in Sweden have&#xD;
      been pointed-out several times before in this application. ASD are no rare disorders,&#xD;
      affecting 1% of the general population, causing substantial burden to affected individuals,&#xD;
      their families and society. The combined usage of the ADI-R and the ADOS is viewed the gold&#xD;
      standard of diagnosing ASD in international child and adolescent psychiatry. They are also&#xD;
      valuable tools for intervention and educational planning, and unlike many other scales,&#xD;
      continuously updated and improved. Their introduction has been decisive for progress in many&#xD;
      fields of basic and applied ASD research. Most guidelines for diagnosing and treating ASD of&#xD;
      professional Societies list them as first choice instruments. Both of them have been adapted&#xD;
      and successfully evaluated for many languages and cultures. Thus they are considered the best&#xD;
      clinical practice scales for ASD. Unfortunately, they have not yet been standardized in&#xD;
      Sweden, impeding better clinical practice for patients, the availability of evidence-based&#xD;
      instruments for clinicians, and research prerequisites on ASD in Sweden. The present study&#xD;
      aims at filling this gap, by broadly establishing reliability and validity of the Swedish&#xD;
      translations of the ADI-R and ADOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this is a study aiming at a long-term improvement of clinical and scientific&#xD;
      structures in Sweden. Its impact will mean enhancing evidence-based clinical practice for&#xD;
      patients and experts and a stimulation of internationally competitive ASD research in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
