  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects on this study have a type of lymph gland cancer called Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, acute&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (these diseases will be referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;lymphoma&quot; or &quot;leukemia&quot;). The lymphoma or leukemia has come back or has not gone away after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No one way seems perfect for&#xD;
      fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells, hoping that they will work together. Both antibodies and T cells have&#xD;
      been used to treat patients with cancer. They have shown promise, but have not been strong&#xD;
      enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cells can kill tumor cells but normally there are not enough of them to kill all the tumor&#xD;
      cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the&#xD;
      laboratory and then given them back to the person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. It first came from mice that have&#xD;
      developed immunity to human lymphoma. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a&#xD;
      substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been used to treat&#xD;
      people with lymphoma and leukemia. For this study, anti-CD19 has been changed so that instead&#xD;
      of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to&#xD;
      a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, the investigators found that T cells work better if they also add proteins&#xD;
      that stimulate T cells, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells last longer&#xD;
      in the body but not long enough for them to be able to kill the lymphoma cells. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that if they add an extra stimulating protein, called CD137, the cells&#xD;
      will have a better chance of killing the lymphoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to see if this is true by putting the CD19 chimeric receptor with&#xD;
      CD28 alone into half of the cells and the CD19 chimeric receptor with CD28 and CD137 into the&#xD;
      other half of the cells. These CD19 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 and with or without&#xD;
      CD137 are investigational products not approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe, to&#xD;
      see how long the T cell with each sort of chimeric receptor lasts, to learn what the side&#xD;
      effects are and to see whether this therapy might help people with lymphoma or leukemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will give the investigators blood to make CD19 CD28 (with and without CD137)&#xD;
      chimeric receptor-T cells in the laboratory. These cells will be grown and frozen. To make&#xD;
      the T cells, investigators will take blood (or blood from a donor) and stimulate it with&#xD;
      growth factors to make the T cells grow. To get the CD19 antibody and CD28 (with or without&#xD;
      CD137) to attach to the surface of the T cell, they will insert the antibody gene into the T&#xD;
      cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and&#xD;
      will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps to find the T cells in&#xD;
      the blood after injecting them; in order to tell them apart investigators have made two&#xD;
      viruses that are slightly different because one has CD137. These two viruses can be told&#xD;
      apart by a special laboratory test. Because the patient will receive cells with a new gene in&#xD;
      them, the patient will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term&#xD;
      side effects of gene transfer. If the patient cannot visit the clinic, he or she will be&#xD;
      contacted by the research coordinator or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When subjects enroll on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD19 chimeric receptor-T&#xD;
      cells. Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate&#xD;
      and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T&#xD;
      cells in circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of that, if the subject's level of circulating T cells is relatively high, s/he may&#xD;
      receive one treatment of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine if the doctor thinks this&#xD;
      is appropriate. This drug will decrease the numbers of the subject's own T cells before&#xD;
      infusion of the CD19 chimeric receptor T cells. If subject is already receiving chemotherapy,&#xD;
      this may not be needed. The investigators would prefer subjects do not receive other&#xD;
      chemotherapy until 6 weeks after cell infusion but they can do so if their doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is medically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV at the assigned&#xD;
      dose. The injection will take about 20 minutes. The investigators will follow them in the&#xD;
      clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after a 6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be experiencing&#xD;
      a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms), s/he may be&#xD;
      able to receive up to five additional doses of the T cells if s/he wishes. The first repeat&#xD;
      infusion can only take place at least 6 weeks after the first infusion. Any additional&#xD;
      infusions after that would be at least 4 weeks apart. All additional infusions will be at the&#xD;
      same dose level received the first time or a lower dose. The treatment will be given by the&#xD;
      Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
