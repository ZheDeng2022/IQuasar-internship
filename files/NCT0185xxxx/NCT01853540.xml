      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial (PNTM) infection is caused by a common type of&#xD;
           bacteria in the environment. Although PNTM infection is most common in people with lung&#xD;
           diseases, it can also affect healthy people. It can be difficult to treat, and affects&#xD;
           parts of the body other than the lungs. For example, PNTM may affect the cilia, the&#xD;
           hair-like structures inside the nose and lungs that help move dirt and debris out of the&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) is a measurement of how fast cilia move. People with PNTM&#xD;
           infection have a lower CBF than healthy people. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas in the body&#xD;
           that may affect CBF. People with PNTM infection produce lower amounts of NO in their&#xD;
           noses than healthy people. Researchers want to see if a drug called sildenafil can&#xD;
           increase NO production and CBF. If sildenafil can improve these measurements, it may be&#xD;
           a useful treatment for PNTM infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effect of sildenafil on CBF and NO levels in people with PNTM infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have PNTM infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be enrolled in a related National Institutes of Health study on&#xD;
           bacterial infections. The study is Natural History, Genetics, Phenotype and Treatment of&#xD;
           Mycobacterial Infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have heart and lung function tests, as well as tests of NO production in the nose. They&#xD;
           will provide samples of sputum and cells from inside the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the first study visit, participants will collect sputum samples for 24 hours.&#xD;
           They will bring the samples to the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will have heart and lung function tests, as well&#xD;
           as tests of NO production in the nose. They will provide blood, urine, sputum, and nasal&#xD;
           cell samples. They will also receive sildenafil tablets to take at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take sildenafil tablets three times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second study visit will be 7 days after the first one. The tests from the first&#xD;
           visit will be repeated. Participants will receive more sildenafil tablets to take on the&#xD;
           same schedule as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third and final study visit will be 30 days after the first one. The tests from the&#xD;
           first visit will be repeated. Participants will stop taking sildenafil at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up phone call will be made about 2 weeks after the final study visit. This call&#xD;
           will ask questions about quality of life and any symptoms or side effects of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial (PNTM) infection has increased over the past several&#xD;
      decades, especially in older women. No consistent immunological abnormalities have been found&#xD;
      despite extensive investigation. In cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia,&#xD;
      mucociliary dysfunction predisposes individuals to high rates of PNTM disease that increases&#xD;
      markedly with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We studied the respiratory biology of subjects with PNTM and healthy controls and found&#xD;
      decreased levels of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in vivo. Ex vivo analysis of ciliated&#xD;
      respiratory epithelium from subjects with PNTM demonstrated an abnormally low resting ciliary&#xD;
      beat frequency (CBF) and an abnormal response to toll-like receptor ([TLR]2,TLR3, TLR5,&#xD;
      TLR7/8, and TLR9) agonists, compared with respiratory samples from healthy controls. The low&#xD;
      CBF response was normalized ex vivo by augmenting the nitricoxide-cyclic guanosine&#xD;
      monophosphate pathway; this supplementation had no appreciable effect on the differences in&#xD;
      TLR responses observed in subjects with PNTM and healthy controls. The reduced CBF and nNO&#xD;
      levels in these subjects reveal possible mechanisms of susceptibility to respiratory&#xD;
      infections, as well as possible avenues of directed investigation and therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, interventional study evaluating the effects of sildenafil on CBF in&#xD;
      subjects with PNTM infection. The study will also measure the effects of sildenafil on nNO,&#xD;
      and it will evaluate the quality of life, exertional capacity, pulmonary function, lower&#xD;
      airway microbiology, inflammatory markers, and the safety and tolerability of sildenafil&#xD;
      treatment in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 5 subjects will receive an oral bolus of sildenafil (40 mg) on day 0 followed by an&#xD;
      oral dose of 20 mg 3 times a day (tid) starting on day 1 for approximately 6 days until the&#xD;
      study visit on day 7. The remaining 5 subjects will receive an oral dose of sildenafil (20&#xD;
      mg) tid on day 0 for approximately 1 week until the study visit on day 7. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      dose will be increased for all subjects to 40 mg tid and will be administered for another 3&#xD;
      weeks until the study visit on day 30 (4 weeks in total). Administering an initial oral bolus&#xD;
      will help us examine sildenafil s immediate effects on CBF and safety parameters. The dosing&#xD;
      necessary to modulate CBF in this subject population is not yet known, thus, we feel that&#xD;
      undertaking a dose-ranging study will allow a thorough evaluation of sildenafil s effects on&#xD;
      CBF.&#xD;
