      The purpose of this research study is to establish a way to help the development of targeted&#xD;
      treatments in autism spectrum disorders. This may also help in early diagnosis of autism and&#xD;
      may possibly predict severity. The study will compare subject's ERK (extracellular&#xD;
      signal-related kinase) signaling to age- and gender-matched neurotypical controls and&#xD;
      Intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched developmental disabilities.&#xD;

      For the ERK activation assay, about 5 mL of whole blood is layered onto 3 mL Histopaque in a&#xD;
      15 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuged. The lymphocyte-containing cell layer is removed and&#xD;
      transferred for washing. After a second wash, cells are resuspended and rested. They are then&#xD;
      stimulated by addition of phorbol myristate acetate and sample aliquots are removed at short&#xD;
      intervals, fixed and permeabilized. Fixed, permeabilized cells are stained by addition of&#xD;
      Alexafluor488-labeled monoclonal antibody to phospho-ERK in the dark for 30 min. Washed,&#xD;
      resuspended cells are analyzed in a Coulter flow cytometer.&#xD;

        The subjects with autism will be recruited through the clinic population at Cincinnati&#xD;
        Children's Hospital Medical Center. Recruitment of subjects will be conducted by notifying&#xD;
        via, IRB approved electronic and paper ads, individuals with autistic disorder, their&#xD;
        families, treating clinicians and agencies throughout the referral base of CCHMC and those&#xD;
        within our existing clinical services, residential facilities, schools and group homes for&#xD;
        the developmentally disabled.&#xD;

&#xD;
        IQ-Matched Control Subjects: Those subjects who are included in the study based on having&#xD;
        an IQ and age that matches the IQ and age of an Autistic Disorder Subject who has an IQ&#xD;

        based on having an age matched to the age of an Autistic Disorder Subject and a history of&#xD;
        normal development. Age-Matched Neurotypical Subjects participate in a Screen/Baseline&#xD;
        visit only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Shipped Biomarker Control Group Subjects: For these shipping control samples, blood samples&#xD;
        will also be drawn from adult parent/guardians of participating subjects.&#xD;
