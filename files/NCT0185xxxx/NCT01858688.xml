      Some men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer do not require immediate treatment. Rather,&#xD;
      they can be followed closely with regular physical exams, blood work and repeated biopsies of&#xD;
      the prostate. If the prostate cancer is becoming more aggressive, curative treatment can be&#xD;
      offered at that time. This strategy of delaying treatment until necessary is called active&#xD;
      surveillance in prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active surveillance is a way of monitoring prostate cancer which aims to avoid or delay&#xD;
      unnecessary treatment in men with less aggressive cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer can be slow growing and, for many men, the disease may never progress or&#xD;
      cause any symptoms. In other words, many men with prostate cancer will never need any&#xD;
      treatment. Treatments for prostate cancer may cause side effects which can affect your&#xD;
      quality of life. By monitoring the cancer with regular tests, you can avoid or delay these&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active surveillance is generally suitable for men with low risk early stage prostate cancer&#xD;
      that is contained within the prostate gland (localized prostate cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If doctors had a better way of identifying who might be best suited for this approach, it&#xD;
      would likely become more appealing for more men. In this study, the investigators are looking&#xD;
      at how accurate a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is at identifying high-risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer, which might make a man a poor candidate for active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the investigators are collecting data from the MRI scan of men and comparing it&#xD;
      to a trans-rectal biopsy performed following the scan. The results of this study will help&#xD;
      inform doctors how accurate the MRI is in identifying men who should not be on active&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;

      Before the research starts (screening): After signing this consent form, you will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the research study.&#xD;
      Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be&#xD;
      done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had&#xD;
      some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical history, which includes questions about your health, current medications, any&#xD;
           allergies and evaluation for whether you can safely have an MRI and biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status, which evaluates how you are able to carry on with your usual&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of the initial diagnostic biopsy, which you had when you were diagnosed with&#xD;
           prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine Blood Tests ( PSA is a protein that is produced by the prostate gland. The PSA&#xD;
           test has been widely used to screen men for prostate cancer. It is also used to monitor&#xD;
           men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer to see if their cancer is responding to&#xD;
           therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health State Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These questionnaires review: Your feelings about your cancer diagnosis, your&#xD;
           satisfaction with the cancer care you received, your health and symptoms over the past&#xD;
           four weeks, and your overall urinary function&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will&#xD;
      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able&#xD;
      to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be scheduled for a MRI between 2 to 14 months after your initial biopsy, which&#xD;
           showed prostate cancer, to assess the grade and extent of your prostate cancer since&#xD;
           your initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be scheduled for a repeat prostate biopsy 0-3 months after your MRI is&#xD;
           reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the findings from the MRI, this biopsy will be performed either in the urologist's&#xD;
      office with an ultrasound (a medical imaging technique that uses high frequency sound waves&#xD;
      and their echoes) or using anesthesia and an MRI to guide where the biopsy is taken within&#xD;
      the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the MRI does not show anything of concern, you will have another ultrasound-guided biopsy&#xD;
      similar to the one you had when you were initially diagnosed with prostate cancer. In this&#xD;
      procedure twelve biopsy samples are taken from the prostate. Each biopsy is about the length&#xD;
      of a dime and as narrow as a toothpick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the MRI has findings which need further evaluation, you will have a guided biopsy. In this&#xD;
      procedure, you will have twelve samples taken from the prostate similar to the biopsy you had&#xD;
      when you were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Additionally, several biopsies will be taken of&#xD;
      the area or areas of concern noted on the MRI. This procedure will require anesthesia, which&#xD;
      may be general anesthesia or another type. You will meet with the study physician prior to&#xD;
      the biopsy procedure. The type of anesthesia to be used will be decided by the study&#xD;
      physician in discussion with you. When undergoing a study in the MRI system, you will lie&#xD;
      motionless inside this device Occasionally the machine will produce a loud banging noise, as&#xD;
      if it were being pounded from the outside with a hammer. Earplugs are available to reduce&#xD;
      this sound level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are in the magnet, under the anesthetic, the investigators will do the biopsy. To&#xD;
      do this the investigators will use 2 ways to help us reach the correct part of your prostate,&#xD;
      one is a robotic needle holder, which will show us where to put the needle, by lining up the&#xD;
      correct place outside on the skin or rectal wall and the study physician will push in the&#xD;
      needle with his/her hand. Second the investigators will use a model of the best location(s),&#xD;
      taken from images. The biopsy is done with a needle put in through the skin, under your&#xD;
      scrotum or through the rectal wall by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire length of the procedure will be approximately 3 hours. The results of the&#xD;
      procedure and biopsy will be communicated by your doctor as soon as they are available. The&#xD;
      results will also be shared with the research co-investigators. This will be done by sharing&#xD;
      the pathology results for each biopsy as matched with the location/place it came from in your&#xD;
      gland. The study doctor will share the results of your biopsy with you at your end of study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Information The investigators will collect your medical information when you come to&#xD;
      the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and link this information to your specimens so that the&#xD;
      investigators may better understand how these tests affect how participants do over time. It&#xD;
      is important to note the following: all blood, tissue, and data collected from participants&#xD;
      will be used for research only and when the research is performed on your samples, the&#xD;
      investigators conducting this research will not have access to participant identification&#xD;
      information, such as medical record numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an end of study visit approximately 30 days after your final biopsy is&#xD;
      performed. At this visit, the study staff will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review your current PSA lab values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the results of your biopsy and discuss options for future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask you to complete several &quot;Health- State&quot; questionnaires if you have not already done&#xD;
           so&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review any side effects that you may have experienced as a result of your recent biopsy.&#xD;
