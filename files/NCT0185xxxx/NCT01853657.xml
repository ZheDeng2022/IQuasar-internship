  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to access efficacy of first and second line antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART) and its determinants in patients treated at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in&#xD;
      Kumasi (KATH), Ghana, and to compare the clinical, virological and immunological efficacy of&#xD;
      second line ART in patients who were switched after virological failure compared to patients&#xD;
      who were switched after clinical or immunological failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other specific study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish an HIV Cohort Study at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the rate of virological failure among patients on first line therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the clinical, immunological and virological efficacy of second line&#xD;
           antiretroviral therapy amongst patients randomised to virological monitoring whilst on&#xD;
           first line compared with those monitored routinely using clinical and immunological&#xD;
           monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the incidence and outcome of tuberculosis (TB) and other opportunistic&#xD;
           infections in patients treated at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital HIV services&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To obtain parameters for quality of care, e. g. performance of TB screening procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To develop strategies to minimise treatment failures, on the basis of the results of the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To generate a large prospective second-line ART cohort, to serve as basis for further&#xD;
           research projects&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To implement point-of-care viral load analysis at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Capacity building: epidemiology, medical documentation and data base management.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open randomized study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients being on stable ART for at least one year will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      study after thorough information about the objectives/procedures of the study and associated&#xD;
      inconveniences/risks. After informed consent has been given, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a short questionnaire on their history of antiretroviral therapy, including&#xD;
      information on drug adherence, reliability of drug supply, side effects and complications of&#xD;
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Data on the socioeconomic status, perceived&#xD;
      difficulties related to antiretroviral therapy and subjective quality of care and support&#xD;
      offered by the HIV treatment program will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to arm I (n=1500), with viral load testing (VL) in addition to&#xD;
      clinical and immunological monitoring according to the algorithm listed below, or to group II&#xD;
      (all other eligible patients, at least n=1500), with clinical and immunological monitoring&#xD;
      (CI) only. Randomization will be conducted according to a computer list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the blood drawn for the routine workup of HIV services (CD4 cell count,&#xD;
      biochemistry), an additional 10ml blood sample (5ml EDTA, 5ml serum) will be obtained from&#xD;
      all patients enrolled in the study for analysis of viral load and major confounders for ART&#xD;
      outcome, as e. g. viral hepatitis. Additionally, a blood sample (5ml EDTA plasma) will be&#xD;
      taken from patients in the arm II (CI) before switching to second line ART upon clinical or&#xD;
      immunological failure for viral load analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral load analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure timely clinical availability of viral load testing, point of care testing is&#xD;
      required and shall be established at KATH. A Cobas® Amplicore Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics)&#xD;
      has been installed at KATH but is not routinely used, although functional, due to lacking&#xD;
      resources. Viral load testing shall be conducted after adequate training of staff and&#xD;
      servicing of the machine has been assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of therapy failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy failure will be defined according to WHO and national guidelines for antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical failure is the occurrence of a new opportunistic infection or malignancy&#xD;
           signifying clinical disease progression, the recurrence of prior opportunistic infection&#xD;
           or onset/recurrence of WHO stage 3 or 4 conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immunologic failure is the return of CD4 counts to pre-therapy baseline, or below and/or&#xD;
           more than 50% fall from on-therapy CD4 peak-level (and/or more than 50% fall in CD4), or&#xD;
           persistent low CD4 of less than 100 cells/µl after one year of therapy without other&#xD;
           concomitant infection to explain the low CD4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Virological failure is defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA level above 5,000 copies/mL in a&#xD;
           person who has been on a regimen for more than 6 months without other concomitant&#xD;
           infection to explain the rise or non-suppression of the viral load and in whom drug&#xD;
           adherence is determined to be sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with viral load &gt; 5000 copies per mL and evidence of insufficient drug adherence,&#xD;
      adherence counseling is conducted and viral load is controlled after 3 months. If viral load&#xD;
      is again &gt; 5000 copies per mL, and adherence is determined to be sufficient, patients shall&#xD;
      be switched to second line ART. In patients with a viral load between 50 and 5,000 copies per&#xD;
      mL, adherence counseling is conducted and viral load is repeated between 3 to 6 months.&#xD;
      Patients with a viral load &gt;500 copies per mL upon control shall be switched to second-line&#xD;
      ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART Switch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the definition of virological, immunological or clinical failure as&#xD;
      specified above, will be informed about the indication to switch to second-line ART according&#xD;
      to national guidelines, about the benefit and possible side effects second-line ART. Patients&#xD;
      however have the choice to refuse being switched to second-line treatment. Currently,&#xD;
      recommended and available second-line regimes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tenofovir plus lamivudine for patients failing a first line backbone of zidovudine plus&#xD;
           lamivudine or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Zidovudine plus lamivudine for patients failing a backbone of Tenofovir plus lamivudine&#xD;
           together with Lopinavir/ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other available backbone available but seldom used include Abacavir and didanosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence monitoring and counseling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence is monitored by self reporting, pill counts and pharmacy records, as indicated in&#xD;
      the national guidelines for antiretroviral therapy. All patients with virological,&#xD;
      immunological or clinical therapy failure will receive adherence counseling before switching&#xD;
      to second-line ART. Patients with detectable viral load will equally receive adherence&#xD;
      counseling, before controlling viral load after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are re-evaluated according to national guidelines. Patients without detectable viral&#xD;
      load or evidence for treatment failure will be seen every 6 months or more frequently if&#xD;
      clinically indicated. Patients who are switched to second-line ART will be closely followed&#xD;
      up to assess tolerance. Usually, this is within 14 days after initiation of treatment, then&#xD;
      monthly for the first 3 month, and then in intervals of 2-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined endpoint is clinical failure 12 and 24 months after switch to second line treatment,&#xD;
      defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First/new AIDS defining event&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Absolute number of CD4 cells at the diagnosis of therapy failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean increase in CD4 cell count after 12/24months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Frequency and time of therapy changes, Lost-to-follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ART-related Adverse Events (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from viral load analysis in a subgroup of randomly assigned patients, no interventions&#xD;
      are carried out within this study. Viral load results will be made available to clinicians&#xD;
      treating patients to help in their management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No substantiated data have been reported regarding the expected difference in the combined&#xD;
      primary endpoint, the occurrence of clinical failure (death or new AIDS defining event) after&#xD;
      switch to second line ART between the groups. Based on existing data, we assume an incidence&#xD;
      of the primary endpoint of about 4% in the first year after switch to second line ART [1]. To&#xD;
      detect a difference of 1.5% after a follow-up period of one year with a power of 0.8, a&#xD;
      sample size of 626 patients (313 per group) is needed. By screening 1500 patients with viral&#xD;
      load testing, with an assumed rate of virological failure of 30%, a total of 450 patients&#xD;
      will be offered second line ART [2]. Thus, assuming that 20-30% of those will either not give&#xD;
      informed consent, drop out or will be not evaluable, it appears adequate to randomize and&#xD;
      1500 patients for viral load analysis to achieve the calculated sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be done for primary and secondary end points 12 and 24 months after&#xD;
      recruitment is completed. Because the number of patients with clinical failure becoming&#xD;
      evident during the recruitment period will be lower than the number of patients with&#xD;
      treatment failure detected by viral load analysis, patients having being already started on&#xD;
      second-line ART upon clinical failure will be evaluated retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistics 19 software package.&#xD;
