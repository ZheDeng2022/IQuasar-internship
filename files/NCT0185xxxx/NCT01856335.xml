      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      -People with seizures benefit from regular exercise. Exercise may help decrease the number of&#xD;
      seizures they have. It also improves overall health and quality of life. However, people with&#xD;
      seizure disorders often have been prevented from doing sports or other regular physical&#xD;
      activity. They may also feel that exercise or injury can increase their risk of seizures.&#xD;
      Researchers want to try an exercise program for people who have seizures to see if they can&#xD;
      increase motivation to exercise which will improve overall health and may decrease the&#xD;
      frequency of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how exercise education improves motivation to exercise in people who have a history&#xD;
      of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a history of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves three outpatient visits and weekly telephone calls for about 12&#xD;
           weeks. There will be followup calls at about 6 and 12 months after the outpatient&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will answer&#xD;
           questions about their current level of physical activity, mood, quality of life, and&#xD;
           ideas about exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will learn how to keep a physical activity log and&#xD;
           seizure calendar. They will also use an activity monitor and take their pulse regularly.&#xD;
           They will complete questionnaires about their mood and thoughts about exercise and&#xD;
           seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit, participants will set personal activity goals and learn about&#xD;
           physical activity and seizures. They will review the physical activity log, seizure log,&#xD;
           and activity monitor and pulse readings for the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the second visit, participants will receive weekly telephone calls. Each call will&#xD;
           last about 5 minutes. These calls will ask about physical activities for the week and&#xD;
           participants' progress toward meeting their goals. These calls will also review the&#xD;
           seizure log.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the third visit (12 weeks), the same tests from the first visit will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The followup phone calls will continue to monitor participants' activity levels.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see what keeps people with seizures from exercising and see how they can increase their&#xD;
      belief that they can exercise and that exercise will help them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 adults with seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we will pilot the use of an educational intervention to provide people with&#xD;
      seizure disorders an opportunity to learn about the benefits of exercise and learn&#xD;
      specifically what types of exercise to incorporate into their daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of the educational intervention, we will use pre and post&#xD;
      intervention measures including seizure specific measures of self-efficacy (belief that they&#xD;
      can exercise) and outcome expectations (belief that exercise will help them) for exercise. To&#xD;
      assess changes in physical activity, seizure frequency, and mood, we will monitor physical&#xD;
      activity and seizure calendars, activity monitor recordings, and mood rating scales.&#xD;
