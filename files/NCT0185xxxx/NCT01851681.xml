      In order to prevent infections and complications, it has been initially established with the&#xD;
      dental implant placement protocol that pre- and post-operative antibiotics should be&#xD;
      prescribed to the patient receiving dental implants. There have been many antibiotic regimens&#xD;
      used in the attempt to minimize the risks of infections and consequently, increasing the&#xD;
      survival rate of dental implants placement procedures. However, issues about bacterial&#xD;
      resistance have been raised recently concerning the extensive use of antibiotics. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to find out whether giving antibiotics before or after implant&#xD;
      placement would significantly influence crestal bone loss around dental implants. One study&#xD;
      group will receive one dosage of antibiotics before implant placement followed by&#xD;
      post-operative intake of antibiotics for 7 days. Another group will receive the antibiotics&#xD;
      in one single preoperative dose followed by an identical placebo for 7 days. Questionnaires&#xD;
      for pain and interference with daily activities assessment to be filled for the first&#xD;
      postoperative week will be distributed to participants. Signs of postoperative morbidity will&#xD;
      be recorded at 1 and 3 weeks following the surgery, and both clinical and radiographic data&#xD;
      will be collected at 4 months postoperative to assess the implants status. A radiographic&#xD;
      follow-up will be done 1 year after the surgery. Peri-implant crevicular fluid levels of 3&#xD;
      known immunological markers for bone loss (MMP-8, sRANKL and OPG) will be measured at 1-, 3-&#xD;
      and 16-weeks follow-ups. The findings from this study might allow clinicians to establish the&#xD;
      ideal antibiotic regimen with minimal risk exposure to bacterial resistance.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the discovery of penicillin as an antimicrobial agent in 1928, and later methicillin,&#xD;
      an important improvement of the prognosis of antimicrobial therapies occurred. However, an&#xD;
      increased trend in antibiotic resistance among community-acquired pathogens has been observed&#xD;
      over the past two decades (1, 2). For example, over a short period of time, S. aureus&#xD;
      developed resistance to the β-lactam compounds found in penicillin families, and by 2003,&#xD;
      more than 50% of S. aureus isolates recovered in U.S. hospitals were methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (3). When a resistant bacterium is involved in any clinical infection,&#xD;
      the prognosis of the antimicrobial treatment drops significantly and the patient affected&#xD;
      might not always survive such infection. As health care professionals, it is important to&#xD;
      minimize the exposure of our patients to antibiotics since the emergence of resistance in the&#xD;
      oral microflora has started to become a threat in our modern society. This could be explained&#xD;
      by the improper use of antibiotics, in terms of either dosage (duration of treatment too long&#xD;
      or dose too weak) or indication (4, 5). To support this statement, three studies have shown&#xD;
      that low dosage and/or long treatment duration increase the risk of carriage of&#xD;
      antibiotic-resistant strains (6-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demand for dental implants has been increasing in the population due to their high&#xD;
      success rate and significant improvements in the quality of life. On the other hand, the use&#xD;
      of antibiotics is very common in the practice of oral implantology. In order to prevent&#xD;
      infections, it has been initially established in the implant placement protocol that pre- and&#xD;
      postoperative antibiotics should be prescribed to the patient receiving dental implants 9.&#xD;
      There have been many antibiotic regimens used in the attempt to minimize the risks of&#xD;
      infections and consequently, increasing the survival rate of dental implants. Initially, it&#xD;
      was recommended to give antibiotics at least 1 hour before implant placement followed by&#xD;
      daily doses for 10 days (9). Later on, a retrospective study demonstrated that there were no&#xD;
      advantages in giving antibiotics 1 hour before implant placement and post-operatively for 10&#xD;
      days regarding the implant survival rates (10). A multicenter retrospective study of 2,973&#xD;
      implants showed a significant higher survival rate in patients who had received preoperative&#xD;
      antibiotics (11). The subjects were followed up to 36 months after implant placement. In that&#xD;
      study, 96% of cases received post-operative antibiotics and that decision to prescribe&#xD;
      antibiotic coverage and the regimen to follow were left to the discretion of the surgeons.&#xD;
      Another retrospective study found that there were no significant differences in failure rates&#xD;
      between implants placed in patients receiving a 1-day single-dose administration of&#xD;
      antibiotic and those placed in patients taking a 1-week post-operative regimen of antibiotics&#xD;
      (12). The authors also stated that a single dose of antibiotics to prevent dental implant&#xD;
      infections was efficient enough to prevent the risks of the emergence of&#xD;
      antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains. Two recent meta-analyses of 4 randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials comparing implants placed in patients who received antibiotics pre- and/or&#xD;
      post-operatively showed a statistically significant higher number of patients experiencing&#xD;
      implant failures in the group not receiving any antibiotics (13, 14). To illustrate the&#xD;
      controversy surrounding antibiotic prophylaxes for dental implant patients, a survey of&#xD;
      private dental practices in UK found that there was a wide variation of antibiotic regimens:&#xD;
      prophylactic, postoperative, and combination of both pre- and postoperative antibiotics (15).&#xD;
      Consequently, in order to prevent the overuse of antibiotics and the potential emergence of&#xD;
      drug resistant bacteria, it would be advisable to find an optimal protocol including an&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy with a minimal duration while the implant survival rate would remain&#xD;
      unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few clinical trials have looked at the patient-based outcomes. Indeed, the patients'&#xD;
      pain and discomfort experience has not been taken into account in most of dental implant&#xD;
      clinical trials and little is known about its prevalence and intensity after surgery,&#xD;
      especially with regard to different antibiotics regimens. Moreover, it was shown that&#xD;
      individuals taking postoperative antibiotics exhibited less crestal bone loss 6 months after&#xD;
      implant placement when compared to those who did not take any antibiotics postoperatively&#xD;
      (16). However, no information is available on the effect of antibiotics on crestal bone loss&#xD;
      with the newer design of implants exhibiting the platform switching concept. Crestal bone&#xD;
      loss around dental implants was recently associated with higher peri-implant crevicular fluid&#xD;
      (PICF) concentration of biomarkers (pg/μL) involved in the bone metabolism such as&#xD;
      metalloproteinases (MMPs), and osteoprotegerin (OPG)(17, 18). The membrane bound and soluble&#xD;
      RANKL (sRANKL) was found in significantly higher PICF levels in peri-implantitis sites&#xD;
      compared to healthy sites (19). To our knowledge, no prospective study in oral implantology&#xD;
      comparing two antibiotics regimens has looked at subject-based outcomes, clinical,&#xD;
      radiographic and immunological outcomes simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this prospective two-arm randomized clinical trial is to compare the&#xD;
      crestal bone loss, the PICF concentration of three selected biomarkers for bone loss, pain&#xD;
      experience and interference with daily activities, and the postoperative morbidity (swelling,&#xD;
      bruising, wound dehiscence and suppuration) between 2 different antibiotics regimens in&#xD;
      patients undergoing dental implant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's null hypothesis is that there is no difference in crestal bone loss around&#xD;
      implants between the 2 different antibiotics regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find out whether giving pre- and/or postoperative antibiotics after implant placement&#xD;
           would significantly change the crestal bone loss around implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the patient's perception of the post-operative healing process for each&#xD;
           antibiotic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the surgeon's perception of the post-operative healing process for each&#xD;
           antibiotic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Subjects in this randomized controlled clinical trial will be divided in two&#xD;
      groups: one group will receive 2 g of amoxicillin 1 h prior the surgery and 500mg three times&#xD;
      a day for 7 days; the second group will receive only 2 g of amoxicillin 1 h prior the surgery&#xD;
      and an identical placebo three times a day for 7 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Prior to data collection, a consent form approved by the institutional review board of the&#xD;
      Université de Montréal (Comité d'éthique de la recherché en santé) will be presented to&#xD;
      participants during initial consultations. All study procedures will be undertaken with the&#xD;
      understanding and written consent of each participant and according to ethical principles&#xD;
      including the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and socio-demographic data collection An investigator or a research assistant, who is&#xD;
      not one of the surgeons, will approach and recruit individuals who had accepted a treatment&#xD;
      plan for dental implant(s) to restore a partially edentulous jaw at the implant dentistry&#xD;
      clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry (CRIP). Medical history, smoking habits (smokers,&#xD;
      non-smokers), ethnicity, gender and age will be obtained through the medical questionnaire&#xD;
      used at the Faculty of Dentistry and will be included in the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedures and data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental implant(s) (Osseospeed™ TX or Osseospeed™ TX Profile, Astra Tech Implant System™,&#xD;
      Dentsply Implants, Mölndal, Sweden) will be placed in a one stage procedure, without&#xD;
      simultaneous bone grafting, and will be inserted at the implantology clinic of the Université&#xD;
      de Montréal - Faculty of Dentistry (CRIP) by one of three board-certified specialists and&#xD;
      experienced implant surgeons (RD, RV, PB; minimum of 10 years of experience). All&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to rinse with chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% for 1 min. just&#xD;
      before surgery and to take 1 hour before surgical appointment 2 g of amoxicillin. A third&#xD;
      party will give an envelope to the patient containing the antibiotic to be taken&#xD;
      postoperatively and the patient's study number so the surgeon will be unaware of the&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen. Subjects will be randomly distributed to one of the two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 g amoxicillin taken 1 hour preoperatively then 500mg of identical placebo three times&#xD;
           per day for 7 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 g amoxicillin taken 1 hour preoperatively then 500mg amoxicillin taken three times per&#xD;
           day for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's allocation will be done in blocks of 4 subjects by a computer-generated sequence&#xD;
      and sealed in consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. The subjects will receive from a&#xD;
      research assistant the envelopes containing either one of the antibiotics regimen with&#xD;
      specific instructions on how to take the medication. The participants will have to take the&#xD;
      antibiotics under the supervision of the research assistant. Additional measures of asepsis&#xD;
      will include the use of sterile drapes around the patient's head and over the supine body of&#xD;
      the patient. Screw-type, root-form, two-pieces rough surfaced dental implants will be placed&#xD;
      using a standard surgical protocol, following the manufacturers' recommendations.&#xD;
      Mucoperiosteal flaps will be used to access underlying alveolar bone for all implant&#xD;
      surgeries. The healing abutment will be inserted instead of the cover screw, and soft tissues&#xD;
      will be sutured with interrupted sutures (4-0 silk, Perma Sharp®, Hu-Friedy Mfg Co., Chicago,&#xD;
      U.S.A.). A standardized radiograph will be taken perpendicular to the crestal bone to assess&#xD;
      the baseline crestal bone level on the mesial and distal aspects of the implant using a bite&#xD;
      registration material (Blu-Mousse®, Parkell Inc., Edgewood, U.S.A.) adapted to a paralleling&#xD;
      device (XCP film holding system, Dentsply Rinn, Elgin, U.S.A.) for each participant. The&#xD;
      customized bite registration will be kept for each patient in a cool room in a locked cabinet&#xD;
      with the participant study identification number for the subsequent 4 months and 1-year&#xD;
      radiographic evaluations. The duration of the surgery and length of the incision will be&#xD;
      recorded by the surgeon. The participants will be asked to refrain from performing mechanical&#xD;
      plaque control in the surgical area and be advised to remain on a soft diet during the first&#xD;
      postoperative week. To minimize the influence of independent variables, they will be&#xD;
      prescribed 600mg of ibuprofen to take every 4 hours for the first 48 hours with a maximum of&#xD;
      4 tabs per day. They will also be prescribed an emergency analgesic (500mg acetaminophen) to&#xD;
      take if needed and a 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate rinse to use twice daily until the sutures&#xD;
      are removed 1 week later. After receiving the standardized verbal and written post-operative&#xD;
      instructions, participants will be given questionnaires to assess postoperative pain and&#xD;
      interference with daily activities for the first postoperative week. The patient will be&#xD;
      asked to keep a pain medication diary to keep track of the number of analgesics (ibuprofen&#xD;
      and acetaminophen) taken for the first postoperative week. The patient will be asked to&#xD;
      record his/her experience with the interference with their daily activities using a 10-cm VAS&#xD;
      questionnaire with end points being &quot;none&quot; and &quot;extremely much&quot; (20) and will have to&#xD;
      attribute a numerical value to his/her pain intensity experienced using the Numerical Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS-11), with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;intolerable&quot;. The patient's pain&#xD;
      experience will also be assessed with the daily pain medication intake diary. Daily&#xD;
      activities will include their ability to chew foods they want to eat, to open their mouth&#xD;
      wide, talk, sleep, go to school or work, carry on a regular social life and participate in&#xD;
      their favorite recreational activities. The subjects will be asked to bring back to the&#xD;
      research assistant the pain and daily interference questionnaires as well as the envelope and&#xD;
      drug containers to ensure their compliance with the prescriptions. At the end of the first&#xD;
      postoperative control appointment, one of the two calibrated examiners unaware of the&#xD;
      antibiotics regimen prescribed will be asked to fill a questionnaire to evaluate swelling,&#xD;
      bruising, pus exudate and wound dehiscence as described elsewhere 20. Postoperative swelling&#xD;
      will be graded as follows: 0 = No swelling, 1 = Mild swelling, 2 = Moderate swelling, 3 =&#xD;
      Severe swelling. Postoperative bruising, suppuration and wound dehiscence will be evaluated&#xD;
      using Boolean variables: 0 = None; 1 = Present. The examiner will measure the modified plaque&#xD;
      index (PI) (21) at four sites per implant (mesial, distal, buccal, lingual). The PI is graded&#xD;
      as follows: 0 = no detection of plaque, 1 = Plaque only detected by running a probe&#xD;
      (PCP-UNC15; Hu-Friedy Mfg Co., Chicago, U.S.A.) along the smooth surface of the healing&#xD;
      abutment, 2 = Plaque can be seen by the naked eye, 3 = Abundance of soft matter. The PI will&#xD;
      be also measured at the 3-weeks and 16-weeks examinations. He will then collect PICF samples&#xD;
      to detect the presence of MMP-8, sRANKL and OPG from the mesial surface of each implant at&#xD;
      this first postoperative appointment and also at the 3-weeks and 16-weeks examinations.&#xD;
      Briefly, supragingival plaque if present, will be removed gently with a gauze. The sampling&#xD;
      site will be isolated with cotton rolls and carefully dried. A filter strip (PerioPaper,&#xD;
      Oraflow Inc., Smithtown, NY, U.S.A.) will be placed 30 s in the peri-implant sulcus. The&#xD;
      collected samples will be immediately transferred into sterile 1 ml tubes containing 100 μl&#xD;
      phosphate buffered saline, centrifuged for 10 min, and stored at - 80 °C for further&#xD;
      analysis. At the laboratory, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be used to&#xD;
      assess PICF levels of MMP-8 (Quantikine-Human Total MMP-8 Immunoassay, R&amp;D Systems Inc.,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, U.S.A), and sRANKL and OPG (Biomedica, Gruppe, Vienna). At the 3-weeks&#xD;
      appointment, postoperative swelling, bruising, suppuration and wound dehiscence will be&#xD;
      evaluated as well as the modified PI. PICF samples will be also collected. At the 16-weeks&#xD;
      evaluation, the implants will be re-assessed both clinically and radiographically to confirm&#xD;
      osseointegration and the modified PI and PICF samples will be collected again. This&#xD;
      appointment will coincide with the impression for restoration of the implant. The same&#xD;
      calibrated examiner unaware of the antibiotics regimen taken will verify if the implants are&#xD;
      osseointegrated by taking a standardized periapical radiograph to verify the presence or&#xD;
      absence of infection and evaluate crestal bone loss using the standardized bite registration&#xD;
      and paralleling device. The examiner will also assess implant mobility using the handles of&#xD;
      two blunt dental instruments (22) (osseointegration = immobile, failure = mobile) and the&#xD;
      presence or absence of any symptom related to infection (suppuration), inflammation&#xD;
      (erythema, bleeding on probing) or neuropathy (paresthesia, dysesthesia, anesthesia) (23).&#xD;
      Four months and one year after the implant placement, a standardized radiograph will be taken&#xD;
      to measure crestal bone loss. Subtraction radiographic analysis will be done using a software&#xD;
      (Image J, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, U.S.A.) to measure mean mesial and distal&#xD;
      bone loss around the implants by one investigator who is unaware of the antibiotic regimen&#xD;
      taken by the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make sure patients at the implantology clinic do not feel obligated to participate to this&#xD;
      study, a research assistant will give to potential participants written information about the&#xD;
      ongoing study at our clinic (&quot;Feuille d'information et de recrutement&quot;). The patients will be&#xD;
      told they can read that information while they are waiting on the dental chair for their&#xD;
      treatments to be finished or at home and let know their dental care provider their decision&#xD;
      once they are sure they are willing to participate. The provider will then notify the&#xD;
      research assistant of the patient's interest in participating in the study if it is indeed&#xD;
      the case. At that time, the information and consent form will be presented to the patient who&#xD;
      is interested in participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the dental record number of each participant will be written on the questionnaires for&#xD;
      identification purposes, a third party (research assistant) will remove the dental record&#xD;
      number and replace it with a study code prior to data analysis. The third party will then&#xD;
      place the questionnaires in a folder containing only the study number of each participant.&#xD;
      The folders containing the research data will be kept in the locked office of the principal&#xD;
      investigator at the Université de Montréal. The principal investigator will ensure during the&#xD;
      entire process of data collection that the research team follows the rules of ethics and that&#xD;
      only members of the research team will have access to the room where the data is kept. Only&#xD;
      the third party will have possession of the sheet where dental record numbers are matched&#xD;
      with study codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that the difference in crestal bone loss between the study groups would be 0.5 mm&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of 0.5mm, the sample size of 17 participants in each group would&#xD;
      provide a power of 80% to reject the null hypothesis of absence of between-group differences&#xD;
      if it is indeed false, at an alpha level of 5%. This difference of 0.5 mm is generally&#xD;
      considered to be clinically significant (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will be crestal bone loss at the mesial and distal aspects of&#xD;
      each implant. The secondary outcomes will be the presence or absence of peri-implant&#xD;
      radiolucency, patient's pain experience (intensity (VAS) and number of analgesics taken),&#xD;
      surgeon's perception of healing (intensity of swelling and presence/absence of bruising, pus&#xD;
      exudate and wound dehiscence), PICF levels of MMP-8, sRANKL, and OPG, modified PI, presence&#xD;
      or absence of implant mobility, presence or absence of pain, infection, neuropathies, and pus&#xD;
      exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trained and calibrated examiners will perform all clinical measurements and take the&#xD;
      radiographs. An intra- and inter-reliability study will be done to compare with a gold&#xD;
      standard examiner. One calibrated examiner with extensive experience will perform the&#xD;
      radiographic analysis. Cohen's kappa, intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland and Altman&#xD;
      graphs will be used to evaluate reliability. Normality of data distribution will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Normalization will be used in case of non-normal distribution.&#xD;
      Crestal bone loss, PICF levels and patient's pain perception (VAS) will be analyzed with&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA, with time as a repeated measure (7 days) and groups as a between&#xD;
      group measure. Groups will be compared regarding postoperative swelling with Kruskall-Wallis&#xD;
      one-way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U test. Groups will be compared regarding implant survival at&#xD;
      4 months, bruising, suppuration, wound dehiscence, mobility, presence of pus exudate,&#xD;
      presence of peri-implant radiolucency on the radiographs, and presence of persistent&#xD;
      signs/symptoms with the Fisher's exact test. Analyses will be conducted in conformity of the&#xD;
      intention to treat principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, this will be the first prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      compare the crestal bone loss between two different antibiotic regimens including&#xD;
      simultaneously patient-based outcomes, clinical, immunological and radiographic measures. The&#xD;
      results from this study might allow dentists and oral surgeons to establish an optimal&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen and to minimize patient exposure to potential stimulation of bacterial&#xD;
      resistance by reducing antibiotic intake.&#xD;

    <description>One of the two calibrated examiners (RD, RV) unaware of the antibiotics regimen prescribed will be asked to fill a questionnaire to evaluate swelling, bruising, pus exudate and wound dehiscence as described elsewhere (Nolan et al., 2013). Postoperative swelling will be graded as follows: 0 = No swelling, 1 = Mild swelling, 2 = Moderate swelling, 3 = Severe swelling. Postoperative bruising, suppuration and wound dehiscence will be evaluated using Boolean variables: 0 = None; 1 = Present.</description>
