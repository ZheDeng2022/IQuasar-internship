      This study will assess whether functional recovery of the hand muscles in patients with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury is enhanced when electrical stimulation of the muscles is delivered&#xD;
      actively by means of using the electroencephalography wave patterns arising from the patient&#xD;
      imagining moving their hand to operate the stimulator. A control group will obtain the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation treatment passively by a therapist operating the machine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Injuries of the higher levels of the spinal cord, called tetraplegia, result in a complete or&#xD;
      partial paralysis of both legs and arms, making the person dependent on their caregivers for&#xD;
      elementary activities of daily living (ADL) such as drinking and feeding. About 60% of&#xD;
      tetraplegics have an incomplete injury and can partially recover their movement and&#xD;
      sensation. The success of a recovery greatly depends on the therapy within the first year&#xD;
      after the injury. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a relatively novel therapy of&#xD;
      the hand. In FES therapy electrodes are attached on the surface the patients's forearms and&#xD;
      electrical current is delivered through them. A disadvantage of the current FES therapy is&#xD;
      that a therapist has to switch the stimulator on and off because patients cannot use either&#xD;
      of their hands. In our previous pilot study performed on two acute tetraplegic patients we&#xD;
      tested feasibility of using brain-computer interface (BCI) to control FES on patient's will.&#xD;
      BCI is based on recording the patient's brain activity. BCI can detect the patient's&#xD;
      intention to move the hand even if they are not able to physically move it. Using BCI,&#xD;
      patients control the FES by thinking to move their hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A BCI-FES therapy will provide a simultaneous training of neural pathways from the brain to&#xD;
      the hand muscle (motor imagination/attempt) and from the muscle to the brain (electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of muscles). This form of therapy could promote faster and more complete recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this controlled study we aim to provide a BCI-FES therapy to both chronic and subacute&#xD;
      tetraplegic patients over a period of 20 sessions and to access the functional and&#xD;
      neurological outcome of the therapy. Five chronic patients (more than a year after the&#xD;
      injury) will participate in a cross-over study as we do not expect that they will recover&#xD;
      spontaneously without BCI-FES. Subacute patients will be receiving both a conventional&#xD;
      therapy and BCI-FES so recovery can be caused by either of these two therapies. Therefore it&#xD;
      is necessary to have a treatment and a control group. Each group will have 10 patients, age&#xD;
      and injury matched. Both groups will receive the same amount of electrical stimulation but&#xD;
      only the treatment group will voluntarily control the electrical stimulator using BCI. A&#xD;
      control group will receive passive electrical stimulation of the same hand muscles but&#xD;
      without using BCI.&#xD;
