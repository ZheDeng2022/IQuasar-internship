      This phase II evaluation of sumatriptan as a treatment for post traumatic headache (PTH) will&#xD;
      examine the methods and approach necessary to take the next step to a phase III trial. The&#xD;
      sample will include 40 persons with mild complicated, moderate or severe TBI who will be&#xD;
      recruited from patients discharged from the acute rehabilitation unit as well as outpatient&#xD;
      clinics and the community who are between 3 and 24 months of injury and will be followed over&#xD;
      3 months. The investigators plan to enroll those who have moderate to severe headache with&#xD;
      frequency of at least four and up to a maximum of fifteen total headache days per month and&#xD;
      at least three months after discharge from hospital. The investigators will use headache&#xD;
      diaries to track the headaches for a month. If subjects still have significant headache, the&#xD;
      investigators will instruct them in the use of sumatriptan 100 mg. to treat headaches. The&#xD;
      subjects will continue to keep daily headache diaries. The investigators will evaluate them&#xD;
      at baseline, Day 30 and Day 90. Each subject will receive weekly telephone follow up calls&#xD;
      from the research staff. The investigators will measure pain severity, duration, recurrence&#xD;
      of headaches, and side effects and how well persons with TBI can use headache diaries.&#xD;

      I. Specific Aims of Study: The ultimate aim of this Phase II open-label study is to test the&#xD;
      research methods and approach necessary to successfully carry out a Phase III study for the&#xD;
      treatment of post-traumatic headache (PTH). During this study, we will&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the feasibility of using a headache diary accessed via smart phone&#xD;
           application, the web, or paper/pencil to record accurate headache data in a group of&#xD;
           individuals with TBI, and their caregivers as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the approximate effect size of sumatriptan on pain severity, duration, and&#xD;
           recurrence of headaches in persons with moderate to severe PTH in order to establish the&#xD;
           necessary sample size for a Phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the side effect profile of sumatriptan in a brain-injured population as well as&#xD;
           the safety of sumatriptan in subjects with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the ability of persons with TBI, and their caregivers as indicated, to&#xD;
           successfully use abortive headache medications and comply with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examine the relationship between PTH and cognitive, emotional, and other self-report&#xD;
           measures to determine important factors to include in a Phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm, unblinded study enrolling 40 subjects and is being undertaken to test&#xD;
      necessary study instruments and procedures, establish feasibility and determine side effects&#xD;
      in a population with mild complicated, moderate or severe TBI in preparation for a subsequent&#xD;
      Phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur at enrollment (Clinic Visit 1) at which baseline testing will&#xD;
      occur, Day 30 (Clinic Visit 2), and Day 90 (Clinic Visit 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment Visit (Visit 1): Subjects who complete informed consent and meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria (with no exclusion criteria) will be asked to complete 30 days of headache diary to&#xD;
      document the number of headaches, headache severity, headache days and description of their&#xD;
      headache and associated symptoms. Research staff will contact them on a weekly basis to&#xD;
      answer questions and maximize accuracy and compliance with the diary. Proper utilization of a&#xD;
      headache diary and success of data input by the subject and caregiver will be evaluated&#xD;
      following weekly interviews with the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit (Clinic Visit 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical history will be obtained to review inclusion and exclusion criteria and to elicit a&#xD;
      thorough review of systems so that adverse events will be identifiable if they occur.&#xD;
      Physical examination will also ensure that cardiovascular status is compatible with&#xD;
      sumatriptan use and will document current status to allow for identification of potential&#xD;
      adverse events. Finally, standard primary headache classification criteria will be reviewed&#xD;
      with each patient to determine whether they meet criteria for migraine or probable migraine.&#xD;
      Headache histories will be assessed and subjects that have experienced between 4-15 headaches&#xD;
      will be included in the medication intervention with Sumatriptan. Subjects who qualify for&#xD;
      the Sumatriptan intervention will receive several assessments, given medication, usage&#xD;
      instructions, and scheduled for weekly phone calls for weeks 5-11. Individuals whose&#xD;
      headaches do not meet criteria for migraine or probable migraine, based on data from headache&#xD;
      diaries, will have their participation in the study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Telephone Follow-Up Calls: Research staff will call each participant weekly to check&#xD;
      on compliance with drug diary use during the first month of the study (Weekly calls 1-3) to&#xD;
      check on compliance in diary usage. For weekly calls in weeks 5-11 (for the intervention&#xD;
      participants), research staff will inquire about study drug usage, and query for adverse&#xD;
      events. Use of rescue medications for headache will be recorded. In the case of minor adverse&#xD;
      effects which are bothersome to the patient, the dosage will be decreased by Â½ pill per use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Visit (Visit 3). This will be the final visit for the subjects. Vital signs will be&#xD;
      obtained. Drug containers and headache diaries will be collected from all subjects. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of sumatriptan and rescue drug: Two packages of nine (9) sumatriptan 100- mg. pills (18&#xD;
      pills total for 2 months of treatment) will be dispensed to each subject on Day 30 once they&#xD;
      have gone through baseline assessment. On average, this will treat a minimum of 5 headaches&#xD;
      or a maximum of 9 headaches per month. Subjects will be instructed to take the sumatriptan at&#xD;
      the onset of headache pain. If subjects are not pain free at 2 hours after the first dose of&#xD;
      study medication, they will be allowed to take one additional pill, but will be limited to 2&#xD;
      pills in a 24 hour period. Subjects will be instructed to take no more than 9 pills in a 30&#xD;
      day period based on research which suggests that additional dosages may increase the risk of&#xD;
      medication-overuse headache. A list of appropriate medications will be provided that they can&#xD;
      use if they: 1) continue to have headache pain 2 hours after their second dose of study drug,&#xD;
      or 2) they have used their 30 day supply of study drug within the month. All subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone on a weekly basis to review their headache diaries, assess potential&#xD;
      adverse events, review compliance with use of the study drug, assess other treatments being&#xD;
      utilized, and answer any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data analysis for the feasibility and safety aims will be primarily&#xD;
      descriptive. The investigators will calculate the percent of subjects who used the diary&#xD;
      successfully, percent who stopped taking sumatriptan because of side effects, percent who&#xD;
      experienced each adverse event, and percent who were able to maintain compliance with&#xD;
      treatment. A confidence interval will be determined for each estimate. To get preliminary&#xD;
      data on efficacy of sumatriptan, headache control will be compared before and after the&#xD;
      participants start taking sumatriptan. The investigators will calculate the percent of&#xD;
      headaches that had complete resolution (pain free at 2 hours) for each person, during the&#xD;
      initial (pre-intervention) month when they used their regular treatment and during the two&#xD;
      months (intervention) when they treated headaches with sumatriptan and compare them using a&#xD;
      paired t-test. The investigators will also examine different definitions of headache relief&#xD;
      (pain free by 30 minutes, no more than mild pain (score &lt;=1) by 30 minutes, no more than mild&#xD;
      pain by 2 hours) to see if another outcome measure may have advantages for a future Phase III&#xD;
      study. Any differences in compliance, side effects, and feasibility based on cognitive&#xD;
      functioning will be described, as well as by other self-report and emotional health measures.&#xD;
      Changes in these measures from pre to post treatment will also be examined to determine&#xD;
      whether there is any change that occurs with treatment and which may be important variables&#xD;
      to include in a Phase III study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-65. The lower age limit is set for ability to consent as an adult for research&#xD;
             participation as well as being a minimum age for administration of most validated&#xD;
             outcome measurements. The higher age limit is set to 65 to reduce likelihood of health&#xD;
             issues which may be a contraindication to the use of sumatriptan and to meet&#xD;
             recommendations by the International Headache Society.62&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of TBI occurring at least 3 months but not greater than 60 months before&#xD;
             enrollment. Three months was chosen to include only those subjects who are having&#xD;
             headache beyond their acute injury and 60 months to identify the ability of&#xD;
             individuals with TBI and headache to use both a headache diary and the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has at least four and up to a maximum of fifteen total headache days per&#xD;
             month. Subject report of meeting this criteria will result in the subject entering the&#xD;
             first month of the study. However, this frequency must be documented in headache diary&#xD;
             to enter the treatment phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Headaches are classified as moderate to severe (2 or 3 on the 4 point pain scale: 0=no&#xD;
             headache, 1=mild headache, 2=moderate headache, 3=severe headache). As above, headache&#xD;
             severity must be documented in the month-long headache diary prior to entry into the&#xD;
             treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is able and willing to give written informed consent for participation in&#xD;
             screening activities and to participate fully in the study if eligible. For those&#xD;
             subjects who score below 25 on the Mini Mental Status Examination, there must be a&#xD;
             caregiver willing to also be consented for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             enrollment, and agree to remain abstinent or use acceptable methods of birth control&#xD;
             (i.e., hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide,&#xD;
             cervical cap or sponge, condoms, or partner has had a vasectomy). Sumatriptan has been&#xD;
             assigned to pregnancy category C by the FDA. Animal studies have revealed evidence of&#xD;
             decreased fetal body weight, embryo lethality, and cervicothoracic vascular defects.&#xD;
             There are no controlled data in human pregnancy and therefore, sumatriptan should only&#xD;
             be given during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             silent ischemia, Prinzmetal's angina/coronary vasospasm, ischemic bowel disease, or&#xD;
             peripheral vascular disease) based on self-report or history of basilar or hemiplegic&#xD;
             migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension at initial visit (sitting systolic pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg,&#xD;
             diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired renal or liver function by medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has taken an MAO inhibitor within 2 weeks of screening because these drugs and&#xD;
             sumatriptan use the same metabolic pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has hypersensitivity reactions or other intolerance to sumatriptan or any&#xD;
             other 5-HT 1B/1D-receptor agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subjects have medication overuse headache in the opinion of the investigator (if&#xD;
             using medication to treat acute headache on more than 15 days per month).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to speak or read English which would limit ability to interact with&#xD;
             examiners and complete headache diary and other questionnaires during this study.&#xD;
