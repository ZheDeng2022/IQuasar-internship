      Multicenter, prospective, observational study in aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing&#xD;
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or high-risk patients undergoing aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement (AVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of neurocognitive status before and after transcatheter aortic valve&#xD;
           implantation and aortic valve replacement procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of Quality of Life (QoL) after these procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Defining the relevance of baseline psychological, emotional and cognitive factors on the&#xD;
           outcomes associated to the different treatment modalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of costs associated to each of the above mentioned strategies of treatment,&#xD;
           including costs of the index hospitalization and costs of follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Italy, a nation-wide observational study endorsed by the Superior Institute of Health has&#xD;
      been previously launched in order to evaluate appropriateness and effectiveness of aortic&#xD;
      valve replacement (AVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures: the&#xD;
      OBservational Study of Effectiveness of AVR-TAVI procedures for severe Aortic steNosis&#xD;
      Treatment (OBSERVANT). The present study was designed to complement the national survey on&#xD;
      TAVI and AVR procedures including data about costs, cognitive functions and quality of life&#xD;
      after these procedures. This integrated framework may help defining the relevance of baseline&#xD;
      psychological, emotional and cognitive factors on the outcomes associated to the different&#xD;
      treatment modalities and, on the other hand, should enable accurate evaluation of the impact&#xD;
      of each kind of treatment on quality of life and neuropsychological functions. These elements&#xD;
      could also represent relevant keys to decision-making to the different therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies. In addition, we aim to ascertain costs associated to each of the above mentioned&#xD;
      strategies of treatment, including costs of the index hospitalization and follow-up costs.&#xD;
      Costs estimate, combined to the integrated physical and mental health status outcome for each&#xD;
      treatment modality, may represent the background for subsequent cost-effectiveness analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation or aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement (if age ≥ 80 years or Logistic Euroscore ≥ 15%) for aortic stenosis at&#xD;
      participating centers during the period of enrollment will be included in the registry, after&#xD;
      release of written informed consent. Allocation of patients to different treatment groups&#xD;
      will be performed jointly by a cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon on the basis of a complete&#xD;
      clinical framework, independently from the present study and in accordance with available&#xD;
      guidelines. Type of treatment (for example, access site for TAVI, type of prosthesis…) will&#xD;
      be decided by the physicians based on local clinical practice and general principles of good&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of neurocognitive and quality of life questionnaires will be performed&#xD;
      before the procedure and after 3 months and 1 year by trained personnel following standard&#xD;
      operation procedures defined by a coordinating unit. A telephone and web-based support for&#xD;
      operators will be available throughout the entire duration of the study. A common methodology&#xD;
      for data collection and analysis is defined to guarantee data reliability and homogeneity of&#xD;
      assessments among the participating units. The cost analysis will be coordinated by the&#xD;
      Regional Healthcare and Social Agency of the Emilia Romagna Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in a web-based database (OBSERVANT) through dedicated Case Records&#xD;
      Forms and a final database will be built by merging this database with a separate database&#xD;
      for costs and Hospital Discharge Records and Mortality Registry databases.&#xD;
