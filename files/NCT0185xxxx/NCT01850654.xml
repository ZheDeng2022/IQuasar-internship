    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative (OCCPI) is to reduce&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer (CRC) in the state of Ohio. By identifying&#xD;
      individuals at high-risk for CRC (genetically predisposed) and providing screening&#xD;
      recommendations for cancer risk reduction, the OCCPI will understand how to increase length&#xD;
      of life and quality of life for those diagnosed with CRC in Ohio, as well as to better&#xD;
      prevent CRC in others in Ohio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have free tumor screening for Lynch syndrome, and may be eligible for free&#xD;
      genetic testing and free genetic counseling as part of this study.&#xD;

      Lynch Syndrome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lynch syndrome (LS), previously known as &quot;hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer&quot;, is a&#xD;
      hereditary cancer syndrome that causes the majority of hereditary CRC and approximately 3% of&#xD;
      all CRC. LS significantly increases the risk for an individual to develop CRC during their&#xD;
      lifetime. Individuals with LS also have an increased risk to develop extracolonic cancers,&#xD;
      including endometrial, gastric, ovarian, upper urinary tract, small bowel, biliary tract,&#xD;
      CNS, and certain types of skin cancer. Tumor studies, including microsatellite instability&#xD;
      (MSI) testing and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, provide information regarding&#xD;
      characteristic features of LS-associated tumors and can help target genetic testing. Given&#xD;
      the hereditary nature of this syndrome, screening all patients who are newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      CRC for LS can identify additional individuals who are at high-risk of developing cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By developing a CRC research infrastructure within the state of Ohio, the OCCPI will achieve&#xD;
      the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish and implement a statewide universal screening protocol for LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elucidate the prevalence of hereditary CRC in Ohio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide screening recommendations for high-risk individuals with CRC and their families,&#xD;
           as well as local access to genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create a CRC biorepository for future research on the etiology of CRC from the leftover&#xD;
           samples of the CRC patients, as well as samples from their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the successful implementation of the OCCPI, knowledge will be gained that will&#xD;
      facilitate the adoption of a universal screening protocol for LS in Ohio and the creation of&#xD;
      a statewide CRC biorepository to be used for additional studies on cancer risks, prevention,&#xD;
      screening, treatment and survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures for CRC and EC participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to donate 2-3 tablespoons of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small piece of your colorectal or endometrial tumor will be obtained from the hospital&#xD;
           where you had your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to contribute your leftover samples (tumor and blood) to the OCCPI&#xD;
           biorepository (sample bank) for help with future research. Additionally, CRC&#xD;
           participants will be asked to donate a saliva sample to the OCCPI biorepository. The&#xD;
           samples will be kept securely in a lab at OSU. Before your samples can be used for&#xD;
           research, the people doing the research must get specific approval from the OCCPI&#xD;
           Steering Committee and possibly the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of OSU. The IRB is&#xD;
           responsible for protecting the participants involved in research studies and making sure&#xD;
           all research is done in a safe and ethical manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete a questionnaire which will ask about your age, medical&#xD;
           history, family history, lifestyle factors and environmental exposures. It should take&#xD;
           about one hour to complete the questionnaire and you can complete it from home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will test your tumor for features of LS (MSI, IHC, methylation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For CRC patients: if your tumor shows features of LS OR you were diagnosed under age 50&#xD;
           OR you have a family history of CRC or endometrial cancer OR you have synchronous or&#xD;
           metachronous CRC or endometrial cancer, we will test your blood for the genes that cause&#xD;
           LS, as well as other genes that can cause hereditary cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For endometrial cancer patients: if your tumor shows features of LS, we will test your&#xD;
           blood for the genes that cause LS, as well as other genes that can cause hereditary&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some patients may have tumor genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are found to have LS or another type of hereditary cancer, you will be offered&#xD;
           free genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are found to have LS, your at-risk relatives will be offered free genetic&#xD;
           counseling and genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures for first-degree relatives (FDR) of the CRC participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDRs of all of the CRC study participants will be given the opportunity to contribute to&#xD;
      the biorepository for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family Member Consent for Contact forms will be provided to the CRC participant at the&#xD;
           time of their enrollment for them to distribute to all of their FDRs (parents, siblings&#xD;
           and adult children ≥ 25 years). The FDRs will mail the signed form to OSU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After obtaining permission to contact the FDRs, OSU will mail them the biorepository&#xD;
           consent form and saliva kit to return to the OCCPI biorepository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDRs of the CRC study participants will also be invited to complete the baseline&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The LS tumor screening portion of the OCCPI will take 1-4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If applicable, genetic testing results should be ready in an additional 3-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall, your participation in the LS screening portion of the OCCPI is expected to take&#xD;
           about 1 year. Most of this time will be spent waiting for results. Your active&#xD;
           involvement will take about 15 minutes on the day that you provide consent and about 60&#xD;
           minutes when you complete the questionnaire from home.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Newly diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma (all stages) and have a resection at&#xD;
             any hospital in Ohio between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For individuals who have neoadjuvant treatment and show a complete response at&#xD;
                  resection, the tumor screening will be attempted on their original biopsy (even&#xD;
                  if it occurred in 2012) as long as their resection occurred between 1/1/2013 and&#xD;
                  12/31/2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Many individuals with stage IV CRC will not have a resection; therefore, the&#xD;
                  tumor screening will be attempted on their original colon biopsy as long as their&#xD;
                  primary diagnosis occurred between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2016. If only metastatic&#xD;
                  CRC is available on a biopsy (liver or lymph node metastases), tumor screening&#xD;
                  will be attempted on the metastatic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Newly diagnosed with endometrial cancer (any histology except sarcoma) and have a&#xD;
             resection between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2016 at OSU only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All at-risk relatives of the participants found to have LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. First-degree relatives (parents, siblings and adult children ≥ 25 years of age) of the&#xD;
             CRC participants who do not have LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prisoners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals who are under the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals must have a primary colorectal or endometrial cancer, not a recurrence of&#xD;
             a previous colorectal or endometrial cancer.&#xD;
