      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals with cancer of the lung, chest cavity, ovary, or bladder, as well as patients&#xD;
      who have been treated with adoptive cell therapy unfortunately commonly succumb to their&#xD;
      disease. Some agree to donate their bodies to cancer research that may help the medical&#xD;
      community better understand these diseases. Studies of cancer tumor tissue obtained soon&#xD;
      after death may be used to answer questions about the origins, progression, and treatment of&#xD;
      cancer. Researchers want to conduct a study that involves planned collection of cancer tumor&#xD;
      tissue shortly after death. To do so, they will arrange to provide inpatient hospice care for&#xD;
      people with non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, or patients who have&#xD;
      been treated with adoptive cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect cancer tissue biopsy samples as soon as possible after death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who have cancer of the lung, chest cavity, ovary, or bladder, or those who have&#xD;
      been treated with adoptive cell therapy and are planning to receive end-of-life hospice care&#xD;
      are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will agree to receive inpatient hospice care at the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health Clinical Center. Full details on end-of-life care preference will be&#xD;
           acknowledged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An autopsy will be performed at the clinical center within 3 hours of death. Tumor&#xD;
           tissue will be collected from the primary site of cancer and from any areas of the body&#xD;
           to which the cancer has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will not receive further cancer treatments as part of this study. This is a&#xD;
           tissue collection study only....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite being the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, there is only limited&#xD;
           knowledge of tumor heterogeneity in lung cancer. There is also limited knowledge of&#xD;
           tumor heterogeneity of other less common thoracic malignancies, such as thymic&#xD;
           epithelial tumors and mesothelioma. The extent and causes of intra-tumor and&#xD;
           inter-metastatic heterogeneity in thoracic malignancies and how they compare to other&#xD;
           tumor types is of utmost importance in managing lung cancer. Newer approaches of&#xD;
           treating malignancies by targeting immune cells or tumor microenvironment are emerging.&#xD;
           Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) is one such approach. How this therapy affects&#xD;
           individual metastatic sites and specific clones of tumor cells is poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Little is known about the clonal architecture of advanced, heavily-treated urothelial&#xD;
           carcinoma or the dynamics that lead to metastasis and chemotherapy and immunotherapy&#xD;
           resistance. Urothelial carcinomas have a high somatic mutation rate (median 5.5 per&#xD;
           megabase) similar to that of non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. Urothelial&#xD;
           carcinoma tumors are extremely heterogenous and the extent of heterogeneity post&#xD;
           treatment is an important area of research that should be further explored.&#xD;
           Understanding the genetic and clonal evolution of urothelial carcinoma tumors will&#xD;
           eventually help guide management of treatment-resistant metastatic tumors. Comprehensive&#xD;
           tissue procurement by rapid autopsy will serve as a valuable mechanism to further&#xD;
           characterize aggressive treatment-resistant, metastatic urothelial carcinomas and other&#xD;
           rare genitourinary histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ovarian carcinoma is frequently associated with poor clinical outcome and metastatic&#xD;
           disease. Although metastatic processes are becoming more understandable, the genomic&#xD;
           landscape and metastatic progression in ovarian cancer has not been elucidated. Despite&#xD;
           prior efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other analyses that were&#xD;
           predominantly focused on samples from patients who had upfront debulking surgery, an&#xD;
           understanding of the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of ovarian cancer based on&#xD;
           highly clinically annotated samples is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor heterogeneity can be evaluated in a comprehensive manner by deep sequencing and&#xD;
           globally analyzing genomic and proteomic alterations of simultaneous core biopsies from&#xD;
           several areas of the primary tumor and metastases. These analyses correlated with&#xD;
           clinical outcomes can further the evaluation of tumor heterogeneity. However, such&#xD;
           studies are not feasible in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue procurement by rapid autopsies provides an effective way for such an&#xD;
           investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Clonal evolution and selection of tumor cells can be assessed by examining genomic and&#xD;
      proteomic alterations of tumor samples obtained from multiple sites of primary and metastatic&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Procure primary and metastatic tissue of thoracic malignancies, ovarian cancer, bladder&#xD;
      cancer and from patients treated with an ACT shortly after death, to investigate tumor&#xD;
      heterogeneity and immune microenvironment intratumorally, between paired primary and&#xD;
      metastatic sites, and among inter-metastatic tumors using integrated genomic and proteomic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (SCLC), extrapulmonary small cell cancer (ESCC), pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor (pNET),&#xD;
      thymic epithelial tumor, mesothelioma, bladder cancer (including urothelial carcinoma and&#xD;
      other rare bladder or kidney histology), ovarian cancer, and patients treated with an ACT,&#xD;
      with no expected chance of cure and an expected survival of less than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forty patients with NSCLC; 30 each with SCLC, thymic epithelial tumors, and&#xD;
           mesothelioma; 6 each of ESCC and pNET; 20 patients with bladder cancer; 20 patients with&#xD;
           ovarian cancer; and 20 patients treated with an ACT will be autopsied in this study. The&#xD;
           accrual ceiling for the study will be set at 205 in order to account for subjects that&#xD;
           for whatever reason do not undergo autopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be admitted for inpatient hospice when an investigator evaluates that&#xD;
           death is clinically imminent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon expiration, rapid autopsy will be performed and tissue will be obtained from the&#xD;
           primary tumor site, if identifiable, and multiple metastatic sites to assess tumor&#xD;
           heterogeneity and immune microenvironment using deep sequencing and global genomic and&#xD;
           proteomic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Archival tissue from patients, if available, will be used to evaluate these changes from&#xD;
           several stages of tumor progression.&#xD;
