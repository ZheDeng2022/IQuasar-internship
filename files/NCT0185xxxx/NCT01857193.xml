      Dose Escalation part of the study: To estimate the MTD(s) and/ or RP2D of LEE011 in&#xD;
      combination with everolimus + exemestane, and LEE011 in combination with exemestane, and to&#xD;
      characterize the safety and tolerability of the combinations of everolimus + exemestane +&#xD;
      LEE011 and LEE011 + exemestane in patients with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion part of the study: To characterize the safety and tolerability of the triplet&#xD;
      combination of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane in patients naïve or refractory to CDK4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor based therapy, and the safety and tolerability of the doublet combination of LEE011&#xD;
      + exemestane in patients refractory to CDK4/6 inhibitor based therapy (except patients&#xD;
      treated with prior LEE011 are not allowed in Group 3).&#xD;

      The primary purpose of the phase Ib part of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane&#xD;
      in patients with ER+ Her2- advanced breast cancer. This part of the study will also assess&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of the LEE011 + exemestane, LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane&#xD;
      combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dose Expansion part of the study will evaluate the triple combination of LEE011 +&#xD;
      everolimus + exemestane and the double combination of LEE011 + exemestane for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;
