      To estimate the I-year progression-free survival probability in patients up to 70 years of&#xD;
      age with previously untreated diffuse large B-celllymphoma (DLBCL), or with intermediate&#xD;
      (Burkitt-like) lymphoma, whose tumor cells show MYC rearrangement, and who are treated with&#xD;
      alternating cycles of Rituximab-HCV AD and Rituximab-Methotrexate-Cytarabine, in concert with&#xD;
      optimal supportive treatment including Pegfilgrastim, prophylactic antimicrobials, and close&#xD;
      clinical follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or intermediate (&quot;Burkitt-like&quot;) lymphoma, newly&#xD;
             diagnosed from an excisional biopsy or from a large core biopsy with sufficient&#xD;

             cytogenetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior lymphoma treatment, with one exception: One cycle of R-CHOP regimen is&#xD;
             permitted (consisting of one single dose each of Rituximab, of cyclophosphamide, of&#xD;
             doxorubicine, and of vincristine, as well as up to 5 doses of Prednisone when part of&#xD;
             chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No prior radiation therapy is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age ≥ 18 years to 70 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. CT imaging of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
             Any additional imaging used to assess extent of disease must also have been done&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Bidimensionally measurable disease by imaging within 28 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate bone marrow biopsy, and aspiration performed for staging within 28 days&#xD;
             before registration, and before start of any treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Indication for primary treatment with systemic multiagent chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL and estimated (Cockroft-Gault) creatinine clearance&gt; 50 ml/min&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Cardiac ejection fraction of ≥ 50% by MUGA scan or by 2-D echocardiogram , as well as&#xD;
             EKG without significant abnormality within 28 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Performance status of 0, of 1, or of 2 (ECOG scale)&#xD;
