      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Studies have shown that inflammation plays an important role in depression. Brain&#xD;
      inflammation may contribute to depression, and may make it more difficult to treat some kinds&#xD;
      of depression with current therapies. Researchers want to use magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study inflammation in the brain. To&#xD;
      do so, they will use a contrast agent, which is a chemical that can show inflammation during&#xD;
      an imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if people with major depressive disorder have increased inflammation in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           provide blood samples before the scanning sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a PET scan after the screening visit. They will have a dose of&#xD;
           the contrast agent before the study. This scan will look for possible brain&#xD;
           inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have an MRI scan. This scan will take pictures of the brain for&#xD;
           comparison studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation in the periphery and in brain may be a predisposing factor for major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD). For example, MDD (even in the absence of medical illness) is often associated&#xD;
      with raised inflammatory markers, and inflammatory medical illnesses are associated with&#xD;
      greater rates of MDD. Moreover, patients treated with cytokines for various illnesses are at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is a highly expressed protein in inflammatory cells of the&#xD;
      brain: activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in brain. TSPO is, thereby, a potential&#xD;
      biomarker of neuroinflammation. This protein can be accurately quantified using positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) and [C(11)]PBR28, a TSPO tracer synthesized in our laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess whether subjects with MDD have increased TSPO binding in&#xD;
      brain as an indirect marker of neuroinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will study up to 40 patients with MDD and 30 healthy volunteers. We will&#xD;
      recruit up to 40 MDD subjects to achieve 30 completers. The remaining 10 MMD subjects&#xD;
      included in the total - account for subjects who sign consent (and therefore contribute to&#xD;
      the accrual ceiling) but do not complete the study for a variety of reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About half of the MDD subjects will be taking antidepressant medication and half will be&#xD;
      unmedicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will exclude subjects (approximately 10% of the population) that have low affinity for&#xD;
      PBR28 ( non-binders ), based on a blood test or genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All healthy volunteers must not have any current serious medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      For absolute quantification of TSPO, both MDD subjects and healthy controls will have&#xD;
      arterial blood sampling concurrent with PET imaging using 11C-PBR28. We will try to minimize&#xD;
      the recruitment of new healthy controls by relying on our historical database of healthy&#xD;
      controls already scanned with [C(11)]PBR28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess absolute quantitation of TSPO with 11C-PBR28, we will primarily use the&#xD;
      distribution volume (VT) calculated with compartmental modeling. As the primary goal, we will&#xD;
      compare VT values obtained in MDD subjects with those from healthy controls. As secondary&#xD;
      goals, we will assess 1) the effects of medication treatment in the MDD patients and 2) the&#xD;
      relationship between CRP levels and TSPO binding in both MDD patients and healthy subjects.&#xD;
