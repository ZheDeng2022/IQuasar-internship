    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in study at 3 investigative sites in Philippines and South Africa from July 20, 2013 to January 13, 2020. Participants received delamanid up to Day 182 in the treatment period and were followed up to Day 365 for safety and efficacy and up to Day 730 (Month 24) for treatment outcome.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Pediatric participants with a diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) who were on therapy with an optimized background regimen (OBR) of anti-tuberculosis drugs and completed study 242-12-232 (NCT01856634) were enrolled in this extension study 242-12-233 to receive delamanid based on the participant's age and weight.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants from birth to 2 years old (inclusive) received DPF (suspension prepared using dispersible tablet) for 182 days plus OBR. Participants continued to receive OBR up to Day 365. The DPF dose was based on the participant's body weight during the baseline visit:&#xD;
Participants &gt;10 kilograms (kg) received DPF 10 mg BID plus OBR&#xD;
Participants &gt;8 kg and ≤10 kg received DPF 5 mg BID plus OBR&#xD;
Participants ≥5.5 kg and ≤8 kg received DPF 5 mg once per day (QD) plus OBR&#xD;
Delamanid dose was adjusted as needed for Group 4 participants based on the weight measurement at specified study visits [Visits 5 (Day 28), 7 (Day 56), 9 (Day 84), 11 (Day 126) and 12 (Day 154)].</description>

        <description>Central clearance is defined as plasma volume in the vascular compartment that is cleared of drug per unit of time. Inter-compartmental clearance is defined as a ratio of the drug's distribution rate between the central compartment and the peripheral compartments over its circulating concentration (L/hr). Population point estimates were based on POPPK analysis to find one measure each for both L and Q. The exposure data were pooled across visits and participants to identify POPPK parameter estimates and were reported for delamanid.</description>

        <description>Vc is defined as the theoretical volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount of an administered drug at the same concentration that it is observed in the blood plasma. Vp is defined as the apparent volume needed to account for the total amount of drug in the body if the drug was evenly distributed throughout the body and in the same concentration as the site of sample collection such as peripheral venous plasma.

        <title>Sputum Culture Conversion (SCC)</title>
        <description>SCC was defined as a sputum specimen from a participant negative for growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), followed by at least one confirmatory negative sputum culture at least 27 days after the first negative sputum test and not followed by any sputum cultures positive for growth.</description>
        <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug up to the end of the Post-treatment Follow-up Period (Up to Day 365)</time_frame>
        <population>Data for SCC could not be collected due to the paucity of sputum production in the participants.</population>

Participants &gt;10 kilograms (kg) received DPF 10 mg BID plus OBR&#xD;
Participants &gt;8 kg and ≤10 kg received DPF 5 mg BID plus OBR&#xD;
Participants ≥5.5 kg and ≤8 kg received DPF 5 mg once per day (QD) plus OBR&#xD;
Delamanid dose was adjusted as needed for Group 4 participants based on the weight measurement at specified study visits [Visits 5 (Day 28), 7 (Day 56), 9 (Day 84), 11 (Day 126) and 12 (Day 154)].</description>

        <description>The palatability of the pediatric formulation was assessed using an age-appropriate visual hedonic scale and clinical assessment (Groups 3 and 4 only). The palatability result was based on 1 of 5 responses: 1=Dislike very much, 2=Dislike a little, 3=Neither liked nor disliked, 4=Like a little, 5=Like very much. Participants were categorized based on different scores. The data per the investigator score are reported.</description>

        <population>Participants from the safety sample aged below 5 years (Groups 3 and 4) and who received any amount of IMP in this study, regardless of any protocol deviation or violation were analyzed for this outcome measure. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analyses at the given time point.</population>

        <description>The palatability of the pediatric formulation was assessed using an age-appropriate visual hedonic scale and clinical assessment (Groups 3 and 4 only). The palatability result was based on 1 of 5 responses: 1=Dislike very much, 2=Dislike a little, 3=Neither liked nor disliked, 4=Like a little, 5=Like very much. The data per parent/patient score are reported. Participants were categorized based on different scores.</description>
        <time_frame>Days 1, 28, 56 and 182</time_frame>
        <population>Participants from the safety sample aged below 5 years (Groups 3 and 4) and who received any amount of IMP in this study, regardless of any protocol deviation or violation were analyzed for this outcome measure. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analyses at the given time point.</population>
