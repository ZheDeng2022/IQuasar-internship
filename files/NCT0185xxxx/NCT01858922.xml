  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a type of cancer called Hodgkin Disease (HD), a cancer of the lymph system. The&#xD;
      lymph system is made up of tissue throughout the body that makes and stores&#xD;
      infection-fighting cells. HD is one of the most treatable childhood cancers. The standard&#xD;
      treatment for HD involves chemotherapy (treatment with anti-cancer drugs) and radiation&#xD;
      therapy (the use of high-dose x-rays to get rid of cancer cells). Although they are cured&#xD;
      from their cancer, some patients experience negative side effects from treatment later in&#xD;
      life. These kinds of side effects are often referred to as late effects. This can include&#xD;
      problems with growth, problems with some organ functions, and sometimes second cancers. These&#xD;
      types of effects can be associated with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators are therefore designing studies to minimize or prevent these late effects. It&#xD;
      is thought that if some patients can be successfully treated without radiation, those&#xD;
      patients might experience fewer late side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients, however, do not respond as well to the first stages of treatment (slow early&#xD;
      responders). Slow early responders are considered to be at higher risk for relapse. This&#xD;
      study also looks at whether these kinds of patients will benefit from additional&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at how the immune system recovers and at how certain&#xD;
      T-cells in the blood behave after receiving chemotherapy with or without radiation. The&#xD;
      investigators also want to identify if bio-markers (special proteins in blood and in cancer)&#xD;
      relate to the response of HD to study treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At first the subject will have 2 cycles of cancer drugs (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vincristine,&#xD;
      Etoposide, Prednisone, Cyclophosphamide). The doctors call this combination of cancer drugs&#xD;
      ABVE-PC for short. A cycle equals 21 days. The cancer drugs will be given intravenously (IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients evaluated as having an early response to treatment will be put in the group of&#xD;
      Rapid Early Responders (RERs). The RER group includes those patients whose disease has been&#xD;
      reduced by 60% or more. The next step for patients with RERs is 2 more cycles of ABVE-PC&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by another evaluation of their response. Those determined to have a&#xD;
      complete response (at least an 80% disease reduction) will receive no further therapy. Those&#xD;
      patients determined to have less than a complete response will receive radiation therapy&#xD;
      within 6 weeks after the last cycle or when blood counts are recovered. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      will be given to the involved areas and by the standard of care of this hospital (Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital). After radiation the subject will be off treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with disease reduction less than 60% are put in the group of Slow Early Responders&#xD;
      (SERs). The next step for patients with SER is 2 cycles of DECA (Dexamethasone, Etoposide,&#xD;
      Cytarabine, and Cisplatin). On Days 1 and 2, the subject will be given dexamethasone IV&#xD;
      first; afterwards, then they will receive the Etoposide and Cytarabine mixture. Cisplatin&#xD;
      will be given by IV only on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOLOGY TESTS The doctors are investigating molecules in tumors and blood that may help them&#xD;
      better understand the biology of Hodgkin's Disease. These studies may also help them&#xD;
      understand differences in patients' responses to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TISSUE FOR BIOMARKER STUDIES The doctors want to study the material that shows the make-up of&#xD;
      the cancer (the genes of the cancer tissue) and the special &quot;markers&quot; of the tissue. Tissue&#xD;
      from the subject's cancer biopsies will be used for these studies. They will collect these&#xD;
      samples when the subject has a biopsy for clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNE FUNCTION AND BIOMARKER BLOOD TESTS The doctors also want to collect blood samples to&#xD;
      study the subject's immune system and to look at biomarkers in the blood.&#xD;

If the subsequent PET/CT for RER patients indicates a partial response, those patients will undergo IFRT.</description>
