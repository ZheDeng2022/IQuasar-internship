      There is currently no experimental model that accurately represents sarcoidosis. The lack of&#xD;
      a useful research model significantly slows progress towards developing new treatments for&#xD;
      sarcoidosis. The investigators plan to develop a new model for sarcoidosis research and will&#xD;
      test the model to see if it helps us understand how sarcoidosis develops and if it is useful&#xD;
      for testing new treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause, most commonly affecting the&#xD;
      lungs, which tends to afflict young adults in the prime of their lives. Recent data&#xD;
      indicating that sarcoidosis mortality rates are rising in the U.S. (1) and Europe (2)&#xD;
      highlight the inadequacy of current therapies. As noted in a recent NIH-sponsored sarcoidosis&#xD;
      workshop, the lack of relevant animal, computer or in vitro models represents a bottleneck&#xD;
      for progress towards understanding disease mechanisms and developing highly effective&#xD;
      sarcoidosis treatments (3). The lack of useful disease models likely contributes to the&#xD;
      current lack (zero) of investigator-initiated (RO1) projects supporting sarcoidosis research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a novel human sarcoidosis research model to&#xD;
      fill the current void in the field, thereby expediting exploration of basic disease&#xD;
      mechanisms and pre-clinical testing of novel therapies. The objective of this application,&#xD;
      which is the first step towards achieving the long-term goal, is to develop a novel in vitro&#xD;
      human granuloma model to represent abnormal granuloma formation in the context of&#xD;
      sarcoidosis. In this regard, a growing body of evidence indicates that mycobacterial antigens&#xD;
      are commonly harbored in sarcoidosis tissues, to which these patients are sensitized (4, 5).&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that the pathological mechanisms of sarcoidosis can be modeled in&#xD;
      vitro, as represented by abnormal granuloma formation in response to mycobacterial and other&#xD;
      ubiquitous environmental antigens. The feasibility of our proposed model is supported by&#xD;
      preliminary studies showing that subjects sensitized to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens&#xD;
      (latent TB tuberculosis with a positive TB skin test) form well-organized granulomas readily&#xD;
      in response to challenge with TB antigens, compared to healthy controls. This project is&#xD;
      highly innovative and we feel has an excellent likelihood of leading to a critical&#xD;
      breakthrough in the field of sarcoidosis research.&#xD;
