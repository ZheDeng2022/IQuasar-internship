      The objective of the study is to determine whether the combination of the bile acid TUDCA,&#xD;
      and doxycycline will slow the progression of familial and senile amyloidosis.&#xD;

      Primary objectives The study is designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      doxycycline and TUDCA, prescribed together, on cardiac disease progression in patients with&#xD;
      senile systemic amyloidosis or familial amyloidosis due to a TTR mutation. The definition of&#xD;
      progression will be defined, primarily, by echocardiographic indices , as well as by serial&#xD;
      cardiac biomarkers, specifically NT-proBNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Echocardiographic details&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Standard parameters of wall thickness, chamber size, Doppler echocardiographic assessment&#xD;
      of valvular function and diastolic function will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the response rate to doxycycline + TUDCA treatment at month 12 and&#xD;
      18, based upon echocardiographic findings. Since the precise echocardiographic findings will&#xD;
      determine the definition of a responder, an approximate figure on which progression is based&#xD;
      will be given here, based on our previous, preliminary data. A responder will be defined as a&#xD;
      patient with echocardiographic evidence of stability of speckle strain parameters at 12&#xD;
      months of therapy with doxycycline/TUDCA. Based on our preliminary work, this is currently&#xD;
      defined as a change in absolute longitudinal strain of &lt; -2%, but the use of this parameter&#xD;
      may alter slightly after the part 1 analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the tolerability and safety of the treatment, based on evaluation of the&#xD;
           development of recognized side-effects, such as photosensitivity, drug sensitivity,&#xD;
           gastrointestinal disturbance and superinfection, as well as any other unexpected effects&#xD;
           potentially attributed to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess change from baseline in QoL (SF-36 scale) at months 6, 12 and 18;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an 18-month, open label treatment period in which doxycycline (100 mg twice daily)&#xD;
      and TUDCA (250 mg, three times daily) are administered to 30 consenting subjects with SSA&#xD;
      amyloidosis and 10 subjects with ATTR amyloidosis. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline,&#xD;
      and then after 6, 12, and 18 months of doxycycline plus TUDCA treatment or at time of&#xD;
      premature treatment discontinuation. Monthly phone contacts and regular blood tests will be&#xD;
      performed to monitor potential adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects will receive doxycycline hyclate (100 mg twice daily) as well as TUDCA&#xD;
      250 mg three times a day orally. Treatment will be initiated with doxycycline 100 mg daily&#xD;
      for 1 week, to assess tolerance, and then increased to twice daily for week 2, following&#xD;
      which repeat blood tests of BUN, creatinine , electrolytes and liver function tests will be&#xD;
      drawn. If these are stable, TUDCA will be added at the above dose, and the combination will&#xD;
      be administered for 17.5 months. TUDCA, formulated in capsules of 250 mg, will be provided at&#xD;
      enrolment and at subsequent study visits. Doxycycline will be prescribed through the&#xD;
      patient's own pharmacy as it is a widely available drug and is already being used as a single&#xD;
      agent in some patients with cardiac amyloidosis (including in our own program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients in whom doxycycline is poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal symptoms and/or&#xD;
      mild, transient reduction in blood cell counts, the treatment schedule will be modified&#xD;
      according to the protocol of Obici et al and doxycycline will be administered cyclically (200&#xD;
      mg/day for 28 days every six weeks up to 18 months). In these patients TUDCA will continue to&#xD;
      be administered at 250 mg, three times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study procedures will be performed at scheduled visits. Entry evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining consent, subjects will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality of Life questionnaire (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A full echocardiographic study (standard clinical practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serum creatinine, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, CBC, NT-proBNP, troponin I, alkaline&#xD;
           phosphatase, and pregnancy test (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-monthly visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months subjects will follow-up with the Investigator for standard blood work and&#xD;
      physical examination, to evaluate tolerability of the treatment, and to have an&#xD;
      echocardiogram. ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone contacts 3-Monthly phone contacts between clinic visits will be performed by the&#xD;
      research coordinator for monitoring of the treatment safety. to the IRB, as per IRB&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiograms will be read blindly to determine standard echocardiographic parameters, with&#xD;
      an emphasis on those that may change in progressive cardiac amyloidosis (LV mean wall&#xD;
      thickness, quantitative LV ejection fraction, LV dimensions etc)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints Response will be evaluated at Month 12 by means of the percentage of subjects&#xD;
      with stability in echocardiographic parameters, as initially defined based on the 40 patients&#xD;
      studied by serial echocardiography. Analysis will be performed both as an evaluation of the&#xD;
      percentage of the group whose cardiac function remains stable, and as an analysis of the mean&#xD;
      change in echocardiographic parameters compared to the historical control group. Details of&#xD;
      the drug regimen tolerability will also be analyzed. Patients will continue in the study for&#xD;
      an additional 6 months (duration of treatment 18 months) with a repeat (secondary) analysis&#xD;
      of the same parameters at 18 months (secondary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects discontinuing study participation prematurely due to drug intolerance will, if&#xD;
      agreeable, undergo a full Study Site visit evaluation. This assessment will include the&#xD;
      routine 6-montly tests, with the exclusion of a repeat echocardiogram if one has been done in&#xD;
      the past 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy observations and measurements For efficacy evaluation, subjects will be interviewed&#xD;
      and examined every 6 months. Echocardiograms, obtained at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months will be&#xD;
      analyzed for standard measurements as well as by strain imaging using a dedicated Echo-Pac&#xD;
      analysis system. Cardiac biomarkers will be obtained every 6months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-36 Quality of Life questionnaires will be administered at baseline and 6, 12, and 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
