  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, diabetes has emerged as one of the most significant co-diseases that many&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients develop. Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 (T2D) diabetes results when&#xD;
      either the body does not make enough insulin or the body does not respond correctly to this&#xD;
      insulin, respectively. Insulin is a hormone which is made by cells in the pancreas and helps&#xD;
      carry glucose (sugar) from the food we eat to the cells of the body for energy. While cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) has many features similar to both T1D and T2D, patients with&#xD;
      CF may not have the same symptoms as either T1D or T2D patients. Currently, there is little&#xD;
      understanding of CFRD and the best options for treatment remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to examine and understand the various mechanisms that&#xD;
      contribute to CFRD and gain a better understanding of potential means to treat CFRD. In&#xD;
      particular, we plan to study the effects of incretin hormones that can enhance insulin&#xD;
      production in CF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment is complete for the protocol as initially written. In order to further study the&#xD;
      role of the incretin hormone on Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)&#xD;
      function , we have received approval to extend our investigation to include the following&#xD;
      study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cystic Fibrosis participants with normal glucose tolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-Cystic Fibrosis controls&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) was considered to be a consequence of&#xD;
      damage to the pancreas therefore the cells contained in the pancreas--i.e.--islets that house&#xD;
      beta cells, which make and release insulin (similar to T1D). Recent evidence suggests that&#xD;
      other factors may also be associated that are similar to those with T2D. For example,&#xD;
      patients with T2D, have decreased secretion of incretins, hormones released by the small&#xD;
      intestine in response to nutrients from food which act, among other things, to increase&#xD;
      insulin secretion from Beta cells of the pancreas. When patients with T2D are treated with&#xD;
      incretin hormones, their pancreatic Beta cells release more insulin (measured as 'second&#xD;
      phase insulin secretion'). Currently, we do not know if patients with CFRD have decreased&#xD;
      incretin secretion like T2D or if treating CFRD patients with incretin hormones will improve&#xD;
      their insulin levels. This study will measure insulin release from the Beta cells from CFRD&#xD;
      patients (second phase insulin secretion) that are being given incretin hormones in the&#xD;
      veins. This will be compared with insulin release when the same patients are given a placebo&#xD;
      (salt containing solution). The patients and the research team will not know what is being&#xD;
      given until all the results are collected. The results will provide unbiased evidence if&#xD;
      incretins will help improve insulin release in CFRD patients.&#xD;

    <description>The key endpoint of interest will be the change in second phase insulin response derived from the Glucose-Potentiated Arginine (GPA) test. The GPA test will measure insulin (and other glucose controlling hormones) which will be a measure of pancreatic endocrine function in response to injection of arginine. Arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid (substance) in the body. It will be given in the veins to make the pancreas secrete insulin. After the first injection of arginine, a glucose infusion will be started in order to raise the level of sugar in the blood to 230 mg/dl. Once the level is achieved, arginine will be injected again and blood samples are measured. After a 2 hour break, the glucose infusion will be started to achieve a blood sugar of 340mg/dl and arginine injection will be repeated. Comparison of responses with incretin vs. placebo will be performed using statistical methods, specifically, paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched pair test.</description>
