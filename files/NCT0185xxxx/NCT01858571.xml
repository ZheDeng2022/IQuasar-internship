  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many of the pediatric malignancies are not curable on progression on front line or 2nd line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Further therapy with conventional drugs imposes many side effects and decreases&#xD;
      the QOL. The usual therapy offered to such patients is best supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic chemotherapy can induce tumor stabilization or tumor responses in patients with&#xD;
      cancer that are refractory or have relapsed after conventional chemotherapy. Whether&#xD;
      metronomic therapy is better than best supportive care is not known. In order to do so, a&#xD;
      study is required which may compare metronomic therapy with a placebo therapy on PFS and QOL&#xD;
      in relapsed refractory cases of pediatric solid tumors who have failed at least two lines of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that metronomic chemotherapy in progressive pediatric&#xD;
      malignancy will improve PFS and QOL. If validated, then this form for therapy will be an&#xD;
      option for both the patients and the clinicians, who are left with just an option of best&#xD;
      supportive care in such situations of progressive pediatric cancers despite multiple lines of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      in relapsed refractory cases of pediatric solid tumors who have failed at least two lines of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be double blind randomized study. One group will receive metronomic therapy along&#xD;
      with best supportive care and other will receive placebo and best supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be continued till progression is documented. Metronomic chemotherapy&#xD;
      schedule : Alternating cycles of Cycle A and B (Each cycle includes 3 weeks of drug&#xD;
      administration) with each drug rounded off to the nearest tablet/capsule size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily oral Thalidomide (at 3mg/kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily oral Celecoxib (100 mg BID for patients &lt; 20 kg, 200 mg BID for patients 20-50 kg,&#xD;
           and 400 mg BID for patients &gt; 50 kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily oral Etoposide (50 mg/m2/d) Cycle B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily oral Thalidomide (at 3mg/kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily oral Celecoxib (100 mg BID for patients &lt; 20 kg, 200 mg BID for patients 20-50 kg,&#xD;
           and 400 mg BID for patients &gt; 50 kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily oral Cyclophosphamide (2.5 mg/kg/d to a maximum of 100 mg/d) every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo: Alternating cycles of Cycle A and B (Each cycle includes 3 weeks of drug&#xD;
      administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capsules of same size and color as used in metronomic therapy Best supportive care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of pain as per WHO standard for pain management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of medications in capsules have to be rounded off to the nearest capsule size.&#xD;
      Instead of rounding off on the daily dose, the total dose over the week would be calculated&#xD;
      and rounded off and divided over 5-6 days in a week. This is being done so as to prevent any&#xD;
      extra dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any grade 3-4 toxicity occurs in the first course, then the dose for chemotherapy would be&#xD;
      reduced in the subsequent course by 20%.&#xD;
