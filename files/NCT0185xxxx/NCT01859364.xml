      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The success rate for those who attempt to quit using tobacco products is only about 5&#xD;
      percent. Many people who try to quit do so without seeking professional help. Several kinds&#xD;
      of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are available without a prescription. However,&#xD;
      prescription drugs and mental health counseling can also help people stop using tobacco.&#xD;
      Combining NRT and/or medication with counseling can increase success rates. Researchers want&#xD;
      to study what kinds of tobacco cessation treatments are most successful. This may help&#xD;
      develop better treatments and determine who will respond best to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide treatment for tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors that affect how well people respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are trying to stop using tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will last up to 1 year. Treatment may last up to 36 weeks. Treatment may&#xD;
           include counseling, NRT (patches and/or nicotine lozenges), or prescription medication&#xD;
           (varenicline or bupropion). Treatment will be determined by a study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have three study visits at 4, 6, and 12 months after starting&#xD;
           treatment. Each visit may take up to 2 hours. At the study visits, participants will&#xD;
           have different kinds of tests. They will provide blood and urine samples, and have&#xD;
           carbon monoxide breath tests. They will also fill out forms about mood and tobacco&#xD;
           cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During treatment, participants will have clinic visits once or twice a week for&#xD;
           counseling and to monitor tobacco use and withdrawal symptoms. Counseling sessions will&#xD;
           work on dealing with tobacco cravings. Each visit may take up to 90 minutes.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to create a mechanism whereby the intramural program of the&#xD;
      NIDA in Baltimore, MD can evaluate and treat a broad range of people who use tobacco&#xD;
      products. Through this protocol, participants will receive state-of-the-art treatment for&#xD;
      their tobacco use. The secondary objective is to investigate predictors of success in&#xD;
      tobacco-use-cessation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be individuals who present to the NIDA IRP seeking to quit tobacco use&#xD;
      (smoked and smokeless). Enrollment may occur as part of participation in another NIDA IRP&#xD;
      study. We will enroll up to 1000 participants. All individuals who give signed informed&#xD;
      consent and who attend at least one study visit will be considered evaluable. We will not&#xD;
      replace study dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      After undergoing initial screening and signing the IRB-approved consent form, participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in our outpatient smoking treatment-research clinic at the NIDA IRP. The&#xD;
      study will last up to one year, with active treatment lasting up to 36 weeks and follow-up&#xD;
      visits 4, 6, and 12 months after the first treatment visit. Treatment will include counseling&#xD;
      and pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline, if warranted and&#xD;
      medically appropriate). During active treatment, participants will visit the clinic up to&#xD;
      twice a week for counseling, dispensing of medication, and monitoring of tobacco use,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, and reporting of any adverse events. Visits may take up to 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no outcome measures for the primary objective. For the secondary objectives, the&#xD;
      outcome measures are (1) tobacco abstinence, as determined by self-reported tobacco use,&#xD;
      urinary cotinine, and (in tobacco smokers only) breath CO, and (2) reduction in tobacco use&#xD;
      of at least 50% (e.g., from 10 cigarettes per day to 5 cigarettes per day). Other outcome&#xD;
      measures for the secondary objectives include duration of abstinence, nicotine withdrawal&#xD;
      signs and symptoms, and tobacco craving. Behavioral, psychological, medical, and genetic&#xD;
      characteristics and tobacco-use history will be assessed at the beginning of the study as&#xD;
      predictors of treatment outcome and at follow-up.&#xD;
