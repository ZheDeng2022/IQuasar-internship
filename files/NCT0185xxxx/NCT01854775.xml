    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of Cohort 1 are to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) for&#xD;
      elvitegravir (EVG) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and confirm the dose of the&#xD;
      elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) STR (Part A) and to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TAF STR through Week 24 (Part B) in human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus - 1 (HIV-1) infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naive&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of Cohort 2 are to evaluate the PK of EVG and TAF in virologically&#xD;
      suppressed HIV-1 infected children 6 to &lt; 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg administered&#xD;
      E/C/F/TAF STR (Part A) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TAF STR through&#xD;
      Week 24 in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected children 6 to &lt; 12 years of age weighing ≥&#xD;
      25 kg (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of Cohort 3 are to evaluate the PK of EVG and TAF and confirm the dose&#xD;
      of the STR, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TAF low dose (LD) STR in&#xD;
      virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected children ≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 to &lt; 25&#xD;
      kg.&#xD;

          <description>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naive adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years of age) received elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) (150/150/200/10 mg) fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets, once daily orally with food for 48 weeks. Participants who completed 48 weeks of study treatment had the option to receive E/C/F/TAF in an extension phase of the study until: a) the participant turned 18 years old and E/C/F/TAF was commercially available for adults in the country in which the participant was enrolled; b) age-appropriate E/C/F/TAF became commercially available in the country in which the participant was enrolled; or c) Gilead elected to terminate development of E/C/F/TAF in that country.</description>
