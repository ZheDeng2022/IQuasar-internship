  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is one of the most difficult techniques&#xD;
      in the field of GI endoscopy. It is necessary for trainees to spend enough time and perform&#xD;
      enough cases to grasp this technique. The methods of ERCP training include hands-on teaching,&#xD;
      training on different kinds of simulators, training on ex-vivo or live anesthetized porcine&#xD;
      stomach models, etc. Supervised hands-on teaching is the standard method for ERCP training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective cannulation is considered the most difficult and challenging part of learning ERCP.&#xD;
      There is not an optimal time for trainees to attempt cannulation during hands-on ERCP&#xD;
      training. The time used for attempting cannulation by trainees was 5min or 10min in several&#xD;
      centers. In ERCP center of the investigators hospital, 15min was used for trainees to attempt&#xD;
      cannulation for about one year. The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis, the major&#xD;
      complication related to cannulation, was 4.0%, which was comparable with previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that a longer time (15min) for trainees to attempt cannulation&#xD;
      would increase success rate of selective cannulation and help to improve skills more quickly.&#xD;
      At the meantime, with actively verbal or hands-on assistance from the instructor during&#xD;
      performance of trainees, the risk of complications would not increased with a longer time to&#xD;
      attempt cannulation. Here a prospective, endoscopists-blinded, randomized, controlled study&#xD;
      was designed to evaluate the effects of different periods of time for trainees to attempt&#xD;
      selective cannulation on success rate of cannulation, self-satisfaction of performance and&#xD;
      post-ERCP pancreatitis.&#xD;

    <description>The standard cannulation technique was used with a sphincterotome preloaded with a guidewire, positioned in the ampullary orifice, and targeting the presumed entry of common bile duct (CBD) or pancreatic duct (PD). During the whole procedure of cannulation by trainees, the senior endoscopist would actively communicate with trainees through verbal and/or hands-on assistance to help them to make the performance more correctly. If the trainees failed to enter the targeted duct within the designated length of time, the senior endoscopist would take over the duodenoscope and continue the following procedure of cannulation. The whole procedure of cannulation was recorded by video. Rectal indomethacin and/or pancreatic stent was used in high-risky patients.</description>
