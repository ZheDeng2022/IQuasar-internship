    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to further investigate the safety of six different commercially&#xD;
      used Gadolinium-containing contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been developed to evaluate Gadolinium retention in patients with renal function&#xD;
      ranging from stable to severely impaired renal function who had previously (i.e. before start&#xD;
      of this study) received any of the six different contrast agents within a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      contrast imaging procedure and who will now undergo an orthopaedic procedure that allows&#xD;
      collection of bone and skin samples for analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to further investigate the safety of six different commercially&#xD;
      used Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. In order to get a better view of internal organs&#xD;
      such as the brain, joints and other body regions contrast agents containing Gadolinium are&#xD;
      often administered during magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gadolinium-containing contrast agents were introduced in the 1980s, and presently many&#xD;
      different products are in common use. Although these agents are well tolerated, in 2006 it&#xD;
      was reported that some patients with severe renal failure undergoing magnetic resonance&#xD;
      contrast imaging developed signs of a rare condition known as Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis&#xD;
      (NSF). NSF is an extremely rare disease that has predominantly been reported in patients with&#xD;
      severe kidney impairment, acute kidney insufficiency due to the hepatorenal syndrome (kidney&#xD;
      failure in patients with advanced chronic liver disease) or in patients with acute kidney&#xD;
      insufficiency, who have recently had or soon expect to have a liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect additional clinical data on a global scale and across different agents in&#xD;
      common use, this study was requested by the European Medicines Agency to further investigate&#xD;
      whether Gadolinium in human bone and skin are retained for a long time after administration&#xD;
      of Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. This study has been developed to evaluate&#xD;
      Gadolinium retention in patients with renal function ranging from stable to severely impaired&#xD;
      renal function who had previously received any of the six different contrast agents within a&#xD;
      magnetic resonance contrast imaging procedure and who are scheduled for an orthopaedic&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the patients will not be administered any research medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites are located in Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, USA, Japan and&#xD;
      Republic of Korea.&#xD;
