  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare IMRT with IMPT in patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma. Researchers want to learn about cognitive side effects (mental status changes)&#xD;
      that may occur, such as memory loss and impaired thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMRT is the delivery of focused radiation therapy using photon beams and advanced computer&#xD;
      planning to help shape the dose in order to give the highest possible dose to the tumor with&#xD;
      the least dose to surrounding normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPT is also focused radiation therapy similar to IMRT, but it uses proton particles to&#xD;
      deliver the radiation instead of photon beams. IMPT also uses advanced computer planning in&#xD;
      order to shape the dose to the target with the least dose to surrounding normal tissues.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will receive IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will receive IMPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, you will receive radiation treatments each day, Monday-Friday, starting on&#xD;
      Day 1. You will continue to receive radiation treatment until you have completed 30 total&#xD;
      treatments. This is a total of up to 6 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will sign a separate consent form for the IMRT or IMPT that will explain the procedures&#xD;
      and risks in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning radiation, you will have what is called a &quot;simulation&quot; to plan your&#xD;
      radiation. During the simulation, you will be flat on your back on a computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      table and a soft plastic mask will be made to help hold your head still during treatment.&#xD;
      This is the position you will be in when you receive radiation treatment. You will then have&#xD;
      a CT scan, which will make computerized images to help plan your treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Month 2 (+/- 30 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the thinking skills tests and the questionnaires about your quality of&#xD;
           life and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 6 weeks of radiation therapy. You will no longer be able to receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Month 4 (+/- 30 days) and then every 2 months for up to 2 years after radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the thinking skills tests and the questionnaires about your quality of&#xD;
           life and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting 2 years after radiation therapy, the study staff will continue checking your medical&#xD;
      record to find out about your health status from then on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. IMRT is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially&#xD;
      available methods. IMPT is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 90 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
