      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are cells that can develop into other tissue types,&#xD;
      including bone, cartilage, marrow, and blood cells. However, BMSCs are not stem cells there&#xD;
      is no evidence that after infusion into another person that BMSCs change into any other&#xD;
      cells. Research suggests that BMSCs can travel to different parts of the body and work with&#xD;
      immune cells to reduce inflammation and help repair damaged tissues. BMSC infusions have been&#xD;
      used in tests to treat moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's disease&#xD;
      (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). These tests have shown some good results, but more research&#xD;
      is needed to study their safety and effectiveness. Researchers want to see how well BMSC&#xD;
      infusions work to treat CD and UC. The BMSCs will be collected from volunteer donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at the safety and effectiveness of BMSC infusions for moderate to severe CD and UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years old with moderate or severe inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (CD or UC) that has not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two screening visits. The first will be 15 to 30 days before the&#xD;
           first BMSC infusion. The second will be within 14 days of the first BMSC infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first screening visit, participants will have a physical exam and medical&#xD;
           history. They will provide blood, urine, and stool samples. They will also give&#xD;
           information about their symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second screening visit, participants will have their vital signs (like blood&#xD;
           pressure and heart rate) measured. They will also provide blood samples, and have a&#xD;
           colonoscopy with biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During treatment, participants will have one BMSC infusion per week for 4 weeks. Blood&#xD;
           and urine samples will be collected at each treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week after the last infusion, participants will have a study visit. The tests from&#xD;
           the first and second screening visits will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be six follow-up visits at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the last study&#xD;
           visit. Participants will repeat the tests from the first screening visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the 2 major sub-types of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (IBD), are chronic, life-long conditions characterized by relapsing inflammation of&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract. CD has a predilection for the small bowel and the proximal large&#xD;
      bowel; however, it can affect the gastrointestinal tract discontinuously anywhere. UC mainly&#xD;
      affects the distal colon but can involve the entire colon as well. In spite of advances in&#xD;
      IBD therapeutics, a significant number of patients continue to have symptoms while on&#xD;
      conventional medications. The current protocol proposes to study infusions of allogenic bone&#xD;
      marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) for the treatment of active IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of BMSC infusions in subjects with IBD&#xD;
      and to examine the host clinical and immunologic response to BMSCs. BMSCs possess&#xD;
      multi-lineage differentiation potential in bone marrow, and aid in the repair of damaged&#xD;
      tissue. They suppress the lymphocyte immune response and target sites of inflammation to&#xD;
      promote healing through tissue regeneration. Studies are underway examining the utility of&#xD;
      BMSCs to treat several conditions including neurologic disorders, myocardial infarctions,&#xD;
      rheumatologic disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders including acute&#xD;
      graft-versus-host-disease and IBD. Progress in the understanding of the cell populations&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and the discovery of the potential immunologic and&#xD;
      regenerative characteristics of BMSCs have created a new potential direction for IBD therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I study will enroll subjects with moderate-to-severe IBD who are refractory to or&#xD;
      intolerant of standard therapy. Under the guidance of the NIH Bone Marrow Stromal Cell&#xD;
      Transplantation Center, the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine&#xD;
      at the Clinical Center has developed a procedure for collecting, expanding, and&#xD;
      cryopreserving clinical grade BMSCs under an FDA Drug Master File. Marrow will be aspirated&#xD;
      from volunteer donors participating on protocol 10-CC-0053 who have passed the standard&#xD;
      screening for blood and marrow donors; BMSCs will be expanded in vitro. Since it is not&#xD;
      necessary to HLA-match BMSC donors with their recipients, a BMSC repository will be used as&#xD;
      the source of BMSCs for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm 1, the safety of the BMSC infusion dosage (4 x 106 cells/kg/dose 10%) and schedule&#xD;
      (once a week for 4 weeks) will be evaluated in 3 non-overlapping IBD subjects. Once safety is&#xD;
      established in these subjects, subsequent subjects in Arm 2 will be enrolled without overlap&#xD;
      restriction. Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and response assessments at 28,&#xD;
      56, 84, and 112 days after the first infusion. Additional safety visits will be performed at&#xD;
      180, 360 and 720 days after the first infusion. Safety will be monitored by a Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board. Response to study drug will be assessed in all patients by changes in&#xD;
      symptom scores, endoscopic/histologic findings, quality of life scores, and&#xD;
      immunologic/laboratory parameters. Fifty subjects will be evaluated over a 5-year period.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  SUBJECT INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet ALL of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, as of the date of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be willing to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy during the study period.&#xD;
             Subject to the judgment and discretion of the PI, participants who meet ANY of the&#xD;
             criteria listed immediately below, as well as male participants who are in a&#xD;
             monogamous relationship with a woman who meets ANY of the criteria below, may not be&#xD;
             required to take any pregnancy avoidance measures (e.g. barrier methods). Such&#xD;
             participants will be counseled on risks at the time of consent and at appropriate&#xD;
             points (e.g. when pregnancy testing occurs) during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Females who have had their uterus, and/or BOTH ovaries removed&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Females who have had BOTH fallopian tubes surgically tied or removed&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Females who have undergone other permanent birth control procedures, such as&#xD;
                  endometrial ablation or sterilization (such as Essure or Novasure), and have had&#xD;
                  any required follow up testing to confirm the effectiveness of the permanent&#xD;
                  birth control procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Females who are above the age of 50 and have spontaneously had no menses at any&#xD;
                  point during the past 12 or more consecutive months (i.e. have reached&#xD;
                  menopause).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Females who, in the conservative and reasonable judgment of the PI (e.g. due to&#xD;
                  sexual orientation, or serious life choice), from the time of enrollment until&#xD;
&#xD;
                  12 weeks after the last BMSC infusion, will NOT participate in any potentially&#xD;
                  reproductive sexual contact (i.e. sexual intercourse with a male partner).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Males who have had a vasectomy and have had the follow-up testing confirming zero&#xD;
                  sperm count in their semen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any subject who does NOT meet the criteria listed in #2 above, will be appropriately&#xD;
             counseled on reproductive risks and pregnancy avoidance, and will be required to&#xD;
             adhere to the following measures, as agreed upon by the subject and the PI until at&#xD;
             least 12 weeks after the last BMSC infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A highly effective hormonal method to prevent pregnancy [e.g. CONSISTENT,&#xD;
                  CONTINUOUS use of contraceptive pill, patch, ring, implant or injection], and/or&#xD;
                  IUD or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  IN ADDITION TO&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A barrier method to be used at the time of potentially reproductive sexual&#xD;
                  activity (e.g. [male/female condom, cap, or diaphragm] + spermicide).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Male participants will be appropriately counseled on risks and must agree to&#xD;
                  consistently use effective contraception with female sexual partners through the&#xD;
                  Day 112 study visit to avoid a pregnancy that could be affected by the study&#xD;
                  drug. Appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy and trial related risks in sexual&#xD;
                  partners, per the PI s judgment, must be agreed to and practiced.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Most of the above interventions to prevent pregnancy must be implemented at a&#xD;
             particular time in the menstrual cycle, and may not be immediately effective. Trial&#xD;
             activity that may pose a reproductive risk may NOT occur until the above contraceptive&#xD;
             measures are fully effective and must continue until at least 12 weeks after the last&#xD;
             BMSC infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a diagnosis of CD or UC that has been endoscopically or radiographically&#xD;
             confirmed at least 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have either active CD symptoms as defined by a CDAI score between 220 and 450,&#xD;
             inclusive, as measured for 7 consecutive days during screening, or active UC as&#xD;
             defined by a SCCAI score greater than or equal to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient must have demonstrated an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or&#xD;
             intolerance of at least 1 of the following agents as defined below:&#xD;

          2. Concomitant treatment with anti-TNF therapy (or other biological therapy) or with&#xD;
             Entyvio/vedolizumab. The following washout period will be required for subjects to be&#xD;
             eligible to participate in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Three months washout prior to baseline for certolizumab or natalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Two months washout prior to baseline for adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, and&#xD;
                  Entyvio/vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. One month washout prior to baseline for cyclosporine, mycophenolate,&#xD;
&#xD;
             pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, and any other systemic immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Serum pregnancy test must be negative at screening for&#xD;
             female subjects of childbearing potential. Urine pregnancy test must remain negative&#xD;
             at each of the four infusion visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject does not agree to pregnancy avoidance measures required to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
             during participation in the study, or meet criteria that would exempt them from&#xD;
             contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has clinically significant systemic infection (e.g., chronic or acute infection,&#xD;
             urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection) within one month of&#xD;
             screening and no opportunistic infection within six months of screening. Has a history&#xD;
             or presence of recurrent or chronic infection (e.g. viral infections [including&#xD;
             hepatitis B or C, HIV], bacterial infections, systemic fungal infections, or&#xD;
             syphilis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a positive Quantiferon-TB Gold (QFT-G) test, indicating tuberculosis infection, at&#xD;
             time of screening. A QFT-G will not be done in a subject who has received tuberculosis&#xD;
             vaccination; these subjects will be eligible to participate if latent tuberculosis can&#xD;
             be excluded with a chest x-ray (CXR).&#xD;

          7. Received an agent not approved by the FDA for marketed use in any indication or any&#xD;
             small molecule inhibitors (e.g., Naltrexone) within 90 days of beginning the screening&#xD;
             CDAI diary or at any time during the screening window. This includes medications used&#xD;
             to treat IBD as an off-label use (at the discretion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count less than or equal to150,000 cells/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine greater than or equal to1.2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to2 times ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prothrombin time-International Normalized Ratio (PT-INR) &gt;2 and/or on chronic&#xD;
                  anticoagulation medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If total bilirubin is greater than 1.2 mg/dL, then direct bilirubin can be no&#xD;
                  more than 70% of the total, up to a direct bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has active infection with enteric pathogens as evidenced by positive microbiological&#xD;
             culture of stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
             testing will be performed on biopsies taken during the time of initial colonoscopy in&#xD;
             order to exclude CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has a history of low-grade or high-grade colonic mucosal dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a history of uveitis or iritis within the previous two months. This is due to the&#xD;
             concern that BMSCs may home to sites of active inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Had bowel surgery other than perianal (e.g., fistulotomy, seton placement, abscess&#xD;
             drainage) within 6 months prior to beginning the CDAI screening diary or drawing&#xD;
             screening blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has surgical changes to gut anatomy that preclude administration of clinical activity&#xD;
             indicies including but not limited to ileostomy, colostomy, or subtotal colectomy with&#xD;
             ileorectal anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has known or suspected short bowel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Requires parenteral or total parenteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a history of cancer, other than non-melanomatous cancer of the skin, within the&#xD;
             past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Unwillingness or inability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicates participation in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has only small bowel IBD that is inaccessible by standard colonoscopy to obtain&#xD;
             research biopsies. For this reason patients with only upper gastrointestinal IBD are&#xD;
             also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Refuses to abstain from using COX-2 inhibitors or NSAIDs throughout the 4 week study&#xD;
             drug infusion period.&#xD;
