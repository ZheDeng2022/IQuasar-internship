  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with blood cancers and those who received a bone marrow transplant frequently have&#xD;
      low circulating white blood cell countS. Fever in patients with low white blood cell count&#xD;
      requires early appropriate antibiotic treatment to prevent complications including death.&#xD;
      Bacteria have increasingly become more resistant to existing antibiotic options.&#xD;
      Ceftolozane-tazobactam is a newer type of antibiotic that has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      effective in infections caused by several types of resistant bacteria that can cause serious&#xD;
      infections in individuals with low blood count. This study aims to examine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of this antibiotic in these types of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with blood cancer and those who have received a bone transplant will be offered the&#xD;
      option to join this study if they develop unexplained fever. If informed consent is granted,&#xD;
      they will receive ceftolozane-tazobactam on top of the usual care that such patients receive.&#xD;
      The patients will then be followed very closely to check their response to the treatment and&#xD;
      if they develop any untoward events. The study will include 164 patients over an estimated 2&#xD;
      year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by Merck &amp; Co, the company that manufactures the study antibiotic.&#xD;
      However, Merck &amp; Co. will not be involved in the actual running of the study, the collection&#xD;
      of the study results or their analysis and interpretation. The study protocol has been&#xD;
      reviewed and approved by an independent research oversight committee.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of early appropriate empiric anti-bacterial therapy in reducing morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with prolonged neutropenia has long being documented. The National&#xD;
      Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR) antibiograms for recent years showed increasing&#xD;
      rates of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, as well as reduced susceptibility of P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa isolates to piperacillin-tazobactam. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is a newer&#xD;
      β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination with a broad in-vitro spectrum that includes ESBL&#xD;
      and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales, as well as multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa. The&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety of ceftolozane-tazobactam was demonstrated in registrational&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials in multiple settings. However, clinical experience with&#xD;
      ceftolozane-tazobactam in patients with hematological malignancy or HSCT is very limited. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to explore the potential role of ceftolozane-tazobactam as empiric&#xD;
      treatment for hematology patients with neutropenic fever of unknown origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of ceftolozane-tazobactam as empiric&#xD;
      anti-bacterial therapy for neutropenic fever in patients with hematological malignancy or&#xD;
      HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective, non-comparative, single-arm, single center, open-label&#xD;
      interventional study. Patients admitted to NCCCR with a malignant hematological diagnosis&#xD;
      and/or HSCT will be screened daily for possible inclusion in the study. Participants will&#xD;
      receive empiric therapy with ceftolozane-tazobactam intravenously. All remaining care will be&#xD;
      consistent with standard clinical care for patients with neutropenic fever. The Primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be treatment success at 72 hours of ceftolozane-tazobactam therapy without&#xD;
      modification of anti-bacterial therapy. Treatment success is defined as a composite of&#xD;
      defervescence, resolution of any baseline clinical signs of infection, microbiological&#xD;
      eradication of any baseline bacterial pathogen, and no modification of anti-bacterial therapy&#xD;
      by addition of or switch to an agent with microbiological activity against Enterobacterales&#xD;
      or P. aeruginosa (except the addition of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for P. jiroveci&#xD;
      prophylaxis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in full conformance with principles of the &quot;Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki&quot;, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and within the laws and regulations of Ministry of&#xD;
      Public Health in Qatar. Participation will be subject to written informed consent. The study&#xD;
      is sponsored by Hamad Medical Corporation. Funding and medication supply is provided by Merck&#xD;
      &amp; Co (MSD) through its Investigator Initiated Studies Program. MSD will not have any role in&#xD;
      data collection, data analysis or driving study conclusions.&#xD;
