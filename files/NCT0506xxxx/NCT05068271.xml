  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most research on the effects of regular exercise on cognitive and brain functions has been&#xD;
      focused on exercise programs with a single mode of exercise. Studies focusing on the effects&#xD;
      of exercise programs with multi-domains on cognitive function and cortical functionality are&#xD;
      sparse in late-middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, the current project will utilize a&#xD;
      single-blinded, double arm, 6-month randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a&#xD;
      multi-domain exercise program containing multiple physical fitness components, meditation,&#xD;
      and social interaction on memory performance, as well as cortical activities during the&#xD;
      memory tasks in cognitively intact adults (i.e., 45-70 years). In addition, the potential&#xD;
      moderator role of apolipoprotein epsilon-4 (ApoE e4) status and the mediator role of the&#xD;
      serum biomarkers (i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) will be explored.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aging has been adversely associated with the deterioration of cognitive and brain functions.&#xD;
      Most research on the effects of regular exercise on cognitive and brain functions has been&#xD;
      focused on exercise programs with a single mode of exercise. Studies focusing on the effects&#xD;
      of exercise programs with multi-domains on cognitive function and cortical functionality are&#xD;
      sparse in late-middle-aged and older adults. In addition, while growing evidence has revealed&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of regular exercise on cognitive function, scientific evidence&#xD;
      regarding the effects of multi-domain exercise programs on cognitive function and brain&#xD;
      function in late-middle-aged and older adults who are with or without the genetic risk for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is scarce. Lastly, the potential mediator role of the levels of the&#xD;
      serum biomarkers (i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) in individuals is required&#xD;
      to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, a single-blinded, double arm, 6-month randomized controlled trial will&#xD;
      be utilized to assess the effects of a multi-domain exercise program containing multiple&#xD;
      physical fitness components, meditation, and social interaction on memory, as well as&#xD;
      cortical functionalities during the memory tasks in cognitively intact adults (i.e., 45-70&#xD;
      years) . Specifically, the investigators aim to examine: (1) the causal links between a&#xD;
      multi-domain exercise program composing of various physical fitness components, meditation,&#xD;
      and social interaction against an active control group on the memory performance in&#xD;
      cognitively intact adults aged between 45 and 70 years with or without a genetic risk for AD,&#xD;
      (2) the cortical functionality through functional images collected through a series of&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), and (3) the potential influence of&#xD;
      apolipoprotein epsilon-4 (ApoE e4) and BDNF on the effects of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred eligible participants will participate in the current study and will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into either the 6-month multi-domain exercise group (exercise group) or the online&#xD;
      educational course group (active control group). In each group, the ages ratio (â‰¤ 55 years&#xD;
      vs. &gt; 55 years), and ApoE genotype [i.e., High-risk candidates (ApoE e3/e4 and ApoE e4/e4)&#xD;
      vs. the Low-risk candidates (ApoE e2/e4, ApoE e2/e3, ApoE e2/e2 and ApoE e3/e3)] will be in a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the exercise and the active control groups would receive either the two&#xD;
      90-min exercise sessions or online educational courses per week, respectively. All&#xD;
      participants' physical fitness, cognitive function, and cortical functionalities via fMRI&#xD;
      scanning will be assessed at the Baseline (Baseline-Assessments) and at the cessation of the&#xD;
      6-month intervention (Post-Assessments). The potential moderating role of ApoE genotypes and&#xD;
      the mediation role of BDNF will be explored. Participation in this study will take&#xD;
      approximately 7 months.&#xD;
