  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of skin cancer has been continuously increasing over the past decades und the&#xD;
      number of non melanoma skin cancer is well as melanoma is still going to increase. Invasive&#xD;
      biopsy and histological examination represents the gold standard in diagnosis of benign and&#xD;
      malignant skin tumors. However, novel technologies such as reflectance confocal microscopy&#xD;
      (RCM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been introduced in dermatology. Multiple&#xD;
      studies have shown the applicability of both technologies for diagnosis of skin tumors as&#xD;
      well as other skin diseases and to increase the specificity of diagnosis resulting in the&#xD;
      reduction of unnecessary biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technological developments resulted in a high resolution OCT scanner (AMO, Taiwan), which&#xD;
      allows vertical and horizontal evaluation (3D) of the skin at cellular resolution and up to a&#xD;
      depth of around 400 μm and thus combines the advantages of both above mentioned techniques.&#xD;
      ApolloVue® S100 Image System is a FDA-cleared 510(k) Class II medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other non-invasive imaging method (reflectance confocal microscopy and conventional optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography) will be used to evaluate a subset of skin lesions.&#xD;

      The new high resolution OCT scanner (ApolloVue® S100 Image System, Apollo Medical Optics,&#xD;
      Ltd. (AMO), Taiwan) is a CE-certified device, which allows non invasive imaging of the skin&#xD;
      at high resolution. ApolloVue® S100 System provides two-dimensional, cross-sectional and&#xD;
      en-face images which allow the real-time visualization of the skin and the assessment by&#xD;
      physicians. OCT is an interferometry technique, which can differentiate the back- scattered&#xD;
      light from different layers within the sample and reconstruct the microstructure of tissue.&#xD;
      ApolloVue S100 System uses a single-crystal fiber light source (750 nm wavelength), thus&#xD;
      allowing cellular images with an axial resolution around one micron can be achieved. The&#xD;
      full-field OCT (FF-OCT) system utilize a camera for parallel detection to increases the&#xD;
      scanning speed. Furthermore, by scanning an en-face image with the coherence and confocal&#xD;
      gates matched, it does not suffer from depth-of-field limitations present in standard OCT and&#xD;
      can achieve micron scale transverse image resolutions. AMO FF-OCT provides both&#xD;
      high-resolution en face and B-scan imaging with decent scanning speed. Compare to traditional&#xD;
      full-field OCT or confocal microscopy, the cross- sectional image can be shown in real-time&#xD;
      without reconstruction after whole volume is scanned. With a simple optical switch, user can&#xD;
      switch between two modes to improve the efficiency of lesion examination and gather more&#xD;
      structure information. ApolloVue® S100 System is a contact imaging system with a guiding&#xD;
      system which provides wide-range real- time color imaging to guide OCT measurement on precise&#xD;
      position. While a measurement starts, the cart can be moved to the patient and adjust the&#xD;
      height by lifter which covers sitting and lying positions. Then, user can precisely align the&#xD;
      probe to a lesion by moving the arm with the guiding video which is shown on monitor. Once&#xD;
      the lesion is aligned, user can switch the system from guiding mode to OCT modes and perform&#xD;
      OCT scans and save the images. After the scans, user can switch back guiding mode for next&#xD;
      position. The modes can be selected through the buttons on the probe or the computer. OCT&#xD;
      images and the scanning positions on the guiding image will be recorded simultaneously for&#xD;
      following up the lesion.The ApolloVue S100 System will enable the user to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acquire cross-sectional or en-face 2-dimensional OCT images of sub-surface tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acquire 2-dimentional OCT images of sub-surface tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Real-time image guiding system for OCT measurement and recording position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Read and manage OCT image data and annotations&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Export OCT images as PNG and as DICOM compliant image files&#xD;
