      Prospective, open-label, two-way crossover, phase Ib drug-drug interaction study in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a pre-treatment (screening) phase (within 14 days before the first&#xD;
      lurbinectedin or itraconazole administration) followed by a treatment phase consisting of two&#xD;
      lurbinectedin cycles, one cycle in combination with itraconazole and one cycle as single&#xD;
      agent (in different order depending on the study sequence), and one additional third cycle of&#xD;
      lurbinectedin as a single agent for patients who meet the continuation criteria and obtain a&#xD;
      clinical benefit after the first two cycles, and then follow-up of adverse events if any.&#xD;
