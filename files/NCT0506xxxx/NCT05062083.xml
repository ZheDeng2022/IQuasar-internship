      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that has no cure. MRI is the main tool used&#xD;
      in the study and treatment of people with MS. A tracer has been developed for&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme found in the brain during inflammation. Researchers want&#xD;
      to explore the role inflammation plays in MS and see if COX-2 is measurable in the brains of&#xD;
      people with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if COX-2 is detectable in the brains of individuals with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with MS who are otherwise healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with their medical history and a physical exam. They will have&#xD;
      an EKG to check the electrical activity of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants study involvement requires 2 to 3 visits and will last between 1 week and 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 PET scans of the brain. These might occur on the same day or on&#xD;
      separate days. A small amount of a radioactive chemical will be injected through an&#xD;
      intravenous catheter. A needle will be used to guide a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.&#xD;
      The needle will be removed. Only the catheter will be left in the vein. The PET scanner is&#xD;
      shaped like a doughnut. Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner.&#xD;
      They will wear a plastic mask molded to fit the head. The scan will last about 90 minutes.&#xD;
      Participants will receive the medication celecoxib orally about 2 hours before the second&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must avoid certain medications a month prior to the PET scans.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine whether cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is elevated in the brain of&#xD;
      individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether COX-2 is detectable in the brains of individuals with MS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Calculation of COX-2 density from [11C]MC1 PET scans, using baseline scans&#xD;
      and scans after blockade with celecoxib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: Comparison of [11C]MC1 specific uptake in different types of MS lesions&#xD;
      (active, chronic active, inactive) and in normal white matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen (16) participants with MS will be recruited. Participants may be male or female. They&#xD;
      must be &gt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multisite protocol that will enroll patients from University of Maryland and have&#xD;
      PET imaging performed at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be intravenously injected with 20 mCi of [11C]MC1 twice, once at baseline&#xD;
      and once after blockade by celecoxib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-3 days&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be male or female, aged &gt;18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable&#xD;
             means of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be in good general health as evidenced by medical history and&#xD;
             physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must have been enrolled under UMB protocol HP-00079860 (In vivo&#xD;
             assessment of meningeal inflammation and its clinical impact in multiple sclerosis by&#xD;
             7 Tesla MRI), P.I. Daniel Harrison and have agreed to contact for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential will be screened by history for the&#xD;
             possibility of pregnancy and undergo a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical contraindication to the procedures performed in the study, or any current&#xD;
             severe medical or psychiatric illness other than MS. This includes contraindications&#xD;
             to Celecoxib, such as aspirin sensitive asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Behavioral symptoms that would preclude the gathering of data for the study, or&#xD;
             advanced disease such that subjects cannot provide assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on EKG or safety labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI performed &gt;90 days before the PET scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should not have taken NSAIDs for two weeks prior to the PET scan. Aspirin,&#xD;
             corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate) must not have been taken in&#xD;
             the prior month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have other major neurological or medical diseases that may cause cognitive&#xD;
             dysfunction, such as structural brain diseases, metabolic diseases, paraneoplastic&#xD;
             syndromes, infectious diseases, or other significant neurological abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an unstable medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, makes&#xD;
             participation unsafe (e.g., an active infection or untreated malignancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are unable to travel to the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have recent exposure to radiation related to research (e.g., PET from other research)&#xD;
             that, when combined with this study, would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an inability to lie flat and/or lie still on the camera bed for at least two&#xD;
             hours, including claustrophobia, overweight greater than the maximum for the scanner,&#xD;
             and uncontrollable behavioral symptoms, which will be screened by an interview with&#xD;
             the patient and/or caregiver during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be NIMH staff or an NIH employee who is a subordinate/relative/co-worker of the&#xD;
             investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion of Children&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because this protocol has more than minimal risk from radiation exposure without&#xD;
        possibility of direct benefit, inclusion of children is not appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion of Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women will be excluded because this protocol involves exposure to ionizing&#xD;
        radiation. Lactating women will be excluded because radioisotopes may be excreted in milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion of Participants who are HIV Positive&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons with HIV infection are excluded because HIV infection itself may cause&#xD;
        neuroinflammation, and we wish to specifically study the effect of depression on&#xD;
        neuroinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion of Participation of NIH Staff or family members of study team members&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH staff and family members of study team members may not be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
