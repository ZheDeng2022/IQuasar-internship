      This study will evaluate if an intervention using academic detailing and audit and feedback&#xD;
      impacts the specific pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead models&#xD;
      implanted in Veterans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-based cardiac&#xD;
      electrophysiologists at three Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). Each cardiac&#xD;
      electrophysiologist will participate in a videoconference during which time an academic&#xD;
      detailing and audit and feedback intervention will be implemented, which will include details&#xD;
      and recommendations about lead selection for implantation, based on cardiovascular&#xD;
      implantable electronic device (CIED: pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator&#xD;
      [ICD]) lead-specific failure rates for lead models currently available in clinical practice.&#xD;
      The cardiac electrophysiologist will also be presented with quantitative data about the&#xD;
      individual physician's facilities implants and national data on implants over the past year.&#xD;
      These data will be shared in advance, with time for questions and discussion. The&#xD;
      electrophysiologist will be asked if anything can be done to facilitate selection of CIED&#xD;
      lead models with the statistically and clinically significantly lower failure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, over the subsequent 3 months, a quantitative evaluation of the CIED lead models&#xD;
      implanted will be evaluated, comparing changes in lead model selection among the&#xD;
      electrophysiologists receiving the intervention to a control group of all VA cardiac&#xD;
      electrophysiologists who do not receive the intervention. Subsequently, semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted to assess reasons for changes, or lack thereof, in CIED lead&#xD;
      model selection - including barriers and facilitators. Finally, quantitative data will be&#xD;
      included to each of the cardiac electrophysiologists, with additional feedback.&#xD;
