  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a longitudinal, observational cohort study of people who are newly-diagnosed&#xD;
      with HIV who consent to recency testing and participate in index testing services, and their&#xD;
      disclosed contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the impact of recency testing on HIV positive yield of index testing&#xD;
      among the contacts of newly diagnosed people living with HIV and the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      events or social harm as a result of returning recency results among newly diagnosed people&#xD;
      living with HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapid test for recent HIV infection (RTRI) assay can distinguish between people who are&#xD;
      recently-infected and those who are long-term HIV cases. This may help guide efforts to&#xD;
      identify ongoing HIV transmission and direct prevention or treatment efforts. But, more&#xD;
      research is needed on the impact of RTRI on the number of HIV+ individuals that can be&#xD;
      identified through testing. Furthermore, not much is known about the impact that returning&#xD;
      RTRI results may have on the occurrence of intimate partner violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A primary objective of this study is to compare the HIV testing yield among contacts of&#xD;
      people newly diagnosed with HIV by recency testing result. The investigators will abstract&#xD;
      routinely collected data from participant medical records and registers. In addition, a&#xD;
      second primary objective of this study is to assess the incidence of intimate partner&#xD;
      violence associated with the return of recency testing results among those classified as&#xD;
      testing recent versus long-term. Index study participants newly diagnosed with HIV will be&#xD;
      interviewed at the initial enrollment visit following HIV diagnosis and during follow-up&#xD;
      visits at 1, 2, and 6-months using a health-related quality of life instrument and intimate&#xD;
      partner violence questionnaire. Participants will be recruited from 60 high-volume facilities&#xD;
      across all provinces in Rwanda during the evaluation period.&#xD;
