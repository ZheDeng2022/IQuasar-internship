  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupuytren's disease is a frequent hereditary disease in Northern Europe. It is a degenerative&#xD;
      disease affecting the palmar aponeurosis of the hand. It develops a progressive contractile&#xD;
      fibrosis which cuts the hypodermic fatty tissue, adheres to the skin and the phalanges,&#xD;
      gradually bending the affected rays, resulting in significant functional impotence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various medical and surgical treatments are available.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among these treatments, none to date can eliminate recurrences, which are still too frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open aponeurectomy (consisting of surgical curettage of the fibrotic cords) remains for the&#xD;
      moment the reference technique for treating Dupuytren's disease, with recurrences (between 12&#xD;
      and 39%), but less frequent than the needle technique (50 to 85%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Could the addition of adipose tissue in the resection areas of Dupytren's fibrosis reduce the&#xD;
      rate of recurrence (by the inhibitory action of ADCs on myofibroblasts) in addition to&#xD;
      reconstructing the hypodermis in the cavity left by the resection of the cords and improving&#xD;
      the quality of the scars? The investigators insist on the fact that this is a homotopic and&#xD;
      homologous adipose tissue graft, in closed circuit without denaturation or adjuvant products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, to our knowledge, no other team has used &quot;lipofilling&quot; as an adjuvant treatment to the&#xD;
      open resection technique of Dupuytren's cords (aponeurectomy), the investigators first&#xD;
      conducted a clinical feasibility and safety study on 70 patients between 2012 and 2017&#xD;
      (currently being published by Springer Editions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now wish to conduct a prospective comparative study between patients&#xD;
      operated by aponeurectomy WITH (experimental group) and WITHOUT (control group) addition of&#xD;
      autologous adipose tissue in the resection areas of Dupuytren's cords.&#xD;

This questionnaire consists of 2 separate scales of 6 items each (one scale for the observer and one scale for the patient). Each item is evaluated on 10 points. The lowest score is &quot;1&quot; which corresponds to the appearance of normal skin. A score of 10 indicates the greatest deviation from normal skin. The total score for each of the scales is obtained by adding the score for each of the 6 items. This total score can vary between 6 and 60 for each of the scales.</description>

    <description>The lipofilling is performed, once the incisions are closed and is performed with the Puregraft® system.&#xD;
The fat graft is taken from the posterior, medial and anterior sides of the arm, by skin puncture. Approximately 10 cc are harvested, allowing a reinjection of about 2 cc per digital radius treated. After conditioning, the fat graft is redistributed to the curettage areas through the skin incisions.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Aponeurectomy alone</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient is installed in dorsal decubitus position and the arm to be treated is anesthetized by axillary block. The procedure is performed in the operating room, respecting all the rules of asepsis and safety in force. A tourniquet is placed on the arm to be treated and inflated to 250mmHg. Broken incisions are then made opposite the cords to be excised, which are located by palpation. Once the noble elements have been identified, the excision of the cords and fibrous nodules can be done as completely as possible. Sometimes an arthrolysis procedure is necessary in order to restore extension to a joint that has been fixed in a flexion position for several years. Skin closure is most often possible by direct suture or by means of local fatty skin flaps. In some cases, the surgeon may use total skin grafts, or directed healing in certain areas where direct skin suture is not possible.</description>
