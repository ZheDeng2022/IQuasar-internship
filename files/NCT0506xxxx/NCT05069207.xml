  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence in children is defined as involuntary leakage of urine. Urinary&#xD;
      incontinence is the most common urological complaint in children. Many factors are effective&#xD;
      in urinary incontinence. Research on the effectiveness of the diaphragm in postural&#xD;
      stabilization, which the investigators think is one of these factors, is limited. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing in postural&#xD;
      stabilization with healthy individuals and individuals with urinary incontinence. As a&#xD;
      result, it has been revealed that one factor of urinary incontinence is due to the&#xD;
      dysfunction of diaphragmatic breathing and will be a step to increase awareness on&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing.&#xD;

      Urinary incontinence in children is defined as involuntary leakage of urine. Urinary&#xD;
      incontinence is the most common urological complaint in children. Nocturnal incontinence is&#xD;
      the most common chronic problem of childhood as well as allergic diseases. Frequency rates of&#xD;
      5-15% are reported in various sources, and in studies conducted with school children in our&#xD;
      country, quite high rates of 20-30% are found. It is estimated that there are over 50 million&#xD;
      children with urinary incontinence worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many studies in the literature to determine the epidemiology and causes of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate diaphragmatic breathing in postural&#xD;
      stabilization in children with urinary incontinence. In our study, Kırıkkale University&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine hospital; Individuals between the ages of 5 and 18 who were diagnosed&#xD;
      with urinary incontinence and volunteered to participate in the study will be included in the&#xD;
      study. The number of individuals will be determined according to the power analysis to be&#xD;
      made. Individuals will be divided into 4 groups according to their diagnosis. Four groups&#xD;
      with monosymptomatic enuresis, non-monosymptomatic enuresis, daytime urinary incontinence and&#xD;
      healthy children as the control group will be included in the study. Before individuals;&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics such as age, gender, height and weight will be questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life in Children with Urinary Incontinence Scale (PIN-Q), which is the evaluation&#xD;
      parameters of the children included in the study, Voiding Disorders Symptom Score (IBSS) to&#xD;
      assess the severity of children's voiding disorder symptoms , Dynamic Neuromuscular&#xD;
      stabilization (DNS) to evaluate the diaphragm in postural stabilization ; S-index&#xD;
      (Inspiratory muscle strength), Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and volume (Volume (V))&#xD;
      parameters will be evaluated with the POWER breathe K5 to evaluate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses :&#xD;
&#xD;
      H01: Diaphragmatic breathing is active in postural stabilization in children with&#xD;
      monosymptomatic enuresis compared to healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H02: Diaphragmatic respiration is active in postural stabilization in children with&#xD;
      non-monosymptomatic enuresis compared to healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H03: Diaphragmatic breathing is active in postural stabilization in children with daytime&#xD;
      urinary incontinence compared to healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: In children with monosymptomatic enuresis, diaphragmatic breathing is not active in&#xD;
      postural stabilization compared to healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Non-monosymptomatic In postural stabilization in children with enuresis, diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breathing is not active compared to healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Diaphragmatic breathing is not active in postural stabilization in children with daytime&#xD;
      Urinary Incontinence compared to healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of our aims in this study is to realize the importance of the diaphragm.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life Scale in Children with Urinary Incontinence (PIN-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of six months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 20 questions. Children are asked to rate each question between 0 and 4 (0=no, 1=never, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=always). The total score of the scale ranges from 0 to 80 points. An increase in the total score means that the quality of life of the child is negatively affected.</description>

    <measure>Voiding Disorders Symptom Score (IBSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of six months</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the severity of children's voiding disorder symptoms. It consists of 14 questions in total. The 13 questions of the questionnaire evaluate symptoms related to daytime incontinence, symptoms related to nocturnal incontinence, frequency of urination in one day, presence of constipation and various urinary incontinence related symptoms. The 14th question evaluates the impact on quality of life in relation to these symptoms.The total score of the scale ranges from 0 to 35 points. An increase in the total score means that the severity of voiding disorders symptom severity increases.</description>
