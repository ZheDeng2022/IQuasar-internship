  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer, caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, poses a problem&#xD;
      worldwide as it is the fourth most common female cancer. Fifty percent of all invasive&#xD;
      cervical cancers occur among the 25% not attending cervical cancer screening. To reach these&#xD;
      women, this project will contribute to the development of a novel and accurate urinary and&#xD;
      vaginal screening tool, which allows women to collect the screening samples at home. This&#xD;
      project tests the hypotheses: 1) urinary HPV testing is non-inferior to HPV testing on&#xD;
      clinician-collected cervical samples for detection of high-grade cervical pre-cancer, 2)&#xD;
      Vaginal HPV testing is non-inferior to HPV testing on clinician-collected cervical samples&#xD;
      for detection of high-grade cervical pre-cancer and 3) DNA methylation testing is suitable as&#xD;
      a colposcopy triage test among women with HPV-positive urine and/or vaginal samples to&#xD;
      prevent unnecessary colposcopies and overtreatment of women without clinically meaningful HPV&#xD;
      infections. If confirmed, urinary and vaginal HPV testing could revolutionize todays&#xD;
      screening programs and keep Denmark at the forefront of cervical cancer prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paired urine, vaginal, and clinician-collected cervical samples will be obtained from&#xD;
      approximately 330 women aged 23-64 years referred for colposcopy and cervical biopsies due to&#xD;
      abnormal screening result or referred for cervical excision due to treatment of CIN2+. Upon&#xD;
      informed consent, the women will collect a first-void urine sample and a vaginal self-sample.&#xD;
      Before colposcopy or excision, a clinician will collect a cervical sample. Among women&#xD;
      referred for colposcopy, four cervical punch biopsies will be taken. For women referred for&#xD;
      excision, a cone biopsy will be taken using a loop electrosurgical excision procedure. Upon&#xD;
      arrival in the laboratory, the paired urine, vaginal and cervical samples will be HPV tested&#xD;
      using the Cobas 4800 HPV DNA assay. Histological results will served as reference and be&#xD;
      grouped as â‰¤CIN1 (normal tissue, CIN1) versus CIN2+. The performance of the six individual&#xD;
      methylation markers and combinations thereof will be evaluated using the histological results&#xD;
      as reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the relative sensitivity and specificity of HPV testing in&#xD;
      first-void urine, vaginal self-sample versus clinician-collected cervical samples to detect&#xD;
      CIN2+. Non-inferiority of HPV testing between sample types will be evaluated against a margin&#xD;
      of 90% for sensitivity and 98% for specificity. The performance of each methylation marker&#xD;
      will be illustrated by ROC curves and assessed by the area under the curve.&#xD;
