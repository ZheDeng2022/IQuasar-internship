  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients included will undergo biopsy and the molecular analysis will be discussed at the&#xD;
      institutional molecular tumor board. The recommandation of the molecular tumor board will be&#xD;
      provided to the physician in charge of the patient for final treatment desicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoints are the number of patients with actionable molecular alterations, the&#xD;
      number of patients with a treatment recommendation, the number of patients receiving the&#xD;
      recommended therapy, overall survival of the patients treated according to recommendations or&#xD;
      not. For patients treated according to the recommendations: Response rate and progression&#xD;
      free survival at 6 months according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Eligible patients have to have a histologically proven metastatic melanoma failing standard&#xD;
      treatments. Other inclusion criteria included age ≥ 18 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
      Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-2; life expectancy ≥ 24weeks; adequate renal, liver,&#xD;
      and bone marrow functions. Previous therapy with intravenous chemotherapy, immunotherapy or&#xD;
      major surgery at least 4 weeks before inclusion was allowed. Patients were excluded if they&#xD;
      had a history of cardiac disease or metastatic brain or meningeal tumors. The study is&#xD;
      approved by the institutional research ethics board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular analysis is performed at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics Berlin and&#xD;
      a comprehensive report is made available with 4-8 weeks. The molecular tumor board interprets&#xD;
      the data and transforms them into treatment recommendations by identifying and prioritizing&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers. The recommendations rely on the definition of evidence levels&#xD;
      attributed to every single aberration and the interdisciplinary discussion of the aberrations&#xD;
      with regard to patient situation, availability of drugs, and clinical trials. The&#xD;
      recommendations are transmitted to the physician in charge of the patient for the final&#xD;
      decision to treat or not the patient accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoints are the number of patients with actionable molecular alterations, the&#xD;
      number of patients with a treatment recommendation, the number of patients receiving the&#xD;
      recommended therapy, overall survival of patients treated according to recommendations or&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients treated according to the recommendations: Response rate and progression free&#xD;
      survival at 6 months according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
