  <brief_summary>

      It was aimed to evaluate the quality of life and sexual function of patients by Pre- and&#xD;
      postoperative POP-Q (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification) staging and PISQ-12 (Pelvic Organ&#xD;
      Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire) test of patients who underwent lateral&#xD;
      suspension operation with V-NOTES (Vaginal-Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery)&#xD;
      Technique.&#xD;

      NOTES technically means a surgical intervention performed by entering the abdomen through one&#xD;
      of the body's natural openings such as mouth, anus, vagina, and urethra. With the flexible&#xD;
      endoscope, a hole is made in organs such as stomach, colon, vagina, bladder, and the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity is entered and the area to be studied is provided by filling air. With the&#xD;
      V-NOTES (vaginal Vaginal-Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) method we will&#xD;
      apply, we reject the bladder from the cervix and reach to abdominal cavity by piercing the&#xD;
      visceral peritoneum. The abdomen will be viewed via trocars placed in this region and a&#xD;
      lateral suspension operation, which is a kind of suspension surgery of pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapsus, will be performed.The POP-Q staging that will be performed before the lateral&#xD;
      suspension operation with the V-NOTES Technique will be compared with the POP-Q staging 6&#xD;
      after the operation. In addition, Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PISQ-12) test will be used for the evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse,&#xD;
      urinary incontinence and sexual function in the same intervals.&#xD;
