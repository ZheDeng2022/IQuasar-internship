    <textblock>
      Many critical questions remain about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in real-world&#xD;
      settings. These questions can only be answered in post-introduction vaccine effectiveness&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol describes a prospective one-year cohort study of hospital-based HWs in Baku&#xD;
      city of Azerbaijan to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in preventing&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. HWs are the target population&#xD;
      in this study because HWs have been prioritized to be the first group to receive the vaccine&#xD;
      in Azerbaijan and offer an early opportunity to evaluate the vaccine in a population in which&#xD;
      it is critical that an effective vaccine be deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HWs will be enrolled after the study protocol is approved by the local ethical review&#xD;
      committee. All HWs eligible to be vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine can be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study, including those who intend to get vaccinated, those who don't plan on getting&#xD;
      vaccinated, and those who are not sure. The target enrolment is 1500 HWs in six hospitals in&#xD;
      Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment, study participants will complete a baseline enrolment e-survey about&#xD;
      demographics, clinical comorbidities, and work- and community-related behaviours related to&#xD;
      infection risk. In addition, a baseline serology will be collected from participants at&#xD;
      enrolment. No PCR testing for COVID19 virus will be done at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, participants will be actively followed for suspected&#xD;
      symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Participants who meet a suspected case definition will be asked&#xD;
      to have respiratory sample for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR to be collected by trained HWs.&#xD;
      PCR-positive samples from participants may also undergo genetic sequencing in or outside of&#xD;
      Azerbaijan to identify the genetic makeup of the SARS-CoV-2 that caused the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, at 6 months and 12 months of the study, serology will be collected from participants&#xD;
      to confirm and quantify the immunity after vaccination as a secondary objective. Serology&#xD;
      will be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serology samples will be stored and may be sent&#xD;
      to laboratories outside of Azerbaijan for advanced serologic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine effectiveness should be analysed as described in the analysis section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the final analysis at the end of the one-year period, interim quarterly (every&#xD;
      three months) analyses will be undertaken.&#xD;

      2. Background and study rationale In late 2019 a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome -&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged. On&#xD;
      January 30, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern.&#xD;
      On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The first case&#xD;
      of COVID-19 was detected in Azerbaijan end of February, 2020, and since then 236,012 cases&#xD;
      and 3,235 deaths has been reported in the country (data as of 8 March 2021).1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19 are vital for controlling the pandemic.&#xD;
      International collaborative efforts have accelerated the development of COVID-10 vaccines. As&#xD;
      of 5 March 2021, there were 182 vaccines in pre-clinical development, and 79 vaccines in&#xD;
      clinical development2. As of 18 February 2021, at least seven different vaccines across three&#xD;
      platforms had been rolled out in countries, including the Coronac vaccine produced by Chinese&#xD;
      company Sinopharm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the real-world COVID-19 vaccine performance is critical for understanding the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of vaccination programs. Many factors impact real-world vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness (VE), including vaccine transportation and storage and how patients are&#xD;
      vaccinated. In addition, the people who get the vaccine in clinical trials are often young&#xD;
      and healthy, and therefore different from those who will receive vaccines in the real world.&#xD;
      Post-licensing VE studies can also answer questions about effectiveness by age-group and&#xD;
      underlying medical conditions, duration of vaccine protection, relative effectiveness of&#xD;
      different vaccines, relative effectiveness of one dose vs. two doses, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the vaccine against new strains of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health workers (HW) have been targeted for this study for a number of reasons. Azerbaijan has&#xD;
      prioritized HWs for vaccination in line with the recommendations of the WHO SAGE and the&#xD;
      European Technical Advisory Group on immunizations for use of COVID-19 vaccines when supply&#xD;
      is limited. HWs provide a critical essential service in the COVID-19 pandemic response. HWs&#xD;
      are at high risk of acquiring infection and associated morbidity and mortality, and also pose&#xD;
      a risk of onward transmission to people who are also at high risk of serious COVID-19&#xD;
      outcomes. Ensuring that HWs receive an effective vaccine is also guided by the principle of&#xD;
      reciprocity because HWs play critical roles in the COVID-19 response, working under intense&#xD;
      and challenging conditions. Targeting HWs in this study offers an opportunity to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the vaccine in a population in which it is critical that an effective&#xD;
      vaccine be deployed. While the HW population is not perfectly representative of the&#xD;
      population of Azerbaijan, having an early understanding of the effectiveness of the vaccine&#xD;
      in this population can inform decisions about vaccine use in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization of HWs in Azerbaijan with Coronavac started in January 18, and the second dose&#xD;
      has been administered to more than 60% of HWs by 15 March 2021. At the same time, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 45-60% of health workers at the six target hospitals have received at least&#xD;
      one dose and 60% of those have also received second dose of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to study the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in HWs in six&#xD;
      selected hospitals in Baku city of Azerbaijan in order to answer critical questions about the&#xD;
      real-world performance of COVID-19 vaccines in one of the key target groups for vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stakeholders of this study include the following: Azerbaijan Republic Ministry of Health,&#xD;
      The Public Health and Reforms Center of the Azerbaijan MOH, TABIB (which is subsidiary of&#xD;
      Mandatory Health Insurance Agency of Azerbaijan that manages most hospitals in the country)&#xD;
      health workers in the six hospitals and in Azerbaijan in general, the administration of the&#xD;
      six study hospitals, and the World Health Organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Objectives 2.1.1. Primary objective To measure the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines&#xD;
      against symptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst hospital level health&#xD;
      workers eligible for vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccine in preventing any laboratory- confirmed&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 infection, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, as measured by&#xD;
           infection detected by PCR and serology?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long does the COVID-19 vaccine confer protection against infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is vaccine effectiveness (VE) by age?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is VE by comorbidity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the VE in people who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with&#xD;
           those who were previously uninfected?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does vaccine effectiveness vary by degree of exposure to COVID-19 patients in the&#xD;
           hospital setting and physical distancing practices outside of the hospital?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does vaccine effectiveness vary by new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that may emerge?&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Methods 3.1. Study setting and population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted among health workers working in six hospitals in different&#xD;
      districts of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan republic. The number of employees in each&#xD;
      hospital is provided in the Table below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitals in Baku are chosen for a number of reasons. The Baku capital is the largest city in&#xD;
      the country with over 3 million inhabitants. It has the largest hospitals in the country and&#xD;
      the largest number of hospital-based HWs of any city in the country. Baku has been and still&#xD;
      is at the forefront of fight with pandemic; the largest number of infections have occurred in&#xD;
      Baku, and the largest number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care are being treated in&#xD;
      Baku hospitals. In addition, conducting the study in Baku will facilitate issues related to&#xD;
      monitoring, supervision and logistics,. given the nation-wide quarantine-related restrictions&#xD;
      and limitations to regional travel. Investigators selected a convenience samples of hospitals&#xD;
      in various parts of Baku city.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be composed of HWs in the above hospitals, eligible for&#xD;
      vaccination, with no contraindication to receive COVID-19 vaccine. HWs include all categories&#xD;
      of staff working in these hospitals, including clinical and non-clinical/administrative staff&#xD;
      and staff with direct patient interaction and those without direct patient interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All HWs who are eligible for vaccination, according to MoH guidelines, will be offered&#xD;
      enrolment, regardless of their intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Currently, all HWs&#xD;
      are eligible to receive vaccines unless they have contraindications, such as severe allergic&#xD;
      reactions to previous vaccinations. Along with HWs, the educators, police and military&#xD;
      personnel as well as all citizens &gt;50 years of age are eligible to receive vaccines unless&#xD;
      there are contraindications including allergies to vaccine incipient/excipients or previously&#xD;
      confirmed allergic reaction to vaccination or current viral or bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will ensure follow up of enrolled participants via serology, respiratory swabs,&#xD;
      and questionnaires. Participants may receive COVID19 vaccine during the study period but not&#xD;
      as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts will be made to enroll all HW as close as possible to the time of their first&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will coordinate with hospital administration in order to ensure that the study&#xD;
      will not interfere with vaccine administration.&#xD;
