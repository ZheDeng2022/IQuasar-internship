  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palpitations occur in more than 25% of women as they approach menopause and after menopause.&#xD;
      However, the etiology of menopausal palpitations has not been studied, and it is unknown&#xD;
      whether palpitations in menopausal women are caused by underlying arrhythmias or other&#xD;
      electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The primary objective of this exploratory pilot study is to assess whether arrhythmias&#xD;
      and/or other ECG abnormalities underlie symptomatic palpitations in peri- and postmenopausal&#xD;
      women 2 The secondary objective is to better understand women's palpitations symptom&#xD;
      experiences (describe the symptom, its dimensions (frequency, severity, distress, duration,&#xD;
      temporal pattern, aggravating/alleviating factors), and any attempted or actual healthcare&#xD;
      utilization related to the symptom (provider contacts, discussions, referrals; laboratory or&#xD;
      other tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 40 peri- and post-menopausal women will be enrolled to determine if they have&#xD;
      underlying arrhythmias or other ECG abnormalities. n=20 peri/postmenopausal women who&#xD;
      describe palpitations within the previous 2 weeks and a control group of n=20&#xD;
      peri/postmenopausal women who have not experienced palpitations within 6 months will be&#xD;
      enrolled. All participants will undergo placement of a 14-day adhesive ECG monitoring patch&#xD;
      [(Carnation Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) patch, Bardy Diagnostics] on their chest. After&#xD;
      wearing the patch for 14 days, the patch will be removed, and a 2nd 14-day patch will be&#xD;
      placed, for a total of 28 days of ECG recording. Data from the adhesive ECG patches will be&#xD;
      uploaded and an assessment of arrhythmias and other ECG changes will be made. In addition,&#xD;
      all participants will undergo a semi-structured interview to obtain information on their&#xD;
      palpitations symptoms experience.&#xD;
