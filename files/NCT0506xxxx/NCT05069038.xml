  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor positive (PR+)&#xD;
      breast cancer do not achieve good responses with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. The sensitivity&#xD;
      of breast cancer to chemotherapy is often determined by the underlying gene expression&#xD;
      pattern and the molecular subtype of the tumor. The luminal subtype (A/B) which includes most&#xD;
      of the ER+ tumors are less sensitive to chemotherapy with lower pathologic complete responses&#xD;
      compared to ER- tumors. In addition, not all patients tolerate chemotherapy well. Due to&#xD;
      these factors, pre-operative endocrine therapy emerged as an effective strategy to improve&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Palbociclib,&#xD;
      an oral CDK 4/6 inhibitor in combination with anastrazole was recently shown to achieve cell&#xD;
      cycle arrest (defined as Ki-67 &lt;2.7%) at cycle 1, day 15 in 85% of the studied population.&#xD;
      This supports the evaluation of this combination further in the neo-adjuvant and adjuvant&#xD;
      settings. Hence, we propose to conduct a study at the University of Nebraska Medical Center&#xD;
      to assess the role of neo-adjuvant palbociclib (CDK 4/6 inhibitor) in combination with&#xD;
      letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) +/-Goserelin (GnRH analogue) to improve overall response and&#xD;
      surgical feasibility in post and pre-menopausal hormone receptor positive and Her-2 negative&#xD;
      subjects with stage IIA-IIIC breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The following drugs will be taken for six cycles:&#xD;
Palbociclib at a dose of 125 mg should be taken by mouth with food on 21 days and 7 days off schedule (meaning: on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle).&#xD;
Letrozole should be taken daily by mouth, every day of each 28-day cycle, at a dose of 2.5 mg.&#xD;
Goserelin is given as subcutaneous injection every 28 days at a dose of 3.6 mg. It is to be given on Day 1 of each cycle. Goserelin will only be administered to pre-menopausal subjects.</description>

    <description>Palbociclib at a dose of 125 mg should be taken by mouth with food on 21 days on 7 days off schedule (meaning: on Days 1-21of each 28-day cycle). If a subject misses a day's dose entirely, she must be instructed not to make it up the next day but just take her regular dose at the next assigned time. If a subject vomits any time after taking a dose, she must be instructed not to retake the dose but resume subsequent dosing at the next assigned time. If a subject inadvertently takes an extra dose during a day, she must be instructed to not take the next day's dose.</description>

             [by ASCO/CAP guidelines: primary tumor size 2 cm or greater OR if primary tumor size&#xD;
             is &lt;2 cm with lymph node involvement (Stage II)] who are candidates for palbociclib in&#xD;

                  serum creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pre-menopausal subjects defined by: Age &lt;60 with no prior bilateral oophorectomy and&#xD;
             having menses in the preceding 12 months in the absence of taking chemotherapy,&#xD;
             tamoxifen or torimefene or ovarian suppression. If any of these agents were used,&#xD;
             measurements of FSH and estradiol have to be made to determine menopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Post menopausal subjects defined by: Age &gt;60 Or absence of menstruation in the&#xD;
             preceding 12 months without taking chemotherapy, tamoxifen, torimefene or ovarian&#xD;
             suppression. If any of these agents were used, measurements of FSH and estradiol have&#xD;
             to be made to determine menopausal status. If none of these are applicable fully,&#xD;
             subject may be judged premenopausal according to local policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participating subjects must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of&#xD;
             protocol treatment and for 6 months after the last treatment with palbociclib.&#xD;
             Adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective form (i.e. abstinence,&#xD;
             (fe)male sterilization OR two effective forms (e.g. non-hormonal IUD and condom /&#xD;
             occlusive cap with spermicidal foam / gel / film / cream / suppository). Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
