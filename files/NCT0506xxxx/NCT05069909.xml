  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover trial was to assess the&#xD;
      satisfaction of edentulous patients and their oral health impact profile when provided with&#xD;
      complete dentures fabricated using the conventional and simplified techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 completely edentulous patients, aged 40-85 years, with no relevant medical conditions,&#xD;
      seeking complete dentures at a university hospital were included in this study. Those were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups (n=20). Each group received two sets of dentures, the Group&#xD;
      (S) were given the dentures constructed using the simplified technique first while the Group&#xD;
      (C) received the dentures constructed using the conventional technique. After 1 month of the&#xD;
      first set of dentures delivery, participants were asked to rate their general satisfaction on&#xD;
      a 10-cm visual analogue scale in addition to their satisfaction regarding comfort, retention,&#xD;
      stability, efficiency of mastication and speaking. Participants were also asked to fill the&#xD;
      20-item oral health impact profile for edentulous patients (OHIP-EDENT). Thereafter, each&#xD;
      group of patients were given the set of dentures constructed using the other technique, given&#xD;
      instructions and recalled after 1 month to evaluate the alternate set of dentures. 2&#xD;
      Prosthodontists performed all the clinical procedures and 1 laboratory technician performed&#xD;
      the laboratory procedures. The results of the study were analyzed using Wilcoxon-signed rank&#xD;
      test at significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
