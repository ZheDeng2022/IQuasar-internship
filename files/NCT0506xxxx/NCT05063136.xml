  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is one of most prevalent malignant tumors in the world. According to the&#xD;
      2020 edition of the global cancer statistics report, the incidence rate of BC has overtaken&#xD;
      lung cancer to become the most commonly diagnosed cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past three decades, survival of patients with primary BC have been notably improved,&#xD;
      mainly due to early detection of the disease and advances in adjuvant treatments such as&#xD;
      endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and anti-HER2 therapy. Patients with HR-positive and&#xD;
      HER2-negative primary BC account for approximately 70% of all cases of early breast cancer.&#xD;
      Endocrine therapy is the core treatment for this subtype of BC. Tamoxifen, aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor or their sequential administration can reduce the recurrence and mortality of this&#xD;
      BC subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of TEXT/SOFT study showed that, compared with the traditional 5-year tamoxifen&#xD;
      treatment, tamoxifen + OFS or aromatase inhibitor + OFS can further improve the survival of&#xD;
      HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients. However, for premenopausal BC patients with HR+/HER2-, only&#xD;
      82.5% (tamoxifen plus OFS) and 85.7% (aromatase inhibitor plus OFS) of 5-year DFS were&#xD;
      achieved. For postmenopausal BC patients, the 5-year DFS was only about 84% with aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors. Therefore, the survival of HR+/ HER2- BC patients needs to be further improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic chemotherapy refers to the use of the minimum effective dose of chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      for long-term, uninterrupted administration to achieve anti-tumor effect. Metronomic&#xD;
      chemotherapy has gradually been verified in clinical practice in the past 20 years. In 2020,&#xD;
      SYSUCC-001 study has confirmed that capecitabine (650 mg/ m2 bid, for 1 years) can reduce the&#xD;
      risk of 5-year DFS events by 36% in TNBC patients in addition to standard treatment. Besides,&#xD;
      POTENT study has confirmed that the combination of endocrine therapy and S-1 (for one year)&#xD;
      can further reduce the risk of iDFS by 37% in HR+/HER2- BC patients who have completed the&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with capecitabine, S-1 has no indication for BC and it is not in the recommendation&#xD;
      for BC treatment in the guidelines. Therefore, the investigators conduct this study to&#xD;
      explore whether adjuvant Capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy for one year can further&#xD;
      improve the survival of BC patients with HR+/ HER2- in addition to standard treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age: 18-70 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women with known menstrual status (at the beginning of randomization or adjuvant&#xD;
             endocrine therapy). Postmenopausal status is defined as (1) The patient has undergone&#xD;
             bilateral ovariectomy, or (2) Age ≥ 60 years, or age &lt; 60 years, amenorrhea for 12&#xD;
             months or more (without chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene or ovarian suppression),&#xD;
             and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and plasma estradiol are within the normal&#xD;
             range of local postmenopausal women.(3) If the patient is taking tamoxifen or&#xD;
             toremifene and is younger than 60 years old, the FSH and plasma estradiol levels are&#xD;

             adjuvant chemotherapy, amenorrhea is not a reliable indicator of menopausal status.&#xD;
             Ovarian function may be complete or restored despite anovulation/amenorrhea. For women&#xD;
             with treatment-induced amenorrhea, continuous measurements of FSH and/or estradiol are&#xD;
             required according to clinical guidelines to determine postmenopausal status.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Invasive breast cancer patients with HR (+) and HER2(-), which is confirmed by&#xD;
             histopathology. (1) ER and/or PR positive (positive staining accounted for more than&#xD;
             1% of all tumor cells) (2) HER-2 negative (IHC 0, 1+, or IHC 2 + and no fish&#xD;
             amplification)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients received radical surgery and chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy), and for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, at least one of&#xD;
             the following conditions should be met: (1) Patients not achieving PCR after&#xD;
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy; (2) Axillary lymph nodes metastasis (including&#xD;
             micro-metastasis) were confirmed by cytology or histology before neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have received breast cancer treatment in the past should meet the&#xD;
             following conditions at the same time: (1) No more than 1 year after radical&#xD;
             mastectomy. (2) For the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, the time from the&#xD;
             last chemotherapy to the beginning of enrollment should be more than 21 days. (3) For&#xD;
             patients receiving radiotherapy, it should be no less than 14 days from the date of&#xD;
             last radiotherapy to the beginning of enrollment. (4) Endocrine therapy should not&#xD;
             exceed 6 months before entering the study (calculated as 30 days per month);&#xD;

             ≥ 55% within 14 days before randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
