    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sequential treatment (Gabrinox)&#xD;
      comprising Gembrax regimen (Gemcitabine -Abraxane) followed by the Folfirinox regimen (5FU,&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan) compared to folfirinox alone in patients treated in first&#xD;
      metastatic line pancreatic cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in 2016, surpassing breast&#xD;
      cancer. It is estimated that by 2030 pancreatic cancer will become the second leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer death after lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its prognosis is very poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate (OS) at all stages of 5.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, its incidence doubled in men and tripled in women between 1982 and 2012. The World&#xD;
      Standardized Rate (MSR) for men and women respectively was 4.9% and 2% in 1980 and 10.2% and&#xD;
      6.9% in 2012. This means an annual rate of change of 2.3 for men to 3.9 for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its diagnosis is often late, carried out in 50% of cases at stage 4, with limited treatment&#xD;
      options, explaining its low survival rate at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until 2011, gemcitabine remained the only validated standard with a median survival of 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many combinations with gemcitabine have been evaluated but have shown no significant survival&#xD;
      advantage over Gemzar alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most promising results reported to date remain the combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan&#xD;
      and 5 fluoro-uracil (FOLFIRINOX), which became the standard metastatic first-line treatment&#xD;
      thanks to the results of the phase III study, ACCORD11, randomizing gemcitabine to FFX with&#xD;
      for the first time, a significant gain in median survival, progression-free survival and&#xD;
      response rate in favor of the experimental arm of 6.8 months vs. 11.1 months respectively&#xD;
      ([HR 0.57, 95 % IC, 0.45-0.7 3];p&lt;0.001), 3.3vs6.4 ([HR 0.47, 95 % IC, 0.37- 0.59];p&lt;0.001)&#xD;
      et de 9.4 % vs 31.6 % ; p&gt;0.001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, the combination gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel (GEMBRAX) showed, in a randomized phase&#xD;
      III study, compared to gemcitabine, a significant gain in terms, median survival, survival&#xD;
      without progression and response rate in favor of the experimental arm, respectively for&#xD;
      gemcitabine vs GEMBRAX, 6.7 months vs 8.5 months ([HR 0.72, 95 % IC, 0.62-0.83];p&lt;0.001) ;&#xD;
      3.7vs 5.5. ([HR 0.69, 95 % IC, 0.58- 0.82];p&lt;0.001) et de 7 % vs 23% ; p&gt;0.001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX and GEMBRAX, two chemotherapy protocols which have shown their effectiveness in&#xD;
      the 1st metastatic line with a gain in terms of response rate, progression-free survival and&#xD;
      median survival but with increased grade 3/4 toxicities, compared to treatment with&#xD;
      gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For FOLFIRINOX: a neutropenia rate of 45.7% vs 21% including 5.4% of febrile neutropenia vs&#xD;
      1.2, a rate of diarrhea of 12.7% vs 1.8% and peripheral neuropathies of 9% vs 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GEMBRAX neutropenia 38% VS 27% including 3% febrile neutropenia VS 1%, 6% diarrhea vs 1%&#xD;
      and peripheral neuropathy 17% vs 1%:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high toxicities, only patients with favorable performance status are eligible to&#xD;
      receive these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor therefore considered a new concept of sequential GABRINOX treatment combining&#xD;
      GEMBRAX followed by FOLFIRINOX, which should make it possible, by reducing toxicities, to&#xD;
      increase the response rate and at the same time progression-free survival and median&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor performed a phase 1/2 study evaluating this GABRINOX protocol with the main&#xD;
      objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose and increasing the response rate. Phase 2&#xD;
      is encouraging with a disease control rate and an objective response rate of 84.2% and 64.9%&#xD;
      respectively, progression-free survival at 10.5 months and overall survival at 15.1 months as&#xD;
      well as a more favorable safety profile compared to non-sequential treatments (less&#xD;
      neutropenia 34.5%, febrile neutropenia 3.5% and neurotoxicity 5.2%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These encouraging results led the investigator to propose a phase 2 study comparing the&#xD;
      standard first-line treatment regimen FOLFIRINOX with the sequential regimen GABRINOX with&#xD;
      the main objective of comparing efficacy in terms of objective response rate.&#xD;
