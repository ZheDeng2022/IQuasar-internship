  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to see if the TRICENTO Valved Stent Graft implant&#xD;
      reduces tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and improves the symptoms and quality of life in 15&#xD;
      participants with carcinoid heart disease, and who are not able to have a new valve via a&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and the potential risks and benefits, participants who&#xD;
      provide written consent will be screened to make sure they fulfil the study entry&#xD;
      requirements. This will involve a detailed medical history, a CT and an echo scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once it is agreed that the participant is suitable for the study, a custom-made TRICENTO&#xD;
      valve is prescribed and made. Participants need to be admitted to hospital for the TRICENTO&#xD;
      device to be implanted. Before the device is implanted the participant will have further&#xD;
      tests and measurements completed eg ECG, a Cardiac MRI, physical measurements such as height,&#xD;
      weight and blood pressure, blood tests, questionnaires and measuring how far they can walk in&#xD;
      6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is implanted in a cath lab procedure which should take about 30-60 minutes in&#xD;
      total. Participants should be discharged from hospital about 2-3 days later after recovery&#xD;
      and further echocardiogram, blood tests and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits are at 1 month and 6 months after the procedure. The following measurements&#xD;
      such as an ECG, echocardiogram, and physical measurements (height, weight and blood&#xD;
      pressure), some blood tests, questionnaires and measuring how far they can walk in 6 minutes&#xD;
      will be repeated at 1 month and at 6 months after the procedure. A cardiac MRI will also be&#xD;
      repeated at 6 months after the procedure. All these tests are to measure whether the TRICENTO&#xD;
      valve improves the participant's heart function, symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>All participants meeting the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled. A custom-made Transcatheter Tricuspid Valved Stent Graft based on CT to define anatomic dimensions will be made. The system consists of a custom-made valved stent graft delivery system, a custom-made valved stent graft bioprosthesis and a loading system. The bioprosthesis is self-expanding and consists of a stent graft spanning from the inferior vena cava to the superior vena cava and a lateral bicuspid valve element made of thin porcine pericardial leaflets requiring a low closing pressure, and Nitinol support structures. The participants will undergo a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure to implant the bioprosthesis which is delivered through a 24 French delivery system via transfemoral access. The device can be repositioned and is retrievable.</description>
