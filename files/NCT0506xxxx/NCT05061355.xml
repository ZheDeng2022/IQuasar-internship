  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a deadly disease and the incidence is increasing. An important&#xD;
      initial assessment of patients with IE includes whether surgical treatment is indicated; yet,&#xD;
      appropriate data to guide this assessment do not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASTERIx study will assess whether a surgical approach in addition to medical care for&#xD;
      treatment of IE is superior to medical care alone. In total, 496 patients will be included in&#xD;
      the study over four years. The study is event-driven and will require at least 240 events.&#xD;
      The study will assess the primary composite outcome of death, embolization, relapse of IE,&#xD;
      new heart failure or reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants who survive to discharge will be followed by routine clinical check-ups at&#xD;
      one- and four-weeks post-discharge and at three months. Additionally a 12-month study&#xD;
      follow-up is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also conduct a small substudy to assess the frequency of silent&#xD;
      emboli.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening disease and studies suggest that the&#xD;
      incidence of IE has almost doubled in the last twenty years. Despite improved&#xD;
      disease-management and diagnostics (i.e. antibiotics, surgery, and imaging techniques) IE&#xD;
      remains a condition that is hard to diagnose and associated with high mortality (â‰ˆ1/3 die&#xD;
      within one year). Surgery is a key part of the clinical practice in IE, but the role of&#xD;
      surgery has been greatly debated and is also used with great variation among centers. Valve&#xD;
      repair and replacement are high-risk procedures and per-operative risk is therefore also a&#xD;
      natural part of decision for surgery. Clinical guidelines on surgical indications have&#xD;
      remained stable in the past decades; however, these recommendations are not based on&#xD;
      randomized data and at the moment we are putting very sick patients with endocarditis through&#xD;
      high-risk procedures without the proper knowledge and perhaps we refrain from surgery where&#xD;
      benefit may be likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients for study inclusion (inclusion criteria are met), will be assessed at the&#xD;
      respective departments in Denmark where IE patients are treated (or in similar department for&#xD;
      the international centers). All departments refer to a local endocarditis heart team at a&#xD;
      tertiary center with cardiothoracic surgical capabilities. If no exclusion criteria exist&#xD;
      (confirmed by the local endocarditis heart team) and the patients sign informed consent after&#xD;
      a decent time for reflection (24 hours) then randomization will be done as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Study participants with IE are randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical Therapy and surgery: Standard of care treatment with antibiotics according to&#xD;
           national and international guidelines depending on the microbiological agent and the&#xD;
           investigators aim to perform surgery within 48 hours of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical Therapy alone with standard of care treatment with antibiotics according to&#xD;
           guidelines depending on the microbiological agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point of randomization will be in the hospital when the patient is assessed for open heart&#xD;
      valve surgery by the heart team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study participants are included in the study and are randomized to the medical treatment&#xD;
      arm of the trial, participants will stay at the local IE center and continue treatment there.&#xD;
      If participants are randomized to surgery, the participants will be transferred to a tertiary&#xD;
      center as soon as possible and returned to the non-surgical center for completement of&#xD;
      treatment. After end of treatment all participants will be discharged to routinely follow-up&#xD;
      at one- and four-weeks and at three months. Additionally, a 12 months visit will be planned&#xD;
      for all study participants.&#xD;
