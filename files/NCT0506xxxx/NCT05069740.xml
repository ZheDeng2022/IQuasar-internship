  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the underlying mechanisms associated with&#xD;
      elevated cardiovascular disease risk in women with endometriosis, and to measure the&#xD;
      effectiveness of emerging endometriosis treatments on outcomes specific to cardiovascular&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic data demonstrate a clear association between endometriosis, reproductive risk&#xD;
      factors, inflammation and cardiovascular (CV) risk. Circulating factors, low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL), are two of many biomarkers of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      inflammatory disease of endometriosis. An important signaling mechanism through which&#xD;
      circulating LDL and oxLDL act is the lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor (LOX-1). LOX-1 signal&#xD;
      transduction functionally results in pronounced endothelial dysfunction, a hallmark of CV.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis that one factor mediating the elevated risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in endometriosis is systemic inflammation and activation of LOX-1 receptor&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent gynecological disorder associated with considerable&#xD;
      chronic pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, and is a major cause of infertility. This&#xD;
      disorder affects 6% - 10% of reproductive age women and can be as high as 35-50% in women&#xD;
      experiencing pain or infertility. Endometriosis derives from the presence of endometrium-like&#xD;
      tissue in sites outside the uterine cavity. While endometriosis is a local inflammatory&#xD;
      syndrome, the inflammatory process is systemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis is associated with higher risk of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension 8.&#xD;
      Epidemiologic data demonstrate a clear association between endometriosis, reproductive risk&#xD;
      factors, inflammation and cardiovascular (CV) risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis a disease of inflammation and increased systemic inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      production, although the precise mechanisms by which localized lesion results in systemic&#xD;
      inflammation are incompletely understood. Published data confirm an elevation of several&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines in the circulation of women with endometriosis. Alterations in&#xD;
      circulating miRNAs specific to endometriosis are one mechanism causing immune dysfunction and&#xD;
      subsequent increased cytokine expression in areas remote from the endometriotic lesions. This&#xD;
      aberrant increase in systemic cytokine production is a highly plausible putative link to&#xD;
      accelerated vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis in women with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The circulating factors LDL and oxidized LDL are two of the many biomarkers of cardiovascular&#xD;
      and inflammatory disease of endometriosis. An important signaling mechanism through which&#xD;
      circulating LDL and oxLDL act is the lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor (LOX-1). LOX-1 is a&#xD;
      ubiquitously expressed scavenger receptor, stimulated by oxLDL, Ang II, and other&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited by estrogen. LOX-1 is the upstream signaling initiator&#xD;
      of mechanisms including increased oxidant production, reduced nitric oxide (NO) metabolism,&#xD;
      and impaired intracellular trafficking. Thus, LOX-1 signal transduction functionally results&#xD;
      in pronounced endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single blind placebo controled cross over study. Two groups of women complete this study: 1) healthy women between the ages of 18 and 45 years (Controls); 2) women between the ages of 18 and 45 years with endometriosis. Once consented and screening, each subject is randomized to either 5 days of salsalate or placebo. On day 5, each subject participates in a cutaneous microdialysis (MD) and flow mediated dilation (FMD) experiment. After a 2-week washout, the participant returns to repeat the study with the other oral drug (salsalate/placebo). These treatments are blinded to only the investigators. The participants and nurse on staff knows which treatment the subject is taking if there are any questions or safety concerns.</intervention_model_description>
