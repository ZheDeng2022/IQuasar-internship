    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate alternative dosing regimens of single-agent belantamab mafodotin&#xD;
      in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) to determine if an&#xD;
      improved overall benefit/risk profile can be achieved by modifying the belantamab mafodotin&#xD;
      dose, schedule, or both.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>KVA scale is used to grade the ocular AEs from Grade 0-4. KVA grading is a composite score considering corneal exam findings (ranging from clear cornea [Grade 0] to corneal ulcer [Grade 4]), as well as changes in visual acuity (ranging from no change from Baseline in visual acuity [Grade 0] to visual acuity reaching 1.0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ([logMAR] 20/200) or worse [Grade 4]). The KVA grade is driven by the most severe finding.</description>
