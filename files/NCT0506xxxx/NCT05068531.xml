  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In North America, colorectal cancer patients with resectable liver-restricted metastases&#xD;
      (mCRC-LR) are treated with approximately 6 months of preoperative systemic multi-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Actuarial data however supports that approximately 20% of mCRC-LR patients can&#xD;
      be cured without as much systemic chemotherapy. Prospective phase II-III trials also support&#xD;
      that awaiting recurrence to initiate further metastases-targeted or systemic treatment may&#xD;
      provide patients with longer overall survival while avoiding toxicities in those without&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of this single-centre, prospective observational cohort study in 100&#xD;
      mCRC-LR patients treated with curative intent along standard of care (SOC), is to obtain&#xD;
      real-world data on administered therapies, selected complications, and oncological outcomes,&#xD;
      while longitudinally collecting biospecimens to enable correlative research investigating&#xD;
      early biological markers of treatment resistance and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryopreservation of sequential blood derivatives, tumor tissue, and stool samples will allow&#xD;
      investigation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), T-cell receptor repertoire, somatic cancer&#xD;
      mutations, immune and other gene expression, gut microbiome, and soluble factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first biological marker that will be investigated in correlative research will be&#xD;
      longitudinal measurements of ctDNA targeting 30 oncogenes, 23 axons, and 146 hotspots (Follow&#xD;
      It assay, Canexia Health). Additional biological markers will be defined in subsequent&#xD;
      amendments to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are expected to provide important insights for the design of future trials&#xD;
      investigating ways to personalize therapy, such as to: a) avoid the unnecessary use of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, b) avoid morbid hepatectomies in patients&#xD;
      unlikely to benefit, c) test novel preoperative therapies in patients more likely to benefit,&#xD;
      and d) modulate the intensity of follow-up.&#xD;
