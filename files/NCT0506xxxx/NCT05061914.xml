  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective descriptive study which will be conducted at Sohag university&#xD;
      Hospital, Sohag, Egypt at emergency and cardiothoracic department . It includes all patients&#xD;
      with pericardial effusion who diagnosed as temponading pericardial effusion or threatened&#xD;
      cardiac temponade , The aim of this work is to clarify the suitability and individualization&#xD;
      of each surgical procedure (either subxiphoidal drainage, drainage through thoracotomy or&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pericardiotomy) in treatment and diagnosis of patients&#xD;
      presenting with pericardial effusion .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The normal pericardial space contains up to 50 ml of fluid that formed of a plasma&#xD;
      ultrafiltrate and the amount greater than this amount is considered as a pathologic effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curvilinear pressure-volume relationship of the pericardial sac leads to the consequences&#xD;
      of the pericardial effusion specially the rapidly accumulating fluid that causes cardiac&#xD;
      tamponade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lot of diseases and complications that vary in causing pericardial effusion e.g&#xD;
      idiopathatic pericarditis, malignancy, connective tissue diseases and heamorrhage. The&#xD;
      management of pericardial effusion depends on whether there is tamponade or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the new diagnostic strategies and the recent data have improved our ability to assess&#xD;
      the presence and the amount of pericardial effusion, and assess the cause and its&#xD;
      heamodynamic impact, the optimal management of the pericardial effusion is still&#xD;
      controversial. While the Echocardiography is the corner stone in the management, multimodal&#xD;
      imaging strategies specially computed tomography are dependable. The optimal therapy for&#xD;
      symptomatic pericardial effusions remains controversial. In general, there are surgical based&#xD;
      approaches and percutaneous-based approaches to pericardial fluid drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A surgical subxiphoid approach for draining a pericardial effusion was first described in&#xD;
      1829 and there have been several additional methods proposed for surgical pericardial&#xD;
      effusion drainage since that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1986, Kopecky and colleagues reported the first percutaneous pericardiocentesis series&#xD;
      with multiple subsequent reports characterizing the relative safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      percutaneous approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, pericardial effusion is classified by the volume of effusion. The treatment is&#xD;
      directed at the primary disease in patients with a small amount of effusion without symptoms.&#xD;
      In contrast, pericardiocentesis is performed for patients who are vitally unstable and with a&#xD;
      massive amount of effusion to prevent cardiac tamponade, Surgical drainage of pericardial&#xD;
      effusion was classically conducted by either open thoracotomy or subxiphoid pericardiectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracoscopy has established itself as an alternative to open thoracotomy for the management&#xD;
      of many pericardial, pleural and pulmonary disorders. Thoracoscopic cardiac procedures have&#xD;
      been performed less frequently. It affords excellent visualization of the pericardial&#xD;
      surface, thus allowing the safe performance of pericardial resection and formation of a&#xD;
      pericardial window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pericardial window allows drainage of pericardial fluid into the adjacent space, usually&#xD;
      the pleural cavity. The subxiphoid approach is erroneously referred to as a &quot;window&quot; because&#xD;
      no connection is made to the adjacent space during the standard subxiphoid approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thoracoscopic approach creates a true window but it is done under general anaesthesia&#xD;
      with single-lung ventilation and through 2 or 3 intercostal ports. However, the role of the&#xD;
      thoracoscopic approach is limited in patients with hemodynamically significant pericardial&#xD;
      effusions due to the positioning of the patients in the lateral decubitus which makes&#xD;
      emergency pericardiocentesis very difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently , video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pericardiotomy has gained popularity as a&#xD;
      minimally invasive approach. VATS allows for visual evaluation of the pericardium and is used&#xD;
      when the diagnosis of pericardial effusion has remained undiagnosed despite previous,&#xD;
      less-invasive tests. It is also used to drain the excess fluid and prevent its&#xD;
      reaccumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choosing the best surgical approach to drain the pericardial effusion is a matter of debate&#xD;
      and it should be based upon the effectiveness of the approach in avoiding recurrence of the&#xD;
      pericardial effusion and upon the morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure.&#xD;
      Moreover, the relative simplicity of the procedure and its cost are other important aspects&#xD;
      that should be considered when choosing the optimal surgical approach.&#xD;
