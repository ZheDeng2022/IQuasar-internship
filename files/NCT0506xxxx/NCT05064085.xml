             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active&#xD;
             bleeding diatheses, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known active infection, including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes&#xD;
             clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in&#xD;
             line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)&#xD;
             result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
             Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B&#xD;
             core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for the&#xD;
             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative&#xD;
             for HCV RNA. Note: This is applied only to patients with a known infection. Screening&#xD;
             tests for TB, hepatitis B and C, or HIV are not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to receiving cemiplimab.&#xD;

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the&#xD;
             evaluation of the study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure (as defined by the investigator) within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
