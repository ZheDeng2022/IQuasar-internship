  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and tumor burden of&#xD;
      18F-metafluorobenzylguanidine (18F-MFBG) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors mainly in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) and neuroblastoma&#xD;
      (NB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) and neuroblastoma (NB) highly express&#xD;
      norepinephrine transporter (NET) which is targeted by functional analogue of norepinephrine,&#xD;
      131I/123I-MIBG. However, low spatial resolution of 123/131I-MIBG and inaccurate attenuation&#xD;
      correction of single photon emission tomography (SPECT/CT) will affect the image quality of&#xD;
      MIBG SPECT and lead to poor diagnosis of small lesions. In addition, 123I-MIBG imaging is&#xD;
      usually performed at 24 h after injection, while 131I-MIBG is performed at 48 h or even 72 h&#xD;
      after injection. The procedure is complicated and takes a long time, which limits clinical&#xD;
      application. 18F-labeled MFBG is an ideal tracer to show the expression of NET. Preliminary&#xD;
      data show that 18F-MFBG imaging is safe and has favorable biodistribution and kinetics with&#xD;
      good targeting of lesions. Patients can undergo PET 0.5 hours after injection without special&#xD;
      preparation. Our study will assess the safety profile, image quality and evaluate the&#xD;
      diagnostic performance and tumor burden of 18F-MFBG. Patients with histologically confirmed&#xD;
      multifocal and/or metastatic neural crest tumor will be prospectively recruited in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        metastatic neural crest tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject should have a routine clinical 131I-MIBG scintigraphy (planar + SPECT/CT) performed&#xD;
        within 6 months prior to the inclusion visit or scheduled within 3 months after the&#xD;
        inclusion visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject is male or is a nonpregnant, nonlactating female who is either surgically&#xD;
        sterile or is post-menopausal. The subject is able and willing to comply with all study&#xD;
        procedures as described in the protocol.&#xD;
