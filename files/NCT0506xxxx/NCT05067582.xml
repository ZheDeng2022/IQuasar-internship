      This study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of L1-79 in participants&#xD;
      aged 12-21 years who have been diagnosed with ASD with a score of &gt;/= 70 and the Wechsler&#xD;
      Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II), and a score of &gt;/= 4 on the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) weighted for socialization.&#xD;
