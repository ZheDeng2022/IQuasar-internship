  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia has a major impact on people with dementia and their family. Informal caregivers of&#xD;
      people with dementia are at higher risk of developing depressive symptoms compared to&#xD;
      informal caregivers of people with other chronic diseases. Therefore, supporting this group&#xD;
      of informal caregivers is particularly important. With an online program based on Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT), this study supports caregivers of people with dementia to lead&#xD;
      a more meaningful and less stressful life. In addition to following the online program,&#xD;
      caregivers are supported weekly by a coach, who helps to set goals, map important values in&#xD;
      life, and take actions in relevant areas. The current study aims to examine the (1)&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and its procedure and; (2) preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention on clinical outcomes (e.g. psychological flexibility and&#xD;
      self-competence); and (3) maintenance of change after the intervention in short-and long-term&#xD;
      follow-ups. This study includes a single-arm, non-randomized trial with a baseline&#xD;
      assessment, a 9-week internet-based intervention period, a post-intervention assessment, and&#xD;
      two follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. ACT is a promising form of therapy that has previously been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in increasing the mental well-being of caregivers. However, this is the&#xD;
      first study to combine online ACT modules, goal-setting, and weekly coaching for informal&#xD;
      caregivers of people with dementia.&#xD;

    <description>Measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress will be assessed by DASS-21 self-report questionnaire. DASS-21 has three sections (7-items per section) that measure depression, anxiety, and stress on a 4-point Likert scale (0= the statement did not apply to me at all, 4= the statement applied to me very much or most of the time. DASS-21 is a validated scale that has been used in previous studies and has been recommended for measuring the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress.</description>

    <measure>Assessing change in sense of competence</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention (9 to 12 weeks), 3month after intervention, and 6 month after intervention..</time_frame>
    <description>Informal caregivers' sense of competence indicates the feelings of being capable of caring for a person with dementia. Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire (SSCQ) is a valid and reliable scale which has been used in previous studies with a similar target population and consists of seven items rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (&quot;agree very strongly&quot;) to 5 (&quot;disagree very strongly&quot;)</description>

    <measure>Assessing change in self efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention (9 to 12 weeks), 3month after intervention, and 6 month after intervention..</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES) is based on a Dutch adaptation of the Lorig et al. CSES evaluates caregiver self-efficacy (four item) and service-use self-efficacy (five items) and item scores range from 1 (uncertain) to 10 (very certain). Previous research has shown that CSES is valid and reliable</description>

    <measure>Assessing change in perceived burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention (9 to 12 weeks), 3month after intervention, and 6 month after intervention..</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver burden will be measured by a one-item questionnaire. The perseverance-time question will ask: if the informal caregiver's current situation persists, for how long (in month) the informal caregiver thinks they are able to maintain caregiving. This questionnaire is a good predictor for institutionalisation.</description>

    <measure>Assessing change in psychological flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention (9 to 12 weeks), 3month after intervention, and 6 month after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological flexibility is defined as the ability to be accepting, flexible and conscious in facing challenging situations and the ability to stay engaged with valued activities. This factor will be assessed by Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II, (AAQ-II) which has been reported to be valid, reliable and psychometrically consistent . 10 Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale and higher scores indicate more psychological flexibility</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing change in resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention (9 to 12 weeks), 3month after intervention, and 6 month after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in psychological flexibility and functional coping with negative thoughts and feelings in informal caregivers will be assessed using the Flexibility Index Test (FIT-60). This reliable and valid questionnaire will assess six different ACT processes (acceptance, diffusion, self as context, attention to present moment and values, and dedicated action) and can monitor the progress of the ACT therapy. The questionnaire consists of 60 items and is scored on a seven-point Likert scale (0= completely disagree, 6= completely agree). Higher score reflects on higher psychological flexibility.</description>

    <measure>Assessing change in values</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention (9 to 12 weeks), 3month after intervention, and 6 month after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Important areas of life will be identified by the Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ), which individuals rate level of importance of 12 different areas (e.g. family, work) on 10-point Likert scale (1= the area is not important at all, 10= the area is very important). The most important area will be considered as individuals' &quot;value&quot; at their current stage of life. The psychometric properties have been investigated in previous studies.</description>

    <measure>Assessing change in committed actions</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention (9 to 12 weeks), 3month after intervention, and 6 month after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The extent to which individuals have been actively living in accordance with their values will be assessed by the Engaged Living Scale (ELS). ELS has been recommended for assessing committed actions and value engagement . ELS consists of 16-items in which individual should reflect in statements based on 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 5= strongly agree)</description>
