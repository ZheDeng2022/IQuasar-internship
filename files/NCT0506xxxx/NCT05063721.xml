      Rationale: Mitochondrial disorders are progressive, often fatal multisystem disorders, in&#xD;
      20-25% of the cases caused by heteroplasmic mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). At&#xD;
      this moment, there is no effective treatment known to influence the disease process or&#xD;
      manifestation. Myogenic stem cell-based therapies complementing defective muscle cells and&#xD;
      fibres, are highly promising to combat the myopathy and exercise intolerance which affect&#xD;
      &gt;50% of heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation carriers. Myogenic stem cells called mesoangioblasts&#xD;
      (MABs), are currently the only myogenic precursors that fulfil all criteria to be used as&#xD;
      advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) for systemic treatment. The researchers have&#xD;
      demonstrated that MABs of most m.3243A&gt;G carriers contain no or only a low amount (&lt;10%) of&#xD;
      the mtDNA mutation, allowing direct ex vivo expansion of patient-derived MABs. The overall&#xD;
      aim is to induce muscle regeneration using these autologous MABs with a mutation load of&#xD;
      &lt;10%, as an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The phase I trial will consist of an intra-arterial injection (via catheter in&#xD;
      femoral artery) of the autologous MABs in the left lower leg of 5 m.3243A&gt;G patients.&#xD;

      Rationale: Mitochondrial disorders are progressive, often fatal multisystem disorders, in&#xD;
      20-25% of the cases caused by heteroplasmic mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies have shown that mtDNA disorders affect about 1 in 10,000 of the&#xD;
      general population, inducing significant morbidity and mortality and high health and societal&#xD;
      costs. Clinical manifestations are most prominent in organs with a high energy demand, like&#xD;
      muscle and brain. At this moment, there is no effective treatment known to influence the&#xD;
      disease process or manifestation. Myogenic stem cell-based therapies complementing defective&#xD;
      muscle cells and fibres, are highly promising to combat the myopathy and exercise intolerance&#xD;
      which affect &gt;50% of heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation carriers. Myogenic stem cells called&#xD;
      mesoangioblasts (MABs), are currently the only myogenic precursors that fulfil all criteria&#xD;
      to be used as advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) for systemic treatment, namely good&#xD;
      ex vivo proliferation capacity, high myogenic capacity and a capability to cross blood&#xD;
      vessels, allowing intra-arterial (systemic) delivery towards affected muscle. Both&#xD;
      genetically corrected autologous and allogeneic MABs transplantation has been performed in&#xD;
      mice and dog models, but only allogeneic MABs transplantation has been performed in patients&#xD;
      with Duchene muscular dystrophy (DMD). Treatment with ex-vivo expanded MABs resulted in&#xD;
      significant regeneration of DMD positive muscle fibers in both mice and dog models.&#xD;
      Intra-arterial delivery of allogeneic MABs in DMD boys (phase I/IIa clinical study)&#xD;
      demonstrated that the treatment was relatively safe, and that some dystrophin was produced by&#xD;
      the new muscle fibers, although not sufficient for functional improvement. The approach of&#xD;
      this study has key advantages as autologous MABs are used, which do not require an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regime. Also, mitochondrial function is partly preserved in mtDNA mutation&#xD;
      carriers and partial supplementation by healthy fibres should suffice to ameliorate&#xD;
      mitochondrial function. The researchers have demonstrated that MABs of most m.3243A&gt;G&#xD;
      carriers contain no or only a low amount (&lt;10%) of the mtDNA mutation, allowing direct ex&#xD;
      vivo expansion of patient-derived MABs. The overall aim is to induce muscle regeneration&#xD;
      using these autologous MABs with a mutation load of &lt;10%, as an advanced therapy medicinal&#xD;
      product (ATMP). This proposal covers the first phase I/IIa trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The phase I/IIa trial will consist of an intra-arterial injection (via catheter in&#xD;
      femoral artery) of the autologous MABs in the left lower leg of 5 m.3243A&gt;G patients. The&#xD;
      primary objective is assessing safety of administration of autologous MABs, which have not&#xD;
      been used as treatment before in humans. Secondary objectives are (1) to assess homing of the&#xD;
      labelled autologous MABs to the tibialis anterior muscle 24 hours after i.a. delivery, and&#xD;
      (2) assess effectiveness at the tissue level by measuring myogenesis and mtDNA mutation load&#xD;
      of treated tibialis anterior muscle compared with untreated muscle from the contralateral&#xD;
      leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Mono-center prospective open label intra-subject controlled phase I/IIa&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 15 adult m.3243A&gt;G patients, of which 5 will be enrolled in the clinical&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All 15 adult m.3243A&gt;G patients will undergo a ~30mg m. vastus lateralis muscle&#xD;
      biopsy at visit 1. From these 15 patients, five patients will enroll the clinical study based&#xD;
      on their m.3243A&gt;G mutation load in skeletal muscle and mesoangioblasts. These 5 patients&#xD;
      will visit the MUMC for four additional times. From each patient, during visit 2 till 5, in&#xD;
      total five muscle biopsies will be collected (1x ~100 mg m.vastus lateralis both legs at&#xD;
      visit 2, 2x ~30mg m. tibialis anterior both legs at visit 4 and 2x ~30mg m. tibialis anterior&#xD;
      both legs at visit 5). At visit 4, the tibialis anterior muscle of one leg will be treated&#xD;
      with 5*10E7/kg autologous MABs via tibial anterior artery delivery. A bout of maximal&#xD;
      eccentric exercise will be executed at visit 3. Venous blood samples will be taken at all&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is to assess safety will be by&#xD;
      monitoring infusion (angiography), monitoring for acute adverse effects (24hrs), blood&#xD;
      sampling and muscle sampling to assess local and systemic inflammation and muscle markers&#xD;
      (CK). Secondary endpoints are assessment of effectiveness at the tissue level: namely,&#xD;
      migration of the IC-Green labelled mesoangioblasts from the bloodstream into the tibialis&#xD;
      anterior muscle (24 hrs after infusion) and formation of new muscle fibers and m.3243A&gt;G&#xD;
      mutation load (28 days after infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Out of the 15 patients, 5 patients will enrol the clinical study and visit the&#xD;
      hospital five times in total. The 10 patients, who are not selected, will visit the MUMC&#xD;
      once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit (all 15 patients), a neurological and routine clinical examination&#xD;
           and one vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsy (~30mg) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit (5 patients), a routine physical examination will be performed, and&#xD;
           a vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsy (~100mg) and a venous blood sample (~10 ml)&#xD;
           will be collected and they will try-out the bout of eccentric exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 3: routine physical examination, a bout of maximal eccentric exercise will be&#xD;
           performed and a venous blood sample (10ml) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 4: routine physical examination, intra-arterial administration of 5*10E7 MABs&#xD;
           in one leg, followed by 24hrs observation in the hospital including regular blood&#xD;
           sampling (4x ~10ml) and a ~30mg tibialis anterior muscle biopsy of both legs 24 hours&#xD;
           after infusion of the autologous MABs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 consists of a neurological and routine physical examination, a venous blood&#xD;
           sample (~10ml) and a ~30mg muscle biopsy in the tibialis anterior muscles of both legs.&#xD;
