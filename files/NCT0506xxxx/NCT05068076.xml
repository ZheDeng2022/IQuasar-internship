  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancers are the sixth most common malignancies worldwide, with hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC) accounting for approximately 80% of them. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer&#xD;
      (BCLC) classification is widely used in the management of HCC. At the time of diagnosis,&#xD;
      fewer than 30% of the patients qualify for resection or transplant due to the large size or&#xD;
      multiplicity of the lesions, background chronic liver disease, and other comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the recent spread of surveillance has led to early detection of hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC), and the chance of receiving local treatment has increased. There are several&#xD;
      options to treat small HCCs, including surgical resection, chemical ablation,&#xD;
      transplantation, and percutaneous ablation (RFA/MWA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, percutaneous ablation plays a key role in the treatment of early-stage HCC because it&#xD;
      is less invasive than surgical resection and has a good efficacy. However, targeting of&#xD;
      lesions under USG alone may be misleading as there may be an enhancing component which is not&#xD;
      seen on plain ultrasound. To overcome this problem contrast enhanced ultrasound may be used&#xD;
      intra-procedurally, however conventional ultrasound contrast agents show washout by 5 minutes&#xD;
      from the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators prospectively analyze patients undergoing ablation with the&#xD;
      help of precise needle placement using a Kupffer phase ultrasound contrast agent&#xD;
      (perfluorobutane) and their post procedure response assessment.&#xD;

      International status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver with&#xD;
      increasing incidence due to hepatitis B and C viruses . Ultrasound (USG) with, or without&#xD;
      alpha feto-protein levels is a standard tool for surveillance of HCC. However, it leads to&#xD;
      suboptimal detection rate and false referrals in the US . Use of an ultrasound contrast agent&#xD;
      can be helpful in surveillance and diagnosis of focal liver lesions . Second generation&#xD;
      ultrasound contrast agents like sulfur hexafluoride (SonoVue), perflutren lipid (Definity)&#xD;
      and perfluorobutane (Sonazoid) are microbubbles composed of a phospholipid shell encompassing&#xD;
      a low-solubility gas . The characteristic property of Sonazoid is its ability to accumulate&#xD;
      in the reticuloendothelial system (such as the Kupffer cells in the liver) for a sustained&#xD;
      period of time (up to 60 mins), which is not seen with other second generation contrast&#xD;
      agents . Malignant liver lesions do not contain Kupffer cells so these lesions appear&#xD;
      hypoechoic in the Kupffer phase (10-60 minutes) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEUS has been previously used for targeting of lesions for radiofrequency ablation, however&#xD;
      the contrast agent used in the study was Definity . CEUS with Sonazoid has been frequently&#xD;
      used in Japan, South Korea and Norway for diagnosis and surveillance. Diagnosis with Sonazoid&#xD;
      involves the vascular phase (10 sec to 5 minutes) and the Kupffer phase (10-60 minutes). The&#xD;
      vascular phase shows the tumor vascularity and the Kupffer phase shows the absence of&#xD;
      reticuloendothelial cells in the lesion (2-4). In case of a new lesion detected in the&#xD;
      Kupffer phase or a doubt regarding a previously detected lesion, defect reperfusion imaging&#xD;
      can be done for confirmation and diagnosis . In a comparison between SonoVue and Sonazoid in&#xD;
      diagnosis of liver lesions, Sonazoid was not inferior to SonoVue in diagnosis and&#xD;
      significantly better in detecting lesions during whole liver scanning .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study was done using Sonazoid enhanced ultrasound for targeting lesions not detected by&#xD;
      conventional USG for ablation therapy, and it was found that CEUS detected 97% of the viable&#xD;
      tumours compared to 83% by conventional USG. Furthermore, 93% of the lesions which were not&#xD;
      detected on conventional USG were treated successfully using late phase of the contrast agent&#xD;
      as a guiding tool . However, CEUS using Sonazoid was not used to assess treatment response in&#xD;
      this study. A meta-analysis assessing the treatment response after radiofrequency ablation of&#xD;
      HCC using CEUS concluded that technical success was higher with Sonazoid compared to other&#xD;
      agents .&#xD;
&#xD;
      National status: A study evaluated the role of CEUS in guiding RFA of HCC, however the&#xD;
      contrast used was SonoVue and no comparison was made of the post op CEUS with routine 1 month&#xD;
      imaging .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate role of perfluorobutane in guiding ablation&#xD;
      (RFA/MWA) of HCC and to compare treatment response two hours post procedure using the same&#xD;
      ultrasound contrast agent with routine follow up CT/MRI at 1 month post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why this study- Sonazoid is available in only limited countries as of now (Japan, South&#xD;
           Korea, Norway)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So only limited efficacy studies have been done and none in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Also, no study as yet has simultaneously evaluated role of Sonazoid in both lesion&#xD;
           targeting as well as response assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis- Immediate post-procedure CEUS with Sonazoid is not inferior to routine&#xD;
           contrast CT/MRI at 1 month follow-up for response assessment.&#xD;
