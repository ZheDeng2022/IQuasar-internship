      This is a prospective observational pilot study for the evaluation of pegvisomant (PEG)&#xD;
      treatment on immune function and its implication on insulin resistance, metabolic&#xD;
      complications and fat accumulation in patients with acromegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational study will concern the collection of data from patients who, as they are&#xD;
      not controlled by SSAs therapy (cohort 1), require PEG therapy in monotherapy (group 1) or in&#xD;
      combination with SSAs (group 2), according to common clinical practice. The investigators&#xD;
      will enroll also acromegaly patients adequately controlled by medical therapy (cohort 2),&#xD;
      respectively treated by any kind of SSAs (group 3) and by PEG (group 4) for comparison&#xD;
      between different medical treatments. The data will be prospectively collected at baseline&#xD;
      and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the immune profiling by quantification of peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of glucose, insulin, c-peptide, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol,&#xD;
           HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol apolipoprotein B and A. Insulin resistance and β cell&#xD;
           function will be assessed by the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance&#xD;
           (HOMA-IR) index and for β cell secretion (HOMA-β). Anthropometric measurements will&#xD;
           include body weight, height and waist and hip circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of peripheral tissue (end-organ) metabolic complications. Composite outcome&#xD;
           measure consisting of skeletal muscle and fat distribution analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting samples from all patients will be assayed for disease control parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of quality of life. Quality of life will be measured by Short Form&#xD;
           (SF)-36-Item Health Survey total score, SF-36-Item Health Survey physical component&#xD;
           summary score and SF-36-Item Health Survey mental component summary score and Acromegaly&#xD;
           quality of life (AcroQol) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances will be measured by Epworth&#xD;
           Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and by polysomnography when appropriate.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline and post 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be evaluated by the Physical Component score and the Mental Component score of the self administered questionnaire SF-36-Item Health Survey questionnaire.&#xD;
This questionnaire measures eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health (physical component) and vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health (mental component).&#xD;
Interpretation of the score will be the following: at each item of the questionnaire corresponds a percentage value (from 0% to 100%). The average of the single items constitutes the scale total percentage (from 0% to 100%); missing data are not considered during calculation. High score defines a more favorable health state</description>

    <measure>Acromegaly Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of quality of life by the Acromegaly Quality of Life Questionnaire (ACROQOL), a disease specific questionnaire to measure quality of life in patients with acromegaly. It contains 22 items divided in two scales that measure physical and psychological aspects. Each of the 22 items of the AcroQoL is answered in a 1 to 5. A global score is obtained adding the results of the 22 items using a specific formula, from a minimum of 22 - worse QoL - until 110 - best QoL -</description>

    <measure>Sleep apnea</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep disturbances will be measured by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The ESS consists of eight questions regarding eight activities. Each of the activities listed has an assigned score from 0 to 3 that indicates how likely a person is to fall asleep during the activity:&#xD;
0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, 3 = high chance of dozing.&#xD;
The total score can range from 0 to 24. A higher score is associated with increased sleepiness.</description>
