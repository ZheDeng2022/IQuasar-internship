      In this study, medical records and follow-up information of young breast cancer patients (age&#xD;
      ≤35 years at first diagnosis) who were first diagnosed and treated in the years (2000, 2003,&#xD;
      2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015) were collected from multiple hospitals in China from 2000 to 2015,&#xD;
      to establish a retrospective cohort of young breast cancer patients. Clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, diagnosis and treatment, and survival rates of young breast cancer patients&#xD;
      from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed. To explore the main factors affecting the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment and the survival of patients.&#xD;
