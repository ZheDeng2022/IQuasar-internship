  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no visual rehabilitation strategies for children presenting visual field&#xD;
      defects consecutive to a brain tumor or its treatment. This study seeks to investigate the&#xD;
      use of a home-based stimulation visual rehabilitation program using immerse-virtual reality&#xD;
      (IVR) in children aged 4-10 years old with a diagnosis of hemianopia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A brain tumor and its treatment can affect the visual system at different levels, from the&#xD;
      optic nerves (through compression or infiltration). Children with brain tumors can present&#xD;
      visual impairments like decreased visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, loss of color&#xD;
      vision, and visual field loss such as hemianopias. Patients with hemianopia present&#xD;
      difficulties in detecting stimuli in the defective visual field and show defective scanning&#xD;
      and exploration. Moreover, they show a rotation and compression of the auditory space leading&#xD;
      to imprecise localization of sound across both hemispaces. Patients with hemianopia naturally&#xD;
      develop oculomotor strategies to compensate for visual field loss, but visual rehabilitation&#xD;
      procedures must still be developed to optimize/improve visual perception in the blind field.&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrated that these patients could improve visual perception in the&#xD;
      damaged hemifield after a stimulation procedure where auditory and visual stimuli were&#xD;
      temporally and spatially correlated. Such audiovisual stimulation programs induce a&#xD;
      functional and anatomical reorganization of the visual connectivity in subcortical and&#xD;
      cortical structures over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current strategies rely on a significant workload, over 30 hours of audiovisual&#xD;
      stimulation using static, spatially, and temporally coherent stimuli displayed on large&#xD;
      screens/panels in a clinical setting. These strategies require frequent visits to the clinic&#xD;
      impeding the patients' adherence and compliance and increasing the burden of disease. We seek&#xD;
      to develop an audiovisual stimulation procedure using immersive virtual reality (IVR) using a&#xD;
      head-mounted display (HMD). This is an emerging and very promising visual rehabilitation&#xD;
      approach using high-technology devices. It is developed to provide sensory stimulation with&#xD;
      better ecological validity due to virtual reality, greater flexibility due to home-based&#xD;
      programs, and improved efficiency due to patient-tailored protocols. IVR is a versatile&#xD;
      technology, allowing its potential use for the rehabilitation of a variety of low-vision&#xD;
      conditions. There are currently limited practical results on whether this technology is&#xD;
      suitable for low-vision patients to use at home and if it can be deployed on a large scale. A&#xD;
      few case reports/series studies suggested the potential effectiveness of IVR on visual&#xD;
      perception in teenagers, adults, and the elderly but more information as to the potential of&#xD;
      use and effectiveness of this technology in children and young teenagers is necessary&#xD;
