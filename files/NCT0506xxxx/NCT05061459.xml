      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common metabolic disorders that's become a&#xD;
      global health burden affecting 463 million people worldwide according to the International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation (IDF). Diabetic nephropathy(DN) is one of the most common secondary&#xD;
      complications of DM and is becoming a major cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetic&#xD;
      patients . DN is a microvascular complication occurring in approximately 20-40% of patients&#xD;
      with T2DM . DN has been described as a glomerular disorder with the following phases:&#xD;
      glomerular hyperfiltration, incipient nephropathy, microalbuminuria, overt proteinuria and&#xD;
      end-stage renal disorder. Microalbuminuria is the gold standard for the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      DN. However, many studies have suggested that it is inadequate and has some drawbacks. Recent&#xD;
      novel biomarkers have been accepted for early diagnosis and progression of DN in patients&#xD;
      with T2DM . Renal cells are capable of synthesizing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor&#xD;
      necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), these&#xD;
      cytokines acting in a paracrine or autocrine manner that leading to the development and&#xD;
      progression of several renal disorders .Circular RNAs are class of endogenous non coding RNAs&#xD;
      and are associated with numerous diseases like T2DM. Circular ankyrin repeat domain 36&#xD;
      (circANKRD36) involved in T2DM and inflammation-associated pathways via interaction with&#xD;
      miRNAs, including hsa-miR-3614-3p, hsa-miR-498, and hsa-miR-501-5p. The expression of&#xD;
      circANKRD36 was upregulated in peripheral blood leucocytes and was correlated with chronic&#xD;
      inflammation in T2DM. Therefore, circANKRD36 can be used as a potential biomarker for&#xD;
      screening chronic inflammation in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
