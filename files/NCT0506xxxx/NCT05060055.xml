  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a single-tooth extraction, physiological remodeling processes are unavoidable which&#xD;
      leads to a total loss of the periodontal ligament and resorption of the bundle bone.&#xD;
      Immediate implant placement associated with bone substitutes and customized healing abutments&#xD;
      seems to reduce the amount of resorption at peri-implant areas. Recently, studies evaluating&#xD;
      the use of a connective tissue grafts are being conducted in order to assess possible final&#xD;
      outcome advantages in immediate implant procedures. This study aims to evaluate peri-implant&#xD;
      tissue dimensional changes after the use of a customized healing abutment with or without&#xD;
      connective tissue graft in flapless maxillary immediate implant placement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was designed as a prospective, controlled clinical trial with a&#xD;
      parallel-group design and balanced randomization (ratio 1:1) to document the peri-implant&#xD;
      tissues response in using a customized healing abutment with a connective tissue graft (Test&#xD;
      group) or without a connective tissue graft (Control group) xenogeneic collagen matrix (Group&#xD;
      CM) or a customized healing abutment (Group CA) in flapless maxillary immediate implants. The&#xD;
      protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institute of Bioethics of the Catholic University&#xD;
      of Portugal (Project nº 139) and the patients included will be previously informed to&#xD;
      participate in this investigation signing an informed consent considering the 1975&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, revised in 2013. Group designation will be kept in opaque-sealed&#xD;
      envelopes that will be opened after implant insertion by an investigator (D.F), not involved&#xD;
      in surgical procedures, randomly allocating participants to one of the two treatment groups.&#xD;
      Patients' inclusion criteria are: 1) ≥18 years of age; 2) patients who had a failing tooth&#xD;
      and needed an implant placing therapy in the aesthetic zone (between 15-25); 3) the failing&#xD;
      tooth has adjacent and opposing natural teeth; 4) sufficient mesial-distal and inter-occlusal&#xD;
      space for placement of the implant and definitive restoration; 5) had an intact socket wall&#xD;
      previously to the extraction; 6) had sufficient apical bone to place an immediate implant&#xD;
      with minimum primary stability of 30 N/cm. Exclusion criteria are: individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      periodontal disease; medical and general contraindications for the surgical procedure; heavy&#xD;
      smokers (&gt; 10 cigarettes/day); an active infection at the implant site. A CONSORT 2010&#xD;
      check-list will be also performed in order to consider an appropriate guideline for the&#xD;
      present randomized trial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical procedures will be conducted under appropriate local anesthesia 4% articaine&#xD;
      with adrenaline 1:100000 (UbistesinTM, 3M-ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). In both groups, flapless&#xD;
      tooth extractions will be performed after sectioning the tooth, followed by the use of&#xD;
      periotomes and elevators to separate the two parts of the tooth, avoiding damage to the&#xD;
      buccal and palatal bone plates. All patients will be treated with cylindrical shape implants&#xD;
      (OsseoSpeed EV™, AstraTech Implant System, Dentsply Implants, Möhndal, Sweden) with a narrow&#xD;
      diameter internal connection platform following the surgical sequence protocol provided by&#xD;
      the manufacturer. Both groups will receive a customized healing abutment made of polymethyl&#xD;
      methacrylate (PMMA) material, designed and fabricated accordingly with the gingival contour&#xD;
      of the original tooth. Patients included in the Test group will receive connective tissue&#xD;
      grafts harvested using the single incision technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protocol was elaborated to study the variables of interest. One examiner, blinded for the&#xD;
      surgical procedure, will be calibrated through an intra-examiner test (Dahlberg d-value),&#xD;
      consisting in a double consecutive data collection of 10 randomly chosen patients included in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be performed in four appointments. A Cone Beam Computer Tomography&#xD;
      (CBCT) evaluation (Ortophos XG 3D®, Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) will be&#xD;
      performed before tooth extraction and implant placement (T0). At this point, two clinical&#xD;
      parameters will be assessed with a periodontal probe (PCB 12; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) to&#xD;
      the nearest millimeter: BID (distance between implant shoulder and the buccal bone plate) and&#xD;
      KM (distance between the gingival groove and the mucogingival junction). Digital impressions&#xD;
      (Cerec Omnicam®, Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) will be taken prior to&#xD;
      extraction (T0), one month (T1), four months (T2) and 12 months (T3) after implant insertion&#xD;
      allowing to superimpose the digital files and to evaluate volumetric changes between&#xD;
      different time points at peri-implant tissue areas like Buccal Volume Variation (BVv) and&#xD;
      Total Volume Variation (TVv). Mucosa variation between T0 and T3 will be digitally computed&#xD;
      assessing the papilla presence at mesial (MPHv) and distal (DPHv) sites and the mucosa height&#xD;
      (MGHv). Mean values will be compared and statistical significance will be at 0,05.&#xD;
