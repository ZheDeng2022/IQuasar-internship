  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile app for monitoring the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients but also on detection delay of side effects and/or complications linked to the&#xD;
      therapeutic management. This allow to adapt their care more quickly, through a prospective&#xD;
      randomized study. The impact of this connected monitoring of patients' anxiety will also be&#xD;
      evaluated in this study as well as the time taken by the medical team to manage alerts&#xD;
      generated by this application.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of the impact of the connected mobile monitoring application on the quality of life, at 6 months, of patients treated for an operated glioma.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the difference in quality of life assessed by the QLQ-BN20 scale at 6 months, compared to inclusion. This scale is made up of 20 items which are grouped into 4 dimensions (future uncertainty, visual disorder, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit) and 7 isolated items.</description>
