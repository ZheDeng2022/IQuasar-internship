  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant melanoma, is a kind of malignant tumor derived from melanocytes. It is common in&#xD;
      skin, mucous membrane, eye choroid and other parts. Melanoma is one of the fastest growing&#xD;
      malignant tumors with an annual incidence rate of 3-5%. In 2012, there were 232000 new cases&#xD;
      of melanoma and 55000 deaths worldwide. Though, the incidence rate of melanoma is relatively&#xD;
      low in China, it has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Melanoma has seriously&#xD;
      endangering the health of Chinese people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stage Ⅳ melanoma have a poor prognosis. According to statistics, the median&#xD;
      survival time of stage M1a melanoma is 15 months, while stage M1b is 8 months. The median&#xD;
      survival time of bone metastasis melanoma is 6 months, while liver and brain metastasis is 4&#xD;
      months. The overall median survival time of metastatic melanoma is only 7.5 months, and the&#xD;
      2-year survival rate is 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with advanced melanoma, dacarbazine is the only chemotherapy drug approved by&#xD;
      NMPA, but its overall effective rate is only 13.4%, and the median survival time is 5.6 ~ 11&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies(new drugs or new combination treatments)with higher remission rate and longer&#xD;
      survival are urgently needed for patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, single-arm,open-label study to evaluate safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      recombinant human GM-CSF herpes simplex virus（intratumoral injection） in combination with&#xD;
      recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (intravenous injection) and radiotherapy&#xD;
      for liver metastasis in stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to enroll 15-30 patients with stage IV liver metastasis melanoma who&#xD;
      lack or become refractory to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study set scientific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients could be included in the&#xD;
      group for treatment only after being strictly reviewed by researcher. The clinical research&#xD;
      associate(CRA) will regularly monitor the research data during the whole study.&#xD;
