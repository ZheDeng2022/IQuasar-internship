    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of&#xD;
      psilocybin therapy in people with Bipolar II Disorder (BD II). Fourteen participants, ages 30&#xD;
      to 65 with clinically diagnosed BD II with active depression, in active outpatient mental&#xD;
      health treatment, and who meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria at screening will&#xD;
      be enrolled. After baseline assessments, participants will engage in preparatory visits with&#xD;
      trained facilitators, followed by an initial drug administration of oral&#xD;
      psilocybin,supervised by the facilitators and a clinician who will conduct safety monitoring&#xD;
      throughout. Participants will complete assessment and integration sessions with the&#xD;
      facilitators subsequently in order to help process the experience. Participants who tolerated&#xD;
      the first dosage may be asked to complete a second psilocybin dosing session, involving the&#xD;
      same preparation, procedures, integration, and supervision as the first. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures will assess safety, tolerability, and feasibility of study procedures. Efficacy will&#xD;
      be measured by change in depression as measured by the MADRS three weeks after the final&#xD;
      psilocybin administration. Exploratory outcome measures will assess changes in sleep, quality&#xD;
      of life, and therapeutic engagement.&#xD;
