  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to compare the needle knife fistulotomy (NKF) technique versus the&#xD;
      partial ampullary endoscopic mucosal resection (PA-EMR) technique in patients with difficult&#xD;
      biliary cannulation and to assess the incidence rate of complications between these&#xD;
      cannulation methods.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cannulation success with standard techniques reported to be around 95% even in expert hands&#xD;
      and despite all efforts, it can be challenging that needs an alternate intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NKF is recommended as the initial technique for pre-cutting because the rate of post-ERCP&#xD;
      pancreatitis (PEP) is significantly low but there is an ongoing debate about limiting its use&#xD;
      in certain types of papillae with a long intra-mural segment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed the shape of the papillae influences the success of bile duct cannulation and the&#xD;
      choice of the pre-cutting technique. Type-2 and Type-3 papillae are more difficult to&#xD;
      cannulate than Type-1. NKF can be performed as the initial technique for pre-cutting in&#xD;
      protruded Type-2 and Type-3 papillae but it has some limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, the incision can be erratic because it is performed without a guidewire and&#xD;
      uncontrolled. This can cause a tattered mucosa as the incision progress and the papillae lose&#xD;
      anatomic contours. Some amount of bleeding may also unavoidably occur and the field of view&#xD;
      further impaired. If the initial incision line is incorrect and additional incision is&#xD;
      needed, more crumpled and deformed papillae with irregular margins may be encountered. These&#xD;
      undesired results are frequently experienced and prevent a clean-cut, thus further complicate&#xD;
      the cannulation. Even perforation can occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the investigators described a novel technique, PA-EMR, for difficult biliary&#xD;
      cannulation in patients with protruded Type-2, Type-3, and shar-pei papilla. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that with this new technique cannulation success will be higher,&#xD;
      procedure time will be shorter and the adverse events will be lower versus NKF technique.&#xD;

    <description>Standard oval-shaped, braided wire polypectomy snare with 10 mm or 20 mm loop diameter will be used. With the duodenoscope in a semi-long position, the tip of the snare will be anchored just below the transverse fold of the ampulla and opened above-downwards fashion until the orifice will be seen. The orifice will be strictly preserved to avoid the risk of PEP and approximately the upper two-thirds of the ampullary mound will be grabbed by the snare. The direction and the depth will be controlled by combined movements of the elevator and wheels of the duodenoscope. After removal of the mucosa, the wall of choledochus will be seen clearly and standard wire-guided cannulation (WGC) will be performed. If cannulation can not be achieved with WGC, an additional incision will be performed to the wall of the choledochus with a needle knife.</description>

    <description>The needle knife will be placed at the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds of the papillary roof (bulging portion). Minimal, superficial incisions will be made in the 11-12 o'clock direction. The length of the fistulotomy will be at the endoscopist's discretion, depending on the shape of the papilla. The cut will be extended until bile juice, the pinkish bile duct mucosa, and/or the bulging of the white sphincter of the Oddi's muscle is visible.</description>
