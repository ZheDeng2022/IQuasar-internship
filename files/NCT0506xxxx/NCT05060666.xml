    <textblock>
      The Prevent-COVID study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, two-armed,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, interventional study in which the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ivermectin in COVID-19 post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is examined in adult, close family&#xD;
      contacts living in the household of a subject suffering from COVID-19.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Study population and study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out in about 30 private practices or clinics in Germany that regularly&#xD;
      carry out SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and treat COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult close contact persons of newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in the same household&#xD;
      are considered for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration and assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 14 days, in which the following study-specific measures will be&#xD;
      undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, height and weight, degree of&#xD;
           relationship to the COVID-19 patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of current comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of current medical accompanying measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of the general condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID-19 symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SARS-CoV-2 PCR test: Only for medical confirmation of the presence of COVID-19 symptoms&#xD;
           during an unplanned COVID-19 visit or final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject diary (daily measurement of body temperature, contact intensity with the index&#xD;
           person)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To demonstrate the efficacy of ivermectin in the COVID-19 post-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis of adult contact persons living in the household of a person suffering from&#xD;
      COVID-19 (index person)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the safety of ivermectin in the COVID-19 post-exposure prophylaxis of&#xD;
           adult contact persons living in the household of a person suffering from COVID-19 (index&#xD;
           person)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the severity of the symptoms of subjects suffering from COVID-19 during the&#xD;
           study period and the comparison between the ivermectin and the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMP: Driponin® is an approved drug with the active ingredient Ivermectin, used to treat&#xD;
      parasitic infections. One tablet Driponin® contains 3 mg Ivermectin. As part of the clinical&#xD;
      trial, the medicinal product will be examined with regard to indication, dosage and&#xD;
      application schedule deviating from the intended purpose and the package insert.&#xD;

    <description>2 doses of Ivermectin will be administered with 48 hours time interval.&#xD;
The dosage is based on body weight calculated as follows:&#xD;
15 mg for 40-60 kg = 5 tablets à 3 mg&#xD;
18 mg for 60-80 kg = 6 tablets à 3 mg&#xD;
24 mg for &gt; 80 kg = 8 tablets à 3 mg each&#xD;
This corresponds to an ivermectin dose of about 300 µg / kg.</description>
