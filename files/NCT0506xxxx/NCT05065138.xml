  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers recruited gastroenterologists. Physician subjects recruited Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori-positive patients before and after receiving standardized training on Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori eradication. There are no restrictions on treatment options and drugs during the&#xD;
      trial. Compare the eradication rate, adverse reaction rate, and patient compliance before and&#xD;
      after physician training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers recruited no less than 20 gastroenterologists to participate in the study,&#xD;
      and gastroenterologists recruited 25 patients who were over 18 years of age and were positive&#xD;
      for Helicobacter pylori for the first time. In this process, the patient population is not&#xD;
      restricted, and the eradication program is not restricted. Gastroenterologists followed up&#xD;
      their diagnosis and treatment. Researchers track and record patients' medications and adverse&#xD;
      reactions during medication via phone or WeChat to assess patient compliance. Record the&#xD;
      eradication rate. We will provide standardized Helicobacter pylori eradication training for&#xD;
      the Department of Gastroenterology after all patients treated by gastroenterologists have&#xD;
      been eradicated and reviewed. After the training, the gastroenterologist recruited 25&#xD;
      patients who were over 18 years old and were newly treated with Helicobacter pylori positive.&#xD;
      In this process, the patient population is not restricted, and the eradication program is not&#xD;
      restricted. Gastroenterologists followed up their diagnosis and treatment. Researchers track&#xD;
      and record patients' medications and adverse reactions during medication via phone or WeChat&#xD;
      to assess patient compliance. Record the eradication rate. Compare the eradication rate,&#xD;
      adverse reaction rate and compliance of patients before and after the training of&#xD;
      gastroenterologists.&#xD;
