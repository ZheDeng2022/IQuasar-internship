  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition characterized by airway&#xD;
      obstruction. Patients with COPD experience significant shortness of breath on exertion. The&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for shortness of breath on exertion are well understood in moderate&#xD;
      and severe COPD, but, are poorly understood in mild COPD where symptoms appear&#xD;
      disproportionate to the degree of airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild COPD patients show an exaggerated breathing response to exercise, determined by the&#xD;
      breathing response to carbon dioxide production (V̇E/V̇CO2). Recent work suggests that the&#xD;
      increased V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise in mild COPD is secondary to increased deadspace (i.e.&#xD;
      lung regions with ventilation but no perfusion) and/or ventilation/perfusion (V̇A/Q)&#xD;
      inequality (poor matching of ventilation to perfusion). Researchers have proposed that the&#xD;
      increased deadspace or V̇A/Q inequality is secondary to pulmonary vascular dysfunction and&#xD;
      hypoperfusion of the pulmonary capillaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we have shown that inhaled nitric oxide, a potent dilator of pulmonary vasculature,&#xD;
      reduces shortness of breath and V̇E/V̇CO2, and improves exercise capacity in mild COPD. This&#xD;
      preliminary finding suggests that pulmonary vascular dysfunction is an important contributor&#xD;
      to exercise intolerance in mild COPD. Here, we aim to test whether sildenafil, an oral&#xD;
      pulmonary vasodilator, can improve exercise tolerance and shortness of breath in mild COPD.&#xD;

      COPD is a condition characterized by airway obstruction and is currently the 4th leading&#xD;
      cause of death in Canada. Patients with COPD experience significant exertional dyspnea, which&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce quality of life and physical activity, and increase risk of&#xD;
      mortality. Much work has examined the mechanisms for dyspnea in moderate and severe COPD, but&#xD;
      the mechanisms for dyspnea in patients with mild COPD, in whom symptoms are often&#xD;
      disproportionate to the degree of airway obstruction, are not well understood. Mild COPD&#xD;
      patients show an exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise, determined by the ventilatory&#xD;
      response to carbon dioxide production (V̇E/V̇CO2), which is a key contributor to dyspnea and&#xD;
      is predictive of mortality. Recent work suggests that the increased V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise&#xD;
      in mild COPD is secondary to increased deadspace (i.e. ventilation with no perfusion) and/or&#xD;
      ventilation/perfusion (V̇ A/Q) inequality (i.e. poor matching of ventilation to perfusion).&#xD;
      Researchers have proposed that the increased deadspace or V̇A/Q inequality is secondary to&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular dysfunction and hypoperfusion of the pulmonary capillaries. Recently we&#xD;
      have shown that iNO reduces dyspnea, and V̇E/V̇CO2, and improves exercise capacity in mild&#xD;
      COPD, suggesting that pulmonary vascular dysfunction is an important contributor to exercise&#xD;
      intolerance in mild COPD. Importantly, this work demonstrated that pulmonary NO mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation pathways are intact, and are a viable target for improving exercise tolerance in&#xD;
      mild COPD. Therefore, we hypothesize that sildenafil, which potentiates intrinsic NO mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation mechanisms, will improve exercise tolerance in mild COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to disease free controls, mild COPD patients have a blunted diffusion capacity and&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary blood volume response to exercise. In the supine position, which&#xD;
      minimizes flow heterogeneity through removal of the coronal gravity-induced pressure&#xD;
      gradient, diffusion capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume responses to exercise were&#xD;
      not corrected. The implication of this finding is that even mild COPD, there is a degree of&#xD;
      permanent vascular destruction, in addition to reversible pulmonary vascular dysfunction. It&#xD;
      is presently unknown when or if in the COPD severity continuum there is a transition from&#xD;
      treatable pulmonary vascular dysfunction to irreversible pulmonary vascular destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sildenafil was previously tested in moderate to severe COPD with mixed success. Blanco et al.&#xD;
      tested the effect of sildenafil (20 or 40 mg dose) on hemodynamics and gas exchange in a&#xD;
      sample of patients with moderate to severe COPD. Eighty-five percent of the sample had&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;20 mmHg. Sildenafil&#xD;
      significantly reduced pulmonary artery pressure at rest and during exercise (-6 and -11 mmHg&#xD;
      respectively), and improved VA/Q inequality. Rietema et al. found no benefit of sildenafil&#xD;
      (3x50mg daily for 3 months) on stroke volume (supine, rest/exercise) or exercise capacity in&#xD;
      moderate to severe COPD. In a randomized, placebo controlled trial, sildenafil (3x20 mg&#xD;
      daily, 3 months) did not improve pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes including cycle endurance&#xD;
      time, 6 minute walk distance, or quality of life. It is not known why the promising reduction&#xD;
      in pulmonary artery pressure and improved V̇A/Q matching did not translate to increased&#xD;
      stroke volume or exercise capacity with chronic sildenafil dosing. Results may partially be&#xD;
      explained by supine body positioning during measurement of stroke volume, and the generally&#xD;
      late disease state of COPD patients. Pulmonary vascular dysfunction observed early in disease&#xD;
      progression may transition to irrevocable vascular/pulmonary structural changes, for which&#xD;
      iNO or sildenafil have limited utility. Accordingly, a secondary objective of the present&#xD;
      study is to gain understanding of pathological vascular progression in COPD to identify the&#xD;
      therapeutic window for pulmonary vascular intervention. We hypothesize that sildenafil will&#xD;
      have greater cardiopulmonary benefit (increased diffusion capacity at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise, greater decrease in pulmonary artery pressure) in early, mild COPD as compared to&#xD;
      moderate-severe COPD, indicative of vascular dysfunction in mild COPD transitioning to&#xD;
      vascular destruction in later disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled cross-over design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Sildenafil (oral), 25 mg; Placebo: Medical grade placebo pill&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven sessions will be completed within an 8-week period in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1) Participant enrollment and familiarization, medical history, COPD assessment test&#xD;
      (CAT), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, standard pulmonary function&#xD;
      test (PFT, including bronchodilator control) and a staged to maximal cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
      test (CPET) with electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, and intermittent blood pressure&#xD;
      and rating of perceived exertion (RPE, leg fatigue and dyspnea, modified Borg scale). A small&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected via finger prick to measure hemoglobin (to correct DLCO). An&#xD;
      additional venous blood sample will be collected for analysis of blood biomarkers to&#xD;
      characterize participants including serum analysis of interleukin 6, c-reactive protein and&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3) Participants will be administered oral placebo/sildenafil (randomly ordered),&#xD;
      wait for 30 minutes and then begin testing. Participants will undergo a staged to maximal&#xD;
      CPET (gas exchange analysis, heart rate, cardiac output measured by impedance cardiography,&#xD;
      blood pressure, RPE, arterial oxygen saturation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 4 and 5) Participants will be administered oral placebo/sildenafil (randomly ordered),&#xD;
      wait for 30 minutes and then begin testing. Testing will start with measurement of resting&#xD;
      diffusion capacity, pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and membrane diffusion capacity&#xD;
      (Dm) using the multiple fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2)-DLCO technique. Participants will&#xD;
      then cycle at 40 W and 50% of peak work rate as determined from Visit 1, measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated during steady-state exercise. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and carboxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout. A small blood sample will be collected via finger prick&#xD;
      following each stage (rest, 40W, 50% of peak work rate) to measure hemoglobin to correct DLCO&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6) Participants will undergo non-randomized control and then sildenafil rest and&#xD;
      handgrip stress echocardiography. Echocardiography will be used to estimate cardiac volumes,&#xD;
      function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure at rest and during handgrip stress. Isometric&#xD;
      handgrip stress echocardiography was previously used in healthy and clinical populations to&#xD;
      evoke marked cardiac stress without hyperpnoea- a major factor compromising image quality,&#xD;
      particularly in COPD due to dynamic hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7) Participants will undergo chest computed tomography to characterize lung structure&#xD;
      and emphysema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 is anticipated to take ~2 hours. Visits 2 and 3 are anticipated to take ~1.5 hours.&#xD;
      Visits 4 and 5 are anticipated to take 2 hours. Visit 6 is anticipated to take 2 hours. Visit&#xD;
      7 is anticipated to take 1 hour. The anticipated total study duration is ~12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed-effects model will be used to evaluate the change in V̇O2peak with sildenafil. A&#xD;
      two-way repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test for a difference in VO2peak response in&#xD;
      mild COPD compared to COPD free controls. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in dyspnea, cardiac output, ventilation, ventilatory efficiency (V̇E/V̇CO2),&#xD;
      diffusion capacity and capillary blood volume during exercise. Variance in V̇O2peak changes&#xD;
      will be explored using Pearson's regression and moderation analysis of echo-derived cardiac&#xD;
      factors and pulmonary function/gas exchange. A three-way repeated measures ANOVA will be used&#xD;
      to test for differences in pulmonary capillary blood volume response to sildenafil between&#xD;
      mild and moderate COPD.&#xD;
