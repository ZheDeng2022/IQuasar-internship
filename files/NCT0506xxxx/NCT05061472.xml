  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15 million women of reproductive age women in the United States have overweight&#xD;
      or obesity and use the combined estrogen and progestin oral contraceptive pill (COC).&#xD;
      Although many women report weight gain as a side effect of COCs, a conclusive link between&#xD;
      COC use and weight gain has not been established. This investigation will address a major gap&#xD;
      in the literature by prospectively evaluating the influence of initiating a COC versus a&#xD;
      localized, progestin-only intrauterine device on weight, body composition, eating behaviors,&#xD;
      and appetite in pre-menopausal women with overweight or obesity. Aim 1 will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining a racially/ethnically diverse group of women with&#xD;
      overweight and obesity while Aim 2 will explore changes in body weight, body composition, and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risks in these women; Aim 3 will explore changes in dietary and macronutrient&#xD;
      energy intake, eating behaviors, and appetite in this subset of women. This research will&#xD;
      help the investigators understand the extent to which COCs are associated with weight gain&#xD;
      and help guide medical providers in counseling women with overweight and obesity on&#xD;
      appropriate contraceptive methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this feasibility pilot study is to prospectively evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of initiating a combined estrogen and progestin oral contraceptive (COC) compared to&#xD;
      a localized progestin-containing intrauterine device (levonorgestrel, LNG-IUD) on body&#xD;
      weight, body composition, eating behaviors, and appetite in pre-menopausal women with&#xD;
      overweight or obesity. Nearly half of the 61 million U.S. women of reproductive age have&#xD;
      overweight or obesity, placing them and their offspring at an elevated lifetime risk of&#xD;
      adverse cardiometabolic and health outcomes. Notably, ~15-20% of reproductive-aged women use&#xD;
      COCs or IUDs. Though many women anecdotally report weight gain as a side effect of COCs, a&#xD;
      conclusive link between COC use and weight gain has not been established. Previous studies&#xD;
      evaluating COCs and weight change have excluded women with obesity, who may be at greater&#xD;
      risk for contraceptive-associated weight gain. In comparison, well-designed studies have&#xD;
      shown LNG-IUDs are not associated with weight gain over 1 year. Given the widespread use of&#xD;
      COCs, it is critical to understand the extent to which these contraceptive methods may be&#xD;
      associated with weight gain and correlated cardiometabolic health risks in reproductive age&#xD;
      women with established overweight or obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reproductive hormonal profile of COC users differs substantially from that of normally&#xD;
      cycling women. A recent study of seven typical COCs found that while median exposure to&#xD;
      synthetic estrogens across a 28-day cycle was similar to median endogenous estrogen exposure,&#xD;
      median synthetic progestin exposure was 4-fold higher than median endogenous progesterone&#xD;
      exposure. COCs also lead to daily spikes in serum estrogen and progestin levels, unlike the&#xD;
      gradual increase and cyclic patterns of endogenous hormones that characterize a normal&#xD;
      menstrual cycle. In contrast, systemic progestin levels are significantly lower in women&#xD;
      using LNG-IUDs than in women using COCs. COCs may impact weight via changes in appetite and&#xD;
      satiety due to supraphysiologic systemic levels of reproductive hormones. For example,&#xD;
      progesterone has been shown to increase appetite and trigger binge- or emotional-eating. The&#xD;
      principal investigator has reported that use of COCs was associated with greater weight&#xD;
      regain over 1 year after weight loss in women with overweight and obesity enrolled in a&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss program. However, no studies have prospectively evaluated changes in&#xD;
      body weight, cardiometabolic risk factors, and eating behaviors in women with overweight or&#xD;
      obesity initiating COC vs. LNG-IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's overall hypothesis is that initiation of COCs in women with overweight or&#xD;
      obesity will be associated with greater weight gain and increases in cardiometabolic health&#xD;
      risks than initiation of LNG-IUD over 6 months. The investigators will recruit pre-menopausal&#xD;
      women with overweight or obesity who have already elected to initiate birth control (either&#xD;
      COCs or LNG-IUDs) through the Comprehensive Women's Health Center (CWHC). The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the feasibility of recruiting women initiating a COC or an LNG-IUD from CHWC&#xD;
      into a prospective, observational study as well as the feasibility of evaluating changes in&#xD;
      weight, body composition, eating behaviors, and appetite over 6 months from contraceptive&#xD;
      initiation. The investigators propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a racially/ethnically diverse group&#xD;
      of pre-menopausal women with overweight or obesity initiating COCs vs. LNG-IUDs. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to recruit ~10 women per month for 6 months (N=64; n=32 COCs, n=32&#xD;
      LNG-IUDs; &gt;20% in each group of African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity) and assess&#xD;
      feasibility of completion of outcome measures. The investigators hypothesize that at least&#xD;
      80% of participants will continue their chosen contraceptive method and complete outcome&#xD;
      measures within a 2-week window at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 2: Explore the influence of COC vs. LNG-IUD use on body weight, body&#xD;
      composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors. The investigators hypothesize that women with&#xD;
      overweight or obesity initiating COCs will exhibit greater increases in body weight, fat&#xD;
      mass, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, and blood&#xD;
      pressure compared to women initiating LNG-IUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 3: Explore the influence of COC vs. LNG-IUD use on energy intake (EI), eating&#xD;
      behaviors, and appetite. The investigators hypothesize that women with overweight or obesity&#xD;
      initiating COCs will have greater increases in dietary energy and fat/carbohydrate intake,&#xD;
      hunger, disinhibition, reward-based eating, emotional eating, binge eating, and food cravings&#xD;
      at 6 months compared to LNG-IUD users.&#xD;
