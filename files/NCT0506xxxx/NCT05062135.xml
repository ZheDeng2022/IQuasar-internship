      Objective: To study the influence of metabolic factors on the action of progesterone on the&#xD;
      endometrium of women with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective open-label clinical trial. Setting: Participants were recruited from an&#xD;
      outpatient reproductive endocrinology clinic at an academic tertiary medical care center from&#xD;
      2014 to 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: To assess the sole effect of progesterone (P4) on the endometrium we studied&#xD;
      amenorrheic (cycles&gt; 90 days) women with PCOS (n=23), comparing them to healthy eumenorrheic&#xD;
      control women ( n=13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention(s): All subjects underwent an endometrial biopsy (EB) in the follicular phase of&#xD;
      the first study cycle. They were then treated with micronized P4 (400 mg/day x 10 days&#xD;
      intravaginally) from days 14-28 of the cycle, and a second EB was performed between days&#xD;
      20-24 of the cycle (second phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measure(s): EB samples were analyzed under light microscopy for&#xD;
      histomorphometric analysis.&#xD;

      PATIENTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Inclusion criteria for PCOS women will be: a) ages 18 to 35 years, and b) PCOS was&#xD;
      defined by the Rotterdam criteria, which includes two of the following three features: a)&#xD;
      oligo-amenorrhea; b) clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism; and c) polycystic&#xD;
      ovaries (6). These criteria yield four PCOS phenotypes (A thru D) (1-3). Controls were&#xD;
      recruited from the family planning outpatient office. All participants will be healthy women&#xD;
      ages 18 to 35 years with regular menstrual cycles, no evidence of hirsutism, no&#xD;
      comorbidities, and not using hormone medications in the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are as follows: a) use of any hormone treatment in the previous 3 months;&#xD;
      b) other causes of anovulation as evidenced by abnormal levels of prolactin, cortisol,&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione,&#xD;
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and free T4, in blood samples obtained between days 2 and&#xD;
      5 of the cycle in cycling subjects or on any other day in amenorrheic subjects; c)&#xD;
      gynecologic disorders or other associated diseases, such as endometriosis, hypertension, or&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus; d) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;15 UI/L (cycle days 2-5); or e) a&#xD;
      positive β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial was previously approved by the Research Ethics Committee (#21253613.6.0000.0068)&#xD;
      of the Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP), São&#xD;
      Paulo, Brazil. The patients will be evaluated at Gynecology Outpatient office. The patients&#xD;
      will be divided into two groups: a) PCOS and b) controls. All subjects will be cared for at&#xD;
      the Endocrinology Gynecology Section and the Human Reproductive Center of the Gynecology&#xD;
      Division, Hospital das Clínicas, FMUSP. After signing the informed consent will be written in&#xD;
      accordance with Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Board (Resolução 196/96 do Conselho&#xD;
      Nacional de Saúde), all subjects will be included in the study and evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preselection: This visit includes the following: interview for medical history; overall&#xD;
      physical and gynecologic examinations; weight measurement (scale Filizola, model PL-150, with&#xD;
      a capacity for 150 kg); height measurement with a metal stadiometer attached to the scale;&#xD;
      abdominal circumference (AC) measurement with a measuring tape at the narrowest region&#xD;
      between the last costal arch and the iliac crest; hip circumference (HC) measured around the&#xD;
      circumference of hips at the top of the iliac crest and buttocks, body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) measurement; hirsutism according to the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG)&#xD;
      scoring system with nine areas, with patients with a score higher than 8 score deemed&#xD;
      hirsute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The menstrual cycle are considered as normal when the interval between periods was 21 to 35&#xD;
      days, and the blood flow lasted no more than 7 days. The cycle was characterized as&#xD;
      anovulatory when the span between blood flows was &gt;35 days (1). Amenorrhea is defined as the&#xD;
      absence of a menstrual flow for a period corresponding to the three previous cycles or for&#xD;
      &gt;90 days (1,20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bloods will be collected and a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound will be performed on all study&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A: Six PCOS patients with amenorrhea (cycles &gt;90 days) and negative β-HCG will be&#xD;
      prescribed daily micronized P4 (400 mg) administrated via the vaginal route for 10 days. Two&#xD;
      endometrial biopsies will be performed, one between the 5th and 9th day and the other between&#xD;
      the 21st and 24th day (under the second treatment cycle with P4) of the menstrual cycle (day&#xD;
      1 being the first day of vaginal bleeding). A third biopsy will be repeated on the 4th cycle&#xD;
      of P4 treatment, between cycle days 21 and 24 (Fig. 2). This part of the study will be&#xD;
      designed to assess whether P4 could transform proliferative into secretory endometrium,&#xD;
      regardless of the number of treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCOS: Seventeen PCOS subjects underwent two endometrial biopsies after the first P4-treated&#xD;
      cycle, the first between days 5-9 of the cycle and the other between days 20-22 (i.e., under&#xD;
      P4 treatment) of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls: Thirteen ovulatory control women under two endometrial biopsies, will be performed&#xD;
      after the first month of luteal P4 treatment, the first between days 5-9 and the second&#xD;
      between days 20-22 of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) consisted of 75 grams of glucose administered&#xD;
      orally after three days of a carbohydrate-rich diet; blood samples for glucose and insulin&#xD;
      measurements were drawn before administration of the glucose solution and 30, 60, 90, and 120&#xD;
      minutes after it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma glucose concentration was determined by the glucose oxidase method. All lipid&#xD;
      measurements were taken directly in the plasma samples. Total cholesterol and triglycerides&#xD;
      were assessed using enzyme methods (Roche Laboratories). The HDL-C was quantified by the same&#xD;
      method and LDL-C was estimated with the Friedwald formula. The glycated hemoglobin were&#xD;
      measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (with the use of the Tosoh A1c 2.2 Plus&#xD;
      Glycohemoglobin Analyzer method in 2003-2004 and the Tosoh G7 method in 2007-2008, Tosoh&#xD;
      Corp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hormone analyses, the blood samples were processed in a centrifuge. Progesterone was&#xD;
      measured by the immunofluorometric assay (Wallac, Finland) using Auto DELFIA kits;&#xD;
      androstenedione, PRL, LH, and FSH, by the immunofluorometric assay; dehydroepiandrosterone&#xD;
      sulfate (DHEAS), by radioimmunoassay (Cisbio International, France and DSL, Texas, USA); and&#xD;
      insulin and 17-OHP, by radioimmunoassay using DSL kits. The testosterone and SHBG levels were&#xD;
      measured using the electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (Modular, Roche). The free&#xD;
      testosterone index was calculated based on the followed formula: total testosterone/SHBG*100.&#xD;
      Free testosterone was calculated by Vermeulen's formula. All analyses were performed twice&#xD;
      and the intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation did not exceed 10% and 15%,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial biopsies Endometrial samples will be obtained using the Pipelle de Cornier&#xD;
      catheter (Laboratoire CCD, Paris, France). Part of the material was embedded in paraffin for&#xD;
      histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses, and the remainder was preserved in RNA&#xD;
      for later molecular analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histochemistry Endometrial samples will be fixed for 24 hrs. in 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated&#xD;
      in increasing concentrations of ethyl alcohol, cleared in xylene, and then embedded in&#xD;
      paraffin. The paraffin-embedded samples will be then cut into ten 3-μm sections per subject.&#xD;
      Eight of these sections were stained for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C (VEGF-C) and&#xD;
      for immunohistochemistry (see below), and the two remaining sections will be stained with&#xD;
      hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to confirm the menstrual cycle phase using the criteria suggested&#xD;
      by Noyes et al. (1953) and morphometry (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sections willl be dewaxed conventionally; 0.3% H2O2 will be used to inactivate endogenous&#xD;
      peroxidase at room temperature for 10 min, followed by washing with distilled water three&#xD;
      times. The sections were immersed in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and then placed in a&#xD;
      microwave oven for heating up to the boiling point. After 10 min, this process will be&#xD;
      repeated twice; then, the sections were cooled at room temperature and washed twice with&#xD;
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). A 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking solution&#xD;
      was added at room temperature for 20, min and the excess liquid was discarded. Rabbit&#xD;
      anti-human VEGF-C polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) (VEGF-C: diluted&#xD;
      at 1:100) were added to the incubation at 37°C for 24 h, and the sections were then washed&#xD;
      for 5 min. thrice. A biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA)&#xD;
      working solution will be added at 1:1000 dilution for incubation at 37°C for 20 min. After&#xD;
      washing, SABC will be added to the incubation at 37°C for 20 min, followed by washing and&#xD;
      color development via diaminobenzidine (DAB) (DAB color development kit, Dako, Dinamarca) at&#xD;
      room temperature for 5 to 30 min., followed by washing with distilled water, haematoxylin&#xD;
      re-staining dehydration via graded ethanol, transparency via xylene, sealing via neutral gum,&#xD;
      and inspection under light microscope. The primary antibody was replaced with PBS as a&#xD;
      negative control. The positive sections that stained satisfactorily in the pre-experiment&#xD;
      were used as positive controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphological and histomorphometric analyses To quantify the parameters of interest, images&#xD;
      were captured using a high-resolution camera (AxioCam-MCR, Carl Zeiss) adapted to a light&#xD;
      microscope (Axiolab, Carl Zeiss) and adjusted with 40× objective lenses. The images were&#xD;
      transmitted to a computer with AxioVision Rel 4.2 software (Carl Zeiss). For assessment of&#xD;
      glandular and surface epithelial thickness, cell count, and counting newly formed blood&#xD;
      vessels, ten images of each endometrial sample were made for each patient. For VEGF-C&#xD;
      determination, the numerical density of blood vessels per mm2 will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The minimum sample size needed for each group will be determined from a&#xD;
      pilot study with 10 women per group after pilot study. Thus, in calculating the sample size,&#xD;
      the correlation between the group measurements will be considered. For the results of the&#xD;
      number of endometrial glands, a type I error of 5% and a type II error of 20% (sample with&#xD;
      0.8% power) were adopted for the detection of &gt;20% difference between groups. Commensurate&#xD;
      with homogeneity, the quantitative data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation. In&#xD;
      conformity with data distribution, the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U test will be&#xD;
      used. The significance level was set at 95% (α ≤ 5%). Moreover, ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis&#xD;
      test will be used for histologic and immunohistochemical comparisons, when the additional&#xD;
      group (PCOS during the proliferative phase) was included. Then, in line with data&#xD;
      distribution, either the Tukey test or the Dunn test will be applied. When possible, the&#xD;
      subjects of Study A and B were combined for analysis.&#xD;
