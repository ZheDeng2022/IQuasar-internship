  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized clinical comparative effectiveness trial (RCT) in which&#xD;
      patients with untreated OUD presenting to a Northwell Health Emergency Department (ED),&#xD;
      NYULH-Brooklyn, NYULH-Tisch, and Bellevue Hospital will be randomized (1:1) to be managed&#xD;
      clinically through either a standard ED visit or an extended visit through ED observation&#xD;
      (EDOU).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this hybrid implementation-effectiveness study, there is no direct research intervention.&#xD;
      Rather, clinical care with well-documented effectiveness will be delivered at the discretion&#xD;
      of clinical staff guided by clinical protocols for the management of OUD with MOUD&#xD;
      (Medications for Opioid Use Disorder) introduced at each site prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomized to ED vs. EDOU and to participate in assessments&#xD;
      conducted at the index visit and at 30 days and 90 days. Patient level data will also be&#xD;
      matched with Medicaid claims data for more robust analyses and to support the development of&#xD;
      clinical quality measures.&#xD;
