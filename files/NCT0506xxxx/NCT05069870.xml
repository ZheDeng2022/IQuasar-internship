      This is a three-part, single-center, open-label phase I clinical study to characterize the&#xD;
      DDIs potential of SKLB1028 with Itraconazole, Gemfibrozil or Rifampicin in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      This study also aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SKLB1028 in the presence of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SKLB1028 is the potential substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and P-gp. This study conducted in three&#xD;
      parts to characterize the DDIs potential of SKLB1028 with the perpetrator drugs (&#xD;
      Itraconazole, Gemfibrozil, Rifampicin) in Healthy Subjects. Each part of this study consists&#xD;
      of a screening period (Day -14 to Day -2), a baseline period (Day -1), a treatment period,&#xD;
      and a follow-up visit period.&#xD;
