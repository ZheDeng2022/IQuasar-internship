    <textblock>
      The investigators used a retrospective review of 251 SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2) positive patients' cesarean section anesthesia to determine the rate&#xD;
      of failed spinal anesthesia, management techniques for failed block, and risk factors that&#xD;
      contribute to failure in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All anesthesiologists face a challenge when it comes to the anesthesia of patients with&#xD;
      coronavirus disease who are going to have a cesarian section. Patients' and healthcare&#xD;
      personnel' safety should be prioritized. Non-emergent procedures in patients with respiratory&#xD;
      infections, such as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019), should be postponed and rescheduled&#xD;
      once the infection has been treated. However, some emergency treatments, such as cesarian&#xD;
      section, cannot be postponed. So, for COVID 19 patients, which method should be used?&#xD;
      According to past studies, the risk of maternal death is 16,7 times higher with general&#xD;
      anesthesia than with regional anesthesia (1). Furthermore, general anesthesia, which requires&#xD;
      aerosol-generating procedures such as ventilating and intubating patients, has a higher risk&#xD;
      of respiratory problems during or after surgery than regional anesthesia. Earlier data on&#xD;
      pregnant patients during the COVID 19 pandemic showed no difference in COVID 19-related&#xD;
      mortality between pregnant and non-pregnant patients, but a recent study found that pregnancy&#xD;
      is associated with a 70% greater risk of death. Another important point is that, when&#xD;
      compared to those who are not exposed to tracheal intubation, the transfer of acute&#xD;
      respiratory infection to a health care professional during tracheal intubation is 6.6 times&#xD;
      higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For such reasons, the European and American Societies of Regional Anesthesia jointly issued&#xD;
      COVID 19 recommendations stating that regional anesthesia should be preferred over general&#xD;
      anesthesia whenever possible, and practice recommendations for regional anesthesia during the&#xD;
      pandemic have already been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the Society for Obstetric&#xD;
      Anesthesiology and Perinatology advise doctors to &quot;consider using neuraxial methods rather&#xD;
      than general anesthesia for most cesarian deliveries.&quot; In many facilities, single-shot spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia is the preferred method for cesarian section. It delivers great anesthesia because&#xD;
      of its ease of use, rapid onset of sensory and motor blockage, reliability, ease of&#xD;
      mastering, and capacity to provide optimal surgical circumstances; it also minimizes the&#xD;
      hazards of general anesthetic while enhancing partition satisfaction. In addition, when&#xD;
      compared to general anesthesia, the risk of complications such intraoperative bleeding,&#xD;
      surgical site infection, and postoperative pain is lower with spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1899, August Bier proclaimed spinal anesthesia to be a failure, stating, &quot;Experienced&#xD;
      professional, correct technique, single puncture, adequate CSF backflow, effective anesthetic&#xD;
      agent!&quot; So, why did it fail? -Capriciousness!!&quot; Single shot spinal anesthesia failure may&#xD;
      occur when the subarachnoid space is not reached, or analgesia is not sufficient for surgery&#xD;
      after injection. The issue is that if anesthesia fails during COVID 19 procedures, we'll need&#xD;
      to develop a new approach for supplementing anesthesia and analgesia cautiously, quickly, and&#xD;
      meticulously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failed spinal anesthesia can be partial or complete. If anesthesia and analgesia are not&#xD;
      achieved within ten minutes after successful intrathecal injection, the bupivacaine spinal&#xD;
      anesthetic is regarded to have failed. Partial failure was defined as insufficient extent,&#xD;
      quality, or duration of pharmacological action for that procedure, while complete failure was&#xD;
      described as no sensory or motor blockage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of spinal anesthesia necessitates extreme caution, judgment, and technique. If&#xD;
      surgery has not yet begun, a partial or total failure can be managed by increasing the&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position or administering a second spinal anesthetic. However, if the surgery&#xD;
      has already begun, it can be managed by changing positions, injecting local anaesthetic in&#xD;
      the operation area by the surgeon, administering sedation with oxygen, opioids,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, or ketamine, and then converting the anesthesia to general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The failure rate of spinal anesthesia is widely distributed, according to researches, ranging&#xD;
      from 1 to 17 percent. During spinal anesthesia, the Royal College of Anesthetics proposes a&#xD;
      failure rate of 3% in emergencies and 1% for elective procedures. The goal of this study was&#xD;
      to determine failure rate and solutions for spinal anesthesia in the context of a COVID 19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
