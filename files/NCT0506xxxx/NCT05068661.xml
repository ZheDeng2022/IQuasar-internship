  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if there are differences in block quality&#xD;
      between the CSE and DPE techniques for labor analgesia in parturients in active labor. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that when compared to the CSE technique, the DPE technique will significantly&#xD;
      improve block quality in this population and require fewer &quot;top-ups&quot; and catheter&#xD;
      replacements.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject identification and recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women admitted to the Duke Birthing Center for spontaneous or induced labor will be screened.&#xD;
      After usual consultation with the anesthesia team is completed and consent for anesthesia&#xD;
      services are obtained, eligible patients will be approached to by a member of the study team.&#xD;
      As indicated below, we will plan to enroll up to 120 patients to have 100 patients with&#xD;
      complete data (50 for the CSE group and 50 for the DPE group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of Study Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomized by computer-generated sequence to CSE or DPE arms,&#xD;
      stratified by parity (nulliparous versus multiparous). After the consented and enrolled&#xD;
      participant requests labor epidural, a study member will give the anesthesia provider a&#xD;
      sealed envelope with study assignment for either standard CSE or DPE technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient requests labor analgesia, the usual standard of care for epidural placement&#xD;
      will be initiated. The patient will receive 500-1000 mL fluid preload. Vitals will be&#xD;
      monitored by the labor nurse, including continuous pulse oximetry, non-invasive&#xD;
      blood-pressure monitoring, and external tocodynamometry. Anesthesia time-out will be&#xD;
      performed by the anesthesia provider with participation from the nurse and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a neuraxial technique in the sitting position at L3/4 or L4/5 using&#xD;
      loss of resistance to saline. In both the CSE and DPE groups, a 25-G Whitacre needle will be&#xD;
      used to puncture the dura. In the CSE group, 10 mcg of preservative-free fentanyl and 2 mg of&#xD;
      preservative-free isobaric 0.25% bupivacaine will be administered into the intrathecal space.&#xD;
      In both groups, the epidural catheter will be threaded 5 cm into the epidural space. In the&#xD;
      DPE group, an initiation dose of 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.1% with fentanyl (2 mcg/mL) over 6&#xD;
      minutes. This would not be administered in the CSE group. Labor analgesia will be maintained&#xD;
      by programmed intermittent bolus with 8 mL of the same solution every 45 minutes starting 30&#xD;
      minutes after the initial dose. Patients will have patient-controlled epidural analgesia&#xD;
      (PCEA) available with an 10 mL dose per demand, every 10 minutes, for a maximum dose of 50 mL&#xD;
      for every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the block is placed, a blinded provider will enter the room to collect data. Data will&#xD;
      be collected every 3 minutes for the first 30 minutes or until pain score is 1 or 0 with&#xD;
      uterine contractions. Subsequent assessments will be every 2 hours until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of breakthrough pain will be standardized.&#xD;
