      EMLA is proven to be better in achieving pain control as topical anesthesia than benzocaine&#xD;
      at palatal mucosa. So this research is done to compare its effectiveness at buccal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 70 patients attending DOW ojha hospital, fulfilling inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      undergoing extraction of bilateral teeth will be included in this study. Approval of data&#xD;
      collection will be sought from the Institutional ethical review board ¬(IERB) of Dow&#xD;
      university of health sciences (DUHS) for this study. the participants will be briefed about&#xD;
      the nature and purpose of the study including visual analogue scale (VAS). They will be&#xD;
      ensured that their information will be used for the study purpose only. Informed consent from&#xD;
      the participants will be obtained. Complete history from patients will be taken. The sites&#xD;
      will be divided into condition A- 5% EMLA and Condition B - 20% Benzocaine Gel. After marking&#xD;
      injection sites, principal investigator will leave the room and the consultant will apply 5%&#xD;
      EMLA gel at experimental area and 20% Benzocaine gel at control area. After pre-treatment&#xD;
      with topical anesthesia the consultant will administer local anesthesia to both sides. Then&#xD;
      Principal investigator will be signaled into the room and patient will be assessed though&#xD;
      visual analogue scale by him and will be confirmed by supervisor.&#xD;

      The concept of dental pain is a true fear for many people. In dentistry, management of pain&#xD;
      and anxiety has evolved through behavior modification and oral and intravenous sedatives.&#xD;
      Whereas local anesthesia is known as the backbone of the profession. Over the years, methods&#xD;
      have been introduced to reduce the pricking pain of local anesthesia injection. There are so&#xD;
      many factors which help reduce the pain caused by local anesthesia injection such as warming&#xD;
      the local anesthetic agent, specific size of needle gauge, a certain type of anesthetic&#xD;
      solution and topical anesthetics. Topical anesthetics are used at insertion sites before&#xD;
      injections to reduces the slight discomfort with insertion of the needle. [1,2,3]&#xD;
      OneaofatheaTopicalaanesthetics widelyaused for dental proceduresaincludesaBenzocaine.[4]&#xD;
      Benzocaine is anaFDA-approved drugawhichaisaavailable in various forms and concentrations. In&#xD;
      the 20% concentration, benzocaineagel is the most commonly used topical anesthetic in&#xD;
      dentistry, withaanaonsetatimeaofa30asecondsaandadurationaofa5-15aminutes. EMLA is a eutectic&#xD;
      mixture of the two local anesthetics, prilocaine and lidocaine which melt at lower&#xD;
      temperatures than any of its components, permitting higher concentrations of anesthetics for&#xD;
      use.[5] It is used to reduce the pain associated with venous cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past studies have reported the pharmacologic and the psychological effects on pain control by&#xD;
      benzocaine and Eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA). However, there is no valuable&#xD;
      data on the effect of the simultaneous use 5% EMLA and 20%&#xD;
