    <textblock>
      Incidence: Dizziness or vertigo is a very prevalent complaint in the general population, and&#xD;
      a common reason for seeking medical attention. In Denmark, 20-30 % have experienced&#xD;
      dizziness/vertigo to a degree that has led to disability, sick leave, or medical contact(1).&#xD;
      In the United States, dizziness is estimated to account for partly 2.6-4.4 million visits to&#xD;
      emergency departments (EDs) each year, partly 4 % of main symptoms in patients admitted to&#xD;
      EDs (2). In Germany, the estimated prevalence of dizziness is 20-30 % with an annual&#xD;
      incidence about 11 % (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terminology and definition: Dizziness or vertigo is not a disease itself but rather a symptom&#xD;
      of various underlying disorders. Thus, vestibular, neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic,&#xD;
      and psychiatric diseases may be associated with dizziness/vertigo as well as medical side&#xD;
      effects. Patients (and professionals) often use the two terms dizziness and vertigo&#xD;
      synonymously, which may cause some confusion in the choice of diagnostics. Vertigo is&#xD;
      characteristic for vestibular disorders and is defined as sensation of self-motion when no&#xD;
      self-motion occurs, or sensation of distorted self-motion during an otherwise normal head&#xD;
      movement, whereas dizziness is a feeling of more general unsteadiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is implementation of HINTS and v-HIT in an ED able to reduce the number of undiagnosed&#xD;
           and misdiagnosed cases of acute onset vertigo as well as diagnostic delay ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the effects of immediate and systematic balance training in case of acute&#xD;
           vestibular diseases ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the cost-effectiveness of implementation of HINTS and v-HIT as up front&#xD;
           diagnostics, and systematic balance training in patients with acute vestibular diseases&#xD;
           ?&#xD;

      Phd thesis will be done including these 3 parts. STUDY 1 Effects of implementation of HINTS&#xD;
      and v-HIT in an emergency department HYPOTHESIS Implementation of HINTS and v-HIT in the&#xD;
      acute diagnostic workup for patients presenting with acute onset dizziness/vertigo at the ED,&#xD;
      Hospital of South West Jutland (SVS), Denmark, along with the routine triage and acute MRI of&#xD;
      the brain can reduce the number of un-/misdiagnosed cases to almost zero at the time of&#xD;
      discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HINTS and V-hit can be performed by a nurse at the ED with a high level of accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS To investigate the effects of implementing nurse-performed v-HIT and HINTS in patients&#xD;
      presenting with acute onset dizziness/vertigo in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN A prospective cohort of unselected patients with acute onset dizziness/vertigo is&#xD;
      compared to a baseline (historical) cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two populations are included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline population 1 (historical cohort being identified by reviewing charts of all&#xD;
      consecutive patients in the ED throughout 12 months prior to implementation of intervention&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population 1: all consecutive patients undergoing intervention 1 (prospective cohort)&#xD;
      throughout 12 months. Inclusion criteria: all consecutive adult patients (18 years and older)&#xD;
      admitted to the ED with acute onset vertigo/dizziness as the primary complaint. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria: patients with known vestibular disease, vestibular symptoms lasting more than two&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred patients are needed in both groups (see sample size calculation in the&#xD;
      statistical section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Baseline population 1: The first part of this study reviews the patient's pathway&#xD;
      from onset of vertigo/dizziness to final diagnosis by means of current management. Charts of&#xD;
      all patients admitted to the ED, SVS, throughout 12 months due to acute onset&#xD;
      dizziness/vertigo as the primary complaint are reviewed. Data is used for comparison with&#xD;
      study population 1 undergoing intervention 1. In addition, the baseline population are&#xD;
      offered a cross sectional follow up visit at the ENT Department, SVS, in order to fill in DHI&#xD;
      (Dizziness Handicap Inventory), as well as undergoing standard vestibular status with HINTS,&#xD;
      v-HIT, VNG (spontaneous nystagmus) and posturography. A subgroup of baseline patients with&#xD;
      assumed peripheral AVS at the time of the acute attack is appointed according to patient&#xD;
      chart, actual history and vestibular status as baseline in study 2 (baseline population 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population 1: is enrolled prospectively and represents all consecutive patients&#xD;
      admitted with acute onset dizziness/vertigo as the primary complaint to the ED. The&#xD;
      population undergoes intervention 1: HINTS and v-HIT performed acutely by a group of trained&#xD;
      nurses in the ED. Furthermore, acute MRI and usual triage is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 1: The group of 5-6 nurses at the ED is trained by two experienced ENT&#xD;
      specialists performing HINTS, v-HIT, and VNG (spontaneous nystagmus). After a month of five&#xD;
      training sessions, the nurses perform the examinations at the ED. All tests results including&#xD;
      MRI and routine triage are conferred with the senior doctor on duty in the ED, and it is&#xD;
      decided to which specialty the patient is referred. HINTS, v-HIT, and VNG are repeated at the&#xD;
      ENT Department within 24 hours to investigate the accuracy of the primary findings in the ED.&#xD;
      Patients with peripheral AVS are identified in order to be included in study 2 with&#xD;
      intervention 2 (study population 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparability of the baseline population and study population 1 will be performed by&#xD;
      demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOMES Number of undiagnosed and misdiagnosed cases in the two populations is&#xD;
      calculated at the time of discharge from ED. Definitions: Undiagnosed: cases without specific&#xD;
      ICD10 code explaining acute dizziness/vertigo. Misdiagnosed: cases in which the chart review&#xD;
      (baseline population) reveals obviously wrong ICD10 codes/post-hospital examinations reveal&#xD;
      the specific cause of dizziness/vertigo; or ENT-examination within 24 hours changes the&#xD;
      primary diagnosis (study population 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage of patients undergoing HINTS in the baseline population, and percentage of&#xD;
      patients undergoing HINTS and v-HIT in study population 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES Time to correct diagnosis. Primary referral to relevant specialty:&#xD;
      internal medicine, cardiology, neurology, or ENT: number of correct referrals from ED.&#xD;
      Accuracy of nurse-performed HINTS and v-HIT using the results of ENT specialist-performed&#xD;
      HINTS and v-HIT as reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES Age, gender, level of education, work, nutritional-, smoking-, alcohol-, and&#xD;
      exercise factors (equivalent of the Danish KRAM factors), BMI, examinations and number&#xD;
      hereof, comorbidities, previous vertigo/dizziness, medication, time to ICD diagnosis after&#xD;
      admittance (hours), diagnosis, correctness of diagnosis evaluated at follow up at the ENT&#xD;
      Department (right/wrong/no initial diagnosis)., HINTS (normal, not normal, not done), v-HIT&#xD;
      (video head impulse (lateral): gain after 60 ms, gain asymmetry (%), saccades overt and&#xD;
      covert), VNG (spontaneous nystagmus, fixed and unfixed gaze).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the ENT examination a subgroup of study population 1 suffering from peripheral AVS&#xD;
      is enrolled in study 2 undergoing intervention 2: rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 2 Effects of immediate and systematic balance training in patients with peripheral&#xD;
      acute vestibular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Patients suffering from any peripheral AVS: vestibular neuritis, benign paroxysmal&#xD;
      positioning vertigo (BPPV), debut of Meniere's disease, perilymphatic fistulas, vestibular&#xD;
      migraine, or labyrinthitis benefit from targeted vestibular balance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The objective is to investigate the number of patients regaining complete balance after&#xD;
      peripheral AVS and to compare a historical group undergoing no balance training with a&#xD;
      prospective cohort undergoing systematic balance training immediately after the acute attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN Prospective, comparative interventional study. POPULATIONS Baseline population 2:&#xD;
      patients identified as baseline population 1 will be contacted 12 months after the acute&#xD;
      admission to ED for a vestibular status at the ENT Department. Those suspected of having&#xD;
      suffered from any kind of peripheral AVS at the time of the acute attack according to the&#xD;
      chart, actual history and vestibular status will be invited to go through the same balance&#xD;
      training and follow up as study population 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population 2 is generated based on the findings in study population 1: those diagnosed&#xD;
      with peripheral AVS according to the ENT examinations (vestibular status within 24 hours&#xD;
      after admission) are offered a systematic and structured balance training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients are needed in both groups (see sample size calculation in the&#xD;
      statistical section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparability of the two populations will be examined by demographics. METHODS Vestibular&#xD;
      status: DHI, HINTS, v-HIT, VNG, and posturography. Intervention 2: The balance training&#xD;
      program consists of a six step gaze stabilizing exercise program and a four step general&#xD;
      balance stabilizing exercise program, introduced as soon as the patient is able to stand on&#xD;
      their own. The progress of the program is evaluated by DHI and posturography in the outlined&#xD;
      time intervals. The programs are individualized so each step is mastered before moving on to&#xD;
      the next step. Patients will be instructed by a physiotherapist and/or a trained nurse in&#xD;
      continuation of going through the vestibular status at the ENT Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Progress with the program is evaluated with vestibular status once a week for six&#xD;
      weeks and then after, three, six and twelve months for a final evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOMES Percentage of patients with complete recovery one year after the acute&#xD;
      attack defined as resumption of all daily day activities. Degree of vestibular deficit scored&#xD;
      by the DHI questionnaire. Vestibular status in baseline population 2 (12 months after&#xD;
      admission) is compared to vestibular status at one year follow up in study population 2 in&#xD;
      terms of HINTS, v-HIT, VNG, posturography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES Vestibular status in study population 2 at admission and at one year&#xD;
      follow up are compared. Progression through the balance training program is evaluated by&#xD;
      change in vestibular status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES Age, gender, level of education, work, nutritional-, smoking-, alcohol-, and&#xD;
      exercise factors (equivalent of the Danish KRAM factors), BMI, comorbidity, previous&#xD;
      vertigo/dizziness, medication, history of substance abuse. DHI (points), HINTS (normal,&#xD;
      abnormal), v-HIT (video head impulse (lateral): gain after 60 ms, gain asymmetry (%),&#xD;
      saccades overt and covert), VNG (spontaneous nystagmus, fixed and unfixed gaze),&#xD;
      posturography (degrees of sway measured in different positions: standing, standing closed&#xD;
      eyes, standing on pillows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 3 Cost-effectiveness of implementing up front diagnostics and balance training in&#xD;
      patients with acute onset dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Changes of up front diagnostics in patients with acute onset dizziness/vertigo as&#xD;
      well as implementation of balance training is associated with increased costs. However, such&#xD;
      improvements result in higher percentage of patients with complete recovery and an earlier&#xD;
      return to work and thereby reduces the total socio-economic burden related to the incident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To examine the cost-effectiveness of up front diagnostics and balance training in&#xD;
      prospective cohorts of patients with acute onset dizziness compared to a historical control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATIONS Baseline population 1, study population 1, baseline population 2 and study&#xD;
      population 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective with one&#xD;
      year follow-up. Total costs of all patients will be measured, valued, and analysed. In the&#xD;
      analysis, the difference in cost will be related to percentage of patients with complete&#xD;
      recovery one year after the acute attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costing: The costs of up front diagnosis and balance training will be estimated using&#xD;
      micro-costing. Use of primary healthcare services (including costs to general practitioner,&#xD;
      specialized doctor, physiotherapist, etc.) will be extracted and valued from the Danish&#xD;
      National Health Service Register for Primary Care (NHSR). Use of secondary healthcare&#xD;
      services will be extracted from the National Patient Registry (NPR). This register includes&#xD;
      information on hospital departments, dates of admission and discharge, and diagnosis. The&#xD;
      valuation is determined by reimbursement rates from the Diagnosis-Related-Grouping (DRG) and&#xD;
      the Outpatient-grouping-system (DAGS). Productivity loss will be extracted from the Danish&#xD;
      Register for Evaluation of Marginalization (DREAM) and valued by age- and gender-matched&#xD;
      average gross salaries from Statistics Denmark (www.dst.dk).&#xD;
