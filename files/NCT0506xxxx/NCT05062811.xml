  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a serious threat to human health and a major global economic burden. Chronic&#xD;
      hypertension can cause left ventricular remodeling and loss of function, eventually leading&#xD;
      to heart failure. Exploring the early changes and mechanisms of left ventricular cardiac&#xD;
      function caused by hypertension, and to identify individuals who may develop into serious&#xD;
      heart injury, may play a positive role in the early prevention and control of heart failure&#xD;
      caused by hypertension. Therefore, this study intend to use two dimensional speckle tracking&#xD;
      technology, a non-invasive method to measure left ventricular pressure-strain loop to&#xD;
      quantitatively reflect cardiac work index , to study different hypertension patients with&#xD;
      normal left ventricular ejection fraction the change of the global and local cardiac work,&#xD;
      and the influence of aterosclerosis in the patients to myocardial work, and explore their&#xD;
      relationship with ventricular remodeling and abnormal diastolic function. To improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension, hypertensive heart disease and heart&#xD;
      failure, and to provide scientific support for the early prevention and control of such&#xD;
      diseases. Myocardial work analysis Echocardiography plays a central role in the evaluation of&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography is widely available and allows&#xD;
      characterization of the functional and structural of heart. Thus, assessment of left&#xD;
      lentricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and Myocardial work indexes has proven&#xD;
      benefit for both diagnosis and risk in hypertension patients.&#xD;

      Hypertension is a serious threat to human health and a major global economic burden.Chronic&#xD;
      hypertension can cause left ventricular remodeling and loss of function, eventually leading&#xD;
      to heart failure. Ventricular remodeling in hypertensive patients is an adaptive and&#xD;
      decompensating response to persistent elevated blood pressure and increased myocardial work&#xD;
      load. Exploring the early changes and mechanisms of left ventricular cardiac function caused&#xD;
      by hypertension, and to identify individuals who may develop into serious heart injury, may&#xD;
      play a positive role in the early prevention and control of heart failure caused by&#xD;
      hypertension.Therefore, this study intend to use two dimensional speckle tracking technology,&#xD;
      a non-invasive method to measure left ventricular pressure-strain loop to quantitatively&#xD;
      reflect cardiac work index , to study different hypertension patients with normal left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (including hypertension without heart damage performance with&#xD;
      different degree of high blood pressure, hypertension with diastolic dysfunction ,&#xD;
      hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy ) the change of the global and local cardiac&#xD;
      work, and the influence of aterosclerosis in the patients to myocardial work, and explore&#xD;
      their relationship with ventricular remodeling and abnormal diastolic function.To improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension, hypertensive heart disease and heart&#xD;
      failure, and to provide scientific support for the early prevention and control of such&#xD;
      diseases.Now days, Echocardiography plays a central role in the evaluation of patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography is widely available and allows characterization of&#xD;
      the functional and structural of heart. Thus, assessment of left lentricular (LV) global&#xD;
      longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and Myocardial work indexes has proven benefit for both diagnosis&#xD;
      and risk in hypertension patients. Myocardial work indexes have four indexes to evaluate&#xD;
      different function of lentricular. However, there is still no research investigating the the&#xD;
      relationship between blood pressure and Myocardial work indexes in patients with different&#xD;
      levels of blood pressure.&#xD;
