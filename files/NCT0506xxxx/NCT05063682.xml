    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the efficacy and safety of brain-targeting epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor chimeric antigen receptor immune cells (EGFRvIII-CAR T cells) in treating&#xD;
      patients with leptomeningeal disease from glioblastoma. T cells are part of the immune system&#xD;
      and help the body fight malignant tumours. Immune cells can be genetically modified to&#xD;
      destroy brain tumor cells in the laboratory. EGFRvIII -CAR T cells are brain tumor specific&#xD;
      and can enter and express its genes in immune cells. Administering patients EGFRvIII -CAR T&#xD;
      cells may help to recognize and destroy brain tumor cells in patients with leptomeningeal&#xD;
      disease from glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine and describe the safety and feasibility of EGFRvIII-specific hinge-optimized CD3&#xD;
           ζ-stimulatory/41BB-co-stimulatory Chimeric Antigen Receptor autologous T-lymphocytes&#xD;
           (EGFRvIII -CAR T cells) through intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery as adjuvant&#xD;
           therapy in participants with EGFRvIII+ leptomeningeal disease from glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the activity of EGFRvIII -CAR T cells based on survival rate at 12 months for&#xD;
           both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe persistence, expansion and phenotype of endogenous and EGFRvIII -CAR T cells in&#xD;
           peripheral blood (PB), tumor cyst fluid (TCF) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) at&#xD;
           applicable time points&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe cytokine levels in PB, TCF, and CSF at applicable time points&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimate the rate of disease response by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
           Leptomeningeal Metastases (RANO LM) criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Estimate rate of progression free survival at 6 months. Estimate rate of overall&#xD;
           survival (OS) at 12 months by study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Estimate time to next treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate EGFRvIII -CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the&#xD;
           EGFRvIII -CAR T cells with respect to the infusion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Evaluate biomarkers and cytokine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive EGFRvIII -CAR T cells intracerebroventricular over 15 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Patients may receive additional cycles based on the persistence of the cells. The patients&#xD;
      are followed extensively according to the clinical pharmacology sampling plan; on days 1-30,&#xD;
      months 2-12, and three times per year up to 10 years based on response&#xD;
