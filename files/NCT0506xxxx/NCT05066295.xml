      Neglect and abuse, which have a devastating effect on children, can be prevented with&#xD;
      community-based education programs aimed at strengthening families. The study aimed to&#xD;
      validate and determine reliability of the &quot;Parents Assessment of Protective Factors (PAPF)&#xD;
      survey&quot; and to develop a culturally appropriate program and educational design for&#xD;
      strengthening families.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The American Center for Social Policy Studies (CSSP) Center for Quality Improvement in Early&#xD;
      Childhood (QIC_EC) defined protective factors that will form the basis of programs designed&#xD;
      to prevent neglect and abuse, with community-based approaches. Community-based programs for&#xD;
      primary prevention should be developed to prevent neglect and abuse, before it occurs.&#xD;
      Existing studies in our country show that there is rarely a focus on preventing adverse&#xD;
      childhood experiences with primary preventive approaches. Most of the studies are&#xD;
      school-based, and aimed at increasing awareness of children and families about abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to evaluate the Turkish translation of the PAPF survey for validity and&#xD;
      reliability and to adapt a culturally appropriate program and educational design for&#xD;
      strengthening families, with a multidisciplinary team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first step of the study, Turkish validity and reliability of the Parents Assessment of&#xD;
      Protective Factors (PAPF) survey, will be conducted and applied to parents to determinate the&#xD;
      protective factors. Turkish version of Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire (ACE), will&#xD;
      be applied simultaneously with the PAPF survey, to identify adverse childhood experiences of&#xD;
      parents that might affect parental resilience, parenting characteristics, and family&#xD;
      dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, community-based family education programs that are&#xD;
      currently being implemented in different countries will be reviewed by a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team (healthcare professionals, social workers and non-governmental organizations). A&#xD;
      culturally appropriate educational primary prevention program for child neglect and abuse&#xD;
      will be developed.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Requests for wider sharing of data (for example in response to publications about the study and willingness to share), will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Any data sharing request will be made to investigators through a pre-defined data requisition form. This form will contain information about the applicant, institution, purpose of data request, study objectives, ethical clearance of the study, etc. Once a request has been made the data governance body will discuss if that request was appropriate; data will be released following signing of the data sharing agreement. The data will be stored on the Marmara University servers and not be deposited in any 'community' database.</ipd_description>
