  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our work is to develop and test the safety and feasibility of a&#xD;
      home-based upper limb rehabilitation program for individuals with tetraplegia. The program&#xD;
      will consist of simultaneous non-invasive spinal cord stimulation and immersive virtual&#xD;
      exercises of the upper limbs, with a focus on shoulder and elbow function.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in medical status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post intervention, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the intervention will be assessed as the number of participants who experience a reduction in medical stability and/or functionality from before to after the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Post intervention, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the treatment will be assessed using the Treatment Evaluation Inventory-Short Form. Items are scored using a 5-point scale, with 1 equaling strongly disagree and 5 equaling strongly agree. TEI-SF scores can range from 9 to 45, with higher scores representing greater acceptance of the treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability of the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Post intervention, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Usability of the treatment will be assessed using the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) Questionnaire. Items are rated on a seven-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. A higher scale score indicates higher usability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post intervention, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Affect will be assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The PANAS is a 20-item measure that measures the intensity of 20 emotions on a 0-5 scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in current pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post intervention, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Current pain intensity will be assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Participants will rate their current pain (multiple types of pain) on a 0-10 scale (0 = &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 = &quot;worst possible pain&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post intervention, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical muscle strength will be assessed using the American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) Upper Extremity Motor Score. Motor strength is rated on a 6 point scale with higher ratings indicating greater strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in upper limb function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post intervention, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb function will be assessed using the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). The SCIM is composed of 19 items that assess function. SCIM scores range from 0 to 100.</description>
