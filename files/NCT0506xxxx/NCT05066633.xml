  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study includes 150 patients with DMD diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing, 8-16 years&#xD;
      old (â‰¥8 and &lt;17) at the study entry with a follow-up of up to 5 years. Random enrollment of a&#xD;
      patient to one of two groups (intervention or control) takes place after pre-screening and&#xD;
      screening stage starts the first phase of the trial. To be eligible for participation in the&#xD;
      study, patients must receive standard of care cardiac therapy, which is an&#xD;
      Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) for at least one-month prior to enrollment. A&#xD;
      major part of the trial is equal for all patients - who will be receiving indistinguishable&#xD;
      investigational medicinal products (IMPs), the drug metoprolol succinate or placebo. As a&#xD;
      part of the clinical trial, diagnostic examinations evaluating progression of the disease,&#xD;
      will be performed periodically. In addition, all patients will be monitored at home. Heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure and patients' personal well-being will be controlled using telemedicine&#xD;
      technologies. Additional visits in the research center will be provided if any adverse events&#xD;
      occur. This model will be continued for 30 months from the enrollment of a first patient.&#xD;
      After this period the first drug efficiency analysis will be performed. After that, the&#xD;
      intervention may be continued or in case of negative impact of the intervention on patients'&#xD;
      health and well-being, terminated with further patients monitoring.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be evaluated for inclusion during a Screening period of up to one year&#xD;
      (possible to extend for another year if warranted). Written informed consent from the patient&#xD;
      and/or parent/legal guardian and assent, if applicable, to participate in the study must be&#xD;
      obtained prior to beginning any study-related procedures. Once eligibility is confirmed,&#xD;
      patients will undergo Screening Assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups will receive either metoprolol succinate (Treatment 1 - Intervention) at a dose&#xD;
      depending on the weight category as described below or matching placebo (Treatment 2 -&#xD;
      Control) to maintain the study blinding, one per day for up to 60 months. All patients (both&#xD;
      arms) will receive ACEi (e.g. perindopril, enarenal, lisinopril) or, if indicated, ARB (e.g.&#xD;
      losartan) as a standard of care at an appropriate therapeutic dose (see below) through all&#xD;
      the study duration. A total of approximately 150 subjects will be randomized into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability, clinical efficacy, at scheduled visits&#xD;
      throughout the study. Adverse events, including SAEs, and concomitant medications will be&#xD;
      recorded throughout the study in eCRF record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access credentials for ePROP will be dispensed to the participant or his legal guardian when&#xD;
      appropriate at the Enrolment Visit to record vital signs (HR and NIBP) and peak-flow-meter&#xD;
      readings, AEs, changes to concomitant medications taken during the study, and any missed or&#xD;
      incomplete doses of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site study staff will contact the parent(s)/ legal guardian(s) by telephone at quarterly to&#xD;
      ensure that the tablet dispensing is proceeding according to protocol and to address any&#xD;
      questions the parent(s)/guardian(s) may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will periodically return to the clinical site for assessments according to the&#xD;
      Visit Plan. The study is comprised of a Pre-screening, Screening-Enrolment-Randomization&#xD;
      Double-Blind Treatment Period further subdivided into Phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled into this study at the time written informed consent is given and&#xD;
      randomized to treatment only after completion of all Pre-treatment Screening and Enrolment&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug dosing will occur at home on all days starting from Enrolment Visit until the&#xD;
      Final Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that relevant clinical or laboratory parameters remain abnormal at the time of&#xD;
      discharge from the study, the subject will be followed medically, as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject who prematurely discontinues the study should return to the study centre for&#xD;
      scheduled assessments at the time of early withdrawal, whenever possible assuming the subject&#xD;
      has not withdrawn consent.&#xD;
