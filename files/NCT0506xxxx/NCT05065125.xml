  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is an essential treatment for end-stage liver disease. Although&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of LT recipients have markedly improved, anastomotic biliary strictures&#xD;
      (ABS) are still occurred in 10-40% of post-LT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Korea, living donor LT (LDLT) is the more common than deceased donor LT (DDLT). When&#xD;
      LDLT is performed, the right lobe graft is usually used, and the right anterior and posterior&#xD;
      segmental bile ducts (RASD/RPSD) of the graft are reconstructed by the duct-to-duct&#xD;
      anastomosis method to the common hepatic duct of the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When ABS occurs in LDLT recipients, the stricture site is often very tight and twisted. So,&#xD;
      conventional endoscopic procedure is challenging and success rate of ERCP for ABS is still&#xD;
      unsatisfactory (about 60%). Furthermore, approach to the RPSD is more intricate than that to&#xD;
      RASD because the duct opening is located deeper in a posterior aspect. Therefore, despite&#xD;
      being able to benefit the patient, bilateral drainage (both RASD and RPSD) is considered to&#xD;
      be more difficult and unilateral drainage of RASD is mainly performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, high-resolution cholangioscopy (SpyGlass™) was introduced. The system enables direct&#xD;
      visualization of the bile and pancreatic ducts strictures. The 3rd Generation SpyScope DS II&#xD;
      Access &amp; Delivery Catheter introduced in 2018, features increased resolution and adjusted&#xD;
      lighting to provide physicians with an even better view of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.&#xD;
      To date, only several retrospective studies have evaluated the efficacy of SpyGlass for&#xD;
      guidewire placement across the ABS and to the best of our knowledge only one prospective&#xD;
      study is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT #03205072). In that study ABS in both LDLT and DDLT&#xD;
      patients are enrolled. Private communications with the Sponsor of this study, however, have&#xD;
      reported that only approximately 10% of the cases are LDLT cases. In addition, there is no&#xD;
      reported paper about the usefulness of Spyglass for bilateral drainage and its clinical&#xD;
      benefit in post LT ABS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful bilateral drainage is performed by using Spyglass, it may be more helpful for&#xD;
      patients than unilateral drainage as it allows sufficient drainage of the transplanted liver.&#xD;
      With this prospective study, we intends to investigate the efficacy of Spyglass for bilateral&#xD;
      drainage of ABS in LDLT patients and improve drainage success rate. This results can be used&#xD;
      as clinical basis for further studies such as randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
