      Main study: This is an open-label, phase 2 study that aims to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety/tolerability of ceralasertib, when administered as monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      durvalumab in participants with unresectable or advanced melanoma and primary or secondary&#xD;
      resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition.&#xD;

      Biopsy sub-study: This is an open-label, non-randomised, sub-study planned in participants&#xD;
      suitable for 3 mandatory biopsies. Serial tumour biopsies are mandated in participants&#xD;
      recruited into the sub-study and will be taken at baseline during the screening period,&#xD;
      during treatment with ceralasertib monotherapy and during the off-treatment period of&#xD;
      ceralasertib monotherapy.&#xD;
