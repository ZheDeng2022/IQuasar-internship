  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a common health problem worldwide. In general population, studies in developed&#xD;
      countries estimated the annual incidence of epilepsy to be~50 per 100,000 and prevalence to&#xD;
      be ~8.2 per 1,000. These figures are higher in developing countries in which prevalence of&#xD;
      &gt;10 per 1,000 was reported. In Upper Egypt, Assiut Governorate, the prevalence rate was 12.9&#xD;
      per 1,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In people with epilepsy there is an associated high rate of cognitive difficulties that&#xD;
      compromise educational progress and achievement throughout life. Approximately 1-5% of the&#xD;
      population exhibits epileptiform discharges on electroencephalography (EEG). Interictal&#xD;
      epileptiform discharges (IEDs), meaning spikes, polyspikes, sharp waves, or spike and&#xD;
      slow-wave complexes without observed clinical seizures, are commonly observed in patients&#xD;
      with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy syndromes manifesting with IEDs are detrimental to cognitive function. Recently, two&#xD;
      studies found that frequent IEDs can impair cognitive performance in children. and adult&#xD;
      patients. Several studies indicated that IEDs in patients with epilepsy had a disruptive&#xD;
      effect on information processing speed with even a low percentage of IEDs (1%).However, it is&#xD;
      unclear whether IEDs are associated with disrupted academic performance in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic epilepsy, and the relationship between general cognitive ability and academic&#xD;
      performance in those patients has not been clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding how IEDs interfere with neurocognitive outcomes is important ,while the goal of&#xD;
      medical and surgical treatments for epilepsy is to achieve seizure-freedom with minimal&#xD;
      morbidity, the benefits of IED suppression are more controversial.&#xD;

      This study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the influence of interictal epileptiform activity per se on some cognitive&#xD;
           functions in newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy (before using anti-seizure&#xD;
           medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine different effects among different brain areas (producing epileptiform&#xD;
           activity) on specific cognitive domains Type of the study: Case control Study Study&#xD;
           Setting: Assiut university hospital -Neuropsychiatry hospital- Out patient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects: Will include epilepsy patients that diagnosed according to the International&#xD;
      League Against Epilepsy criteria, 2017:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study tools All patients included in this study will be subjected to: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History taking including Personal history, history of present illness, therapeutic&#xD;
           history, past history and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete physical examination. 3) Neurological examination. 4) Digital&#xD;
           electroencephalography (EEG) for an hour (16 channels). 5) Psychiatric assessment: all&#xD;
           subjects included in the study will be asked to perform a series of psychological tests&#xD;
           done by expert psychologist to detect cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).&#xD;
