  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With 25.2 million children affected and 3.4 million deaths in 2017, paediatric sepsis is the&#xD;
      leading cause of under-five mortality worldwide and has recently been described as&#xD;
      &quot;significant global health threat&quot; by the World Health Organization. In addition to early&#xD;
      antibiotics, fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is one of the cornerstones of management, due to the&#xD;
      theoretical improvement of cardiac output, oxygen delivery and organ perfusion. In the&#xD;
      absence of a consensual and operational definition to date, the latest international&#xD;
      guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2020 (SSC-2020), refers to children (≥ 37 weeks&#xD;
      gestation at birth to 18 years old) with severe infection leading to cardiovascular (i.e.,&#xD;
      &quot;septic shock&quot;) or non-cardiovascular organ dysfunction (i.e., &quot;other sepsis-associated organ&#xD;
      dysfunction&quot; or former &quot;severe sepsis&quot;). The SSC-2020 specifies the modalities for paediatric&#xD;
      sepsis management, particularly concerning FBT, with, for example, the preferential use of&#xD;
      balanced crystalloids, and a target volume of 40-60ml/kg at one hour of recognition using&#xD;
      boluses of 10-20ml/kg in children who have access to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)&#xD;
      in their health system. Further, it is now well established that compliance with&#xD;
      international guidelines is associated with improved outcomes in paediatric sepsis. Despite&#xD;
      the importance of awareness and implementation of the SSC-2020, there are, to our knowledge,&#xD;
      no studies evaluating its application in children. We prospectively conducted the Fluid&#xD;
      Resuscitation for Suspected Sepsis in Paediatric Emergency Departments (FRESSPED) study in 25&#xD;
      hospitals over five weeks between November 2021 and March 2022, whose principal objective was&#xD;
      to assess doctors adherence to the SSC-2020 guidelines when performing FBT in infants and&#xD;
      children with suspected sepsis in French paediatric emergency departments.&#xD;

      FRESSPED study was conducted over 5 weeks, the last week of each month, between November 2021&#xD;
      and March 2022 (11/29 - 12/05 ; 12/27 - 01/02 ; 01/24 - 30/01 ; 02/21 - 02/27 ; 03/21 -&#xD;
      03/27). Patients were followed up one month after inclusion, extending the study period until&#xD;
      midnight on 28 April 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FRESSPED study was conducted in three stages :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of usual fluid bolus therapy practice in infants and children with suspected&#xD;
           sepsis in French paediatric emergency departments, through the prospectively anonymous&#xD;
           completion of a paper case report form (CRF) designed to be completed in less than 5&#xD;
           minutes, within 72 hours of inclusion, by each doctor in one of the participating&#xD;
           centers caring for an eligible patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questioning of participating doctors at the end of the 5-week prospective data&#xD;
           collection period, to explore the underlying reasons of doctors non-adherence to the&#xD;
           SSC-2020 guidelines. It will take the form of a short, anonymized and blinded of centers&#xD;
           outcomes, online survey to assess attitudes and knowledge, without inter-center or&#xD;
           inter-individual comparisons (except for doctors seniority)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Description of characteristics and outcomes of included patients, by consultation, up to&#xD;
           1 month after inclusion, of data collected in routine care (patient chart) by the lead&#xD;
           researcher (Julian San GEROTEO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above criteria, the suspicion of sepsis was confirmed retrospectively in&#xD;
      doubtful or non-documented cases or those without microbiological documentation, using an&#xD;
      adjudication committee composed of two medical experts particularly important in the absence&#xD;
      of a &quot;&quot;gold standard&quot;&quot; definition of paediatric sepsis to date.&#xD;
