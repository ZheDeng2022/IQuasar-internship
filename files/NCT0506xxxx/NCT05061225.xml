      Objectives: The aim of this project will be to evaluate the efficacy of a lifestyle PA&#xD;
      counselling program for physically inactive first responders with at least mild symptoms of&#xD;
      either anxiety, depression or stress and their chosen support partners compared to a waiting&#xD;
      list, and to determine the mediating effect of autonomous motivation. Additionally, the&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial will be complemented with qualitative interviews to provide a&#xD;
      deeper context and understanding to the quantitative findings. To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      no randomized controlled trial to date has examined the outcomes of an online physical&#xD;
      activity counselling intervention using peer-support in firefighters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Within mixed methods randomized controlled trials, we will follow a sequential&#xD;
      explanatory design. In this design, qualitative results complement and help interpret&#xD;
      quantitative findings. In order to address the main aims, a randomized controlled trial will&#xD;
      be executed. CONSORT statement will be followed for reporting findings. Protocol will be&#xD;
      submitted to clinicaltrials.gov. For addressing the secondary aim of the study, the study&#xD;
      will follow a qualitative design based on interpretative phenomenology. Phenomenology is a&#xD;
      model used for describing, understanding, and interpreting the lived experiences of the&#xD;
      participants by means of discourse analysis. For the quantitative component, two arms with 24&#xD;
      firefighters will be required. Additionally, chosen support partners will enter the&#xD;
      intervention arm. Participants in the intervention arm will be invited to a private facebook&#xD;
      page where the researcher will upload weekly educational posts regarding different aspects of&#xD;
      physical activity. For the qualitative component, participants will be invited to 2-3 focus&#xD;
      groups where the experiences of the participants on the program will be discussed.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by a combination of emotional,&#xD;
      behavioural, and physiological symptoms following exposure to a traumatic event. Due to a&#xD;
      greater exposure to traumatic events, first responders such as firefighters tend to have&#xD;
      worse general well-being, higher risk of problematic alcohol use, and worse sleep quality,&#xD;
      which consequently results in mental health problems, and also increases the risk of&#xD;
      firefighters of developing PTSD compared to the general population. Evidence-based guidelines&#xD;
      for the treatment of PTSD consider psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy as first line treatment.&#xD;
      However, less than 10% of first responders with PTSD seek these guideline-informed&#xD;
      treatments. One of the reasons is that first responders have a unique culture of&#xD;
      self-reliance and strength, where mental health issues are considered a weakness. A culture&#xD;
      of not showing weakness, together with fear of stigma and of confidentiality breach are the&#xD;
      main barriers for seeking traditional mental health treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity (PA) and its structured form, exercise, are a non-stigmatizing, easily&#xD;
      accessible and promising add-on prevention and treatment interventions for a wide range of&#xD;
      mental disorders including depression, anxiety- and stress-related disorders. It has an&#xD;
      effect size similar to commonly used pharmacotherapy in patients with anxiety disorders.&#xD;
      Furthermore, PA-based interventions have shown to be effective in improving sleep quality and&#xD;
      reducing alcohol consumption. Adding on the mental health benefits, PA-based interventions&#xD;
      can also target the cardiometabolic co-morbidity commonly observed in people with depression,&#xD;
      anxiety- and stress-related disorders and in first responders. Therefore, PA might be a&#xD;
      promising treatment modality for physically inactive first responders with depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, or stress symptoms. Current guidelines strongly recommend 150-300 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate PA or 75-150 minutes of vigorous PA, or an equivalent combination of&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to successfully implement PA-based interventions as prevention and treatment&#xD;
      programs, research should explore effective ways to deliver the intervention in a way that is&#xD;
      appealing for the target population. E-health and new technologies could provide a novel and&#xD;
      less stigmatising approach to mental health interventions. It is an accessible and low-cost&#xD;
      tool that could be effective for delivering PA interventions, increasing PA levels and&#xD;
      improving mental health outcomes in people with psychiatric disorders or mental distress.&#xD;
      Social media, more specifically Facebook, is a promising platform that has been previously&#xD;
      used for supporting PA interventions for people with severe mental illness. The use of a&#xD;
      private Facebook group to deliver these interventions could increase the feeling of&#xD;
      belongingness and facilitate peer-to-peer support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social support is an essential aspect of adherence to PA interventions. Furthermore, social&#xD;
      and family support are well-known protective factors against mental distress after prolonged&#xD;
      exposure to trauma. Recent research suggests that partners, family members, or friends&#xD;
      (commonly known as &quot;informal caregivers&quot;) of first responders with mental distress have&#xD;
      poorer mental health compared with the general population. Moreover, informal caregivers are&#xD;
      also more likely to be sedentary, defined as wake-time spent sitting, reclined, or lying down&#xD;
      quietly, than the general population. Including informal caregivers as support partners in a&#xD;
      PA intervention could be beneficial not only for the first responders, but for the health of&#xD;
      their informal caregivers. Another relevant factor which has been found to impact&#xD;
      implementation of PA in daily living is the quality of the motivation to engage in PA.&#xD;
      Previous research has found evidence that higher levels of autonomous motivation are related&#xD;
      to more leisure time spent in physical activity in firefighters. However, despite the calls&#xD;
      for more research examining the mediating effect of autonomous motivation on PA-based&#xD;
      interventions, there is still a lack of causal evidence on the influence of autonomous&#xD;
      motivation on PA-related behaviour change in physically inactive firefighters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this project will be to evaluate the efficacy of a lifestyle PA&#xD;
      counselling program for physically inactive first responders with at least mild symptoms of&#xD;
      either anxiety, depression or stress and their chosen support partners compared to a waiting&#xD;
      list, and to determine the mediating effect of autonomous motivation. Additionally, the&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial will be complemented with qualitative interviews to provide a&#xD;
      deeper context and understanding to the quantitative findings. To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      no randomized controlled trial to date has examined the outcomes of an online physical&#xD;
      activity counselling intervention using peer-support in firefighters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the efficacy of a lifestyle PA counselling program in physically inactive&#xD;
      firefighters with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms and their support partner compared&#xD;
      to waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the mediating effect of autonomous motivation and perceived social support&#xD;
           on the improvements on PA levels and mental health outcomes after a lifestyle PA&#xD;
           counselling program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the experiences of firefighters and their support partners participating&#xD;
           in a lifestyle PA counselling program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon of the aforementioned aims, the following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PA levels, mental health outcomes, quality of life, and sleep quality of firefighters&#xD;
           and their support partners will improve after participating in a PA counselling&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomous motivation and perceived social support will partially mediate the&#xD;
           improvements on PA levels and mental health outcomes of firefighters after participating&#xD;
           in a PA counselling intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to indicate that qualitative research does not require a hypothesis, but a&#xD;
      research question to drive the study. The research question for the secondary aim of the&#xD;
      study is &quot;How is the experience of participating in a PA counselling intervention to increase&#xD;
      levels of PA and improve mental health outcomes, quality of life and sleep quality?&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed-methods designs facilitate the assessment of the perspectives and experiences of the&#xD;
      participants while providing numerical data, and can offer deeper and wider understanding of&#xD;
      a research question than qualitative or quantitative methodologies alone. For this reason,&#xD;
      the use of mixed-methods designs in mental health research and implementation of new health&#xD;
      policies is growing. Furthermore, this design is recommended for physical therapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation research aimed at exploring and explaining complex phenomena in interaction&#xD;
      with bio-psycho-social and personal factors. This study will explore the complexity of the&#xD;
      interactions between motivation for PA, mental health, and traumatic experiences for which&#xD;
      the use of a purely quantitative or qualitative approach would be insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within mixed methods randomized controlled trials, a sequential explanatory design will be&#xD;
      followed. In this design, qualitative results complement and help interpret quantitative&#xD;
      findings. In order to address the main aims, a randomized controlled trial will be executed.&#xD;
      CONSORT statement will be followed for reporting findings. Protocol will be submitted to&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov. For addressing the secondary aim of the study, the study will follow a&#xD;
      qualitative design based on interpretative phenomenology. Phenomenology is a model used for&#xD;
      describing, understanding, and interpreting the lived experiences of the participants by&#xD;
      means of discourse analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of Fire Stress Team (FiST) will be contacted, a non-profit community initiative&#xD;
      aiming to increase awareness for support and care for first responders and their families,&#xD;
      and Netwerk Brandweer Vlaanderen, the firefighters' network of the Flemish region of Belgium.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via mail in which they will receive the participant&#xD;
      information and a flyer of the study. Participants will have the option to schedule a meeting&#xD;
      with the main researcher to go through possible questions or comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should have internet access and an active Facebook account or be willing to&#xD;
      create one. First-responders will be required to nominate a support partner. This may be any&#xD;
      person with a close personal relationship to them, for example, partner, family member, carer&#xD;
      or friend with whom they have at least weekly in-person contact with. Participants who are&#xD;
      eligible will be randomized to either the lifestyle PA counselling or a wait-list condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid separating firefighters from their support partner, each pair will be randomized as&#xD;
      a unit. Each group will have the same number of participants (1:1). Each pair will be coded&#xD;
      by a research assistant, who will do the simple randomization into control or intervention&#xD;
      arm before baseline assessment using www.randomization.com. Allocation will be concealed from&#xD;
      participants and the main researcher. The research assistant will introduce the allocation&#xD;
      results in a sealed opaque envelope which will only be opened once baselines assessments have&#xD;
      been completed in order to invite the participants to the Facebook group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G*Power was used to detect an average large effect size (r = 0.8) with a statistical power of&#xD;
      80% and a significance level of 0.05 based on the SD of a similar population. A total sample&#xD;
      size of 24 firefighters per group for each intervention study is required to detect a 10&#xD;
      point between group difference on the PCL-5. An additional number of 6 firefighters will be&#xD;
      recruited to account for a possible drop-out rate of 22% based on the results of the latest&#xD;
      literature on drop-out rates on exercise trials for anxiety and related- disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be executed on 3 time points for both intervention and control group:&#xD;
      one-week pre- intervention, immediately post- intervention and 3 months post. The full survey&#xD;
      takes approximately 50 minutes to complete. Data will be stored separately for control and&#xD;
      intervention arm. A survey with all the questionnaires will be sent by e-mail to the&#xD;
      participants. Blinding at baseline will be reached by concealed allocation, and a researcher&#xD;
      blinded to group allocation will carry out assessments post-intervention and at 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PA counselling intervention will consist of 10 weeks of content, delivered online&#xD;
      interventions through a private Facebook page. Firefighters and their nominated support&#xD;
      partners will both be encouraged to be actively involved on the Facebook page and with the&#xD;
      programme. The research team will facilitate discussion boards. The intervention will be&#xD;
      elaborated based on the evidence gathered in previous studies on the different motivation&#xD;
      strategies and barriers for PA. Weekly content will include information regarding different&#xD;
      aspects of physical activity and mental health, demonstration videos, links to existing&#xD;
      online resources and discussion questions. These posts will all occur from the study&#xD;
      generated account, twice a week, and the page will be checked by the researcher at least once&#xD;
      per day, Monday to Friday. If participants are not interacting (i.e. reading the posts) in&#xD;
      the Facebook page for more than a week they will be contacted by the main researcher. At the&#xD;
      beginning of the intervention, participants will be given a Fitbit Inspire 2 in order to&#xD;
      learn self-monitoring and goal-setting. An outline of the intervention content can be found&#xD;
      in Table 1. Behaviour-change techniques will be incorporated into the program. Participants&#xD;
      will also have the option to join a weekly group telehealth call via Skype for Business. The&#xD;
      main researcher, a physiotherapist specialized in PA counselling in mental health, will lead&#xD;
      the discussion and provide further education on the same weekly topic as the Facebook group&#xD;
      for approximately 20-30 min. To encourage participation, there will be two telehealth group&#xD;
      calls per week and participants can join either. Participants will be able to join in on the&#xD;
      discussion, share their experiences, and ask questions. Participants allocated to the control&#xD;
      group will be assigned to a waiting list and enter the Facebook Group after the last&#xD;
      follow-up assessment. The control group will receive the same content but there will be no&#xD;
      telehealth discussion calls.&#xD;

      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be run using IBM SPSS statistics version 27. Data will be tested&#xD;
      for normality with the Shapiro-Wilks test. Differences in baseline characteristics between&#xD;
      the two groups will be analysed by means of independent-samples t-tests or Mann Whitney U&#xD;
      tests when appropriate for continuous variables, and Chi-square test for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis will consider participants randomly&#xD;
      assigned to each group for inclusion in the analysis, using the base-line characteristics of&#xD;
      non-completers to compare with participants who complete all follow-up assessments.&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis of variance will be used to explore between-group differences (standard&#xD;
      mean difference and 95% confidence intervals) immediately post-intervention and at 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up for all outcome measures. Cohen's d will be used as an estimate of the effect size.&#xD;
      Mediation analysis will be carried out in 3 steps. First, effects of the intervention on&#xD;
      autonomous motivation and perceived social support (potential mediators) will be tested by&#xD;
      regressing both variables into the treatment condition. Second, associations between changes&#xD;
      in potential mediators and changes in PA levels and mental health outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      by regressing PA levels and mental health outcomes into treatment condition and potential&#xD;
      mediators. Third, indirect effect will be estimated and tested for statistical significance&#xD;
      by means of the Sobel test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis will be based on an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach. QRS&#xD;
      Internationals' NVivo 12 software will be used to store and code the inductive qualitative&#xD;
      data gathered from the focus groups. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim,&#xD;
      and sent back to the participant to check veracity. In order to identify, analyse, and report&#xD;
      patterns within data, thematic analysis will be used. The steps for thematic analysis are: 1)&#xD;
      familiarisation with data, 2) generation of initial codes, 3) searching for themes, 4)&#xD;
      reviewing the themes, 5) defining and naming the themes, and 6) producing the report.&#xD;
      Trustworthiness will be ensured by team meetings to discuss the data. A research assistant&#xD;
      will take the role of observer in the focus-groups and assist the main researcher with data&#xD;
      collection and non-verbal observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and acceptability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be defined by usage of the Facebook group (manual calculation of the sum of posts, likes&#xD;
      and comments), and participant retention (completion of questionnaires and retention in&#xD;
      programme). Acceptability will be assessed immediately post-intervention using the 14-item&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability questionnaire that has been used previously to measure&#xD;
      participant responses to a private Facebook group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive information concerning the purpose of the study, being properly&#xD;
      stated in a consent form in Dutch. The protocol, patient data management plan, and consent&#xD;
      form will be sent to the local KU Leuven Ethical Committee, and registered at clinical trial&#xD;
      center (CTC) UZ Leuven prior to the start of the trial. To avoid potential loss of&#xD;
      confidentiality, data collected will be anonymized and de-identified immediately after its&#xD;
      collection. For qualitative focus groups, participants' names will be coded in a&#xD;
      password-secured file by the main researcher. Participation in all studies is voluntary and&#xD;
      participants will be able to withdraw at any time without any consequence or prejudice.&#xD;
      Participation in the intervention study will not be reimbursed since monetary profit is a&#xD;
      form of external motivation which might affect the outcomes of the intervention. Flyers&#xD;
      showcasing the obtained results will be sent to the involved associations for their&#xD;
      dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in these studies has little to no associated risks. Participants that are&#xD;
      confronted with strong emotions when filling in the surveys will be directed to local&#xD;
      psychological services. There will be no direct human contact, implying no COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      risk. All data collection will be carried out on-line, and post PA recommendations will be&#xD;
      adapted to current local restrictions and recommendations (consulted in&#xD;
      https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/faq/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facebook group will be private and hidden for anyone not involved in the intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to make anonymous posts when discussing sensible topics in&#xD;
      the Facebook group. Anonymous posts are seen by every member of the group but only the group&#xD;
      administrator will know the identity of the person posting it. Additionally, participants&#xD;
      will have to sign a confidentiality clause in order to enter the group. During telehealth&#xD;
      calls and focus groups, only the first name of the participants will be used.&#xD;
