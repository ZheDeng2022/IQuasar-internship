      The study adopted the design of multi-center, randomized, double-blind, positive control&#xD;
      drug, superiority test, using the double-blind double-simulating skills. The qualified&#xD;
      subjects, according to the ratio of 1:1, were randomized into experimental group and positive&#xD;
      drug control group and received a treatment course of 4 weeks, all individuals were followed&#xD;
      up for 4 weeks after drug withdrawal.&#xD;

             RUCAM causality scale score is more than or equal to 6 points. If the RUCAM causality&#xD;
             scale score is 3~5, the subject needs three liver disease experts to confirm whether&#xD;
             he is DILI patient, meanwhile, at least two of three liver disease experts should have&#xD;
             the same judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The serum ALT is between 5 and 20 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Liver biochemical indexes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, TBiL, albumin, prothrombin time)&#xD;
             abnormalities lasted no more than 90 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients can understand the nature of the experiment, the nature of the disease, the&#xD;
             characteristic of drugs, related treatment methods, and the risk they may need to bear&#xD;
             if they participate in the test and sign the informed consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Liver injury is caused by other reasons, such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver&#xD;
             disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, etc.;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with acute or subacute liver failure; patients with acute liver failure or&#xD;
             liver decompensation, such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, albumin is less than&#xD;
             normal value, prothrombin time compared with normal control extended for more than 3&#xD;
             seconds;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Serum creatinine is more than 1.5 times ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe or life-threatening heart, lung, brain, kidney, gastrointestinal and systemic&#xD;
             diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Simultaneous application of drugs that affect the efficacy of this trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Allergy or intolerance to experimental drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. With no ability to express their complaints, such as mental illness and severe&#xD;
             neurosis patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient can not cooperate and poor compliance;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant and lactating women or women preparing for pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient participated in other clinical trials in 3 months before entering this&#xD;
             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Using other liver-protective drugs except ursodeoxycholic acid or ademetionine within&#xD;
             last 3 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The researchers consider not suitable.&#xD;
