  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a combined phase 1 and 2 study in 66 subjects, male or female, between 7-21 years of&#xD;
      age that have recently (&lt; 6 months) been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The first phase 1&#xD;
      part of the study includes six subjects openly receiving allogeneic Wharton's jelly derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stromal cells as the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) Protrans, three&#xD;
      each in the age ranges 7-11 and 12-18.The second part is a randomized, double-blinded&#xD;
      placebo-controlled phase 2 study in parallel design comparing allogeneic Wharton's jelly&#xD;
      derived mesenchymal stromal cells treatment (as Protrans) to placebo in children and&#xD;
      adolescent subjects (7-21 years of age) diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study will be to investigate the safety, tolerance and efficacy after an&#xD;
      allogieneic infusion of Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells.&#xD;

             hepatitis B antigen (subjects with serology consistent with previous vaccination and a&#xD;
             history of vaccination are acceptable), or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with any systemic immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with a known demyelinating disease or with symptoms or physical examination&#xD;
             findings consistent with possible demyelinating disease.&#xD;
