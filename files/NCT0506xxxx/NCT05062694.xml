  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the literature there is still debate about the concept of central sensitization, as a pain&#xD;
      mechanism that can support a neuromusculoskeletal pathology and which for Woolf corresponds&#xD;
      to an amplification of neural signaling within the Central Nervous System causing&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mechanism is often confused with the concept of chronic pain, as in many conditions such&#xD;
      as fibromyalgia, traumatic neck pain, low back pain or osteoarthritis, central sensitization&#xD;
      supports its maintenance beyond 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe it is important to investigate among Italian physiotherapists the management of&#xD;
      the patient in which the presence of a central pain sensitization phenomenon is suspected, in&#xD;
      order to provide consistent data to direct the education of health professionals towards more&#xD;
      effective management of this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this goal we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a Delphi study in order to reach consensus, into a panel of experts, on the&#xD;
           methods useful for the management, in each phase of the physiotherapy process, of the&#xD;
           patient with neuromusculoskeletal problems with pain underlying central sensitization&#xD;
           mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate, through a survey among Italian physiotherapists, their clinical approach to&#xD;
           the patient in question&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a free online course available to clinical professionals and/or students who&#xD;
           wish to deepen this issue.&#xD;
