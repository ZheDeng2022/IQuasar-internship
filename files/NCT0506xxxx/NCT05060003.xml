  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's hypothesis is that patients with stage II melanoma who test positive for&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA are at a higher risk for recurrence and therefore adjuvant treatment is&#xD;
      justified. In this study, the blood of consenting and eligible patients will be tested for&#xD;
      ctDNA and those patients who test positive will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either&#xD;
      treatment with atezolizumab and tiragolumab or atezolizumab alone during Stage 1 of the&#xD;
      study. If at least 3 patients in the atezolizumab + tiragolumab arm are shown to be ctDNA&#xD;
      negative at C3D1, stage 2 of the study will begin enrollment. Stage 2 consists of 25 patients&#xD;
      all enrolled to the atezolizumab + tiragolumab arm (no randomization and no atezolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy arm).Patients who test negative for ctDNA will be observed off protocol.&#xD;
