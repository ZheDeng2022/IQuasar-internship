  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with advanced head and neck cancer, skin cancer, or non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. People can take part if previous treatments were not successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out how a medicine called BI 765063 is taken up in the&#xD;
      tumours and how it gets distributed in the body. In addition to BI 765063, participants also&#xD;
      receive ezabenlimab. BI 765063 and ezabenlimab are antibodies that may help the immune system&#xD;
      fight cancer. Such therapies are also called immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants get BI 765063 and ezabenlimab as an infusion into a vein every 3 weeks. In the&#xD;
      first weeks, doctors check how BI 765063 is taken up in tumours. To do so, the doctors use&#xD;
      imaging methods (PET/CT scans). For this, participants get BI 765063 injected in a labelled&#xD;
      form up to 2 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate&#xD;
      it. The doctors regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.&#xD;
