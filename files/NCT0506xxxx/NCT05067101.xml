  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is a common malignant tumor of the urinary system, radical resection plus&#xD;
      urinary diversion is the first choice of treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;
      Urinary diversion of surgical options related to patient' survival and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2000, professor Chunxiao Liu invented &quot;detaenial sigmoid neobladder&quot;, this surgical method&#xD;
      overset the traditional intestinal detubularization approach, which detached the serosal&#xD;
      layer with smooth muscle from the bowel without split it. This kind of neobladder is easier&#xD;
      to construct and have less impact on intestinal function. So far, it has been implemented for&#xD;
      more than 700 cases in Zhujiang hospital, the age of patients range from 9 months (bladder&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma) to 88 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The filed of standard radical bladder cancer resection includes the structure of the prostate&#xD;
      and seminal vesicles. More and more studies and long-term clinical experience in our hospital&#xD;
      have confirmed that capsule sparing cystectomy can achieve good tumor control and excellent&#xD;
      functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project is going to perform a randomized controlled trial for capsule sparing cystectomy&#xD;
      and conventional radical cystoprostatectomy and look forward to assess the cncology outcome&#xD;
      and functional recovery of these two procedures which provide an objective basis for the&#xD;
      patients undergoing orthotopic urinary diversion in the future.&#xD;

      CSC group：patients undergoing transurethral resection and enucleation of the prostate first,&#xD;
      do not open the bladder neck to maintain the integrity of the bladder neck. The enucleated&#xD;
      prostate capsule is preserved under laparoscopic surgery, and the urinary catheter is&#xD;
      stretched during the operation to avoid implantation and metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC group：patients undergoing conventional radical cystoprostatectomy. All the patients&#xD;
      undergoing detaenial sigmoid neobladder after cystectomy and accept at least 36 months follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followup: Each patient was evaluated at 3-month intervals for 1 year, at 6- month intervals&#xD;
      for 2 to 3 years. Renal ultrasound, biochemical examination and urine culture were done every&#xD;
      3 to 6 months. Pelvic computerized tomography and retro-cystogram were performed 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively and annually thereafter. Urodynamic investigation and cystoscopic examination&#xD;
      were done annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications were classified as early (90 days or less) and late (greater than&#xD;
      90 days). Early and late complications were subdivided into those related and not related to&#xD;
      the neobladder. Complication grade was classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system.&#xD;
      Major complications were defined as grade III or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daytime and nighttime continence levels were recorded postoperatively at patient interview.&#xD;
      Continence was defined as complete if the patient was dry without a pad, satisfactory if no&#xD;
      more than 1 pad was required and poor if the patient used more than 1 pad during the day or&#xD;
      night.&#xD;
