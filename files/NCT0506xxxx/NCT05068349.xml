  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, single-arm, the real world of clinical trials. The researchers&#xD;
      plan to recruit 300 eligible patients. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of butylphthalide in the treatment of ischemic stroke, and to&#xD;
      establish a population pharmacokinetic model of butylphthalide in elderly patients to explore&#xD;
      its blood drug concentration. Correlation with its efficacy and adverse reactions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is one of the diseases that seriously threaten human health, with the&#xD;
      characteristics of high incidence, high disability and high recurrence rate. Patients will&#xD;
      not only suffer from impaired physical function, but also mental symptoms, social function&#xD;
      and other obstacles, which seriously affect the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Butylphthalide can improve the damage of central nervous system in patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, and can promote the improvement of patients with neurological deficits.&#xD;
      Regarding the treatment of ischemic stroke with butylphthalide, there is still a lack of big&#xD;
      data research based on real-world efficacy and safety; there is a lack of data on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of elderly patients and their correlation with adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is estimated that 300 patients will be enrolled and given intravenous butylphthalide&#xD;
      sodium chloride injection 25mg twice a day for 7-14 days, and then oral butylphthalide soft&#xD;
      capsule 0.2g three times a day for 76-83 days. The patients will be collected for experiment&#xD;
      before and after treatment. Laboratory data, electrocardiogram, NIHSS, mRS, combined&#xD;
      medication and adverse events, etc., to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      butylphthalide in the treatment of ischemic stroke. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      model of butylphthalide in elderly patients was established for 50 of them.&#xD;

    <description>NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) to assess the degree of neurological deficit in stroke patients. The score ranges from 0 to 42 points, the higher the score, the more severe the nerve damage. Patients with a baseline assessment of&gt; 16 points are likely to die, while those with a score of &lt;6 are likely to recover well; for each additional point, the probability of a good prognosis is reduced by 17%</description>

    <description>Modified Rankin scale (mRS) is an indicator of the efficacy of functional disability. The score ranges from 0 to 5 points, and the clinical score will be increased to 6 points to indicate death. The higher the score, the more disability the patient is.</description>
