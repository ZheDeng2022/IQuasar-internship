  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-hundred and fifty-nine patients undergoing Nissen fundoplication for symptomatic&#xD;
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), who had a concomitant hiatal hernia of &gt; 2 cm axial&#xD;
      length, were previously randomized to closure of the diaphragmatic hiatus with either crural&#xD;
      sutures alone or tension-free closure with a non-absorbable mesh. Primary outcome variable&#xD;
      was the incidence of radiologically verified recurrent hiatal hernia 3 years after the&#xD;
      surgery and secondary outcomes were dysphagia score, reflux control and quality of life. The&#xD;
      study showed no differences between the groups regarding hiatal hernia recurrence but higher&#xD;
      dysphagia scores for solid food at 3 years in mesh group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a long-term follow-up (&gt;10 years) after surgery for hiatal hernia by&#xD;
      tension-free mesh closure or simple suturing.&#xD;

The same dysphagia scoring was also used in a previous rct, from the same institution, comparing different types of antireflux procedures in open surgery.</description>
