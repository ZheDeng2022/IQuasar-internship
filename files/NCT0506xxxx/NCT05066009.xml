  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a within subject's assessment of whether a novel wearable technology, NextSense&#xD;
      electroencephalography earbuds (EEGBuds), is able to detect differences in onset to sleep&#xD;
      from wake versus in-laboratory, gold-standard electroencephalography (EEG) utilized as part&#xD;
      of a standard four trial Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) at medicated baseline versus&#xD;
      free of prescribed medications for promoting wake (random order).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detection of &quot;sleepiness&quot; has for more than four decades relied upon methods that acquire the&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) from multiple surface electrodes applied to the scalp and hardware&#xD;
      that amplifies and stores information on a central processing unit (CPU). There are&#xD;
      substantial limitations to this methodology beyond the fact that it is time, labor, and cost&#xD;
      intensive. Such procedures restrict a subject's freedom of movement and necessitate that&#xD;
      patients are monitored by trained staff in an accredited laboratory which levies substantial&#xD;
      time and financial burdens upon patients and families. Finally, the test-re-test reliability&#xD;
      and utility of testing paradigms reliant solely on an EEG 'signature' to detect statistically&#xD;
      meaningful - let alone clinically meaningful - changes is dubious, and has come under&#xD;
      increased scrutiny.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess whether novel wearable technology (NextSense EEGBuds and/or Ellcie&#xD;
      Healthy Glasses) are able to detect differences in onset to sleep in patients diagnosed as&#xD;
      having one of the central disorders of hypersomnolence (e.g., narcolepsy type 1 or type 2, or&#xD;
      idiopathic hypersomnia) while using their prescribed wake promoting medication(s) versus&#xD;
      while they are not medicated, and how it's sensitivity compares to differences as detected by&#xD;
      the standard MWT. The two study visits will occur within 16 days of one another.&#xD;

    <description>Sleep onset latency is the time in minutes it takes to transition from wakefulness to sleep. Within-individual change in the mean onset to sleep will be assessed from the two MWT sessions performed as detected by NextSense EEGBuds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraclass correlation between measurement methods</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 days</time_frame>
    <description>The coefficient of intraclass correlation (ICC) between the individual sleep onset latencies as derived by NextSense EEGBuds vs. those revealed by gold standard EEG and conventional scoring. Higher correlation values (typically 0.75 to 1.00) indicate greater agreement between the measurements.</description>

    <description>Each NextSense EEGBud device comes with a custom-fit earmold with biometric sensors to detect the EEG, motion (via tri-axial accelerometers), and heart rate. A unique custom mold is created employing a 3D printer to capture the geometry of a patients' ear and external auditory canal with a ring laser scanner to an accuracy of within 0.1 mm. This design process allows for a custom fit, and therefore both comfort and complete, consistent contact with the inner surface of the ear canal, providing high quality signal capture of brain activity, and head and eye movements.</description>
