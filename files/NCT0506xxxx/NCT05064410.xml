    <measure>Change in Knowledge Related to Colorectal Cancer Risk, Prevention, and Screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately following intervention, at 3 months and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pre and post assessment surveys completed by participants will consist of 14 questions assessing knowledge of CRC, risk factors, and screening options and recommendations. Assessments also include 5 questions to determine intentions to change screening/health behaviors, speaking to one's healthcare provider about screening, getting screened, and talking with family/friends about CRC and CRC screening.&#xD;
3-month follow up survey consists of 5 sections to determine CRC knowledge, screening behavior since baseline, future screening plans, talking with family and friends about CRC screening, and behavior changes in eating habits and physical activity since partaking in the educational session.&#xD;
6-month survey consists of 5 questions about screening since the 3-month follow up survey. Those needing to complete the 6-month follow up survey are those that were screened at the time of the 3-month follow-up but had not received final diagnostic results.</description>

    <description>The Community Health Educator (CHE) will provide online colorectal cancer (CRC) early detection, prevention, and screening education to increase knowledge of CRC and the importance of screening. These sessions will be conducted virtually within a group format or one-on-one via phone. Additionally, the CHE will provide information regarding FIT kit and colonoscopy screening and the screening process for attendees. The CHE and research assistant will be prepared to provide access to screening resources and services through participants' existing coverage. Those participants who do not have a primary care provider will be provided information on obtaining FIT kits through the mechanisms of the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and/or a colonoscopy through the cancer center on a case by case basis.</description>

    <description>The colorectal cancer (CRC) educational activities will include the use of NCI CRC resources and materials, including a PowerPoint presentation, and CRC educational models and displays. The CRC education will be delivered in Spanish and English, and will consist of pre and post knowledge assessments including screening and behavioral intention questions. The educational intervention will take approximately 45 minutes-1 hour.</description>
