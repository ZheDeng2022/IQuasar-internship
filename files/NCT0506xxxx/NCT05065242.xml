  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose with this investigation was to increase access to cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) by examining CBT-I delivered through a smartphone application&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim that will be addressed is to explore the efficacy of the smartphone delivered&#xD;
      CBT-I on overall insomnia and on nighttime symptoms by comparing CBT-I to a waitlist control&#xD;
      in a randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to investigate the effect smartphone delivered CBT-I compared to the&#xD;
      waitlist on secondary outcomes related to insomnia, such as stress, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      quality of life and functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim that will be addressed is to examine what patient characteristics that CBT&#xD;
      delivered to a smartphone depend on to be effective with a treatment-moderator strategy. To&#xD;
      investigate moderators, the following moderators will be assessed; age, gender, occupational&#xD;
      status, level of education, initial insomnia severity, dysfunction, medication use, chronic&#xD;
      pain, somatic/psychiatric co-morbidity, and proposed behavioral mediators of sleep&#xD;
      restriction and stimulus control will also be employed as moderators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth aim that will be addressed is to examine behavioural processes of sleep&#xD;
      restriction and stimulus control as potential mediators of treatment outcome.&#xD;
