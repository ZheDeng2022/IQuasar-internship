  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effects of two versions of 10 high intensity&#xD;
      interval trainings (HIIT) within a 7-day shock microcycle on endurance performance,&#xD;
      well-being, health, stress and recovery in trained athletes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-six trained endurance athletes will be recruited and randomly assigned to either a&#xD;
      &quot;high volume (HIIT-HV)&quot; group, a &quot;low volume (HIIT-LV)&quot; group, or a control group. All&#xD;
      participants will be monitored before (9 days), during (7 days), and after (14 days) a 7-day&#xD;
      training intervention, for 30 days. Participants in both intervention groups will complete 10&#xD;
      HIIT sessions within the period of 7 days, with an additional 30 minutes of low-intensity&#xD;
      training exclusively in HIIT-HV. HIIT sessions consist of aerobic HIIT, i.e., 5x4min at&#xD;
      90-95% of maximal heart rate interspersed by 2.5 min active recovery periods. To determine&#xD;
      the effects of the intervention, performance diagnostics, and a 5 kilometer time trial will&#xD;
      be conducted before and after the intervention. In addition, participants are closely&#xD;
      monitored for general health, stress, fatigue, recovery, neuromuscular performance, executive&#xD;
      functions and sleep.&#xD;
