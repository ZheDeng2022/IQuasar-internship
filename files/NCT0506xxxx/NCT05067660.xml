      The TASTEPRO pilot trial evaluates the feasibility of PSMA PET-CT (Computer tomography)&#xD;
      targeted stereotactic radiation therapy (SABR) in management of lymph node positive prostate&#xD;
      cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted SABR is compared to current standard; template-based salvage radiation therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators expect SABR to be of equal or better oncological outcome compared to the&#xD;
      standard therapy with less radiation-induced side-effects. Results of the pilot trial will be&#xD;
      used when designing larger trials on oncological efficacy and safety of PSMA PET-CT targeted&#xD;
      SABR.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed in men and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer death after lung cancer. Out of an estimated 1.1 million cancers diagnosed&#xD;
      worldwide in 2012, prostate cancer accounted for approximately 15% of all cancer cases. The&#xD;
      incidence of prostate cancer around the globe varies widely, being the highest in North&#xD;
      America and northwestern Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Society of Urological Pathology (2014) divides prostate cancer into three&#xD;
      risk groups, consisting of low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancers.&#xD;
      Determining factors include the PSA-level, Gleason Score, and the extent of the primary tumor&#xD;
      according to the TNM classification. The treatment modality of choice for prostate cancer&#xD;
      depends on the risk-group. Low-risk prostate cancers are primarily managed conservatively,&#xD;
      and the aim is to reduce over-treatment. This so-called deferred treatment includes the&#xD;
      concepts of active surveillance and watchful waiting. Active surveillance is suitable for&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with a localized and well-differentiated prostate cancer with a low risk&#xD;
      of progression. Patients remain under close surveillance and the treatment intent is&#xD;
      curative, as active treatment is initiated if changes in biopsy results or a T-stage&#xD;
      progression occur. Watchful waiting is a palliative approach for patients with an estimated&#xD;
      life expectancy below 10 years. These patients are treated symptomatically in order to&#xD;
      maintain the best possible quality of life. Intermediate-risk prostate cancers are commonly&#xD;
      treated operatively or with radiotherapy. Patients with high-risk prostate cancer show an&#xD;
      increased risk of metastatic progression and death from the disease. Consensus regarding&#xD;
      optimal treatment of high-risk prostate cancer does not thus far exist. Treatment options for&#xD;
      localized disease include operative radical prostatectomy with subsequent pelvic lymph node&#xD;
      dissection. A further therapy option for high-risk localized prostate cancer is the&#xD;
      external-beam radiation therapy in combination with long-term androgen deprivation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing PSA recurrence is common after primarily curative radical prostatectomy or&#xD;
      radiotherapy, occurring in 27%-53% of all patients. A rising PSA-level after curative-intent&#xD;
      therapy may precede metastatic progression. The threshold for a clinically relevant PSA&#xD;
      relapse depends on the primary treatment. A PSA rise of &gt; 0.4 ng/ml after radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy is considered as the best threshold prediction for further metastases, although&#xD;
      further studies suggest a cut point for a PSA-relapse at &gt; 0.2 ng/ml. After primary&#xD;
      radiotherapy, a PSA rise of â‰¥ 2 ng/mL higher than the nadir (absolute lowest PSA level)&#xD;
      achieved through the therapy is considered a PSA relapse. A rapid PSA-doubling time of under&#xD;
      three months or a PSA recurrence within the first three years indicates a high risk of&#xD;
      metastasis. On the contrary, a PSA-relapse more than three years after surgery or a PSA&#xD;
      doubling time of over 12 months correlates with a low risk of metastases. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      evident that the speed of PSA relapse after treatment correlates with the aggressiveness of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that the enzyme Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) could be used as a&#xD;
      tumor marker for prostate cancer. TK1 is an enzyme involved in the DNA synthesis and its&#xD;
      expression correlates with active cellular proliferation. A study by Murtola et al (2020)&#xD;
      found that serum TK1 levels were significantly elevated in metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
      compared to non-metastatic cases. High serum TK1 levels were also identified as a predictor&#xD;
      of prostate cancer specific and overall mortality. Further research is required to determine&#xD;
      whether TK1 could be included in the prostate cancer risk stratification and influence the&#xD;
      planning of optimal treatment and surveillance. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a further&#xD;
      marker which has demonstrated potential in detecting disease recurrence. ctDNA originates&#xD;
      from degenerate tumor cells and can be detected in plasma. ctDNA can be used to estimate&#xD;
      disease burden and has prognostic value in metastatic prostate cancer. A study by Lau et al&#xD;
      (2020) found that patients with positive tumor ctDNA experienced rapid disease recurrence and&#xD;
      progression compared to patients without detectable ctDNA, suggesting that ctDNA could&#xD;
      potentially predict patients at highest risk for relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a clinically relevant PSA relapse, the presence of metastases and the&#xD;
      progression of the disease are commonly assessed with an abdominopelvic computer tomography&#xD;
      (CT) as well as a skeletal scintigraphy. Advanced prostate cancer metastasizes primarily in&#xD;
      the local pelvic lymph nodes and axial skeleton. Studies suggest, however, that only 11-14%&#xD;
      of patients with a PSA-relapse show a positive CT-scan. Furthermore, the probability of a&#xD;
      positive bone scan after radical prostatectomy is below 5% if the PSA-level is under 7 ng/ml.&#xD;
      This indicates that conventional imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to detect&#xD;
      metastases at early stages and low PSA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising detection rates of metastases at low PSA-levels have been shown by the&#xD;
      prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-CT imaging. PSMA is a glycoprotein&#xD;
      overexpressed on the cell surface of prostate cancer cells which can be bound by radiolabeled&#xD;
      small molecules, enabling whole-body tumor specific imaging with PET-CT. PSMA PET-CT is thus&#xD;
      a state-of-the-art imaging method capable of detecting lesions of prostate cancer more&#xD;
      accurately than any other clinically available imaging method. A number of recent studies&#xD;
      show that PSMA PET-CT is particularly effective in detecting cases of recurrent cancer.&#xD;
      Further research is required, however, to determine whether the increased sensitivity of the&#xD;
      PSMA PET-CT in localizing metastases could improve the clinical outcome. It is currently&#xD;
      unclear to which extent PSMA PET imaging results should influence the choice of treatment&#xD;
      modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease recurrence after primary curative-intent treatment is commonly managed with salvage&#xD;
      radiation therapy. To achieve the best results from salvage radiotherapy, research suggests&#xD;
      that the PSA-level should be below 0.5 ng/ml, or preferably even lower at the start of&#xD;
      treatment. Early salvage radiotherapy before a PSA-relapse &gt; 0.5 ng/ml leads to an&#xD;
      undetectable PSA-level in more than 60% of men. Furthermore, the treatment delays the need&#xD;
      for androgen deprivation therapy by 12-14 months. Salvage therapy is usually directed to the&#xD;
      prostate bed as well as the iliac and obturator lymph nodes. Due to the poor sensitivity of&#xD;
      conventional imaging techniques, salvage radiation therapy is commonly delivered with a&#xD;
      uniform dose without histological proof of the local recurrence. The optimal salvage&#xD;
      radiotherapy dose has not been clearly defined. The USA Guideline Panel regards 64-65 Gy as&#xD;
      the minimum dose, whereas the European Association of Urology recommends at least 66 Gy for&#xD;
      salvage radiotherapy. A dose escalation beyond 72-76 Gy significantly increases the risk of&#xD;
      severe side effects, even with newer treatment techniques. Despite the possibility of a cure&#xD;
      for patients with prostate cancer relapse, notable side-effects of the treatment include&#xD;
      increased irritative symptoms of the lower urinary tract and rectum. Additionally, for men&#xD;
      primarily managed with prostatectomy, the risk of urinary incontinence rises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a highly focused radiation treatment that&#xD;
      concentrates an intense dose of radiation on the recurrent tumorous lesion while limiting the&#xD;
      dose to healthy surrounding tissues. A recent study by Phillips et al (2020) concluded that&#xD;
      SABR improves progression-free survival, induces a systemic immune response and delays the&#xD;
      initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Thus, it is a promising treatment approach for&#xD;
      men with recurrent hormone-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer. PSMA PET-CT may prove&#xD;
      to be a promising standard imaging technique, allowing targeted treatment of recurring&#xD;
      lesions with SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TASTEPRO pilot trial evaluates the feasibility of PSMA PET-CT targeted SABR radiation&#xD;
      therapy in management of lymph node positive disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
      The investigators expect targeted SABR to be of equal or better oncological outcome compared&#xD;
      to the template-based conventional salvage therapy. Furthermore, the trial seeks to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the targeted SABR radiation would reduce treatment toxicity and adverse side effects,&#xD;
      leading to improved quality of life. Results of the pilot trial will be used when designing&#xD;
      larger trials on oncological efficacy and safety of PSMA PET-CT targeted SABR.&#xD;
