  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of adapting the National Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program (NDPP) to include recreational sports in effort to increase physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) and promote lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of developing Type&#xD;
      2 Diabetes Mellitus. The hypothesis is that both the traditional NDPP and the NDPP+&#xD;
      Basketball will be considered feasible. The primary outcome is to assess whether the&#xD;
      intervention (NDPP+BB) compared to the standard of care (NDPP only) will result in greater&#xD;
      weight loss, lower A1c, and increased engagement in physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NDPP has successfully helped to reduce the rate of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)&#xD;
      through moderate weight loss and increased physical activity(PA). Kaiser Permanente Georgia&#xD;
      (KPGA) members, identified as being at risk to develop type 2 diabetes will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in the intervention trial testing DPP vs. NDPP+ BB study arms. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized into 1 of 2 groups (traditional DPP curriculum or DPP + basketball).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of adapting the NDPP to&#xD;
      include recreational basketball as an exercise component among KPGA population of overweight,&#xD;
      pre-diabetic adults ages 18-44 using novel translational science approach and qualitative&#xD;
      formative research tools. The secondary objective is to implement the adapted NDPP + BB&#xD;
      program among a pre-diabetic KPGA adult members, 18-44 years living in Atlanta and determine&#xD;
      post-program efficacy in achieving the desired 5 percent weight loss goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to contribute beneficial information to clinical and operational leaders&#xD;
      across KP and beyond, as they consider approaches to improve overall participation rates in&#xD;
      the NDPP, particularly for young and middle-aged adult members, leveraging interest in a&#xD;
      popular recreational team-based sport such as BB. Longer-term, the goal is to reduce diabetes&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is interventional Efficacy trial for people at risk for type 2 diabetes. Participants will be randomized into the traditional DPP curriculum or DPP + basketball. Certified NDPP coaches will deliver the curriculum.The Traditional arm will receive the standard NDPP curriculum. The intervention arm will receive the NDPP curriculum and participate in group based exercise sessions. Both groups will submit weekly activity reports.&#xD;
Group evaluations are based on the percentage of participants achieving 5% weight loss at 12-months; self-reported dietary intake, physical activity and sleep time, HbA1c, fasting glucose, body composition, blood pressure, aerobic fitness, musculoskeletal fitness, quality of life, self-efficacy, motivation and depression symptoms at 12-months. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6 months, and at 12-months from study initiation. An additional 24-month measurement will be conducted to determine sustainability of program effects.</intervention_model_description>
