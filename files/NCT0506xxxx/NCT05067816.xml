  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the processes by which a previously proven&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention (the Med-South Lifestyle Program) can most effectively and efficiently&#xD;
      be translated into public health and clinical practice to positively impact chronic disease&#xD;
      risk reduction among mostly minority, rural, and medically underserved populations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Although lifestyle behavior change interventions are widely recommended to improve&#xD;
      health, they are not being implemented sufficiently or equitably on a national scale,&#xD;
      particularly in rural communities. The research team has developed and tested multiple&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions, which have culminated in the Med-South Lifestyle Program (MSLP), an&#xD;
      evidence-based behavior change intervention that translates the Prevention with Mediterranean&#xD;
      Diet (PREDIMED) dietary pattern for a Southeastern US population and includes support for&#xD;
      increased physical activity. In this research, the investigators propose to identify the most&#xD;
      effective and efficient way to scale-up the MSLP for use in public health and clinical&#xD;
      practices settings so that it reaches minority, rural, and medically underserved populations.&#xD;
      In Phase 2, the investigators will apply an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to&#xD;
      compare two formats for scaling up MSLP on implementation outcomes (primary aim) and confirm&#xD;
      the MSLP's impact on behavioral and clinical outcomes (secondary aim).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Phase II participants include: staff at 20 rural North Carolina sites (10&#xD;
      health departments and 10 federally qualified health centers) and participants from each site&#xD;
      (15 each, 300 total)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Test the effects of scaling up MSLP using two different formats. Using&#xD;
      an effectiveness-implementation hybrid Type 3 design, the investigators will randomize 20&#xD;
      sites (10 health departments and 10 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)) to 1 of 2&#xD;
      formats for delivering scale up strategies: distance (webinar and phone) vs. a blended&#xD;
      in-person/distance collaborative format. Each site will collect data on 15 patients (n=300).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Site level: compare the relative effects of the 2 scale-up formats on implementation&#xD;
      outcomes (reach, acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, and cost).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Participant-level: assess changes in behavioral and clinical outcomes: (1)&#xD;
      self-reported diet and physical activity and (2) weight from baseline to follow-up (4 and 10&#xD;
      months). Compare outcomes across the 2 scale-up delivery formats.&#xD;

    <description>Mean difference in minutes of physical activity per week (baseline activity in minutes/week - follow-up activity in minutes/week) as measured by the validated modified RESIDE questionnaire. The RESIDE questionnaire is a 21-item self-administered instrument in which participants recall the frequency, duration, and destination of their walking (for transport and recreation) within and outside of their neighborhood, and cycling activity in a usual week. Higher scores indicate more minutes of activity.</description>

    <description>The Med-South Lifestyle Program (MSLP) is an evidence-based behavior change intervention that translates the PREDIMED (Mediterranean) dietary pattern for a southeastern US population and includes support for increased physical activity. To promote healthy dietary intake and increased physical activity, the intervention incorporates theory-based behavioral approaches targeting self-efficacy, self-regulation, and internal motivation. The MSLP is delivered in 4 monthly counseling sessions with 3 interim phone follow-up contacts. A maintenance phase lasting 6 months follows the 4-month MSLP and includes 2 phone contacts about 2 months apart. Participants are counseled individually, with 2 in-person counseling visits (at the 1st and 4th counseling visit) and 5 total phone contacts. Each participant is provided with program materials in a participant manual, a cookbook, and a local resource manual identifying community resources to support making targeted behavior changes.</description>
