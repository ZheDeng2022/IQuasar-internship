  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a virtual, patient-centric, observational study that will follow approximately 60&#xD;
      participants for up to 8 weeks following initiation of Remodulin therapy via their&#xD;
      UTC-developed next generation infusion pump and consists of remote and electronic assessments&#xD;
      administered to patient via the uMotifÂ® data capture platform at Study Enrollment, Day 1 (or&#xD;
      Combined Study Enrollment/Day 1, if applicable), Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8 or Early&#xD;
      Withdrawal (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 2 cohorts of PAH patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. De Novo Cohort: patients new to parenteral prostacyclin-class therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transition Cohort: patients who are currently receiving SC Remodulin therapy via a&#xD;
           previous generation infusion pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The De Novo Cohort will initiate subcutaneous (SC) Remodulin via a next generation infusion&#xD;
      pump as prescribed by their healthcare professional. Participants will be followed from time&#xD;
      of enrollment to up to 8 weeks after Day 1 (ie, start of infusion of Remodulin via a next&#xD;
      generation infusion pump) or until discontinuation of Remodulin (early withdrawal), whichever&#xD;
      comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Transition Cohort will continue to receive Remodulin as prescribed by their healthcare&#xD;
      professional via their current (ie, previous generation) infusion pump until transitioning to&#xD;
      delivery of Remodulin via a next generation infusion pump. Participants will be followed from&#xD;
      time of enrollment to up to 8 weeks after Day 1 (ie, first day patient transitions to&#xD;
      delivery of Remodulin via a next generation infusion pump) or until discontinuation of&#xD;
      Remodulin (early withdrawal), whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of study assessments at Week 8 or Early Withdrawal (if applicable),&#xD;
      participants will continue Remodulin therapy via their infusion pump at their prescriber's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
