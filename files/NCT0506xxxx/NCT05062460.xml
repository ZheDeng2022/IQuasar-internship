  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if in patients with gestational diabetes (GDM),&#xD;
      adherence to postprandial glucose monitoring differs when performed 1-hour versus 2-hours&#xD;
      after eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate difference in rate of adherence (binary&#xD;
      outcome defined as &lt;80% or ≥80% of glucose log completed) between gestational diabetics who&#xD;
      perform 1-hour versus 2-hour postprandial blood glucose testing.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consented patients who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes will be randomized to either&#xD;
      1-hour or 2-hour postprandial blood glucose monitoring. A retrospective chart review from&#xD;
      July 2020 until study commencement for patients from the same clinic will be used as a&#xD;
      historical control group. This study will assess differences in adherence to testing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients with singleton gestation who are ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of GDM after 24 0/7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For diagnosing GDM, a two-step screening algorithm will be performed according to the&#xD;
             American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists.4 Specifically, a 1-hour 50-g&#xD;
             glucose-loading test is given first. Plasma glucose levels between 140 and 200 mg/dL&#xD;
             will be considered elevated. Confirmatory testing will then be performed using a&#xD;
             3-hour 100-g glucose tolerance test. Diagnosis was made when two of the four values&#xD;
             were elevated. Abnormal glucose value thresholds are established via the criteria&#xD;
             suggested by Carpenter and Coustan: fasting value ≥ 95 mg/dL, 1-hour ≥ 180 mg/dL,&#xD;
             2-hour ≥ 155 mg/dL, and 3-hour ≥ 140 mg/dL.9 Patients with a blood glucose level&#xD;
             greater than 200 mg/dL after 1-hour 50-g glucose-loading test will be diagnosed with&#xD;
             GDM without requirement for the 3-hour 100-g glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 1 pre-gestational diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 2 pre-gestational diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GDM diagnosed prior to 24 0/7 weeks gestation.&#xD;
