  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this multicentric, prospective and interventional study is to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of multimodal prehabilitation in patients aged 75 years or older with&#xD;
      surgical indication for coxarthrosis or severe gonarthrosis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a pre-established surgical preparation program in cooperation with&#xD;
      physiotherapists or physical activity instructors, dieticians, psychologists, physical&#xD;
      therapists and nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative program improves muscle strength, balance and walking of the study patients.&#xD;
      It also allows for faster and better recovery of their physical fitness and intellectual&#xD;
      abilities after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These interventions will be performed in day admission (DA) and at home and will consist of&#xD;
      training, a diet program to strengthen the muscles and balance of the patients participating&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will receive surgery for 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
      surgery, partly in a day hospital and partly at home, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle rehabilitation developed with a physiotherapist or physical activity instructor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional support (dietician at 1st, 3rd, and 6th day admission (DA), referring&#xD;
           geriatrician)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive and physical stimulation &quot;Exergame&quot; (Genious Healthcare); with only cognitive&#xD;
           exercises at home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological support by a psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information in the form of videos on the main risks and important points to know and&#xD;
           prepare before and after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 follow-up call per week made by the PRE4OS referent between each day admission (DA) to&#xD;
           assess patient satisfaction, any limitations encountered, possible exercises at home,&#xD;
           the occurrence of possible adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 hour per week home adapted physical activity session by the Siel Bleu association&#xD;
