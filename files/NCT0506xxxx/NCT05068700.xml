  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implementing capnography into practice for respiratory monitoring during sedation is&#xD;
      considered a high priority by leading authorities in Canada and internationally. The Canadian&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists' Society's position statement recommends that capnography should be&#xD;
      available wherever moderate or deep sedation is used. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges&#xD;
      (UK) Standard and Guidance report on Safe Sedation Practice for Healthcare Procedures noted&#xD;
      that while capnography is not a mandated practice, providers should consider implementing&#xD;
      capnography as a long term goal. These recommendations are in place because sedated patients&#xD;
      who are not monitored with capnography have frequent undetected, and therefore untreated,&#xD;
      respiratory depression. Of note, though, these guidelines do not provide specific&#xD;
      recommendations for how capnography should be implemented for nurse-administered sedation.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if smart alarm guided treatment of respiratory&#xD;
      depression using the Integrated Pulmonary Index is an effective way to implement capnography&#xD;
      during nurse-administered sedation. The primary outcome is the number of seconds in an alert&#xD;
      condition state without an intervention being applied. The IPI is intended to reduce the&#xD;
      cognitive burden of synthesizing multiple sources of physiological monitoring input and hence&#xD;
      lowering the threshold for triggering intervention by clinicians to support respiration. The&#xD;
      primary outcome directly measures this concept by quantifying the time taken for an alert to&#xD;
      trigger an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher values of the primary outcome will result from either a problem state that should have&#xD;
      triggered an intervention but did not, or an 'inappropriate' alert (i.e. an alert that was&#xD;
      not important enough to warrant immediate intervention.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hybrid effectiveness-implementation design will be used for this study, incorporating a&#xD;
      parallel cluster randomized trial. Capnography monitoring will be implemented as standard&#xD;
      practice for all patients undergoing procedures with nurse-administered sedation in the four&#xD;
      departments participating in the study, as per recommendations for procedural sedation in&#xD;
      Canada. Nurses working in the four departments will be invited to choose to participate in&#xD;
      the randomized controlled trial component of the study. If they choose to participate, they&#xD;
      will be randomized to use capnography either with or without the Integrated Pulmonary Index&#xD;
      (IPI) enabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be establishment and stability phases where the implementation of capnography&#xD;
      (with or without IPI enabled) into practice commences and is optimized through an audit and&#xD;
      feedback process. Data collection for the primary outcome will be undertaken during the&#xD;
      evaluation period. This design was chosen for two main reasons. First, it allows for the&#xD;
      establishment phase, which will provide the time required for the research team to&#xD;
      meaningfully engage with staff at each department and recruit nurses to participate in the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial component of the study. Second, the stability period will involve&#xD;
      sustained engagement with clinicians in the department, regardless of assignment, in order to&#xD;
      optimize the implementation of capnography monitoring (with or without the IPI enabled) into&#xD;
      practice using a facilitated audit and feedback process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation management and monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no restrictions on sedation dosing for this study. It is typical for a bolus&#xD;
      dose of 25-50mcg of fentanyl followed by 1-2mg of midazolam to be administered approximately&#xD;
      two to five minutes prior to procedure commencement. Further doses of 1mg midazolam and 25mcg&#xD;
      fentanyl are usually administered at the discretion of the proceduralist to maintain&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental oxygen is routinely applied for patients unless contraindicated by pre-existing&#xD;
      conditions, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The oxygen flow rate will&#xD;
      be adjusted as per direction from the proceduralist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of usual practice in these departments, all patients receive all aspects of standard&#xD;
      physiological monitoring including electrocardiography for heart rate and rhythm,&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure measurements taken at regular 5-10 minute intervals (or more&#xD;
      frequently if deemed required by nursing or medical staff) and continuous pulse oximetry.&#xD;
      Assessments of respiratory rate and depth, as well as level of consciousness, are taken at&#xD;
      regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally in this study, the standalone Capnostream 35p monitor (Medtronic) will be used.&#xD;
      It displays a capnography waveform as well as end-tidal CO2 and respiratory rate. A nasal&#xD;
      cannula or facemask that allows oral and nasal sampling of exhaled air as well as the&#xD;
      delivery of supplemental oxygen will be used (Medtronic). The nasal cannula or facemask will&#xD;
      be connected to the capnography monitoring device (Capnostream 35P, Medtronic). Nurses who&#xD;
      choose to participate in the randomized controlled trial component of this hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation study, will be randomized to use capnography with or without the&#xD;
      Integrated Pulmonary Index enabled. The IPI is a feature, which can be enabled in the&#xD;
      Capnostream 35p devices. Nurses who are *not* participating in the randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial component of the study will use capnography with or without the IPI feature enabled, at&#xD;
      their own discretion. The Capnostream 35p monitor also collects SpO2 and heart rate&#xD;
      measurements via pulse oximetry using a finger probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment and stability periods will be guided by recommendations for improving the&#xD;
      quality of clinical alarms from The Society for Critical Care Medicine Alarm and Alert&#xD;
      Fatigue Task Force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the establishment period, each department will be provided with 2 Capnostream 35p&#xD;
      monitors so that capnography monitoring can become part of routine practice for&#xD;
      nurse-administered sedation. At this time, the research team will assist with providing&#xD;
      education to nursing staff for capnography monitoring and the Integrated Pulmonary Index. The&#xD;
      principal investigator will provide an overview of the Capnostream 35p device and how to use&#xD;
      it, including the functionality of the Integrated Pulmonary Index. All nursing staff will be&#xD;
      provided with printed information about how to access a standardized education program&#xD;
      designed by Medtronic, which is certified for accreditation with the American Nurses&#xD;
      Credentialing Centre and American Association for Respiratory Care&#xD;
      (https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/clinical-education/catalog/healthstream-capnography&#xD;
      -standard-of-care-for-procedural-sedation-monitoring.html). Specifically, in this course&#xD;
      nurses will have access to education material covering topics including how to detect common&#xD;
      capnographic waveform abnormalities, which indicate sedation-induced alveolar&#xD;
      hypoventilation, and implement an appropriate intervention if indicated according to the&#xD;
      alert conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the stability period is to optimize the alarm conditions set for the Capnostream&#xD;
      35p devices prior to the evaluation period. We will undertake an audit and feedback process&#xD;
      for nurses choosing to participate in the randomized controlled trial component of the study.&#xD;
      The audit and feedback process will evaluate the performance characteristics of the alerts&#xD;
      triggered by the Capnostream 35p monitor (with or without IPI enabled depending on&#xD;
      randomization). Alert performance characteristics to be audited include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alarm burden (total number of alarms triggered by the Capnostream 35p).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of appropriate alarms (defined as an alarm that triggered an intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of inappropriate alarms (defined as alarms that were triggered but manually&#xD;
           dismissed by silencing the alarm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of alert conditions (defined as the total time that an alert condition was&#xD;
           active).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Assistant will need to be present during procedures to observe and record the&#xD;
      type of interventions implemented in response to capnography monitor alarms, as well as the&#xD;
      time that the intervention was observed. A web-based data collection tool has been designed&#xD;
      for this purpose (more detail is provided in the data collection section below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feedback of data collected during the audits for nurses who choose to participate in the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial will take an aggregated summary form per department. It will&#xD;
      further delineate alarm performance characteristics depending on whether or not the IPI was&#xD;
      enabled. The feedback will be presented on a webpage created for each department so that it&#xD;
      can be updated approximately weekly as new audits are performed. The link to the webpage will&#xD;
      be provided to nurses at the time of randomization. Access to the webpage will be restricted&#xD;
      to users through an email address with an organizational domain (i.e. uhn.ca). The webpage&#xD;
      will contain tabulated and other visual summaries of the audit data to highlight alarm&#xD;
      performance characteristics, such as the number and duration of appropriate and inappropriate&#xD;
      alarms, total alarms etc. In addition to the webpage, the Principal Investigator and/or&#xD;
      Research Assistant will present summary findings from the audits at departmental meetings at&#xD;
      least once per month to facilitate discussion amongst staff as to the appropriateness of&#xD;
      current alarm settings and if changes are indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alarm conditions set for the Capnostream 35p monitor can be revised at any time&#xD;
      throughout the study period at the discretion of the nurses based on insights from this audit&#xD;
      of performance characteristics. This is an implementation study, employing an audit and&#xD;
      feedback process to assist departmental staff to optimize capnography alarm settings (with or&#xD;
      without the IPI enabled).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alarm performance for the Capnostream 35p monitor, now optimized for each capnography&#xD;
      monitoring condition through the establishment and stability periods, will be compared&#xD;
      between nurses randomized to use capnography alone or with the Integrated Pulmonary Index&#xD;
      enabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant selection and enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to be used, all patients undergoing&#xD;
      procedures in the departments included in this study will receive capnography monitoring. We&#xD;
      anticipate that approximately 1200 patients will undergo procedures with capnography&#xD;
      monitoring across the departments during the study overall. The target sample size for the&#xD;
      evaluation period is 400 patient participants (sample size calculation presented in a section&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves only routinely collected clinical data and direct observation of nursing&#xD;
      responses to capnography monitor alarms. As such, consent from patients will not be sought.&#xD;
      The Tri-Council Policy Statement requires a study to fulfill conditions for waiver of&#xD;
      consent, including that the alteration to consent requirement is necessary to address the&#xD;
      research question. The integration of capnography monitoring with or without the IPI enabled&#xD;
      is planned to be optimized in this implementation study through an audit and feedback&#xD;
      process. As such, it will be impossible for individual patients to provide consent for&#xD;
      participation in this study prior to the initiation of implementation and optimization of&#xD;
      capnography into nurses routine care of sedated patients. In the 'evaluation' period&#xD;
      specifically, a Research Assistant will observe procedures being performed with nurses who&#xD;
      have chosen to participate in the randomized controlled trial component of the study on&#xD;
      randomly selected days of the week until the target sample size is reached. The Research&#xD;
      Assistant will be blinded to allocation status, as this is essential for studies that use&#xD;
      clustered randomized trial designs to reduce risk of selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves only routinely collected clinical data and direct observation of nursing&#xD;
      responses to capnography monitor alarms. During all phases ('establishment', 'stability' and&#xD;
      'evaluation'), we will retrospectively retrieve data recorded on the Capnostream 35p monitors&#xD;
      using the USB port. Specifically, the 'Real-time Full Continuous Transfer' report will be&#xD;
      downloaded. This report contains the real-time CO2 waveform plus real-time values of&#xD;
      parameters (EtCO2, SpO2, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and IPI) with 1-second resolution by&#xD;
      repeating numerical values for every 50ms along with the waveform. Other fields include the&#xD;
      patient type (adult), report generation date and time, alarm occurrences, equipment advisory&#xD;
      messages (eg. waveform not available, battery low, etc) and events entered into the monitor&#xD;
      by a clinician (medication administrations etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 'stability' and 'evaluation' periods, a Research Assistant will be present during&#xD;
      procedures to observe and record the type of interventions used, as well as the time that it&#xD;
      was observed. A web-based data collection tool has been designed for this purpose, which will&#xD;
      be accessed using an iPad. The times will be synced with the capnography monitoring device&#xD;
      (Capnostream 35p).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 'stability and 'evaluation' periods, standard demographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics will be collected by a Research Assistant. Procedural characteristics (type&#xD;
      and duration) and sedation characteristics (medication type and dosages) will be collected&#xD;
      for the purposes of the audit and feedback process in the 'stability' periods and for the&#xD;
      purposes of describing the participant characteristics in the evaluation period.&#xD;
