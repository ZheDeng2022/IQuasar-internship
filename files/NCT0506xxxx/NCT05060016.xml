      The main aim of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate safety and efficacy (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version&#xD;
           1.1 [RECIST 1.1] by investigator) of 2 dose levels of AMG 757 for Part 1 only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate anti-tumor activity of AMG 757 as determined by objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
           per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) for Part 1 and 2&#xD;
