  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To create a new patient reported outcome measure in the form of a questionnaire, which will&#xD;
      accurately reflect the profound impact that vulval dermatoses and vulval pain syndromes have&#xD;
      on patients' quality of life&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to create the proposed vulval specific patient reported outcome measure we will use&#xD;
      semi structured questionnaires and a focus group interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will be recruited through their attendance at a specialist vulval&#xD;
      dermatology clinic across two secondary care centres, by the direct patient care team.&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained at every stage and each patient will receive written&#xD;
      information in the form of a patient information leaflet as to why the research is being&#xD;
      conducted. Patients will be reassured that declining involvement in the research will have no&#xD;
      impact upon the quality of their care and that their involvement is entirely voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially fifty (50) follow up/new patients attending the specialist vulval clinic across two&#xD;
      sites will be invited to answer questionnaires on their attendance at clinic, which will ask&#xD;
      a number of open-ended questions about aspects of their vulval condition that may have&#xD;
      affected them. These questions have been devised by the research team based on professional&#xD;
      experience and the results of previous research, which have identified common themes to life&#xD;
      impairment to include symptoms, sexual function, personal relationships, emotions, daily&#xD;
      activities and social/leisure activities.4,7 Based upon the findings we will develop a&#xD;
      preliminary questionnaire (patient reported outcome measure) in conjunction with an expert&#xD;
      panel compromising of a consultant dermatologist and speciality doctor in gynaecology, both&#xD;
      of which have a specialist interest in vulval medicine. This questionnaire will be&#xD;
      subsequently piloted on a focus group of fifteen (15) patients with a variety of vulval&#xD;
      conditions. The research team feels that a small focus group would be preferential over&#xD;
      individual interviews as we hope a group discussion in which people can share their&#xD;
      experiences will stimulate discussion, generate new ideas and help reach a consensus opinion&#xD;
      on the newly created patient reported outcome measure. Furthermore, focus groups have been&#xD;
      successfully used in other studies of patients suffering with vulval disease. 8,9 Individual&#xD;
      diagnoses will not be discussed in the patient group setting and It will be attended by the&#xD;
      full patient care team and directed by the Chief Investigator. Based upon their comments and&#xD;
      professional consensus the questionnaire will be further refined. Patients will be consented&#xD;
      for their involvement and the justification of the research explained. These patients may or&#xD;
      may not have been asked to complete the original questionnaire which was used to help develop&#xD;
      the subsequent patient reported outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to authenticate the newly created patient outcome measure, one hundred (100)&#xD;
      patients attending the specialist vulval dermatology clinic on an opportunistic basis across&#xD;
      two centres (both new and follow up) will be invited to participate in completing the newly&#xD;
      created questionnaire. These patients may be previously been part of the pilot group and/or&#xD;
      been asked to contribute to the initial questionnaire which led to the development of the&#xD;
      patient reported outcome measure. All patients will be given the questionnaire fifteen (15)&#xD;
      minutes prior to their clinic appointment and given the opportunity to ask questions in their&#xD;
      clinic appointment should they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second duplicate questionnaire will be given to all the participating women in a&#xD;
      self-addressed envelope, with instructions to complete it after two weeks and return it in&#xD;
      the post. If the second questionnaire is not received within three weeks, two reminder calls&#xD;
      will be made. Through repeating the questionnaire at 2 weeks, its reliability can be&#xD;
      determined using statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same clinic visit patients will also be asked to complete the dermatology life quality&#xD;
      index (DLQI), which is a questionnaire that is routinely used in clinical practice to assess&#xD;
      the impact of a patient's skin condition on their quality of life. This is done so&#xD;
      comparisons can be made between the DLQI and new questionnaire. Statistical methods will be&#xD;
      used analyse the results and interpret the authenticity of the new questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of the vulval specific patient reported outcome measure will be addressed in a&#xD;
      number of ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test retest reliability will be assessed by asking the women to fill out the same&#xD;
      questionnaire two weeks after their initial recruitment into the study. The second&#xD;
      questionnaire will be given to the women with a self-addressed envelope after their initial&#xD;
      recruitment into the study, with instructions to complete it after two weeks and return it in&#xD;
      the post. This time period was chosen in order to avoid recall bias. If a second&#xD;
      questionnaire is not received in three weeks, two reminder calls will be places. Test-retest&#xD;
      reliability will be measured for individual questions using the kappa coefficient for&#xD;
      individual questions. The test retest reliability for the sum of the different scales will be&#xD;
      measured by intra class coefficients. Cronbach's alpha will be used to measure internal&#xD;
      consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmatory factor analysis will be used to verify the five a priori scales of the vulval&#xD;
      specific patient reported outcome measure. (These are assumed to be sexual function,&#xD;
      emotions, symptoms, daily activities and social functioning) This will be used to address&#xD;
      construct validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct validity will be also be determined through testing against the Dermatology Quality&#xD;
      Life Index. There is currently no gold standard quality of life measure used in vulval&#xD;
      conditions, but the DLQI is used routinely in dermatology practice, including patients who&#xD;
      present to the specialist vulval clinic. All patients (n=100) will be given a DLQI form to&#xD;
      complete at the same time as the piloted questionnaire.&#xD;
