  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospice care at the end of life (EOL) includes a multidisciplinary team that helps patients&#xD;
      and families focus on symptom control and quality of life. For patients with &quot;solid&quot; (e.g.&#xD;
      lung, breast) cancers it has been shown to improve quality of life for both patients and&#xD;
      families. Unfortunately, patients with blood cancers (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma) often delay&#xD;
      their enrollment and receive more aggressive care at the EOL. One factor in this delay is the&#xD;
      inability for patients to receive blood transfusions while on hospice. Patients with blood&#xD;
      cancers often require frequent blood transfusions near the EOL for symptom control. The&#xD;
      structure of Medicare hospice benefit makes coverage for transfusions financially unfeasible&#xD;
      for hospice agencies, and therefore patients with blood cancers will delay enrollment onto&#xD;
      hospice in order to continue to receive blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether removing this financial burden, through&#xD;
      external funding of blood transfusions for patients while on hospice, will encourage patients&#xD;
      with blood cancers to enroll on hospice earlier and ultimately improve their and their&#xD;
      caregivers EOL care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of providing blood transfusions to&#xD;
      patients with HM enrolled on hospice, and to evaluate both EOL care quality outcomes in these&#xD;
      patients, and caregiver quality of life and perception of patient EOL care quality.&#xD;
      Palliative blood transfusions will be provided to patients on this study free of cost through&#xD;
      study funding. The hypothesis is that removing transfusion dependence as a barrier to hospice&#xD;
      enrollment for patients with hematologic malignancies will result in improved EOL care&#xD;
      quality outcomes. This hypothesis is derived from our previous research demonstrating that&#xD;
      for Medicare beneficiaries with HM, transfusion dependence poses a significant barrier to&#xD;
      timely hospice referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is to conduct a single-center, prospective pilot study . Patients with&#xD;
      aggressive hematologic malignancies who are hospice eligible, not pursuing further cancer&#xD;
      directed therapy, and whose primary hematologist is planning to initiate a conversation&#xD;
      regarding transition to hospice will be pursued for enrollment. These patients will be&#xD;
      offered to enroll in this study in which funding will be provided to receive palliative blood&#xD;
      transfusions while enrolled on hospice.&#xD;
