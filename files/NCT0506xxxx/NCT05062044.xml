  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which data from the participants who will be taking&#xD;
      different vitamin supplementation regimes before and during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin deficiency is a condition where there is not enough vitamins in the body. During&#xD;
      pregnancy, a woman's body may require more vitamins than usual. When the body does not get&#xD;
      enough vitamins, people can take vitamin supplements to help increase the amount of vitamins&#xD;
      in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is already known, that polyvitamins can decrease risks of anemia (low level of red cells&#xD;
      in the blood), neural tube defects (severe congenital anomaly of neural system) or other&#xD;
      malformations, but also on several pregnancy complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a significant amount of evidence on the use of vitamins during pregnancy has&#xD;
      been obtained in countries with low and middle level of living standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Countries with higher living standards may have different prevalence of vitamin&#xD;
      insufficiency, thereby it is not clearly known how vitamin supplementation may help to reduce&#xD;
      pregnancy complications in these population. So, researchers think it is important to do more&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevit contains many different vitamins and minerals. These vitamins and minerals are&#xD;
      important to help women before and during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to collect more data about how well pregnancies progress&#xD;
      and the outcomes of the pregnancies in women who are taking different vitamin treatment or&#xD;
      supplements, including elevit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the researchers will review information collected from the participants to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calculate how many women give birth without any complications between weeks 37 and 42 of&#xD;
           their pregnancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calculate how many women have low levels of red blood cells in the blood during the&#xD;
           third trimester of their pregnancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calculate how many women have a serious condition called preeclampsia during their&#xD;
           pregnancy, a condition in which pregnant women have a sudden rise in blood pressure and&#xD;
           swelling in the hands, feet and face&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calculate how many women give birth to babies who weigh less than expected at the time&#xD;
           of their birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  give the women a questionnaire to complete during each trimester to see how they are&#xD;
           feeling&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have decided with their doctor to start their vitamin treatment or&#xD;
      supplements before getting pregnant or during their pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the researchers will collect the women's information from their medical&#xD;
      records taken during their regular medical appointments. The study will include women who are&#xD;
      pregnant and who are planning to get pregnant. The study will include both women who have&#xD;
      vitamin deficiency and women who do not have vitamin deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be in this study for up to 18 months., The whole study will last about&#xD;
      2 years and 10 months. During this time, the participants will visit their doctor 5 times as&#xD;
      part of their usual care. The study is planned to collect data from October 2021 until June&#xD;
      2024.&#xD;
