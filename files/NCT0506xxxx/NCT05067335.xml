      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of treatment with romosozumab for 6 months&#xD;
      compared with placebo on the percent changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar&#xD;
      spine, at the total hip and femoral neck in postmenopausal Chinese women with osteoporosis.&#xD;

Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
