    <measure>The rate of complete aneurysm occlusion (Raymond score: Ⅰ) confirmed by 12 postoperative menstrual imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The cerebral vascular imaging examination 12 months after the operation was performed to analyze whether the aneurysm was completely occluded. Aneurysm occlusion images were reviewed by clinicians and the core laboratory respectively. When the evaluation results were different from those determined by clinicians, the results of the core laboratory should prevail</description>

    <measure>Immediate postoperative success rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after</time_frame>
    <description>The intraoperative blood flow guidance device was successfully released, and the implant was accurately located by angiography after placement, and the proportion of subjects who could effectively cover aneurysma neck was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The parent artery was unblocked 12 months after surgery (stenosis rate ≤50%) and no further intervention was performed</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The clinician and the core laboratory will evaluate the results respectively. If the evaluation results are different from those determined by the clinician, the core laboratory results shall prevail</description>

&#xD;
          -  The width of tumor neck should be less than 30mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imaging measurements of the tumor parent artery showed that the diameter was 1.5mm ~&#xD;
             6.5mm&#xD;
