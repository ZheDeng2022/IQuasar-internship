      In this randomized prospective single-blind study,American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      physical status classification system ( ASA )I-II-III patients aged 50-80 years undergoing&#xD;
      transurethral bladder resection will be randomly divided into two groups. First group will be&#xD;
      covered with 41 centigrade degrees double layered cotton cloth. Second group will receive&#xD;
      active prewarming. Core temperature of all patients will be monitorized via tympanic&#xD;
      membrane. Skin temperature will be monitorized from 4 different body areas. Spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      will be applied at the level of L3-L4 by a 25 Gauge quincke needle with a dose of 12.5-15 mg&#xD;
      hyperbaric bupivacaine. Pinprick test will be used for sensorial block assessment. T10&#xD;
      sensorial block will be our goal. Hemodynamic parameters will be recorded. Skin temperature&#xD;
      will be monitorized before and after spinal anesthesia and changes will be recorded.&#xD;
      Operation time, amount and temperature of irrigation fluids, transfusion requirement,&#xD;
      discharge time from postoperative care unit will also be recorded. Shivering score and&#xD;
      thermal comfort scale will be used. The two groups will be compared for the temperature&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;

      In this prospective single-blind study, patients will be divided into 2 groups with&#xD;
      computer-based randomization technique. All patients will have a fasting time of 2 hours for&#xD;
      clear fluid and 6 hours for solid food. Patients will be taken to the premedication room&#xD;
      before the operation. Written and verbal approval will be taken from all patients. Tympanic&#xD;
      membrane will be used for core temperature measurement by Citizen ear thermometer,every 15&#xD;
      minutes.Adult skin temperature probe will be used for continuous peripheral temperature&#xD;
      measurement from four different body areas (T1:Cervical7 (C7) dermatome, T2:C6 dermatome&#xD;
      T3:Lumbar 5( L5 )dermatome, T4: L4 dermatome). The two groups will have an infusion of&#xD;
      balanced electrolyte solution with a rate of 8 Mililitre/Kilogram/ hour(mL/kg/hour). Patients&#xD;
      in Group I will be covered with a 41 centigrade degrees double layered cotton clothes.&#xD;
      Patients in Group II will receive active prewarming with a forced-air warming blanket&#xD;
      (WarmCare full body blanket) 30 minutes prior to the operation. 0.1 mg/kg intravenous (iv)&#xD;
      midazolam hydrochloride will be administered for premedication. Patients will be transferred&#xD;
      to operating room, covered with warmed double layered cotton clothes. Standard monitoring&#xD;
      (pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography) will be applied to the&#xD;
      patients. Core temperature and 4-points skin temperature measurements will be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients will be delivered 2 Liter/minute oxygen with a nasal cannula. Iv hydration will be&#xD;
      continued by room temperature balanced electrolyte solution with an infusion rate of&#xD;
      2mililiter/kilogram/hour. Spinal anesthesia will be applied at the level of L3-L4 by a 25&#xD;
      Gauge Quincke needle with a dose of 12.5-15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine in the sitting&#xD;
      position. Then patients will be taken supine position. Hemodynamic measurements will be&#xD;
      continued. Core temperature measurements will be done every 15 minutes. Peripheral skin&#xD;
      temperature measurements will be continuous. 1st, 2nd ,3rd,4th ,5th ,6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and&#xD;
      10th minutes and every 5 minutes measurements will be recorded during the operation. Pinprick&#xD;
      test will be used for sensorial block assessment. T10 sensorial block will be our goal. The&#xD;
      time for adequate sensorial block (T10) will be recorded. The patients will be repositioned&#xD;
      (lithotomy) before the beginning of surgery. 5 mg iv ephedrine and 0.5 mg iv atropine will be&#xD;
      administered when the blood pressure will be %80 of the baseline pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
      Operating time, amount and temperature of irrigation fluids, transfusion requirement will be&#xD;
      recorded. All patients will be transferred to post anesthesia care unit (PACU). Core&#xD;
      temperature measurements will be continued every 15 minutes at PACU. Shivering scale and&#xD;
      thermal comfort scale will be used during and after the operation. 25 mg iv meperidine will&#xD;
      be administered when the patient's shivering score will be more than 3. Length of PACU stay&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
