      The 33-month pregnant patient was followed in the gynecology service with the complaint of&#xD;
      shortness of breath after receiving the covid positive diagnosis and was transferred to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit due to acute respiratory failure. She was intubated in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit and the baby was taken by cesarean section. Pulmonary rehabilitation steps to be applied&#xD;
      to the patient with long-term intensive care hospitalization will be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the patient was admitted to the chest diseases service, pulmonary rehabilitation was&#xD;
      started. The patient was evaluated before starting pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation parameters; vital signs, shortness of breath, oxygen support, grip force and&#xD;
      pinchmeter, fatigue, anxiety and depression, cognitive functions. The pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program will be implemented every day during the hospitalization. The&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program will consist of breathing exercises, strengthening training&#xD;
      of upper and lower extremity, exercises in bed, mobilization and reducing oxygen support. The&#xD;
      patient will be re-evaluated before discharge.Pulmonary rehabilitation after discharge will&#xD;
      continue 2-3 days a week.The patient will be re-evaluated at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive will be assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. MoCA Test; a score of 19 to 25 indicates mild cognitive impairment. Scores of between 11 and 21 suggest mild Alzheimer's disease. There is some overlap between this type of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, reflecting the difficulty in using a single test to make this type of diagnosis</description>

    <measure>Assessment of anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression will be assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.The HADS questionnaire has seven items each for depression and anxiety subscales. Scoring for each item ranges from zero to three, with three denoting highest anxiety or depression level. A total subscale score of &gt;8 points out of a possible 21 denotes considerable symptoms of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy. The FACIT Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, easy to administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a four point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued)</description>
