  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HSCT from an allogeneic donor is the standard therapy for high-risk hematopoietic&#xD;
      malignancies and a wide range of severe non-malignant diseases of the blood and immune&#xD;
      system. The possibility of performing HSCT was significantly limited by the availability of&#xD;
      donors compatible with the MHC system. However, modern ex-vivo and in vivo technologies for&#xD;
      depletion of T lymphocytes have made it possible to improve the outcomes of HSCT from&#xD;
      partially compatible related (haploidentical) donors. In representative groups, it was shown&#xD;
      that the success of HSCT from haploidentical donors is not inferior to standard procedures of&#xD;
      HSCT from HLA-compatible unrelated donors. HSCT from haploidentical donors in children&#xD;
      associated with the deficit of the adaptive immune response, which persists up to 6 months&#xD;
      after HSCT and can be an increased risk of death of the patient from opportunistic&#xD;
      infections. To solve this problem, the method of infusion of low doses of donor memory T&#xD;
      lymphocytes was introduced. This technology is based on the possibility of adoptive transfer&#xD;
      of memory immune response to key viral pathogens from donor to recipient. Such infusions have&#xD;
      been shown to be safe and to accelerate the recovery of the pathogen-specific immune&#xD;
      response. The expansion of virus-specific T lymphocytes in the recipient's body depends on&#xD;
      exposure to the relevant antigen in vivo. Thus, in the absence of contact with the viral&#xD;
      antigen, the adoptive transfer of memory T lymphocytes is not accompanied in vivo by the&#xD;
      expansion of virus-specific lymphocytes and does not form a circulating pool of memory T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, that can protect the patient from infections. Therefore the investigators assume&#xD;
      that ex-vivo priming of donor memory lymphocytes with relevant antigens can provide optimal&#xD;
      antigenic stimulation and may solve the problem of restoring immunological reactivity in the&#xD;
      early stages after HSCT. Technically ex-vivo primed memory T lymphocytes will be generated by&#xD;
      short incubation of CD45RA-depleted fraction of the graft (a product of T lymphocyte&#xD;
      depletion) with a pool of GMP-quality peptides representing a number of key proteins of the&#xD;
      viral pathogens. The following are proposed as targeted antigens: CMV pp65, EBV EBNA-1, EBV&#xD;
      LMP12A, Adeno AdV5 Hexon, BKV LT, BKV VP1. An infusion of donor memory lymphocytes will be&#xD;
      performed on the day +1 after transplantation. Parameters of the assessment will be safety&#xD;
      and efficacy (immune response by day 60 and stability (responses by day 180).&#xD;
