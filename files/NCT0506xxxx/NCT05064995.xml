    <textblock>
      The BIPLONG (The Bipolar Disorder in the Longitudinal Course ) study is a longitudinal study&#xD;
      on the course of bipolar disorders and comprises two sub-studies: On the one hand, BIPLONG&#xD;
      examines the genetic foundation and change in bipolar disorder, on the other hand, metabolic&#xD;
      changes, clinical symptoms and cognition in bipolar disorders is evaluated. A current&#xD;
      subproject of BIPLONG is the analysis of the psychological response of the COVID-19 (Corona&#xD;
      virus disease) pandemic. With the parameters examined in BIPLONG, it is hoped to gain better&#xD;
      understanding of the bipolar disorder in the longitudinal course.&#xD;

      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the bipolar patients, healthy controls will also be included. The same&#xD;
      inventories will be used for the control subjects and the same examinations or visits will be&#xD;
      performed; bipolar-specific disease questions will not be asked in controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Longitudinal study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients and controls undergo several assessments every six months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected with the following main parameters of interest being examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection and analysis of DNA, establishment of permanent cell lines, determination of&#xD;
           mRNA and gene products (proteins), proteomics, lipidomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine parameters: Blood count, TSH, T3, T4, homocysteine, creatinine, amylase, lipase,&#xD;
           CK, urea, uric acid, coagulation, HBA1c, glucose, lipids (triglyceryl, LDL, HDL,&#xD;
           cholesterol, mass spectrometry), transaminases, CRP- levels, vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarkers: oxidative stress parameters and antioxidants, neuroinflammatory markers&#xD;
           (e.g. interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, interferons, GDNF, VEGF, etc.), neurotrophins&#xD;
           (BDNF, NT, Trk..), insulin, IGF, adipokines, Apo-E and AAT analysis,&#xD;
           tryptophan/kynurenine metabolites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intestinal hormones grehlin, glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1/2) and&#xD;
           cholecystokinin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, socio-demographic data and psychological data are collected by administering&#xD;
      self-assessment questionnaires. Further, neurocognitive tests are administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current psychological and psychiatric state of all subjects is examined by external&#xD;
      ratings done by experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropomethric measures are examined (waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, weight, height).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, MRI is conducted on all subjects (for patients every 6 months, for controls&#xD;
      every 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gene-environment interactions are significantly contributory to bipolar affective&#xD;
           disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are pathologically altered neurobiological markers that play a role in the&#xD;
           pathogenesis of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is an influence of anthropometric data on the course of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and anticipated sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data analysis will be investigated using a multi-factorial between subject design,&#xD;
      with the variables of group (bipolar patients versus healthy controls), gender (males versus&#xD;
      females), weight (normal weight versus overweight), etc. as independent factors, depending on&#xD;
      the research question. As dependent variables, in addition to sociodemographic and clinical&#xD;
      variables (number of episodes, etc.), physiological parameters (blood parameters,&#xD;
      anthropometry and lipometer data, EEG, ECG, MRI) and psychological variables (psychological&#xD;
      questionnaires) will be investigated. Likewise, covariates such as age or body mass index&#xD;
      will be included as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation analyses (bivariate, partial) should show possible correlations between the&#xD;
      variables. Discriminant analyses should find out which variable best separates the&#xD;
      investigated groups (e.g. patients vs. controls). Furthermore, regression analyses (linear,&#xD;
      multiple) will be performed to obtain additional information about the predictive value of&#xD;
      the variables under investigation. All analyses will be computed using IBM SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the &quot;a priori analysis&quot; of the follow-up study (T1-T5), a repeated measures design&#xD;
      (repeated measures within factors) was adopted. The case number calculation (effect size d&#xD;
      between .30 and .80; Cohen, 1988) for the F-test thus results in a sample size of 47 patients&#xD;
      with a target effect size of .40 (power 95%; alpha .05; calculated with GPower 3.1). The&#xD;
      correlation analyses at the first measurement time point (power .95, alpha .05, effect size:&#xD;
      .35) yields 79 subjects per group (Pat. vs. controls) at all time-points.&#xD;
