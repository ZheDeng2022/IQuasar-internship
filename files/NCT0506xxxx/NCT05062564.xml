  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry Eye Disease (DED) is a disease of the ocular surface which may be secondary to a variety&#xD;
      of causes, including cataract surgery. DED is characterized by loss of tear film stability&#xD;
      and dry eye symptoms, and its pathogenesis is related to corneal nerve injury, decreased&#xD;
      goblet cells, inflammation of the ocular surface, and dysfunction of the meibomian glands&#xD;
      (MGD). MGD is the main cause of evaporative DED and can cause irregularity of the ocular&#xD;
      surface, affecting the accuracy of the biometric calculation. In addition, it is a risk&#xD;
      factor for DED exacerbation after cataract surgery, that may occur in about 40% of cases.&#xD;
      Current therapies for DED include artificial tears, warm compresses, manual squeezing of the&#xD;
      glands, eyelid hygiene, omega-3 fatty acids, topical cyclosporine, serum tears, topical&#xD;
      azithromycin, oral doxycycline. The above therapies in some cases can provide only transient&#xD;
      relief, affecting the outcome of cataract surgery and the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, stabilization of the ocular surface before cataract surgery is important to&#xD;
      achieve better post-operative comfort and a better refractive result. The introduction of&#xD;
      LipiFlow thermal pulsation treatment (LTP) represents a controlled method of squeezing the&#xD;
      obstructed Meibomian glands by applying heat to the upper and lower eyelids and&#xD;
      simultaneously applying pulsatile pressure to the eyelid skin surfaces. The aim of our study&#xD;
      will be to evaluate the effect of preoperative LipiFlow therapy in patients with age-related&#xD;
      cataracts and mild to moderate MGD in reducing postoperative DED.&#xD;
