      This study is being done to determine if cryptic alterations exist within or near to the ALPL&#xD;
      gene in patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypophosphatasia, but without identifiable&#xD;
      alteration on commercial testing. Additionally, the study aims to characterize functional&#xD;
      effects of certain variants of uncertain significance in patients with clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      hypophosphatasia.&#xD;

      Primary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if cryptic alterations exist within or near to the ALPL gene in patients with&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of hypophosphatasia, but without identifiable pathogenic or likely&#xD;
      pathogenic variant on commercial testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterize functional effects of variants of uncertain significance in patients with&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of hypophosphatasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further characterize the differential diagnosis of hypophosphatasemia in patients with&#xD;
      skeletal disease&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 1-&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of Hypophosphatasia based on clinical features that include&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History consistent with diagnosis of hypophosphatasia AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Physical examination findings consistent with a diagnosis of hypophosphatasia AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of low serum alkaline phosphatase level for age and sex AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Elevation of at least one natural substrate of alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Lack of detection of a variant on molecular analysis of the ALPL gene. When possible,&#xD;
             first degree relatives (parents, siblings, or child) will be included for the sole&#xD;
             purpose of trio testing. No additional information will be collected on first degree&#xD;
             relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 2-&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Missense variant in ALPL which is interpreted as a variant of uncertain significance&#xD;
             by the American College of Medical Genetics Guidelines for Variant Interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Variant has been interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign, or&#xD;
             benign using ex-US interpretation guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 1-&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History and physical examination incompatible with a diagnosis of hypophosphatasia OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Absence of hypophosphatasemia as measured by age and sex-matched control OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Absence of at least one elevated natural substrate of alkaline phosphatase OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Alternate diagnosis which could overlap with signs and symptoms of hypophosphatasia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 2-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inability to express variant in plasmid for residual enzyme and co-transfection analyses&#xD;
