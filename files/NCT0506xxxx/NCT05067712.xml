  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Permanent maxillary canines are the second teeth that most commonly assume ectopic positions&#xD;
      after the third molars. They are diagnosed as impacted and have an incidence of 1 % to 3%&#xD;
&#xD;
      In their ectopic path of eruption, they can cause damage (resorption) of the adjacent roots,&#xD;
      a severe complication that may lead to the loss of anterior teeth. When cone-beam computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scanning is used for diagnose, root resorption is detected in two-thirds of&#xD;
      the lateral incisors adjacent to impacted maxillary canines before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of this condition comprises two stages: a surgical intervention to uncover the&#xD;
      canine crown followed by orthodontic treatment to move the canine into correct position. The&#xD;
      surgical intervention commonly involves two different techniques: the open and the closed&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The open technique procedure involves removing the bone and mucosa covering the crown of the&#xD;
      canine. The exposed crown is left uncovered and a pack is placed over the area to avoid&#xD;
      overgrowth of tissue. When enough spontaneous eruption of the canine has occurred, an&#xD;
      orthodontic attachment is bonded to the crown and the tooth is moved above the mucosa with&#xD;
      orthodontic appliances into the correct position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The closed technique procedure involves bonding an orthodontic attachment to the crown with a&#xD;
      chain after exposing the canine during the surgery. The palatal flap is sutured back covering&#xD;
      the exposed crown and the chain is left through the palatal mucosa free in the oral cavity.&#xD;
      Shortly after, the canine is forced to erupt through the palatal mucosa and moved into the&#xD;
      correct position with orthodontic appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical trial is to compare outcome variables&#xD;
      between the Open and Closed surgical exposure techniques regarding the success of treatment,&#xD;
      patient's perceptions of pain and discomfort experienced and analgesic consumption, treatment&#xD;
      time, and complications. The null hypothesis is that similar outcomes occur when the surgical&#xD;
      exposure of palatally impacted canines is performed by using the open or the closed surgical&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients planned for surgical exposure of uni- or bilateral palatally impacted&#xD;
      canines of two centers, are invited to participate in the Trial. The centers are the&#xD;
      University Orthodontic Departments of Oslo, Norway, and Jonkoping, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participant patients and their parents are given verbal and written information&#xD;
      about the Trial and Informed Consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly allocated to one of two interventions by use of Permuted Block&#xD;
      Randomization in order to maintain equal allocations across treatment groups. Allocation&#xD;
      concealment is held by one individual in each center that is not involved in the study. No&#xD;
      stratification is made for age or gender in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the maxillary deciduous canine is present at the time of the surgery, the tooth is removed&#xD;
      together with the exposure of the impacted canine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before entering the surgery room, participants answer a first questionnaire on whether they&#xD;
      are experiencing pain or discomfort (measured in VAS-scales) in the area of the impacted&#xD;
      canine and whether they have taken analgesics. The questionnaire is filled in and delivered&#xD;
      back before entering the surgery room. After the surgical exposure, verbal and written&#xD;
      information and recommendations on chlorhexidine mouth rinse and analgesic consumption are&#xD;
      given. A second questionnaire is then handed out for participants to self-report the&#xD;
      pain-discomfort they experienced during surgery, and are experiencing in the evening the same&#xD;
      day and the following seven days together with the analgesic consumption. The second&#xD;
      questionnaire is delivered back to the clinic at the post-surgical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the post-surgical control, participants receive a third questionnaire where they&#xD;
      self-report the pain-discomfort they experienced during and after sutures (closed technique)&#xD;
      and packing (open technique) are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical exposure with the open technique, the canine is left to erupt&#xD;
      spontaneously. Participants are follow-up by the orthodontist until the canine has erupted&#xD;
      enough (approximately ½ - 1/3 of the crown above the level of the palatal mucosa) to bond an&#xD;
      attachment to the crown. The canine then starts to be moved into alignment in the dental arch&#xD;
      above the mucosa with orthodontic appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical exposure with the closed technique, the impacted canine starts to be moved&#xD;
      with orthodontic appliances within 2 weeks after surgery. The canine is moved into alignment&#xD;
      in the dental arch through the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the completion of the surgical exposure phase until the previously impacted canine is&#xD;
      orthodontically positioned in the dental arch, similar questionnaires are handed out to the&#xD;
      participants in both treatment groups every second/ third orthodontic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are followed until the active orthodontic treatment is finished and&#xD;
      orthodontic retainers bonded.&#xD;
