  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Connective tissue disease (CTD) covers all heterogeneous and broad immunological diseases.&#xD;
      These immunological diseases are characterized by inflammation, tissue damage, and abnormal&#xD;
      repair. Disorders such as fibrotic tissue or loss of function are seen in the degeneration of&#xD;
      the target organ. There is a complex relationship between genetic and environmental factors&#xD;
      on the basis of these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency has been frequently observed in autoimmune diseases such as systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Vitamin D deficiency is&#xD;
      primarily seen with musculoskeletal complaints and is an early warning of osteomalacia.&#xD;
      Muscle weakness is most common in the trunk, shoulders and hips. It is characterized by&#xD;
      difficulty in climbing stairs, getting up from sitting or lying position, feeling of&#xD;
      heaviness in the legs, duck-like gait, difficulty getting up from a chair, fatigue easily,&#xD;
      inability to lift objects with arms and hands. Patients experience decreased exercise&#xD;
      capacity as a result of pain and muscle weakness. In addition, vitamin D deficiency causes&#xD;
      smooth muscle contraction and an increase in airway inflammation. As a result, it was&#xD;
      observed that the disease course and symptoms were more severe in CVD patients with vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency. In a study conducted with rheumatoid arthritis patients, the quality of life,&#xD;
      physical activity and depression levels of patients with vitamin D deficiency were compared&#xD;
      with the control group. The evaluation parameters of rheumatoid arthritis patients were worse&#xD;
      than the control group. Vitamin D levels were compared with sleep, anxiety and depression&#xD;
      levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A positive relationship was found&#xD;
      between vitamin D deficiency and sleep disturbance level. It has been observed that the life&#xD;
      expectancy of patients with connective tissue disease is significantly reduced compared to&#xD;
      healthy ones. Exercise capacity and oxygen consumption decreased in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient connective tissue disease patients (systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus) with stable medical conditions will be referred for physiotherapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation after being examined by the relevant physician. Physiotherapy evaluation will&#xD;
      be made by the physiotherapist. In addition; healthy individuals who accepted and gave&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study without any chronic disease for the healthy control group&#xD;
      will be included in the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Numerical Evaluation Scale-Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used to determine the pain level of the patients at rest, activity and at night. Patients are asked to mark the numbers between 0 and 10 at the time of assessment, in terms of rest, activity and night pain.</description>

    <measure>Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of dyspnea was assessed with the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale. The MMRC is a category scale consisting of 5 statements about dyspnea, scored between 0-4.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>A valid and reliable Turkish Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to determine the anxiety and depression levels of the patients. In the questionnaire consisting of a total of 14 questions, odd-numbered questions assess anxiety and even-numbered questions assess depression. It has two subgroups, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). The lowest score that patients can get from both subgroups is 0, and the highest score is 21.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). It is a scale used by the individual to determine the perception of fatigue. The scale consists of nine items, each item is scored between 1-7. An increase in the total score obtained from the scale indicates that the severity of fatigue of the individual increases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity level was evaluated with Turkish valid and reliable International Physical Activity (IPAQ) questionnaire. The questionnaire consisting of 7 questions gives information about the time spent in walking, moderate-to-vigorous and vigorous activities. The time spent sitting is considered as a separate question. A score is obtained in total score metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes. According to the result, physical activity level is classified as 'inactive', 'minimally active' and 'very active'.</description>

SF-36 questionnaire; It includes a total of 36 questions in eight subgroups: physical function, physical role difficulty, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role difficulty and mental health. Separate scores are calculated for eight subgroups. SF-36 evaluates the negative and positive aspects of the general health condition together. Subgroup scores range from 0 to 100, with a high score indicating good health.</description>
