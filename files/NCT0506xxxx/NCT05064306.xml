  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are doing this study to provide access to treatment with 131I-omburtamab for&#xD;
      children and young adults who have CNS/leptomeningeal neoplasms. 131I-omburtamab is an&#xD;
      investigational drug; the FDA has not approved it to treat this cancer or any other disease.&#xD;
      However, the agency has granted the drug Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment&#xD;
      of neuroblastoma with CNS metastases.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of an embryonal malignancy&#xD;
             (including but not limited to neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdoid tumors,&#xD;
             pineoblastoma, retinoblastoma, PNET, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, Wilm's tumor,&#xD;
             hepatoblastoma) other non-embryonal tumors must have histologic confirmation of B7-H3&#xD;
             reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have CNS/ leptomeningeal disease which is refractory to conventional&#xD;
             therapies or for which no conventional therapy exists or a recurrent brain tumor with&#xD;
             a predilection for leptomeningeal dissemination (i.e. PNET, rhabdoid tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             °Patients must have received their last dose of myelosuppressive anticancer therapy at&#xD;
             least 21 days (3 weeks) prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biologic or investigational agent (anti-neoplastic):&#xD;
&#xD;
             °Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to the agent&#xD;
             and received their last dose of the investigational or biologic agent ≥ 7 days prior&#xD;
             to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Monoclonal antibody treatment and agents with known prolonged half-lives:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to the&#xD;
                  agent and received their last dose of the agent ≥ 21 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Monoclonal antibody treatment and agents with known prolonged half-lives: Patient&#xD;
                  must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to the agent and&#xD;
                  received their last dose of the agent ≥ 28 days prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurologic Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with neurological deficits should have deficits that are stable for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 1 week prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with seizure disorders may be enrolled if seizures are controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
             °Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS for &gt; 16 years of age) or Lansky Performance Score&#xD;
             (LPS for ≤ 16 years of age) assessed within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment must be&#xD;
             ≥ 50%. Patients who are unable to walk because of neurologic deficits, but who are up&#xD;
             in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the&#xD;
             performance score.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 0.5x 10^9/ L (must not have received&#xD;
                  G-CSF within the 7 days prior to enrollment or pegfilgrastim within the 14 days&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/ L (unsupported, defined as no platelet transfusion&#xD;
                  within 7 days prior to study enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraventricular Access Device °Protocol treatment with radioimmunotherapy&#xD;
             (131I-omburtumab) will require the presence of an appropriate intraventricular access&#xD;
             device (e.g.,programmable ventriculoperitoneal [VP] shunt or Ommaya reservoir).&#xD;
             Patients are not required to have an existing programmable VP shunt or Ommaya at the&#xD;
             time of study enrollment but must be willing and able to undergo a surgical procedure&#xD;
             to have one placed prior to Radioimmunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Patients with an existing intraventricular VP shunt without a programmable component&#xD;
        must be willing and able to undergo modification of the shunt before treatment with&#xD;
        131I-omburtumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both pediatric and adult patients of any age are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have active malignancy outside the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be on standing steroids, as long as the dosage is either stable or&#xD;
             decreasing for at least week prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent and assent when appropriate indicating awareness of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with obstructive or symptomatic communicating hydrocephalus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an uncontrolled life-threatening infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant: negative pregnancy test is required for all women of&#xD;
             childbearing age, and appropriate contraception is required during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received cranial or spinal irradiation less than 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received systemic chemotherapy (corticosteroids not included) less&#xD;
             than 3 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe major organ toxicity. Specifically, renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, and&#xD;
             gastrointestinal system toxicity should all be less than grade 3. Patients with stable&#xD;
             neurological deficits (because of their brain tumor) are not excluded. Patients with ≤&#xD;
             grade 3 hearing loss are not excluded.&#xD;
