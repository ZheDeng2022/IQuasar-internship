  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-inflammatory brace technology has demonstrated superior clinical outcomes in the&#xD;
      management of knee osteoarthritis and accelerate recovery time for Major League Soccer&#xD;
      players. Authors have postulated that embedding germanium into cotton garments increases&#xD;
      circulation and augments the inflammatory process through a transdermal micro-electromagnetic&#xD;
      field. In addition to immunomodulatory effects, knee braces immobilize and stabilize the&#xD;
      joint through tactile feedback from the skin. Thus, a germanium-embedded knee brace may&#xD;
      provide inflammatory control to augment pain and edema while concomitantly enhancing&#xD;
      proprioception. ACL Reconstruction rehabilitation goals during the acute post-operative phase&#xD;
      include diminishment of pain and edema as well as restoration of knee range-of-motion. The&#xD;
      presented study intends to assess the impact of a germanium-embedded knee brace on patient&#xD;
      recovery after ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-center blinded randomized controlled clinical trial to study effectiveness of&#xD;
      germanium-infused knee brace on rehabilitation in patient population undergoing ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction. Patients will be randomized into germanium-infused knee brace group and&#xD;
      compared to a replica knee brace group. Inclusion criteria will include skeletally mature&#xD;
      individuals undergoing primary ACL reconstruction. Exclusion criteria will include autoimmune&#xD;
      disorders and history of surgery on ipsilateral joint. The presented protocol intends to&#xD;
      assess the impact of a germanium-embedded knee brace on patient recovery after ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction. The primary outcome measure was chosen for its implications for the design&#xD;
      and conduct of the study,1 including well-validated outcome instrument for comparison,&#xD;
      facilitation of a priori power analysis, randomization, and blinding. Secondary outcomes were&#xD;
      chosen for their pertinence to surgeon decision-making during patient rehabilitation.&#xD;
