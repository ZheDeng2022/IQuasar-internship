  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent type of cancer in women yet, it is&#xD;
      associated with relatively lower mortality rates, as it ranks fifth in cancer-related deaths&#xD;
      overall, which is attributed to evolution in the treatment of recurrent and metastatic&#xD;
      lesions, especially when these lesions were detected early . BC recurrence can occur even 15&#xD;
      years after primary treatment.&#xD;

      life-long routine monitoring is mandatory. Although histopathologic confirmation is the&#xD;
      definitive diagnostic method for BC recurrence, it is not always easy to perform as in cases&#xD;
      with deeply located or very small-size lesions, or lesion too close to organs or great&#xD;
      vessels, making sampling either inaccessible or hazardous. BC recurrence can be assessed&#xD;
      using morphological imaging studies or tumor markers. Mammography, ultrasound (US), computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently the most commonly used&#xD;
      morphological imaging methods for detecting breast cancer recurrence. However, both of the&#xD;
      two modalities have some restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are two tumor markers that&#xD;
      are frequently used in the monitoring of BC patients . However, the findings of many studies&#xD;
      on these markers in BC follow-up are conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of integrated 2-deoxy-2-[18 F] fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT), known as PET/CT, has become a helpful tool for&#xD;
      this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT is the functional imaging tool that can measure increased glucose metabolism in cancer&#xD;
      cells by using 18F-FDG. Its ability to identify tumor recurrence before detection of&#xD;
      morphologic changes in conventional imaging reflecting its importance in detecting BC&#xD;
      recurrence in asymptomatic patients with high tumor markers and negative results of&#xD;
      radiological imaging. 18F-FDG PET/CT is frequently used for BC evaluation. However, data on&#xD;
      its value in evaluating BC recurrence in patients with elevated tumor markers are limited and&#xD;
      unclear&#xD;

    <description>Patients with previous breast cancer, already treated and with clinical or biochemical suspicion of disease relapse. All patients will underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT. In all patients, the value of CA 15.3 was compared to PET/CT. The final diagnosis of relapse will be derived from histopathological sampling As much as possible or radiological follow up for at least 6 months will be compared with PET/CT results.</description>
