  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The social cognitive deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are related to&#xD;
      an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, specifically a deficit in the&#xD;
      inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The investigators have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRS) techniques to measure GABA in specific brain regions and have demonstrated that a&#xD;
      single dose of gabapentin increases GABA in brain regions associated with social cognition.&#xD;
      This study will use a biomarker-driven approach to investigate gabapentin to correct the&#xD;
      underlying imbalance of neurotransmitters and improve the core social cognitive deficits in&#xD;
      ASD. By using a brain-based biomarker (GABA) that is quantifiable and measurable, the&#xD;
      investigators can target this biomarker directly and measure the impact of the treatment.&#xD;
      This will help with the future development of targeted therapies for ASD and provide an early&#xD;
      marker of response to aid in the selection of individuals more likely to respond to various&#xD;
      treatments. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) determine if treatment with gabapentin&#xD;
      sustainably increases GABA in the right anterior insula (RAI; an area of the brain involved&#xD;
      in social cognition), 2) determine if response of RAI GABA levels to a single dose challenge&#xD;
      of gabapentin predicts a sustained response after treatment, and 3) determine if the increase&#xD;
      in GABA levels with gabapentin treatment translates into clinically measurable improvement in&#xD;
      social cognition. The investigators will conduct an 8-week open-label clinical trial of&#xD;
      gabapentin in 40 adolescents (age 13-17 years) with ASD, using MRS before and after treatment&#xD;
      to measure GABA in the RAI (the primary outcome for the study). Before the trial, a single&#xD;
      dose challenge of gabapentin will be used to evaluate the immediate response of GABA levels&#xD;
      in the RAI, to determine if this predicts later response. A secondary outcome will be the&#xD;
      clinical effects of gabapentin on social cognition. This study can demonstrate for the first&#xD;
      time that neuroimaging biomarkers can be used to guide treatment of social cognition deficits&#xD;
      seen in ASD and that the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in neurotransmitters in ASD can be&#xD;
      pharmacologically targeted. This can provide a rational basis for pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      of the core social deficits of ASD, providing direct benefit to participants in the study as&#xD;
      well as indirect benefit to countless patients in the future.&#xD;

      1. Outline of Research Plan The investigators will recruit 40 adolescents with ASD (age&#xD;
           13-17) to participate in an 8-week open label clinical trial of gabapentin, with&#xD;
           wraparound neuroimaging to assess the primary outcome of Aim 1 (response of RAI GABA&#xD;
           levels to 8 weeks of gabapentin treatment) and Aim 2 (evaluation of acute response to&#xD;
           gabapentin as a predictor of response at 8 weeks). Clinical measures of social cognition&#xD;
           described below will be obtained to address Aim 3 (to assess for clinically measurable&#xD;
           improvements in social cognition deficits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical Assessments The subjects will be assessed with the Autism Diagnostic&#xD;
           Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) to confirm&#xD;
           the diagnosis of ASD. The Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale will assess overall&#xD;
           severity of autism-specific symptoms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview&#xD;
           for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID 7.0.2) will be used to document comorbid&#xD;
           psychiatric diagnoses. The Weschler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI-2) will be&#xD;
           used to assess IQ. Social cognition deficits will be assessed using the Reading the Mind&#xD;
           in the Eyes test (RMET), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), and the Vineland&#xD;
           Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) Socialization subdomain. The Aberrant Behavior&#xD;
           Checklist, Community version (ABC), will be used to quantify behavioral measures&#xD;
           associated with ASD. To assess whether clinical improvements with gabapentin extend&#xD;
           beyond effects on social cognition, other symptom domains will be assessed pre- and&#xD;
           post-treatment as well. Specifically, information on repetitive and/or compulsive&#xD;
           behaviors will be obtained using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale&#xD;
           modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CY-BOCS-PDD). The ADHD Rating Scale-IV&#xD;
           (ADHD RS-IV) will be used to assess ADHD symptoms, the Children's Depression Rating&#xD;
           Scale (CDRS) to assess depressive symptoms and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for&#xD;
           Children, 2nd edition, (MASC-2) will be used to assess anxiety-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to traditional outcome measures for social functioning in ASD, including&#xD;
           parent report measures (SRS-2) and theory of mind tasks (RMET), a novel technique of&#xD;
           measuring social motor coordination will be used that was developed as a potential&#xD;
           outcome measure in ASD clinical trials. This assessment involves a video-based analysis&#xD;
           of whole-body social motor coordination during a more naturalistic task, the&#xD;
           conversation task of an ADOS-2 administration. Changes in social motor coordination will&#xD;
           be evaluated in relation to changes in GABA levels with treatment over the course of the&#xD;
           clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline MRI T1- and T2-weighted high-resolution structural imaging (T1- and T2-weighted&#xD;
           (MPRAGE)) will be acquired, along with a baseline MRS using MEsher-Garwood Point&#xD;
           REsolved Spectroscopy Sequence (MEGA-PRESS: TE: 68 ms, TR: 2 s) to quantify GABA in a 4&#xD;
           cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm voxel localized in the RAI. Imaging sessions will be conducted at&#xD;
           the Advanced MRI Center (AMRIC) at UMMS, which houses a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI&#xD;
           research scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) and 8 element phase-array&#xD;
           receiver SENSE head coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The baseline MRI protocol also leverages collaborations with the Human Connectome (HCP)&#xD;
           and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developments (ABCD) projects and is designed to support&#xD;
           integration with national multi-site studies for added protocol utility. The scan&#xD;
           session will include 1) a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition&#xD;
           gradient echo scan for cortical and subcortical segmentation (6.5 min); 2) a 3D&#xD;
           T2-weighted variable flip angle fast spin echo scan for screening out white matter&#xD;
           lesions and quantification of CSF (6 min); 3) a diffusion imaging scan, for segmentation&#xD;
           of white matter tracts and measurement of diffusion parameters (1.5mm isotropic, b=1000;&#xD;
           110 directions acquired with both AP and PA phase encoding; 2 x 5 min); 4) a resting&#xD;
           state fMRI scan (2mm isotropic ; TR 750 ms; AP, PA phase encoding; (2-5.75 min runs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acute Response of GABA levels A second MRS scan will be obtained two hours after an&#xD;
           approximately 20 mg/kg challenge with gabapentin to obtain the acute response for Aim 2.&#xD;
           Subjects will receive a single dose of gabapentin. The dose used will be calculated to&#xD;
           provide the highest possible dose to the nearest 100 mg without exceeding 1500 mg or 20&#xD;
           mg/kg, whichever is lower. The weight exclusion criteria ensures that all subjects will&#xD;
           receive at least 17 mg/kg dose. All subjects will be monitored for adverse effects for&#xD;
           up to 4 hours following administration of the single dose and will have direct phone&#xD;
           access to the principal investigator (24 hours/ 7 days a week) for reporting of any&#xD;
           post-observation adverse effects. A blood sample to assess drug level will be taken as&#xD;
           close to 3 hours after administration as possible, allowing time for imaging scan and&#xD;
           transport to clinical trials unit for blood draw. This will be used to control for&#xD;
           variability in bioavailability in interpreting the cortical GABA level changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical Trial of Gabapentin The study involves an 8-week open-label clinical trial with&#xD;
           gabapentin in 40 adolescents age 13-17 years who meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD. At the&#xD;
           acute gabapentin dosing visit, baseline safety labs will be obtained, including complete&#xD;
           blood count; comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, renal function tests,&#xD;
           and liver function tests; and creatine kinase. Baseline EKG will be obtained as well.&#xD;
           The above labs will be repeated at week 4 and week 8 of the clinical trial, or if&#xD;
           adverse events occur which indicate the need for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, the following clinical measures will be obtained:&#xD;
      OACIS-S, OACIS-I (for post-baseline visits). At baseline and at 8 weeks, the following&#xD;
      assessments will also be administered: VABS-II, SRS-2 (modified to ask about symptoms in&#xD;
      previous 2 weeks), RMET, ABC, CY-BOCS-PDD, ADHD-RS-IV, MASC-2, and CDRS-R. ADOS-2 will also&#xD;
      be re-administered at week 8 for videotape assessment of social motor coordination as&#xD;
      described above. At week 8, a trough serum gabapentin level will be obtained to account for&#xD;
      variability in bioavailability as a potential confounding factor. At week 8, the MRS scan&#xD;
      will be repeated to evaluate RAI GABA levels, and also include a resting state functional MRI&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
