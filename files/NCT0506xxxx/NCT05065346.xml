  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation&#xD;
      emitter device (DaRT) as a treatment prior to additional radiation or chemo therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned as a phase II, single arm interventional, open-label, multi-center,&#xD;
      prospective study evaluating DaRT as a neoadjuvant therapy in patients with advanced oral&#xD;
      cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 79 subjects with pathologically confirmed, previously untreated,&#xD;
      resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity above the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used&#xD;
      in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that&#xD;
      will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target lesion will be inserted with DaRT in a neo-adjuvant setting. DaRT seeds will be&#xD;
      removed 15 days following the insertion. Surgery will follow 15 to 20 days after removal of&#xD;
      the DaRT seeds followed by standard chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone based on&#xD;
      histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be the assessment of the major pathological response.&#xD;

             becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12&#xD;
             months, with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who&#xD;
             have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antioestrogens, low&#xD;
