    <description>To assess the impact of the educational intervention on participants knowledge and beliefs about clinical trials, participants will be asked to complete a survey prior to and after the educational intervention. The pre-assessment and post assessment survey includes 11 items assessing knowledge of clinical trials, risks and benefits to clinical trials participation, and the consent process. Additionally, the assessment includes 6 items to determine intentions to seek out information related to clinical trials, speak with one's healthcare provider about appropriate clinical trials, clinical trials participation, and talking with family/friends about participating in clinical trials.</description>
