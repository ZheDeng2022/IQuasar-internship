    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the impact of the two major disease modifying&#xD;
      therapy (DMT) classes (B cell therapies and S1P modulators) on humoral and cell-mediated&#xD;
      immunity to SARS- CoV-2 vaccination compared to non-MS controls. We have chosen to compare&#xD;
      DMT-treated MS patients to non-MS controls because the pivotal vaccine studies were conducted&#xD;
      in non-MS healthy control groups in which there is significant clinical data and validated&#xD;
      assays for antibody responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects approximately 1 million persons in the United States and is&#xD;
      the leading cause of disability in young adults. Disease modifying treatments for MS act&#xD;
      through modulation or suppression of immune responses including B and T cell responses. Two&#xD;
      major classes of drugs used to treat MS are 1) B cell antibodies, including Kesimpta&#xD;
      (ofatumumab) and Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), and 2) S1P modulators including Gilenya (fingolimod)&#xD;
      and Mayzent (siponimod). SARS-CoV2 is a potentially fatal novel coronavirus, which has&#xD;
      claimed over 350,000 lives in the United States. The causative agent of COVID-19 disease, the&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes the angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme II (ACE2) to target cells in the lower airway.(1, 2) Symptoms of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection can cause pneumonia with primarily lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates.(3) Most&#xD;
      people (approximately 81%) experience mild upper respiratory tract infection or mild&#xD;
      pneumonia, while approximately 15-20% of cases experience severe or critical disease&#xD;
      characterized by dyspnea, lung infiltrates, respiratory failure and multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction.(4) The case- fatality rate ranges from 0.7-5.8%. SARS-CoV2 vaccines have just&#xD;
      been FDA approved, including the Moderna® and Pfizer-BioNTech® vaccines which contain lipid&#xD;
      nanoparticle- formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the receptor binding domain&#xD;
      (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.(5, 6) Prior work suggests that vaccine responses may&#xD;
      be blunted in patients treated with these two drug classes, however there is currently no&#xD;
      controlled data on the efficacy and durability of SARS-CoV2 vaccine responses in treated MS&#xD;
      patients. Current data is limited to uncontrolled case reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robust studies are needed to inform the efficacy of SARS-CoV2 vaccines in MS patients on&#xD;
      DMTs, which will guide infection risk management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the impact of the two major DMT classes (B cell&#xD;
      therapies and S1P modulators) on humoral and cell-mediated immunity to SARS- CoV-2&#xD;
      vaccination compared to non-MS controls. We have chosen to compare DMT-treated MS patients to&#xD;
      non-MS controls because the pivotal vaccine studies were conducted in non-MS healthy control&#xD;
      groups in which there is significant clinical data and validated assays for antibody&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the percentage of MS patients on&#xD;
      immunotherapy with a positive SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody response (positive seroconversion)&#xD;
      compared to the percentage of controls who seroconvert at 5-6 months post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody % seroconversion and titers in MS patients on&#xD;
           immunotherapy to titers in controls at 2-3 months and 11-12 months post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in MS patients on&#xD;
           immunotherapy to titers in controls at 5-6 months post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of antibody titers and T cell responses between the four groups of&#xD;
           immunotherapies evaluated and to controls at each of the three timepoints.&#xD;
