    <textblock>
      This study including two phases: (1) Pre-test Phase, 3~6 patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      receive 20 mg Chidamide BIW and 400 mg Envafolimab Q4W. The main object of pre-test phase is&#xD;
      to evaluate the preliminary safety and tolerability of Chidamide when in combination with&#xD;
      Envafolimab. (2) Formal experiment Phase, 63 patients will be enrolled and receive 30 mg&#xD;
      Chidamide BIW and 400 mg Envafolimab Q4W, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide&#xD;
      when in combination with Envafolimab in patients with PD-1 inhibitor resistant advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is also to explore the gene expression and variation, PD-L1 and HDAC2 proteins&#xD;
      expression levels in tumor tissue samples, the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma, and&#xD;
      the potential correlation between peripheral blood cytokines and clinical preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy and safety.&#xD;
