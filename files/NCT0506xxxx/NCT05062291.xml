TLPP is defined as freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) or target lesion thrombosis measured through 6 months post-procedure, which is the time interval of uninterrupted patency after study procedure to the next intervention performed on the target lesion or uncorrectable target lesion occlusion.</description>

&#xD;
          3. Subject is willing to comply with site standard of care procedures and follow-up visit&#xD;
             schedules over 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is undergoing chronic hemodialysis with the hemodialysis access the&#xD;
             intervention will be performed upon&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The dialysis access is considered mature and has been used to deliver hemodialysis&#xD;
             treatments for at least one session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has stenosis or occlusion within the dialysis outflow circuit of an&#xD;
             arteriovenous (AV) fistula or AV graft and is treated with WRAPSODY Endoprosthesis&#xD;
             System in accordance with device instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has a comorbidity that, in the investigator's opinion, would limit life&#xD;
             expectancy to less than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a planned surgical revision of access site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a known or suspected infection of the hemodialysis access site, systemic&#xD;
             infection and/or septicemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has an uncorrectable coagulation disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known hypersensitivity to nickel titanium alloy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject's hemodialysis access is anticipated to be abandoned within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is scheduled for kidney transplant or peritoneal dialysis within the next 6&#xD;
             months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Full expansion of a Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) balloon cannot be&#xD;
             achieved during predilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Device would be placed in the Superior Vena Cava&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any inflow or outflow lesion that could jeopardize patency access long-term beyond the&#xD;
             target treatment area.&#xD;
