    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 and 2. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of evobrutinib on single doses of&#xD;
      digoxin, metformin and rosuvastatin in Part-1 and sumatriptan in Part-2 of the study.&#xD;
