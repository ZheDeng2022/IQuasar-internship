  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to understand how the presentation of information on social media influences&#xD;
      processing and recall of information, particularly in relation to modified risk tobacco&#xD;
      products. Participants will see a social media site where either (a) the topic of discussion&#xD;
      varies between each post or (b) posts on the same topic are grouped together. They will then&#xD;
      be asked to recall information about the posts they saw on the site.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Participants are assigned to one of two between-group conditions: either receiving a high mixed presentation of content in the social media feed (where the topic varies from post to post), or a low mix of presentation of content in the social media feed (where the topic does not vary).&#xD;
Additionally, two further between-subject groups will be created by independently examining effects among current and former smokers.</intervention_model_description>
