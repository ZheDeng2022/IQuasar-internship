  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, multi-cohort Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in patients with solid tumors and&#xD;
      brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be comprised of 3 patient cohorts: triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and solid tumor types other than TNBC and NSCLC. Cohort 3&#xD;
      will be comprised of solid tumor types with established (e.g., renal cell carcinoma [RCC],&#xD;
      endometrial cancer) or preliminary clinical evidence (e.g., gastric cancer, colorectal&#xD;
      cancer) of efficacy of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and angiogenesis inhibitors. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted using a Simon's optimal two-stage design, and approximately 87 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled concurrently (n=29 per cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is intracranial objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the&#xD;
      modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the intracranial ORR of the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination&#xD;
      in patients with TNBC or NSCLC and brain metastases, as assessed according to the modified&#xD;
      RECIST (mRECIST) [Qianet al., 2017] (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib&#xD;
           combination in patients with TNBC, NSCLC, and other solid tumor types and brain&#xD;
           metastases, as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
           Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0. (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the intracranial ORR of the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination in&#xD;
           patients with TNBC or NSCLC and brain metastases, as assessed according to the Response&#xD;
           Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria (Appendix 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To determine intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) of the&#xD;
           pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination in patients with TNBC, NSCLC, and other solid&#xD;
           tumor types --Objective: To determine the systemic ORR of the pembrolizumab and&#xD;
           lenvatinib combination in patients with TNBC, NSCLC, and other solid tumor types and&#xD;
           brain metastases, as assessed by the RECIST v1.1 (Appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate systemic PFS in patients with TNBC, NSCLC, and other solid tumor&#xD;
           types and brain metastases receiving the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination, as&#xD;
           assessed by the RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients with TNBC, NSCLC, and other&#xD;
           solid tumor types and brain metastases receiving the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib&#xD;
           combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To identify the site of first progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To determine changes in dose, duration, and frequency of steroid use for&#xD;
           symptomatic management of brain metastases. Patients who require at least 4 mg of&#xD;
           dexamethasone/day for symptom management will be considered as requiring high-dose&#xD;
           steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To assess neurological function according to the Neurologic Assessment in&#xD;
           Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale (Appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate immune-related biomarkers of response to the pembrolizumab and&#xD;
           lenvatinib combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To identify imaging characteristics associated with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
           lenvatinib treatment-induced immunological changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate the effects of the pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination on&#xD;
           cranial radiation and opiate pain medication use and seizure reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: Intracranial and systemic duration of response (DOR) in patients who achieve&#xD;
           partial response (PR) or complete response (CR).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply, unless&#xD;

             V600E; fusion/rearrangement[s] in ALK, ROS1, NTRK, or RET; or MET amplification). KRAS&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has hepatocellular carcinoma. NOTE: patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and brain&#xD;
             metastasis are excluded from this trial because the dose of lenvatinib approved for&#xD;
             this disease is different than the ones used in this trial.&#xD;

             (cortical-based brain metastasis) and leptomeningeal spread is suspected, a work-up&#xD;
             for leptomeningeal disease (LMD) should be performed (MRI and lumbar puncture with CSF&#xD;
             cytology). If LMD is not confirmed, the treating physician, neuro-oncologist, or brain&#xD;
