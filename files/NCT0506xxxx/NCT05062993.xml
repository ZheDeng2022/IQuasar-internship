  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postlumbar surgery syndrome (PLSS; failed back syndrome) is characterized by persistent pain&#xD;
      in the lower back or lower extremities after spinal surgery. It occurs in 10-40% of patients&#xD;
      who undergo a back surgery. The recently introduced pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) technique is&#xD;
      widely used to provide relief from chronic pain and studies have shown that PRF stimulation&#xD;
      can be used to control neuropathic pain by placing the needle electrodes into the caudal&#xD;
      epidural space The aim of this study is evaluation of the effect of ultrasound guided caudal&#xD;
      epidural pulsed radiofrequency stimulation in patients with chronic lumbosacral radicular&#xD;
      pain due to postlumbar surgery syndrome.&#xD;
