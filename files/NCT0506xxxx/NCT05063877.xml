    <textblock>
      EQU-201 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      dose-ranging safety, tolerability, and exploratory efficacy of adjunctive EQU-001 using the&#xD;
      continuous reassessment method (CRM). 10 participants diagnosed with epilepsy according to&#xD;
      the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of the Epilepsies 2017&#xD;
      criteria whose seizures are uncontrolled on one to four concomitant antiepileptic drugs&#xD;
      (AEDs) for ≥4 weeks will be enrolled in 4 dose cohorts (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg) The&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 4:1, drug to placebo. The dosing is for 12 weeks, after&#xD;
      which, safety data will be reviewed post 14 days to determine whether the next cohort can be&#xD;
      opened. Once the 12-week study dosing period is complete, all subjects may enroll in an&#xD;
      open-label extension, during which period investigators may make dose adjustments down to 10&#xD;
      mg and up to the dose at which a cohort has not met stopping criteria and has completed at&#xD;
      least 14 days of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study of EQU-001 will provide safety of a range of doses, tolerability, and PK data in&#xD;
      patients with epilepsy and aims to identify drug-specific DLTs and MTD. The PK component will&#xD;
      characterize the PK of EQU-001 to inform dosing and may help to correlate exposures with any&#xD;
      DLTs or other treatment-related AEs. The open label extension component will provide data on&#xD;
      subject safety, tolerability and efficacy.&#xD;
