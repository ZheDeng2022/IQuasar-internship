    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of creating a health education&#xD;
      telemedicine curriculum that can be delivered by Weill Cornell Medicine faculty and medical&#xD;
      students and NY-Presbyterian Hospital resident physicians to community dwelling adults in an&#xD;
      under-resourced local community.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's Satisfaction with the Curriculum at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's satisfaction with the curriculum will be measured via 5-point Likert scale survey that was created by our research team. Scores will range from a low of &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; to a high of &quot;Strongly agree.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Number of Participants Virtually Attending the Health Education Seminars</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Virtual attendance to the health education seminars will be collected. The number of participants who virtually attend all health education seminars over the 12 week period will be collected and change in number of participants attending will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant's Rate of Completion of Weekly Blood Pressure Recordings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's rate of completion of the weekly blood pressure recording logs will be measured and analyzed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant's Rate of Completion of Weekly Steps Recordings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's rate of completion of the weekly step recording logs will be measured and analyzed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Systolic Blood Pressure Measurement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-report weekly up to 4 blood pressure readings taken at baseline through week 12 with their automatic blood pressure arm cuff. The change in systolic blood pressure measurements in this time frame will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Diastolic Blood Pressure Measurement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-report weekly up to 4 blood pressure readings taken at baseline through week 12 with their automatic blood pressure arm cuff. The change in diastolic blood pressure measurements in this time frame will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Number of Daily Steps Measured by Pedometer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-report weekly the number of steps taken as measured by their wrist pedometer at baseline through week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Reported Health Attitudes and Behaviors As Assessed by Survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The name of the survey is &quot; Knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions towards hypertension and cardiovascular disease.&quot; The survey was adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It consists of both quantitative and qualitative questions assessing participants' demographics, participants' knowledge and attitudes about diet and exercise, and participants' knowledge about hypertension and other related cardiac diseases (i.e. stroke, coronary artery disease). The survey will be administered at enrollment and post-intervention at week 12. Pre- and post-surveys will be compared for accuracy of answers and change in self-reported behaviors.</description>
