  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The wide application of ISR and DST has greatly improved the anal preservation rate for low&#xD;
      rectal cancers, but the technical difficulty has also been obviously increased because of the&#xD;
      limited pelvic space. Although many scholars have tried to solve this problem, all the&#xD;
      methods have failed to fundamentally solve the problem of &quot;the oblique dissection&quot; of the&#xD;
      distal rectum. To solve the problem above, the director of this clinical trial has explored a&#xD;
      new distal rectal resection method-- transanterior obturator nerve gateway approach. The&#xD;
      purpose of this clinical trial is to prospectively collect and compare data on the patients'&#xD;
      perioperative variables and postoperative functional and oncological outcomes of this novel&#xD;
      approach with the traditional approach to confirm the safety and feasibility of this novel&#xD;
      approach and its advantages over the traditional approach.&#xD;

      Objective To confirm the safety, feasibility and advantages by comparing the perioperative&#xD;
      variables, postoperative functional and oncological outcomes of patients with ultralow rectal&#xD;
      cancer treated by laparoscopic traditional distal rectal dissection vs. by transanterior&#xD;
      obturator nerve gateway approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients with ultralow (≤5cm from the anal verge) rectal cancer who are to undergo&#xD;
      laparoscopic radical resection (ISR- DST) without any contraindications of general&#xD;
      anesthesia, surgery or chemotherapy. (See details in Eligibility part) Sample size Two groups&#xD;
      are designed, patients who are to receive the traditional approach to transect the distal&#xD;
      rectum are assigned to the control group, patients who are to receive the transanterior&#xD;
      obturator nerve gateway approach to transect the distal rectum are assigned to the&#xD;
      experimental group. 100 cases are to be enrolled for the experimental group and not less than&#xD;
      100 cases are to be enrolled for the controlled group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment If the participant match with the requirements for this study and agree to take&#xD;
      part in it, once hospitalized, the participant will complete the established preoperative&#xD;
      tests including blood routine, the comprehensive metabolic panel, blood coagulation function,&#xD;
      tumor markers, blood type, infectious disease screening tests, chest, abdominal and pelvic CT&#xD;
      (Computed Tomography) scan and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), colonoscopy, echocardiogram,&#xD;
      pulmonary function, venous duplex ultrasound of legs. All male patients will be routinely&#xD;
      asked to fill in the IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function-5) sexual function&#xD;
      scoring questionnaire preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following comprehensive treatment will be depended on the examination results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant therapy The treatment plan will be made in accordance with the NCCN (National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network) Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer&#xD;
      (Version 1.2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Pelvis radiotherapy with a total dose of 50 Gy with 25 courses&#xD;
      in 5 weeks. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy include single drug therapy: capecitabine (CAP, 1250&#xD;
      mg/m2, BID) or double drug therapy: oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine (CapeOX,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2, day 1, capecitabine 1000mg/ m2, day 1 ~ 14, then rest for 7 days,&#xD;
      repeated every 3 weeks) or three-drug therapy (mFOLFOX6, oxaliplatin 85 mg/ m2 intravenous&#xD;
      infusion for 2 hours, leucovorin calcium 400 mg/m2 intravenous infusion for 2 hours, 5-FU&#xD;
      (fluorouracil) 400 mg/m2 intravenous infusion for 1 day, Then 1200 mg/ m2/d×2 days of&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion with a total of 2400mg/m2 for 46 ~ 48 hours, repeated every 2&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal and pelvic MRI and contrast enhanced CT will be routinely performed 6 to 8 weeks&#xD;
      after neoadjuvant therapy to confirm the extent of tumor regression without new-found distant&#xD;
      metastasis. Those whose clinical stage after neoadjuvant therapy changes from T4 to T3 will&#xD;
      be seen as eligible in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment Preoperative preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Patients older than 60 years old or having a smoking history for over 10 years will&#xD;
      receive lung ventilation training and atomization treatment for 3 days. 2) Intestinal&#xD;
      preparation will be done with oral cathartic medications 12-24 hours before surgery. 3)&#xD;
      Prophylactic antibiotics will be given once anesthesia is begun, the second antibiotics will&#xD;
      be given if the operation lasts for over 3 hours. 4）Urethral catheterization will be&#xD;
      routinely done preoperatively. 5）If the patient refuses to accept the novel approach before&#xD;
      surgery, they will be directly enrolled in the traditional group. If both approaches are&#xD;
      acceptable to the patient, the decision whether to use the novel approach will be made&#xD;
      according to the intraoperative conditions (see operating procedures below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating procedures General anesthesia; Modified lithotomy position; Establishment of&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum: Place a trocar 1cm above the umbilicus through which to establish&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum and keep the abdominal pressure as 12mmHg (millimeters of mercury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trocar placement: above the umbilicus (trocar C, 10 mm), upper right and left quadrants&#xD;
      (trocars B and D, 5 mm), lower right quadrant (trocar A, 12 mm), lower left quadrant (trocar&#xD;
      E, 5 mm), the midpoint between the pubic symphysis and umbilicus (trocar F, 5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal exploration: Explore the abdominal cavity in accordance with the principle of&#xD;
      non-contact, from far to near step by step, explore the tumor finally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mesosigmoid and mesorectum are dissected from the right lateral rectum towards the root&#xD;
      of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The IMA is transected and ligated, so is the&#xD;
      inferior mesenteric vein. Posterior space of the descending colon is dissected following&#xD;
      opening the peritoneum beside the left rectum. The rectum in the pelvis is been mobilized&#xD;
      from posterior rectal space, anterior rectal space to bilateral rectal space successively.&#xD;
      The lower edge of the tumor is marked by a clamp. The linear stapler is placed in the pelvis&#xD;
      to clamp the distal rectum below the tumor to see if the transection can be done more than&#xD;
      1cm from the lower edge of the tumor. If yes, the distal rectum will be transected by the&#xD;
      traditional approach (that means the patient will be assigned to the traditional group). The&#xD;
      proximal bowel is transected through a small midline incision. Then the coloanal anastomosis&#xD;
      will be done intracorporeally. A surgical drain is placed in the pelvis and a terminal&#xD;
      ileostomy is routinely performed. All incisions are closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the distal rectal transection cannot be done more than 1cm from the lower edge of the&#xD;
      tumor, the anterior obturator nerve gateway approach will be used (that means the patient&#xD;
      will be assigned to the experimental group). The steps are as follows: The peritoneum&#xD;
      covering the ureter and external iliac artery is opened more than 2 cm across the vas&#xD;
      deferens (male) or round ligament (female). The Retzius space and vesicohypogastric fascia&#xD;
      are exposed. The obturator vessels and obturator nerve are properly identified. Care should&#xD;
      be taken to avoid any injury when using energy devices near the obturator nerve. The gateway&#xD;
      is then opened through the TME (total mesorectal excision) compartment and the lateral&#xD;
      compartment. If necessary, an &quot;endoloop&quot; can be placed through the gateway, and the bundled&#xD;
      S2-4 nerves, ureter and bladder vessels are gently retracted toward the cranial direction to&#xD;
      widen the gap. The linear stapler is placed in the gateway to vertically transect the distal&#xD;
      rectum. The following procedures are the same with the traditional group as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, the following variables will be recorded: the angle between the linear&#xD;
      stapler and the rectum, distance from the lower edge to the resecting margin, whether the&#xD;
      operation converted to transanal approach, operative time, bleeding volume, anastomotic&#xD;
      height from anal verge and the length of the stapling line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management：&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1）Vital signs (body temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, blood pressure) are routinely&#xD;
      monitored, gross volume of fluid input and output will be recorded every 24h, blood routine,&#xD;
      the comprehensive metabolic panel and coagulation function tests will be performed every 3&#xD;
      days. 2）The time of catheter removal (days after operation), residual urine volume in the&#xD;
      bladder will be measured by ultrasound examination. Whether there is a request to be&#xD;
      re-catheterized or take oral medication to relive the dysuria. All patients will be asked to&#xD;
      fulfil the IPSS (International prostate symptom score) questionnaire to assess urinary&#xD;
      function. 3）The time of pelvic drain removal (days after operation). 4）Whether complicated&#xD;
      with anastomotic leakage, ileus and long-lasting (more than 5 days) pulmonary or abdominal&#xD;
      infection. 5）All information of the pathologic report. 6）Postoperative hospital stay (days)&#xD;
      Postoperative chemoradiotherapy Radiotherapy program is the same with the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy. Chemotherapy will be advised for patients with stage II cancer accompanied with the&#xD;
      following high-risk factors: histologically poorly differentiated with normal mismatched&#xD;
      repair or stable microsatellite (MSS), pT4 (pathological stage T 4), vascular/nerve invasion,&#xD;
      preoperative intestinal obstruction or perforation, ≤ 12 lymph nodes retrieved and R1&#xD;
      resection. The chemotherapy program is the same with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If mismatch&#xD;
      repair defect (dMMR) or high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is confirmed by&#xD;
      pathology, chemotherapy will not be advised. Patients with stage III cancer will routinely&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Information on general medical history and physical examination will be collected every 3&#xD;
      months for 3 years. 2) Blood tumor markers of CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and CA19-9&#xD;
      (carbohydrate antigen 19-9) will be tested every 3 months for 3 years. 3) Abdominal and&#xD;
      pelvic ultrasound and chest X-ray examinations will be carried out every 3 months for 3&#xD;
      years. 4) Abdominal and pelvic MRI or contrast enhanced CT scan will be done every year for 3&#xD;
      years. 5) Colonoscopy will be performed within 1 year after surgery. If there is any&#xD;
      abnormity, reexamination will be required within half a year. If no abnormality is found,&#xD;
      once a year for 3 years. All new-found adenomas by the colonoscopy during follow-up are&#xD;
      recommended to be resected. 6) Sexual function score is assessed by filling in the&#xD;
      questionnaire (IIEF-5) both preoperatively and 1 year later since operation. 7) 3-year&#xD;
      tumor-free survival (month): The time from operation to confirmation of tumor's local&#xD;
      recurrence or distant metastasis. The end point of the patient lost to follow-up is the date&#xD;
      of loss. 30 days is defined as one month. 8) 3-year overall survival (month): The time from&#xD;
      operation to death. The end point of the patient lost to follow-up is the date of loss. 30&#xD;
      days is defined as one month. 9) Stoma closure time (months since operation). Anal function&#xD;
      is assessed by Wexner scale 3 months and 12 months after stoma closure, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (As to possible risks and benefits of participating in this trial, see details in the&#xD;
      informed consent document.) Study start date (actual) 2020-12-01 Study completion date&#xD;
      (anticipated) 2025-12-01 (All outcomes of the last patient are recorded 3 years&#xD;

      (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) Statistics 25 (IBM, Inc., Armonk, NY) will be&#xD;
      used to perform statistical analyses. The t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for&#xD;
      quantitative data between groups. Qualitative data were compared by Chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test and survival distributions were analyzed by log-rank test.&#xD;
