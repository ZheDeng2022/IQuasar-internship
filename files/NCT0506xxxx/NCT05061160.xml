  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>BRS is the index which is used to quantify the control of baroreflex on the heart rate. Patient's beat to beat arterial pressure and heart rate are measured simultaneously with the Maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) manoeuvre or valsalva manoeuvre. Changes from the baseline to 4 week will be analyzed</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate reserve (HRR)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>It is the difference between resting heart rate and maximum heart rate. HRR is primarily use to determine heart rate zone for exercise. HRR can be calculated by subtracting resting heart rate from maximum heart rate. Changes from the baseline to 4 week will be analyzed</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Blood pressure is measured through sphygmomanometer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen saturation</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of oxygen in the blood is known as oxygen saturation. normal range is 94-99 percent. Pulse oximeter is used to measure oxygen saturation. Changes from the baseline to 4 weeks</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain perception</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is defined as unpleasant sensation which is generated by body as a protective response to prevent further tissue damage. It will be measured with the help of Numeric pain rating scale ranging 0 to 10. where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable. Changes from the baseline to 4 week will be analyzed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as how much an individual consider he eligible to perform the given exercise. Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) Exercise Self Efficacy scale will be provided to the individuals at the baseline and then after 72 hours i.e 3 days of training/week. It has total of 10 questions which allow the participants to indicate on four point scale how much confident they are about the exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QOL Index-Spinal cord injury version questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>QOL index spinal cord injury version is used to assess the quality of life of spinal cord injury patients. It has 32 to 37 items. Each item is rated on scale of 1 to 6.5 scores of 0-30 are calculated.1) quality of life, 2) health and functioning, 3) social and economic life, 4) physiological life, and 5) family life. Changes from the baseline to 4th week will be analyzed</description>
