  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II trial of belimumab in combination with rituximab/venetoclax in&#xD;
      patients with refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Treatment of CLL has&#xD;
      drastically changed in the past years as new therapeutic agents have gained clinical&#xD;
      approval. The combination rituximab/venetoclax over a course of two years is approved as&#xD;
      second line therapy especially in patients with high risk CLL (del17p), showing high&#xD;
      remission rates and achievement of MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity. The next goals&#xD;
      in CLL therapy are now to increase the rate of MRD negativity and to achieve an earlier MRD&#xD;
      negativity during the course of treatment to allow for a reduction of treatment time and&#xD;
      therefore treatment-induced toxicities. In line with other hematologic diseases, progression&#xD;
      free survival depends on remission status, especially MRD negativity, after last treatment as&#xD;
      MRD positivity after therapy indicates the persistence of treatment resistant CLL cells. One&#xD;
      mechanism of therapy resistance has been described as reduced sensitivity to&#xD;
      rituximab-induced antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK)&#xD;
      cell production of B-lymphocyte stimulator (BlyS, also called BAFF), which can be bound by&#xD;
      belimumab, a human anti-BAFF antibody. Moreover, recombinant human (rh)BAFF can dose&#xD;
      dependently reverse cytotoxic effects of venetoclax, which could also be restored by the&#xD;
      application of belimumab. This led to the conceptualization of this clinical trial, in which&#xD;
      belimumab is applied as a weekly subcutaneous injection in combination with&#xD;
      standardrituximab/venetoclax treatment for up to 24 months in relapsed and refractory CLL&#xD;
      patients. By removing BAFF from the CLL microenvironment we aim to increase the efficacy of&#xD;
      rituximab/venetoclax treatment to achieve higher and earlier MRD negativity rates and allow&#xD;
      for an abbreviated treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment landscape for relapsed/refractory CLL has faced profound changes and new&#xD;
      developments in the past years. Conventional chemoimmunotherapies show only limited efficacy&#xD;
      in the relapsed setting and are associated with side effects caused by rather unspecific mode&#xD;
      of action of chemotherapy. Therefore, several targeted agents have become available for the&#xD;
      treatment of CLL in recent years. However, beside the combination of rituximab and venetoclax&#xD;
      all of these substances require continuous treatment bearing the risk of developing therapy&#xD;
      resistance and accumulation of side effects. The combination of rituximab and venetoclax&#xD;
      shows high response rates in the relapsed setting with MRD negativity rates of 83%, however&#xD;
      still requiring a 2-year period of continuous treatment. Future efforts have now to focus on&#xD;
      the further and earlier elimination of MRD in all treated patients to allow for a reduced&#xD;
      treatment time and therefore lower risks of side effects and development of resistance as&#xD;
      well as the achievement of long-lasting remission and potential cure in the future. The&#xD;
      available data on the sensitizing effect of belimumab for venetoclax treatment, together with&#xD;
      the published results showing a belimumab-induced sensitization of CLL cells to NK cell&#xD;
      antitumor immunity as mediated by rituximab, provide a clear rationale for the evaluation of&#xD;
      a combinatorial treatment with belimumab to increase sensitivity and response to the&#xD;
      established CLL treatment regimen venetoclax/rituximab. Thus, we here propose an open-label,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase II study analyzing safety and efficacy of belimumab&#xD;
      in combination with venetoclax and rituximab in patients with refractory or relapsed CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of combinational treatment The published and preclinical data on the&#xD;
      sensitizing effect of belimumab on CLL cells to venetoclax and rituximab provides a clear&#xD;
      rationale for combinational treatment of rituximab/venetoclax with belimumab. Although high&#xD;
      MRD negativity rates are achieved withrituximab/venetoclax some patients still present with&#xD;
      persisting MRD and suffer from early disease relapse. This phase II trial is designed to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of belimumab in addition to rituximab/venetoclax in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL. The primary endpoint is achievement of MRD negativity at end of&#xD;
      induction treatment (EOI). Furthermore, the following secondary objectives will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of belimumab and rituximab/venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of response (DOR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of further efficacy markers of belimumab in combination with&#xD;
           rituximab/venetoclax in CLL compared to control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics of belimumab in CLL patients&#xD;
