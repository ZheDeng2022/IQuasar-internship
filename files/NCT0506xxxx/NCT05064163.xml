  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The waiting lists for surgery and diagnostic tests registered in the health management area&#xD;
      of Campo de Gibraltar West are very high, and this is compounded by the lack of resources&#xD;
      that prevent them from being managed efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to know, quantify and communicate the measurement of the social&#xD;
      impact, also known as social return on investment, which is presented as a tool for decision&#xD;
      making on the intervention of the management of health concerts in comparison with the&#xD;
      current system in Andalucia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, other objectives will be studied, such as the health and non-health benefits&#xD;
      derived from applying the intervention of the concerts compared to the current system of&#xD;
      waiting list management from the economic, social and environmental points of view, the&#xD;
      economic cost of the interventions by the health concerts and the Andalusian public health&#xD;
      system, the cost of the increase in extraordinary health resources, determining the most&#xD;
      prevalent surgeries from highest to lowest and specifying the highest number of surgeries&#xD;
      that are established in the concerts and in the SSPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method used will be an economic evaluation of the different healthcare technologies in&#xD;
      which the investigators compare the healthcare agreements of the most prevalent procedures&#xD;
      and those that collect data in both groups through the SROI tool. A cross-sectional and&#xD;
      prospective design will be carried out with a time horizon of 2021 and 2022, and for the&#xD;
      statistical analysis the investigators will use the SSPS V25 and JASP programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators consider it necessary to carry out this research study as there is no&#xD;
      specific bibliography on the healthcare technology used in healthcare agreements as a new&#xD;
      healthcare technology compared with the current system for managing surgical waiting lists in&#xD;
      the Andalusian public healthcare system in terms of return on investment.&#xD;

      The main objective of the study is to carry out a SROI (social return on investment) project&#xD;
      as a decision-making tool for clinical and health management of waiting lists in Campo de&#xD;
      Gibraltar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators consider it necessary to carry out this research study as&#xD;
      there is no specific bibliography on the healthcare want to achieve other more specific&#xD;
      objectives such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To know the economic cost of the interventions by the extraordinary health concert and&#xD;
           the ordinary activity of the Andalusian Public Health System (APHS) of the surgical&#xD;
           waiting list and diagnostic tests of certain surgical and functional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To know the increase in extraordinary resources to reduce waiting lists in terms of&#xD;
           human and material resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe socio-demographic data and the prevalence of surgical interventions and&#xD;
           diagnostic tests in the extraordinary agreement and the Andalusian Public Health System&#xD;
           (APHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out how the patient's life is affected in different areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specify the patient's willingness to pay to improve their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the social return for each surgical procedure and functional test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of the study, a questionnaire will be carried out with the aim of analysing&#xD;
      the effect that the waiting list for surgery and diagnostic tests has on the lives of the&#xD;
      people who suffer from it, this questionnaire will include, among others, the following&#xD;
      sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-demographic characteristics, employment situation and family environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of procedures and pathology - Effect of the waiting list for surgery and diagnostic&#xD;
           tests on different areas of the patient's life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to pay to improve aspects of their life affected since diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of health resources in the last year linked to the pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of visits that the patient will have to make will only be once, prior to their&#xD;
      diagnostic or surgical procedure, to which they will be given the information sheet, informed&#xD;
      consent and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extraordinary visits will not be made. The alternative procedures or treatments that may&#xD;
      exist for the subject and their significant potential risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be 1 year, from April 2021 to March 2022. The number of&#xD;
      participants will be the patients included in the surgical waiting list and diagnostic tests&#xD;
      of the Hospital Punta de Europa located in the health management area Campo de Gibraltar West&#xD;
      and referred to the centre &quot;Clínica Virgen del Rosario&quot;.&#xD;
