      This study is designed to pilot a text message (TM) delivered behavior change intervention to&#xD;
      decrease binge drinking and to increase use of sexual violence (SV) harm reduction strategies&#xD;
      among college students.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, feasibility trial of a text message-delivered intervention&#xD;
      designed to increase use of sexual violence harm reduction strategies and decrease alcohol&#xD;
      use among college students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be asked to complete three surveys, one survey at the start of the study, one at the end&#xD;
           of 3 month intervention period, and one at 6 months after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive one of two sets of text messages for a 3 month intervention period and be asked&#xD;
           to respond to some of those text messages&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control condition text messages: The control condition will be a version of the&#xD;
                TM-delivered alcohol use reduction intervention developed and implemented by Dr.&#xD;
                Brian Suffoletto while at the University of Pittsburgh. This intervention has been&#xD;
                tested in young adults (age 18-25) recruited from Emergency Department and college&#xD;
                settings, and will be used to provide an attention control group for efficacy&#xD;
                testing. Prior to typical drinking occasions, individuals planning a drinking event&#xD;
                are prompted to consider committing to a drinking limit goal, i.e.: &quot;Would you be&#xD;
                willing to set a goal to drink less than X drinks when drinking?&quot;. Based on&#xD;
                willingness to commit to the goal, a feedback message is provided. During typical&#xD;
                drinking periods, individuals receive a goal reminder. Each week, the program&#xD;
                provides goal success/failure feedback or drinking quantity feedback. For example,&#xD;
                those occasions where an individual committed to a drinking limit goal triggers&#xD;
                either messages to reinforce goal successes or reframe goal failures. When an&#xD;
                individual did not commit to a drink limit goal, they are provided feedback based&#xD;
                on alcohol quantity (e.g. abstinence feedback, high risk drinking feedback).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention condition text messages: The multi-target sexual violence harm&#xD;
                reduction and alcohol use intervention will use a similar model to the alcohol use&#xD;
                reduction intervention previous developed and implemented at the University of&#xD;
                Pittsburgh.13-15 Students will be: 1) queried via TM prior to typical drinking days&#xD;
                regarding both alcohol use and SV harm reduction goal setting; 2) provided with&#xD;
                goal reminders during drinking period; and 3) assessed for goal attainment and&#xD;
                given feedback following drinking episodes.&#xD;
