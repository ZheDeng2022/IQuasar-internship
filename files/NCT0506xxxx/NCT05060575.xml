    <textblock>
      This research will be conducted to determine the effects of education and telephone&#xD;
      counseling given to hypertension patients on drug treatment compliance and rational drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses H0: Education and telephone counseling given to hypertension patients do&#xD;
      not affect drug treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Education and telephone counseling given to hypertension patients increase drug treatment&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Education and telephone counseling given to hypertension patients do not affect rational&#xD;
      drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Education and telephone counseling given to hypertension patients increase rational drug&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was planned as a single-blind randomized controlled experimental study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Medication Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 13 items and determines the self-efficacy/confidence level of adherence to drug treatments of individuals with hypertension. The scale is evaluated by scoring from 1 to 4 in each question. The minimum score that can be obtained from the scale is 13, and the maximum score is 52. The increase in the scale score indicates that the compliance of individuals to antihypertensive drug treatment increases positively.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rational Drug Use Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale has 36 items and is a triple Likert type. Behavioral beliefs (items 1-9), Control beliefs (items 10-16), Attitude (items 17-21), Subjective norm (items 22-23), Intention (items 24-28), and Knowledge It has 6 sub-dimensions (items between 29 and 36). Scoring of scale items was never (0), sometimes (1), and always (2) for positive items; negative items (items 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 24) are calculated as never (2), sometimes (1), and always (0). The scores that can be obtained from the scale range from 0 to 72. As the score obtained from the scale increases, the level of rational drug use increases.</description>
