  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, prospective feasibility study and pilot randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      of patients scheduled for elective intermediate or major non-cardiac cancer surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to randomise up to 200 patients who meet the inclusion criteria to&#xD;
      standard care or to personalised perioperative care based on pharmacogenomic testing for&#xD;
      drugs commonly used in anaesthesia and postoperative pain management e.g., opioids -&#xD;
      morphine, oxycodone and tramadol; anti-emetics - metoclopramide and ondansetron; and&#xD;
      non-steroidal drugs - celecoxib and ibuprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that pharmacogenomic testing is feasible prior to elective&#xD;
      surgery and through 'personalised prescribing' for precision tailored perioperative care the&#xD;
      investigators will improve patient's postoperative quality of recovery, including pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients will remain blinded until the completion of data collection on post-operative day 30. Investigators assessing postoperative outcomes will remain blinded throughout study. Treating clinicians and study investigators will be unblinded to the pharmacogenomic results available for patients randomised to the active arm of the study group. Treating clinicians will remain blinded to the pharmacogenomic results available for patients randomised to the control arm of the study group, as this group will receive standard care that is provided at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.</masking_description>

    <description>The perioperative (anesthetic and postoperative pain management) plan for each patient will be determined preoperatively by the treating anesthesia team. Thereafter, the pharmacogenomic results of the patient will be released and a personalised anesthetic plan formulated based on international pharmacogenomic guidelines. The treating anesthesia team will then modify the perioperative care plan based on the patients' pharmacogenomic results and the international pharmacogenomic guidelines.</description>
