    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study Investigational Product (IP) and other study treatments, whether or not considered related to the study IP and other study treatments. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study IP and other study treatments. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures.&#xD;
An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if, the event: results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or other medically important event.</description>
