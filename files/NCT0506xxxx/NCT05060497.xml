    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators are hoping to the find out what changes occur within the body&#xD;
      of people recovering from Covid-19 at 5-7 months and 11-13 months following discharge from&#xD;
      hospital, compared to healthy controls, and whether these changes can help explain why some&#xD;
      patients may experience fatigue. Measurements will be taken using state-of-the-art MRI&#xD;
      imaging at rest and also during low intensity exercise, to mimic everyday activity. In doing&#xD;
      so it is expected that this will inform ways to adapt exercise rehabilitation programmes,&#xD;
      making them better suited for Covid-19 survivors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Purpose and design Covid-19 manifests as a spectrum of multi-organ damage and dysfunction.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle wasting and strength loss from heightened inflammatory burden and hospital&#xD;
      immobilisation, together with vascular dysfunction and lung damage, combine to create a&#xD;
      profound insult resulting in severe deconditioning and long-lasting functional&#xD;
      insufficiencies. Marked physiological deficits likely prevail due to the multi-organ nature&#xD;
      of this insult, but clear understanding of breadth and magnitude is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst susceptible groups exist, patients surviving this critical illness also include those&#xD;
      who were previously fit and well, many of younger and working age, but a unifying trait is&#xD;
      the inability to mount a dynamic physiological response to simple every-day activities, such&#xD;
      as walking. Greater effort to address the multi-organ nature of this lack of physiological&#xD;
      resilience is urgently warranted, it is essential to understand the relative regional&#xD;
      contribution of the disease to pathophysiology and frailty. Further, understanding the&#xD;
      dynamic response across organs will be fundamental in developing optimal interventions to&#xD;
      facilitate recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will combine state-of-the-art, validated techniques and research expertise in&#xD;
      human physiology, MRI/MRS and clinical medicine to provide novel insight of the impact of&#xD;
      Covid-19 on physiological resilience at a multi-organ level (here, muscle, heart and brain&#xD;
      related to fatigue/physical activity), using exercise as a stressor. This will provide a&#xD;
      unique clinically valuable perspective of whole body dysfunction that will underpin global&#xD;
      rehabilitative programmes designed to maximise patient recovery and functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urgent priority to define Covid-19 multi-organ damage and optimise the rehabilitation&#xD;
      package underpins the rapidity of this call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are other multi-organ MRI projects post Covid-19 (for example coverscan and C-More)&#xD;
      which will take cohorts of patients. DYNAMO differs as it has been developed specifically to&#xD;
      mechanistically study the cause for the persisting symptoms such as fatigue, atrophy,&#xD;
      impaired exercise tolerance, poor vascular and metabolic health, and cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      delineate the targets for rehabilitation. Detailed whole-body and organ level metabolic and&#xD;
      physiological assessments will be collected using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      and MR spectroscopy measures, with exercise as a stressor, only under stress will some&#xD;
      deficits become apparent. This is highly novel, and will deliver unprecedented insight into&#xD;
      the mechanisms driving persisting symptoms. DYNAMO will complement other projects, and the&#xD;
      objectives and detailed physiological phenotyping described in DYNAMO is not covered&#xD;
      elsewhere in other funded imaging studies. Moreover, DYNAMO will provide an important&#xD;
      evidence-based foundation for optimising future rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will be recruiting 30 patients who have recovered from Covid-19, 5-7 months&#xD;
      from discharge from their local hospital Trust, compared to 10 age, gender, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) and ethnicity matched healthy control volunteers. Patients will also undergo a set of 6&#xD;
      month follow up visits to see if there is any change in their physiological and metabolic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Potentially eligible patients, attending the established post Covid-19 outpatient&#xD;
      clinic at the Nottingham University Hospitals Trust as part of their follow up care after&#xD;
      hospital admission, will be approached by an existing member of their clinical care team (the&#xD;
      Chief investigator (CI) forms part of this team). Similarly, there is active follow-up at&#xD;
      other nearby acute hospital trusts in the East Midlands, who are collaborating, from where&#xD;
      patients can be recruited. Furthermore, collaborations with PHOSP-Covid on this project have&#xD;
      been confirmed and participants who have been involved in PHOSP-Covid can be recruited as a&#xD;
      Tier 3 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be given a Participant Information Sheet to read about this study and will be&#xD;
      advised that with their verbal consent, their contact details can be passed onto a research&#xD;
      team, who can contact them to discuss the study further and answer any questions they may&#xD;
      have. If needed, the usual hospital interpreter and translator services will be available to&#xD;
      assist with discussion of the trial, the participant information sheets, and consent forms,&#xD;
      but the consent forms and information sheets will not be available printed in other&#xD;
      languages. Potential participants will be given at least 48 hours to decide on whether they&#xD;
      wish to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants may also be approached by way of invitation letter sent to them from&#xD;
      their Clinician or a member of the research team, inviting them to consider taking part. A&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheet will also be included with this letter. Patients identified&#xD;
      through their records by the CI who is also their clinician will be contacted by one of the&#xD;
      clinical team who will check/confirm they are in receipt of the letter and discuss the study&#xD;
      further, answer any queries and see if they are interested in taking part. They can also&#xD;
      contact the study team if they are interested in taking part or leave their contact details&#xD;
      so a research nurse can then contact them to discuss the study and /or arrange an appointment&#xD;
      to come in for a study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also approach participants admitted following Covid-19 related hospital&#xD;
      admission to the Nottingham University Hospitals trust, though these patients will be&#xD;
      required to wait 5-7 months following discharge to commence study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient who decides to take part in the study will be given an appointment for a study&#xD;
      visit; at the start of which, a research fellow (medic), fully trained in the study&#xD;
      procedures and informed consent will take consent, participants will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      speak to a medically trained doctor if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to recruit volunteers who haven't contracted with Covid, investigators will use our&#xD;
      study flyer with relevant contact details, and will advertise on Nottingham University&#xD;
      Hospitals and University of Nottingham campuses, in local press, in departmental Facebook and&#xD;
      Twitter posts and in any departmental mailing/ emailing lists to people who have agreed to be&#xD;
      contacted with such information. A summary of the research study will also be provided on the&#xD;
      designated website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be explained to all potential participant that entry into the trial is entirely&#xD;
      voluntary and that their treatment and care will not be affected by their decision. It will&#xD;
      also be explained that they can withdraw at any time but attempts will be made to avoid this&#xD;
      occurrence. In the event of their withdrawal it will be explained that their study research&#xD;
      data collected so far cannot be erased and investigators will seek consent to use the data in&#xD;
      the final analyses where appropriate. It will be possible to link the withdrawn participant&#xD;
      to the log and consent form. However, any personal information, such as contact details will&#xD;
      be removed appropriately. Participants that are withdrawn from the study will be replaced&#xD;
      with new volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo a series of tests including:&#xD;
