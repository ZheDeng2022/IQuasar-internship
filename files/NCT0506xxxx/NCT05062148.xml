    <textblock>
      This research is being done to understand the role of different recovery methods in healing&#xD;
      time after athletic or sports related concussion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to assess PCS symptoms and how those symptoms are affected by&#xD;
      Float-REST and PBM therapy in comparison to standard recovery practices. To do this, the&#xD;
      investigators will operate in four phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Initial Injury: High school aged athletes will be recruited from a WVU clinic in&#xD;
      the acute phase of the athletes injury. Severe cases such as those with hemorrhaging and&#xD;
      memory loss will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Pre-intervention: Patients will be randomly assigned using R software&#xD;
      (https://www.r-project.org) to three groups - Float-REST, PBM, or no intervention. Upon each&#xD;
      subjects' first visit to Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI) a brief health&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the mechanism of injury will be administered (see below), the&#xD;
      Rivermead Postconcussive Symptom Inventory (Rivermead), and the pre-intervention testing&#xD;
      battery. All subjects will be instructed to complete the Rivermead as a daily log on a&#xD;
      smartphone to monitor symptoms and follow the physician's orders for recovery (limited screen&#xD;
      time, decreased homework load, etc.). Subjects will also be given a wearable sleep tracking&#xD;
      device and instructed to wear it each night. Float-REST subjects will be shown the float&#xD;
      tanks and will be given the opportunity to float for 5-10 minutes to become familiar with the&#xD;
      sensation. PBM subjects will be shown the PBM bed and be permitted to test the brightness of&#xD;
      the device. All subjects wishing to test either the PBM or the Float-REST will be required to&#xD;
      take the SCAT5 Symptom Checklist first and not meet the exclusionary criteria contained in&#xD;
      the Data Monitoring Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III - Intervention: All subjects will return to RNI three times per week. Subjects&#xD;
      receiving Float-REST will float for 60 minutes, those receiving PBM will undergo a 20-minute&#xD;
      therapy session, and both will complete the weekly testing (Table 1) afterwards. Subjects in&#xD;
      the no intervention group will complete the weekly testing only. This will continue until the&#xD;
      subjects' physicians clear them to return to play. The duration for return to play is an&#xD;
      outcome measure of interest as it will expectedly vary subject to subject. If a recovery&#xD;
      intervention is capable of shortening the time an athlete takes to return to competition,&#xD;
      that particular intervention may be considered an effective strategy for accelerating&#xD;
      recovery periods after sustaining a sports-related concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV - Post-intervention: Once a subject has been cleared to return to play, the subject&#xD;
      will come to RNI one final time and complete the post-concussion battery (Table 1). Upon&#xD;
      completion, all patient's scores will be analyzed using R software&#xD;
      (https://www.r-project.org). It is expected that those receiving Float-REST and/or PBM will&#xD;
      have a greater improvement of cognitive scores than those just following physician orders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study: When the physician provides a medical clearance for the athlete to return to&#xD;
      competition that will subsequently cease further data collection for that individual for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
