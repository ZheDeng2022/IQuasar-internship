  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To learn about patient barriers to accessing genetic medicine, we will analyze anonymous&#xD;
      posts from a membership-based online community [Inspire.com], and investigate how these&#xD;
      barriers differ for various populations. We will then test whether these barriers can be&#xD;
      addressed by providing online access to a genetic counselor to answer patient questions for&#xD;
      one group of patients (virtual advisory board group) and compare to that of a control group&#xD;
      who does not have access to a genetic counselor (virtual peer-to-peer board group).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Genomic medicine has the potential to advance diagnoses, predict risk, support prevention&#xD;
      efforts, and inform treatment decision-making. Though technologies for measuring genetic&#xD;
      variants have improved and become more cost-effective, clinical integration of genomic&#xD;
      medicine has been surprisingly slow. For genomic medicine to be successfully implemented&#xD;
      across specialties and across demographics, the systemic barriers that patients experience&#xD;
      need to be identified and addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online health support is becoming an increasingly important part of healthcare as more&#xD;
      patients use digital health networks. In the first part of this study, an analysis of online&#xD;
      communication in a membership-based online support community [Inspire.com] will identify&#xD;
      systemic, structural and individual barriers to accessing genomic medicine. A genetic&#xD;
      counselor will be informed to these results and will be part of the intervention arm of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the extent to which online health networks can directly help genomic medicine&#xD;
      implementation, participants will join one of two Virtual Discussion Boards (a Virtual&#xD;
      Advisory Board and a Virtual Peer-to-Peer Discussion Board). In the intervention arm, the&#xD;
      Virtual Advisory Board will have a genetic counselor answer patient questions online about&#xD;
      genomic medicine once every week for a period of three months. In the control arm,&#xD;
      participants will answer and comment on each others' questions in the Virtual Peer-to-Peer&#xD;
      Discussion Board. We hypothesize that after six months, patients who participate in the&#xD;
      Virtual Advisory Board are more likely to self-report receiving genomic medicine than those&#xD;
      in the control arm. After completion of the study, participants in the Peer-to-Peer&#xD;
      Discussion Board, we will give online access to the genetic counselor to answer any questions&#xD;
