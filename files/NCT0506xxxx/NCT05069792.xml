  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Lung cancer is the predominant cancer type worldwide in terms of incidence and&#xD;
      mortality. Novel treatment techniques are continuously being developed, all of which need&#xD;
      thorough evaluation before they can be implemented in clinical routine. The gold standard&#xD;
      design for such evaluation is the randomized controlled trial (RCT), but this design has&#xD;
      shown many challenges, particularly in the oncology setting. The 'Trials within Cohorts'&#xD;
      (TwiCs) design, previously referred to as 'cohort multiple RCT' (cmRCT), is a promising&#xD;
      design enabling multiple (simultaneous) randomized evaluations of experimental interventions,&#xD;
      with advantages for recruitment, comparability, and long-term outcome data collection. This&#xD;
      design will speed up the process of translating treatment innovations in daily clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: 1) To collect information on patient characteristics, short- and long-term&#xD;
      clinical and patient-reported outcomes; and 2) to create an infrastructure for efficient,&#xD;
      fast, and pragmatic randomized evaluation of new interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational, prospective cohort study, according to the 'TwiCs' design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients with lung cancer referred to the Department of Pulmonology or&#xD;
      the Department of Radiotherapy of the UMC Utrecht.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Clinical parameters (performance status, co-morbidity,&#xD;
      oncological history, symptoms, imaging, technical and treatment data), clinical endpoints&#xD;
      (toxicity, reintervention and survival), and patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basis of the TwiCs approach is an observational prospective cohort, consisting of&#xD;
      patients with the same condition of interest, who undergo standard treatment. The patient&#xD;
      characteristics are captured at baseline, and clinical and patient-reported outcome measures&#xD;
      are captured at fixed time points. When a new intervention is ready for formal evaluation,&#xD;
      eligible patients within the observational cohort are identified. From this so-called&#xD;
      sub-cohort, patients will be randomly selected to undergo the new intervention. The other&#xD;
      eligible patients will not be approached and undergo the standard treatment. Outcomes of the&#xD;
      selected patients receiving the new intervention will be compared with the outcomes of the&#xD;
      non-selected patients receiving the standard treatment. Within this cohort, the same process&#xD;
      can be simultaneously repeated for other interventions. Advantages of the TwiCs design&#xD;
      include ongoing information as to the natural history of the condition and to treatment as&#xD;
      usual, the ability to facilitate multiple simultaneous randomized evaluations, the improved&#xD;
      comparability between trials, and the patient-centered informed consent procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By setting up the prospective U-COLOR cohort (Utrecht COhort for Lung cancer Outcome&#xD;
      Reporting and trial inclusion), we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gather data on natural disease progression, treatment response, disease recurrence,&#xD;
           complications, quality of life and survival of patients with lung cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect a patient group willing to participate in studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facilitate multiple, parallel randomized controlled trials within the cohort.&#xD;
