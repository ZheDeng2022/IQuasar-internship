  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are areas of epidermal discontinuity in lower limbs with causes of venous,&#xD;
      arterial, diabetic, pressure, traumatic, allergic, or inflammation. Chronic venous leg ulcers&#xD;
      (VLUs) are defined as leg ulcers persisting for 4 weeks or more, a.k.a C6 in CEAP&#xD;
      classification of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and account for up to 70% of all chronic&#xD;
      leg ulcers exhibiting overall prevalence of up to 2% in the general population of western&#xD;
      countries with significant morbidity and a negative socioeconomic impact. Wound care,&#xD;
      debridement, bed rest with leg elevation, and compression are basic approaches for chronic&#xD;
      VLUs. Meanwhile, numerous medical and surgical interventions were developed to promote wound&#xD;
      healing and to prevent recurrence by focusing on pathophysiology of chronic VLUs. However,&#xD;
      many strategies just have adjuvant effects or exert debatable benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lymphatic system been considered important for removal of excessive fluid from the&#xD;
      interstitial space, absorption of fat from the intestine and the immune system, actively&#xD;
      involved in regulation of immune cell trafficking and inflammation. Emerging lymphovenous&#xD;
      bypass (LVB), a supermicrosurgical technique diverting lymphatic drainage into venous system&#xD;
      in dealing with lymphedema, not only restores TH1 and TH2 imbalance, but decreases oxidative&#xD;
      stress and increases antioxidant capacity in the serum of lymphedema patients. Clinically,&#xD;
      LVB could be an alternative treatment option for patients with lymphorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these facts, the investigators hypothesis that lymphatic hypertension and lymph&#xD;
      impregnation contributes chronic venous leg ulcer formation and propose a novel strategy,&#xD;
      using LVB to treat patients with refractory/recurrent chronic VLUs. The preliminary results&#xD;
      revealed promising results and the investigators would go on clinical trials.&#xD;
