  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is a life-saving emergency&#xD;
      procedure that is highly suited for simulation-based training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the validity of our REBOA simulator with virtual coach (or live&#xD;
      quantitative feedback) for mastery learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Virtual coach is non-inferior in REBOA training to an average human instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Virtual coach is inferior in REBOA training to an average human instructor. We expect to&#xD;
      learn whether the virtual coach is non-inferior to an average human instructor for US-guided&#xD;
      REBOA training. Additionally, we expect to find which determinants affect success rate most&#xD;
      and to assess the needs for the current simulator system's future software development.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multi-center randomized simulation study. Setting, location,&#xD;
      participants: This multi-center study will be held at University of Florida (UF) Health and&#xD;
      Madigan Health centers. Planned time is between June 01 to October 31, 2021. The study&#xD;
      population will be trainees (students, residents, fellows, and physicians) working at UF&#xD;
      Health Center and Madigan Health Center. Exclusion criteria are: i. not obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent, ii. inability to complete all the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeframe of training and data collection: June 01 to October 31, 2021 Learner or trainee&#xD;
      population: Learners will be healthcare staff in two hosting institutions. Trainers will be&#xD;
      the academic staff from UF Health and Madigan Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development and pilot testing of assessment tool: REBOA simulator will be developed at the&#xD;
      Center for Safety, Simulation, and Advanced Learning Technologies (CSSALT). Pilot testing&#xD;
      will be on primary team members. The trainer will play confederate nurse role and assist the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychometric properties of previously developed and pilot tested tools: The hosting center&#xD;
      (CSSALT) has developed a central venous access (CVA) simulator with a virtual coach. The same&#xD;
      simulator development technology (SMMARTS) will be used in the proposed project. Study team&#xD;
      has prior data regarding psychometric properties of previously developed simulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rater training to use assessment tools and scores consistently: The simulator has a limit for&#xD;
      the number of instruments (4) to be tracked. Therefore, the it will track the procedures that&#xD;
      occur under the skin out of a human instructor's sight by the simulator's software, whereas&#xD;
      the procedures that are visible by the trainers are not automatically tracked by the&#xD;
      software. There will therefore be two rating systems: One is by trainers or assistants (T)&#xD;
      and the other is by the simulator's software (SS). Rating by SS will be electronically and&#xD;
      automatically scored. The study team will train the in-person trainers prior to study to&#xD;
      score the learners consistently. For this purpose, the study will plan an online training for&#xD;
      trainers prior to the data collection phase to obtain consistent rating of the participants.&#xD;
      Based on the current literature, ratings will be based on these items and rating systems,&#xD;
      which are given in parentheses for each item:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Sheath insertion with Seldinger technique i. Sheath priming (T) ii. Ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      puncture (SS) iii. Sheath guidewire insertion (T) iv. Sheath insertion: Participants receive&#xD;
      &quot;fail&quot; grade if they did not complete this item successfully to common femoral artery (CFA)&#xD;
      or inserted to the common femoral vein (CFV) (SS) b. Balloon insertion i. Balloon priming (T&#xD;
      and SS) ii. Balloon test: Participants receive &quot;fail&quot; grade if they inflated the balloon&#xD;
      during preparation (T and SS) iii. Balloon position measurement using body landmarks (SS) iv.&#xD;
      Balloon inflation (SS) v. Final balloon position (SS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the reported items above, we will track several items to build a better&#xD;
      training system. The virtual coaching system of the SMMARTS simulator will automatically&#xD;
      capture and store the data required for the study including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Balloon inflation volume: We developed a syringe simulator system. (SS) b. Inflation of&#xD;
      the balloon with saline [Zone 1: 8 mL (cc) Zone 3: 2 mL (cc)] (SS) c. Observe the simulated&#xD;
      blood pressure monitor to see the increase of the blood pressure. (SS) d. Timeframes (SS) e.&#xD;
      Back walling (SS) f. Precise discrimination of the Zone where the balloon was inflated. (SS)&#xD;
      g. Puncturing: i. Needle tip remains in femoral artery from time of arterial access to&#xD;
      guidewire placement (SS) ii. Needle tip completely in US plane at time of arterial puncture.&#xD;
      (SS) iii. Needle angle to the skin surface at vascular access. (SS) iv. Advancing needle&#xD;
      while the tip is outside the ultrasound insonation plane. (SS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard setting methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clear definition of mastery: Mastery is defined as two consecutive successful applications of&#xD;
      Prytime REBOA catheter in two different Zones; one is for Zone 1 and the other is to Zone 3.&#xD;
      Using right or left groin does not matter. The participant can apply on the same side, or do&#xD;
      the second try using the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of scoring rules: Scoring will be based on the measurements by the simulator&#xD;
      software and ratings by trainer. These items include but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clear definition of how minimum passing standards were set: Minimum passing standards are set&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insert two REBOA catheters Without complications (venous puncture, inflating balloon in wrong&#xD;
      zone or volume) Within 240 seconds from hitting the start button to secure the REBOA&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of curriculum development including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teaching tools: An experienced clinician will be the instructor with online training. The&#xD;
      instructor will explain the study and simulator through an online presentation to the&#xD;
      participants. Volunteers will sign the informed consent if they agree to participate. The&#xD;
      instructor will present an online didactic course to participants. Online training will be&#xD;
      recorded and available to the participants at any stage of the study for their reference.&#xD;
      Then participants will take the &quot;Guay Visualization of Views Test&quot; (limited to 8 minutes) to&#xD;
      assess their spatial abilities. Afterwards, participants will start hands-on training. One&#xD;
      simulator will be set up in a specific room for the study with the required equipment.&#xD;
      Participants will practice one-by-one, and they will be able to schedule hands-on training&#xD;
      time based on mutual availability of the instructor and participant. The training&#xD;
      intervention is expected to be completed in 4 months. Every participant will practice until&#xD;
      mastery is achieved. (see Figure 1). There will be no control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two groups (see Figure 1) with a simple randomization&#xD;
      using a random number table. One group will be trained by an average human instructor and the&#xD;
      other group will be trained by the virtual coach. In some institutions like UF, there are&#xD;
      scoring systems for the assessment of instructors, e.g., by residents. Some instructors are&#xD;
      excellent, but some are not. The instructor's performance may affect the results of the&#xD;
      simulation studies. Therefore the study proposes to include instructors within the normal&#xD;
      ranges of assessment (not the worst or the best) and term them as 'average instructor.'&#xD;
      Baseline assessment: First try of the participants at placing a REBOA on the simulator will&#xD;
      be the baseline measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature of practice (e.g. duration, intensity, individuals or team): The hands-on training&#xD;
      session to mastery is expected to be under 3 hours for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback/debriefing (source, type, frequency): After each try, the instructor or virtual&#xD;
      coach will provide feedback and a 3-minute debriefing based on the simulator's software&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-training assessment with minimum passing standards (MPS): After every try, the trainer&#xD;
      and the simulator's software will report the participant's score based on MPS Stakes for&#xD;
      participants: During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants run the risk of infection during&#xD;
      training. We will conduct online orientation and didactic training via cloud-based video&#xD;
      communications apps. Participants will undergo hands-on training sessions individually. If&#xD;
      the pandemic is not resolved, both instructor and trainee will stay 6 feet apart and use face&#xD;
      covers. Hands-on training may also be risky for COVID-19 infection. Participants will take&#xD;
      the training one-by-one and clean the simulator with disinfectant after completing the&#xD;
      training. The simulator and the handheld tools will be cleaned and wiped down with 55%&#xD;
      Isopropyl Alcohol between participants. This study will be voluntary. If a trainee or a staff&#xD;
      member opts not to participate, they will not be penalized in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the REBOA simulator with a virtual&#xD;
      coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Define the time required for a complete REBOA insertion on a simulator ii. Define the time&#xD;
      required the time to mastery iii. Define the complication rates in the simulator iv.&#xD;
      Association of success rates and complications on the simulator to spatial ability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The study conducted a power analysis/sample size calculation for a&#xD;
      non-inferiority analysis on the difference in two independent proportions, assuming α=.05,&#xD;
      power=.95, a high success rate expected for both groups (99%) and a non-inferiority margin of&#xD;
      15% (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/power/binary-noninferior/ [Accessed March 26, 2021]).&#xD;
      Sample size required per group is 10. The investigators decided to include a total of 28&#xD;
      participants to the study. The non-inferiority margin is set so that a difference bigger than&#xD;
      this limit would matter in clinical practice. It is usually assumed that the success&#xD;
      proportion is the same in both groups unless there is good reason to believe that one&#xD;
      treatment is, in fact, superior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses: The investigators will use SPSS for statistical analysis. Yahya A.&#xD;
      Acar, MD, will perform the analysis. Demographic data will be presented as frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages. Continuous variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses used to assess: The chi-square test will be used for the comparison of two groups&#xD;
      concerning categorical variables. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the dependent t-test will be&#xD;
      used for pairwise comparisons (first and last measurements) of continuous data that do not&#xD;
      conform to a normal distribution. Logistic regression analysis will be used to identify&#xD;
      factors independently predictive of success. Those factors remaining in the model will be&#xD;
      used in a set of linear scores. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) will be&#xD;
      constructed for each model, and the areas under the curve will be calculated.&#xD;
