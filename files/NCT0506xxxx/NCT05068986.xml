           liver disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the study participants will be subjected to an educational asthma program for 3 months to&#xD;
      provide parents and children with information and skills to manage their asthma, through&#xD;
      avoiding triggers, training in the correct use of medicines, including inhaler technique,&#xD;
