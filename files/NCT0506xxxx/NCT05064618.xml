  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an important component of the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment. The most common notion in the CAF research field has been that CAFs promote&#xD;
      cancer progression through various mechanisms. Interestingly, however, recent studies have&#xD;
      revealed that CAFs are heterogeneous and that CAF subsets that suppress cancer progression&#xD;
      (cancer-restraining CAFs [rCAFs]) must exist in addition to well-characterized&#xD;
      cancer-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). However, the identity and specific markers of rCAFs have not&#xD;
      been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently identified Meflin as a specific marker protein of rCAFs in&#xD;
      pancreatic and colon cancers. The investigator's studies revealed that rCAFs are similar to a&#xD;
      small subset of resident fibroblasts, which is consistent with the famous hypothesis proposed&#xD;
      by Micheal Stoker (University of Glasgow) more than 50 years ago, stating that static normal&#xD;
      fibroblasts suppress tumor growth. Interestingly, The investigator's lineage tracing&#xD;
      experiments showed that Meflin-positive rCAFs differentiate into Meflin-negative pCAFs during&#xD;
      cancer progression. These studies revealed that the tumor stroma is comprised of pCAFs and&#xD;
      rCAFs, which is analogous to the heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (e.g.,&#xD;
      protumor regulatory T cells versus antitumor cytotoxic T cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of the rCAF marker Meflin enabled the investigators to develop new&#xD;
      strategies to convert or reprogram pCAFs to rCAFs. Using a pharmacological approach, The&#xD;
      investigators performed a chemical library screen and identified Am80, a synthetic unnatural&#xD;
      retinoid, as a reagent that effectively converts Meflin-negative pCAFs to Meflin-positive&#xD;
      rCAFs. Am80 administration improved the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics. These data suggested that the conversion of pCAF to rCAFs may represent a&#xD;
      new strategy for pancreatic cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The object of this study is to perform an investigator-initiated clinical study to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of AM80 on pancreatic cancer with a combination of conventional&#xD;
      tumoricidal agents including gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
