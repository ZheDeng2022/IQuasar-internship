  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal: Various studies suggest a negative association between spatial neglect and motor&#xD;
      outcomes after stroke (Barrett &amp; Muzaffar 2014) (Kwakkel 2014). Our goal is to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The longitudinal interaction of the recovery of spatial neglect with the recovery of&#xD;
           motor function and outcomes (such as paresis, sitting balance and standing balance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the association is different across the different subtypes of spatial neglect&#xD;
           (visuospatial/personal/ADL-related)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The role of compensation strategies for balance control in patients with spatial neglect&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, we will perform a longitudinal cohort study in which we will repetitively assess&#xD;
      post-stroke patients using a comprehensive assessment approach for both spatial neglect and&#xD;
      motor outcomes. With regards to neglect, we will evaluate various aspects of both&#xD;
      visuospatial and personal neglect. For motor outcomes, we will combine clinical and&#xD;
      instrumented (biomechanical) assessment methods to evaluate post-stroke recovery of leg&#xD;
      paresis, (sitting and standing) balance and gait.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spatial neglect is a post-stroke disorder characterized by impaired awareness for stimuli&#xD;
      located on the contralesional side of space. This neglect results in problems with reporting,&#xD;
      responding or orienting toward contralesional stimuli, which cannot be explained by sensory&#xD;
      or motor impairments. It can be present after a right- or left-sided brain lesion but is more&#xD;
      frequently present in right-sided brain lesions. Within the first 2 weeks post-stroke, it&#xD;
      occurs in approximately 50% of patients. Spontaneous neurological recovery of neglect follows&#xD;
      a natural logistic pattern of improvement within the first 12 to 14 weeks post-stroke.&#xD;
      Afterward, the curve flattens and the severity remains merely invariant, leaving 40% of&#xD;
      patients with initial neglect still with symptoms at 1 year post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high frequency and persistence of spatial neglect might have major consequences; indeed,&#xD;
      various studies suggest a negative association between spatial neglect and post-stroke&#xD;
      recovery of motor function and abilities. Apart from the seemingly suppressive influence of&#xD;
      VSN on the recovery of upper-limb strength and synergy acquisition, lower limb motor&#xD;
      recovery, balance and functional mobility might also be affected. However, the longitudinal&#xD;
      interactions between spatial neglect and lower limb motor recovery are complex and only&#xD;
      partially understood, owing to a lack of prospective cohort studies evaluating this.&#xD;
      Additionally, also the association between spatial neglect and balance and functional&#xD;
      mobility is currently unclear. A comprehensive overview is lacking, even though both balance&#xD;
      and functional mobility are likely to be affected in these patients. Indeed, spatial neglect&#xD;
      is characterised by a spatial (orientational) bias of attention. This bias might reflect a&#xD;
      disruption in spatial information processing, which is a neural process incorporating sensory&#xD;
      information from multiple modalities, resolving sensory ambiguity and integrating afferent&#xD;
      and efferent information. A bias in this information processing might impede postural control&#xD;
      and therefore also balance and mobility. However, whether spatial neglect and these motor&#xD;
      outcomes are longitudinally associated, and whether such association is similar for the&#xD;
      different spatial neglect subtypes, is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The longitudinal interaction of the recovery of spatial neglect with the recovery of&#xD;
           motor function and outcomes (such as paresis, sitting balance and standing balance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the association is different across the different subtypes of spatial neglect&#xD;
           (visuospatial/personal/ADL-related)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The role of compensation strategies for balance control in patients with spatial neglect&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, we will perform a longitudinal cohort study in which we will repetitively assess&#xD;
      post-stroke patients using a comprehensive assessment approach for both spatial neglect and&#xD;
      motor outcomes. With regards to neglect, we will evaluate various aspects of both&#xD;
      visuospatial and personal neglect. For motor outcomes, we will combine clinical and&#xD;
      instrumented (biomechanical) assessment methods to evaluate post-stroke recovery of leg&#xD;
      paresis, (sitting and standing) balance and gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: as early as possible after stroke on fixed time-points post-stroke as&#xD;
      recommended by the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable (internationally renowned&#xD;
      field experts). We include patients at: ≤14 days, 3 weeks, or 5 weeks post-stroke. Inclusion&#xD;
      in RevArte rehabilitation hospital, UZA, GZA St-Augustinus, GZA St-Vincentius and Reva Geel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: include measures for spatial neglect, motor function and balance/mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: linear mixed models will be fitted to evaluate study results and therefore&#xD;
      mean change over time.&#xD;
