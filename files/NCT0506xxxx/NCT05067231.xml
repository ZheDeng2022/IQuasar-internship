      The UAB Cardiovascular Research Biobank (CARBON) will be a resource that contains biological&#xD;
      materials, such as DNA samples, in addition to health and personal information on a large&#xD;
      number of people over time. It will be set up so that it can be used in the future as a&#xD;
      resource for researchers undertaking a wide range of medical research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The UAB Cardiovascular Research Biobank (CARBON) will be a resource that contains pertinent&#xD;
      genetic, health, and biological samples such as blood derived from a large-scale population.&#xD;
      Researchers may use disease correlates and predictors identified from the genetic, health,&#xD;
      and personal information contained in the Biobank as a resource to investigate cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, hypertension, diabetes, and a myriad of other disorders. Through these studies,&#xD;
      researchers may identify the progression of risk factors in certain diseases and help develop&#xD;
      novel strategies to detect, treat, or prevent such diseases. In addition, the Biobank serves&#xD;
      as a valuable tool to assess how certain treatments may respond differently to individuals as&#xD;
      a result of genotypic differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have demonstrated that lower natriuretic peptide (NP) levels are associated&#xD;
      with a decreased insulin sensitivity and have a causal role in the development of diabetes&#xD;
      and have also shown that certain populations, such as African Americans, have relatively low&#xD;
      NP levels, which may contribute to their underlying risk for insulin resistance. Since NPs&#xD;
      play an important role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, one can infer that&#xD;
      relatively low NP levels are an important biological contributor to the high prevalence rates&#xD;
      of cardiometabolic disease in African Americans. The Biobank will contain genetic information&#xD;
      concerning the presence of gene variants that encode NPs.&#xD;
