  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV (PLWH) are 28 times more likely to be diagnosed with Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus (HPV) - associated anal cancer than the general population. The HPV vaccine is&#xD;
      an effective and safe approach to prevent and reduce the risk of HPV-related disease among&#xD;
      PLWH. HPV vaccine programs tailored and implemented in the HIV population are lagging for&#xD;
      this high-risk group. The CDC's 4 Pillars Transformation Program is a multi-level,&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention that has been successfully used to increase HPV vaccination in&#xD;
      the general population and is ready to be tested in the high-risk HIV population,&#xD;
      particularly PLWH in the rural South. This program offers providers and clinic staff&#xD;
      evidence-based strategies to increase HPV vaccination uptake via training and educational&#xD;
      resources. This study proposes to tailor and refine the 4 Pillars Program and do this project&#xD;
      in three HIV clinics in Georgia (AID Atlanta, AID Newnan, and Albany Model Rural HIV Clinic)&#xD;
      and enroll n=365 PLWH who are age 18-45 years from those clinics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People living with HIV (PLWH) are 28 times more likely to be diagnosed with HPV- associated&#xD;
      anal cancer than the general population. The HPV vaccine is an effective and safe approach to&#xD;
      prevent and reduce the risk of HPV-related disease among PLWH. However, in previous pilot&#xD;
      studies, there were significant gaps found in knowledge and awareness of the HPV vaccine as&#xD;
      well as low receipt of the HPV vaccine (13.5%) in our population of rural PLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV vaccine programs tailored and implemented in the HIV population are lagging for this&#xD;
      high-risk group. The Center for Disease Control's (CDC) 4 Pillars Transformation Program is a&#xD;
      multi-level, evidence-based intervention that has been successfully used to increase HPV&#xD;
      vaccination in the general population and is ready to be tested in the high-risk HIV&#xD;
      population, particularly PLWH in the rural South. Thus, this study proposes to tailor and&#xD;
      refine the 4 Pillars Program and do this project in three HIV clinics in Georgia (AID&#xD;
      Atlanta, AID Newnan, and Albany Model Rural HIV Clinic) and enroll n=365 PLWH who are age&#xD;
      18-45 years from those clinics. To be included in the study, interested participants must&#xD;
      meet the following criteria: Patients enrolled in the study will meet the following criteria:&#xD;
      1) HIV positive; 2) 18-45 years of age; 3) read and speak English; 4) capable of informed&#xD;
      consent; 5) have not been previously received the three series HPV vaccine; 6) no&#xD;
      contraindications to receiving the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 Pillars Program offers providers and clinic staff evidence-based strategies to increase&#xD;
      HPV vaccination uptake via training and educational resources. Providers and clinic staff who&#xD;
      are interested in participating will &quot;enroll&quot; online and complete an electronic informed&#xD;
      consent before participating in the focus groups and completing the evaluation surveys.&#xD;
      Providers and clinic staff will be offered an opportunity participate in an in-service&#xD;
      training (CE units will be available) that will provide education and resources on the 4&#xD;
      Pillars program and will learn more about HPV, HPV vaccination, and HPV-associated cancers.&#xD;
      Providers and clinic staff will be asked to recommend and administer the HPV vaccine during&#xD;
      each routine clinic visit. Consenting providers and clinic staff will be asked to complete&#xD;
      pre-intervention evaluations, an intervention evaluation every 3 months, a post-evaluation,&#xD;
      and post-intervention evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patient enrollment, the research coordinator, with assistance from a clinic-designated&#xD;
      Immunization Champion (IC), will review the clinic's appointment schedule to call patients in&#xD;
      the target age range (18- 45 years of age) one week in advance of their appointments to&#xD;
      inform them of the study and to determine eligibility. If eligible and interested in the&#xD;
      proposed study, the individual will be given an overview of the research study, including&#xD;
      purpose, what participation entails, potential risks and benefits of participation, and&#xD;
      measures that will be used to ensure confidentiality. Participants will be assured&#xD;
      participation is completely voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time&#xD;
      without consequences. If the individual volunteers to participate in the study, an electronic&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained by the research assistant(s) via REDCap. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to consent to have their HPV vaccination status confirmed via electronic medical&#xD;
      records and GRITS. Participants will then watch a short video on HPV and HPV vaccines that&#xD;
      can be viewed on their phones (or the clinic's iPad) while waiting to be seen. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be asked to &quot;follow&quot; the study's private Facebook page which will offer&#xD;
      additional educational information tailored towards individuals with HIV on HPV-related&#xD;
      disease and general health promotion and risk reduction tips. A post-intervention evaluation&#xD;
      will be provided after the third immunization is given or due (if missed).&#xD;

The Control arm will be collected from EMR and the GRITS database from patients not receiving the vaccine before the intervention period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The CDC's 4 Pillars Transformation Program (4 Pillars Program) is a robust and empirically supported strategic approach that promotes the uptake of adult vaccinations and addresses facilitators and barriers at the patient, provider, and clinic level. This multi-level, evidence-based intervention has been successfully utilized to increase HPV vaccination in the general population and is primed to be tested in the high-risk HIV population, particularly PLWH in the rural South. This proposal seeks to expand the success of the 4 Pillars Program and tailor, refine, and implement in the HIV positive population who are at extraordinarily high risk for HPV-related cancers and can obtain the most benefit from the vaccine.</description>
