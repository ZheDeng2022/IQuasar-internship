  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Biomarker study will be conducted (i) to establish biomarker profiles that reflect the&#xD;
      daily diet and regularly dietary habits, (ii) to complement self-reported dietary habits and&#xD;
      (iii) to reduce gaps between self-reported information and real dietary intake. The study&#xD;
      aims to assess relationships between defined nutrient intake (four groups: 1. Milk and dairy&#xD;
      products, 2. Whole-grain products (rich in soluble fibers), 3. Sausage and processed meat&#xD;
      (pork), 4. Meat-free sausage and meat alternatives (based on egg, soy) and resulting&#xD;
      biochemical markers in human samples (plasma, serum, 24 h urine). In a next step, we will&#xD;
      focus on unraveling the connection of the established diet-related metabolites with&#xD;
      biomarkers of health and disease status, with focus on cardiovascular diseases (CVD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the scope of the present study, biomarkers or biomarker profiles are to be identified&#xD;
      which reflect the daily diet and eating habits (focus: mixed diet / Western diet,&#xD;
      vegetarians, vegans) in order to supplement or complete the information from diet protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen study design enables relationships between a defined nutrient intake in the form&#xD;
      of a standardized diet over five days (four groups with 40 subjects each; group 1: Milk and&#xD;
      dairy products, group 2: Whole grain products (rich in soluble fiber), group 3: Sausage and&#xD;
      processed meat (pork), group 4: Meat-free sausage and meat alternatives (based on egg, soy)&#xD;
      and the resulting biochemical markers in the human samples (plasma, serum, whole blood,&#xD;
      24-hour urine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, one subgroup (n = 12) consumed a test meal with the study foods on day 6 after&#xD;
      the 5-day standardized diet. Before the test meal (time 0) and at intervals of 30, 60, 120,&#xD;
      180 min, blood samples are taken (postprandial profiling) in order to examine the brief&#xD;
      increase in nutrients from the study foods in the human samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is i) to validate already established biomarkers and ii) to identify new&#xD;
      biomarkers / patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the further course of the study, the identified and validated nutrition-associated&#xD;
      biomarkers are to be linked to parameters of the health and disease status, whereby in&#xD;
      particular the connection to cardiovascular risk factors and endpoints is considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study design enables an assessment of the physiological effects as a result&#xD;
      of an increased intake of the selected food (groups).&#xD;
