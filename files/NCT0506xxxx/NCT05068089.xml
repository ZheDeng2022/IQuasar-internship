    <textblock>
      Nutritional difficulties are common in children with neurodisabilities and can be associated&#xD;
      with malnutrition and gastrointestinal diseases, such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      (GERD) and constipation. Neurological disorders can be divided into two main categories:&#xD;
      progressive (neurodegenerative, mitochondrial disease) and non-progressive (cerebral palsy)&#xD;
      neurodisabilities; nature of the disorders can impair on the nutritional status of these&#xD;
      children. In 2017, ESGHAN published guidelines with specific nutritional claims.&#xD;
      Approximately 46%-90% of children with neurodisabilities suffer from malnutrition and an&#xD;
      enteral feeding is necessary to reach the nutritional requirements. In addition, a relevant&#xD;
      issue for these children is GERD, reaching up to 70% prevalence. The treatment of GERD could&#xD;
      be based on pharmacological therapy (protonic pomp inhibitor, PPI), on nutritional treatment&#xD;
      (changing type of formula) or on surgical treatment (Nissen Fundoplication). European&#xD;
      guidelines for GERD recommend PPI as the first line, with fundoplication being considered in&#xD;
      cases of failure of optimized medical therapy. Enteral feeding can be considered in order to&#xD;
      avoid malnutrition and is justified when other efforts to increase nutritional intake.&#xD;
      Enteral feeding can be provided by nasal tube at the beginning, but a gastrostomy feeding&#xD;
      tube would be preferred for a long-term nutrition (greater than six weeks). A jejunal tube&#xD;
      can be introduced through the gastrostomy; jejunal feeding is appropriate in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent vomiting and/or tube feeding-related aspiration, severe gastroesophageal reflux,&#xD;
      and gastroparesis. Different types of formulas can be used for enteral nutrition and can be&#xD;
      offered by nasal tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or percutaneous endoscopic&#xD;
      jejunostomy (PEJ). Whey-based formulas have been shown to empty from the stomach more rapidly&#xD;
      than casein-based formulas, which may be helpful for patients presenting with delayed gastric&#xD;
      emptying. Use of peptide-based, 100% whey protein formulas are associated with improved&#xD;
      feeding tolerance, increased consistency in meeting nutritional needs, and a reduction in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal issues associated with vomiting and aspiration of feeds. For these reasons,&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the role of different formulas against&#xD;
      Nissen fundoplication, regarding tolerance, utility, applicability and safeness of these&#xD;
      products, by performing a cost analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nutritional difficulties are common in children with severe motor and intellectual&#xD;
      disabilities (SMID) and can be associated with malnutrition, growth difficulties,&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies, osteopenia and nutritional comorbidities. In children with SMID,&#xD;
      neurological disorders can be divided into two main categories: progressive and&#xD;
      non-progressive neurodisabilities. Progressive neurological disorders feature a progressive&#xD;
      decline of functioning, which can occur over many years and decades, or more rapidly over&#xD;
      weeks and months. Such disorders include mitochondrial disorders, myopathies, disorders only&#xD;
      involving the spinal cord, or neuromuscular disorders and are likely to have a lifelong&#xD;
      course. On the other hand, non-progressive neurological disorders apparently do not feature a&#xD;
      progression of disease, as seen in the most common condition, infantile cerebral palsy (ICP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both progressive and non-progressive neurological disorders feature nutritional difficulties&#xD;
      following involvement of the central nervous system or neuromuscular disorders. In patients&#xD;
      with both conditions, oral motor dysfunction (involving tongue, chin or the whole mouth)&#xD;
      results in the development of feeding problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, gastrointestinal disturbances in these children reflect the interplay between the&#xD;
      central nervous system and the enteric nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, specific guidelines for the nutritional management of children with neurological&#xD;
      disease were published by the ESPGHAN. These guidelines mention the following five warning&#xD;
      signs (&quot;red flags&quot;) for the identification of nutritional issues in children with&#xD;
      neurological impairment: (1) physical signs of undernutrition (decubitus skin problems, poor&#xD;
      peripheral circulation), (2) weight for age Z-score &lt;-2, (3) triceps skinfold thickness &lt;10th&#xD;
      centile forage and sex, (4) mid-upper arm fat or muscle area &lt;10thcentile and (5) faltering&#xD;
      weight and/or failure to thrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines also suggest not to limit nutritional status assessment based on weight and height&#xD;
      alone, but to also perform evaluation of knee height or tibial length when height cannot be&#xD;
      measured, of fat mass by skinfold thickness, of BMD by DXA scans, and of micronutrient&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition is a relevant issue for children with SMID, with a reported 46%-90% prevalence&#xD;
      and multifactorial etiology, including inadequate dietary intake; gastro-oesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease (GERD); constipation; underlying neurological disability and relevant medications,&#xD;
      including antiepileptic drugs. More in detail, GERD in children with SMID is a well-described&#xD;
      phenomenon, reaching up to 70% prevalence and potentially resulting in aspiration pneumonia&#xD;
      and fatal outcomes. In these patients, GERD occurs as a result of impaired motility of&#xD;
      esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter (LOS), which lead to the development of&#xD;
      retrograde, regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On top of the underlying neurological impairment causing delayed gastric emptying and altered&#xD;
      esophageal motility, several other factors are involved, such as increased abdominal pressure&#xD;
      secondary to scoliosis, constipation and spasticity of abdominal musculature. As also&#xD;
      suggested by ESPGHAN, several diagnostic procedures should be considered to objectively&#xD;
      investigate GERD in children with neurological impairments (NI), such as upper GI endoscopy&#xD;
      and/or esophageal pH- or pH/multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring. As GERD is highly&#xD;
      prevalent, it can be useful to consider a short trial with PPIs: these drugs should be&#xD;
      considered as the first-line treatment, while use of prokinetic agents should be limited&#xD;
      owing to the weaker efficacy and higher incidence of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several treatments are available for GERD, including enteral mixtures containing whey&#xD;
      proteins; surgical treatments (Fundoplication according to Nissen, NF) are also available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition should be considered only following failure of other strategies aimed to&#xD;
      increase nutritional intake in order to reduce the risk of malnutrition. Children with NI&#xD;
      should preferably be provided long-term nutritional support by a gastrostomy feeding tube,&#xD;
      with gastrostomy to be reserved for cases in which enteral feeding is supposed to last more&#xD;
      than six weeks), or to increase weight, improve overall health and decrease feeding times for&#xD;
      children with neurological impairment. Caregivers might similarly have a beneficial effect&#xD;
      for quality of life. Laparotomy, laparoscopy or endoscopy can all be used for the placement&#xD;
      of a gastrostomy tube, with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) being at present the&#xD;
      most favored procedure. Tube placement, however, carries several risks, including infection,&#xD;
      perforation, bleeding, tube migration/dislocation, intestinal fistulas and obstruction. Over&#xD;
      time, the presence of a gastrostomy tube might lead to the development, or to the progression&#xD;
      to more severe forms of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another viable choice for patients who already have a gastrostomy is the placement of a&#xD;
      jejunal tube through the gastrostomy itself. However, as these tubes can migrate back to the&#xD;
      stomach or can incur tube obstruction or mechanical failure, jejunal tubes require careful&#xD;
      monitoring. Additionally, use of a jejunal tube should be considered only for patients who&#xD;
      cannot use other forms of enteral feeding, such as recurrent vomiting and/or tube&#xD;
      feeding-related aspiration, severe gastroesophageal reflux, and gastroparesis. Favorable&#xD;
      clinical outcomes were found following the use of combined gastric decompression via PEG and&#xD;
      simultaneous jejunal nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently of the strategy used (tube feeding, PEG or PEJ), several formulations are&#xD;
      available, most for which provide 1-2 kcal/ml, with or without fibre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPGHAN recommendations state that standard (1.0 kcal/mL) polymeric age-appropriate formula&#xD;
      including fiber should be used for children with NI older than 1 year, a high energy density&#xD;
      formula (1.5 kcal/mL) containing fiber in cases of poor volume tolerance and human milk, a&#xD;
      standard infant formula, or nutrient dense infant enteral formula as clinically indicated in&#xD;
      infants. Moreover, a low-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, and micronutrient replete formula for&#xD;
      the maintenance of enteral tube feeding after nutritional rehabilitation in immobile children&#xD;
      is recommended; and using a trial of whey-based formula in cases of gastroesophageal reflux,&#xD;
      gagging, and retching in children with NI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with delayed gastric emptying can have beneficial effects from whey-based formulas,&#xD;
      which based on the more rapid emptying than casein-based formulas. Additionally, some&#xD;
      populations might be preferentially treated with hydrolyzed over intact proteins. Feeding&#xD;
      tolerance is improved by the use of peptide-based, 100% whey protein formulas, and similarly&#xD;
      other beneficial effects, such as increased compliance to meeting nutritional needs and&#xD;
      reduction of gastrointestinal complications secondary to vomiting and feed aspiration, have&#xD;
      been reported. Patients with gastrointestinal illnesses, including pancreatic insufficiency&#xD;
      or malabsorption, should preferentially be treated with peptide-based diets, which can also&#xD;
      be useful for children with developmental delays in the absence of a definite diagnosis of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical management of GERD in NI children has historically been burdened by low compliance,&#xD;
      leading to the widespread use of surgical treatments such as a Nissens, Thal, Toupet or&#xD;
      Belsey fundoplication to provide relief from reflux. The fundoplication procedure is&#xD;
      performed by wrapping the stomach fundus around the gastro-oesophageal junction, therefore&#xD;
      creating an additional barrier to acid reflux: more in detail, the procedures involves&#xD;
      correction of hiatal herniation, lengthening of the intra-abdominal portion of the&#xD;
      oesophagus, and tightening of the crura, therefore increasing pressure at the LOS level.&#xD;
      According to the different extent of the operation, fundoplication procedures can provide&#xD;
      both a full 360° wrap and a partial 180° wrap. Fundoplication, however, has other&#xD;
      consequences, such as increasing the risk of vagal nerve damage which in turn can elicit the&#xD;
      emetic reflex, or promoting the onset of seizures or pulmonary disease secondary to increased&#xD;
      abdominal pressure or to the surgery itself. Other surgery-related complications include gas&#xD;
      bloat syndrome, impaired gastric accommodation, gastric hypersensitivity, rapid gastric&#xD;
      emptying (or 'dumping syndrome'), retching or dysphagia. Additionally, as NI children often&#xD;
      have other underlying conditions, such as epilepsy or scoliosis, the risk of failure of any&#xD;
      anti-reflux intervention should be considered: in these children, fundoplication has a high&#xD;
      failure rate, reaching up to 40%, and significant morbidity and mortality, with a 1% to 3%&#xD;
      mortality rate. Reflux might persist following fundoplication in about 12% to 30% of children&#xD;
      with NI, and almost two-thirds of treated children (59%) develop postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore unsurprising that ESPGHAN recommendations state that fundoplication should be&#xD;
      only considered in children with NI following failure of optimized medical therapy for GERD.&#xD;
      Indeed, beneficial effects can be obtained by anti-reflux surgery in children with confirmed&#xD;
      GERD who did not have clinical improvement despite adequate medical treatment, or who require&#xD;
      long treatment duration, who are non-compliant to medical therapy, or who have&#xD;
      life-threatening complications of GERD. Following failure of medical treatment, surgery is&#xD;
      most likely beneficial in children with asthma, recurrent aspiration, or other GERD-related&#xD;
      respiratory complications. If medical treatment achieves its target of controlling symptoms,&#xD;
      there is supposedly no additional benefit from antireflux surgery, also owing to the&#xD;
      aforementioned risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of treatment is based on clinical considerations which may vary between patient&#xD;
      and patients. The ESPGHAN guidelines recommend making a careful diagnosis of possible causes&#xD;
      and prescribing nutritional adaptation and therapeutic treatments (proton pump inhibitors,&#xD;
      PPIs) as first-line approaches, considering Nissen surgery only in case of failure of medical&#xD;
      therapy / nutritional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the clinical management of children with neurological impairments could be&#xD;
      variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As shown, enteral nutrition through specific formulas seems to be well tolerated and seems to&#xD;
      reduce gastro-intestinal (GI) intolerance in children with impaired neurological functions.&#xD;
      From literature it can be said that from a clinical point of view, enteral nutrition based on&#xD;
      whey proteins can be considered a valid alternative to NF, reducing not only the incidence of&#xD;
      GI intolerance symptoms but also the need for further health interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these findings, no data are available in literature regarding a comparison between&#xD;
      special formula and Nissen fundoplication and the main aims of this study is to fill this&#xD;
      evidence's gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on evidences showing that a changing from an intact protein enteral feeding to a 100%&#xD;
      whey, peptide-based formula improved the feeding tolerance, the hypothesis that peptide-based&#xD;
      formula could be comparted to NF turns out to be the next step in the analysis of these&#xD;
      products. In this way, it might be useful to evaluate the role of different formulas against&#xD;
      NF, regarding tolerance, utility, applicability and safeness of these products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was been designed as a monocentric, retrospective observational (cohort) study&#xD;
      with the aim to carry out a healthcare cost analysis between patients undergoing NF surgery&#xD;
      and patients treated with whey protein-based enteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By performing this cost analysis, it may be possible to evaluate the better timing for Nissen&#xD;
      Fundoplication surgery in patient with enteral nutrition and secondary, it may be possible to&#xD;
      describe and to quantify resource consumption and the occurrence of GI disorders related to&#xD;
      the different types of formulas.&#xD;
