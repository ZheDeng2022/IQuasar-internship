    <textblock>
      The incidence rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients is increasing, and&#xD;
      the mortality associated with dialysis-requiring AKI remains as high as 60-70%. In these&#xD;
      patients, AKI results are increased in-hospital and post-hospitalization medical resource&#xD;
      utilization. To improve AKI-associated morbidity and mortality, Taiwan Consortium of Acute&#xD;
      Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKS, TCTC) as the leading clinical trial group of kidney&#xD;
      diseases in Asia-Pacific will establish an anonymous nationwide AKI database to explore the&#xD;
      epidemiology, risk factors and prognosis of AKI in Taiwan. The demographic and clinical&#xD;
      information of AKI stage 2, 3 or weaning from dialysis requiring AKI patients (AKI-D), will&#xD;
      be prospectively collected for further analysis. In this double two-by-two factorial design,&#xD;
      upon the identification of AKI stage 2, 3 or weaning from AKI-D at index out patients&#xD;
      clinics, enrollees who are randomly assigned to slow kidney function progression first by&#xD;
      randomization to add Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I)/Angiotensin II Receptor&#xD;
      Blocker (ARB), or by randomization to multidisciplinary care. Patients will be followed up at&#xD;
      least 6 months to evaluate kidney function and the predictability of developing chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease, end stage renal disease, major cardiovascular events and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is an emerging syndrome in the past 10 years. Among hospital diagnosed&#xD;
      kidney disease, acute renal disease outnumbered chronic kidney disease (CKD) since 2005, and&#xD;
      the incidence is still climbing. Patients who were diagnosed with AKI bear a substantial risk&#xD;
      for adverse outcomes, including premature death, increased morbidity, prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, and increased medical costs. A variety of factors may predispose a patient&#xD;
      to AKI, including poor pre-morbid kidney reserve, conditions leading to hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability, or increased complexity of concurrent medications. With the advance of modern&#xD;
      medical diagnosis and treatment modalities, the incidence and prevalence of AKI syndrome&#xD;
      gradually increase over the past years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KDIGO Guideline for AKI recommended that we should diagnose AKI if a given patient has a&#xD;
      6 hour urine amount less than 0.5ml/kg/hr or a serum creatinine elevates more than 0.3mg/dL&#xD;
      or 1.5 times greater than baselines. Epidemiology data on hospitalized patients indeed&#xD;
      disclosed high risk for adverse events using this classification system and its analogues.&#xD;
      However, besides diagnosis, we do not have a useful tool to treat or to help improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication that affects nearly 5% of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients and 40%-70% of patients in the intensive care unit. AKI requiring&#xD;
      dialysis (AKI-D), the most severe type of AKI, is associated with the highest proportion of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. AKI is associated with a risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that&#xD;
      is 13 times as high as the risk among patients without AKI, and the risk of ESRD is 40 times&#xD;
      as high if the patients have both AKI and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since&#xD;
      AKI is recognized as a risk factor for the development of ESRD, it is crucial to have&#xD;
      appropriate protection strategies for the avoidance of further target organ damage and&#xD;
      associated mortality in the critical phases of the acute kidney disease (AKD). Several&#xD;
      studies have validated the hypothesis proposed by Guyton that the kidneys have a crucial role&#xD;
      in affecting the chronic level of blood pressure (BP). Furthermore, AKI during&#xD;
      hospitalization was an independent risk factor for subsequent development of BP elevation. BP&#xD;
      level is related to the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, which makes the elevated BP&#xD;
      as a leading risk factor for global health. However, it is still a missing puzzle piece in&#xD;
      the timely pharmacologic treatment and long-term target organ protection of AKD patients. By&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of the large FROG ICU database, including 1551 ICU survivors, of which&#xD;
      611 had AKI during their ICU stay, the authors could demonstrate reduced 1-year mortality in&#xD;
      the cohort who had AKI and who were prescribed ACEIs/ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the issue of the 'black hole' between AKI and CKD, the Kidney Disease: Improving&#xD;
      Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI Workgroup propose the concept of acute kidney disease (AKD). AKD,&#xD;
      defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or evidence of structural&#xD;
      kidney damage for &lt;3 months, provides an operationally integrated bridge between AKI and CKD.&#xD;
      The AKD concept, which incorporates the concept of partial renal recovery, might also help&#xD;
      raise awareness and engender the necessary clinical mechanisms to follow AKI survivors for&#xD;
      progression to CKD, which has been recently highlighted as a missed opportunity for adequate&#xD;
      transitions of care. Also, a panel of gut microbiota and biomarkers will also be determined.&#xD;
