      The study involves patients with microtia of certain criteria will undergo tissue expansion&#xD;
      by silicone bags in the postauricular region then Medpor implants will be applied undercover&#xD;
      of the expanded skin for reconstruction of the auricule instead of the costal cartilage graft&#xD;

      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous multistage rib cartilage technique for auricular reconstruction was firstly&#xD;
      introduced by Tanzer in 1959(1) however, such technique had many drawbacks like being a&#xD;
      lengthy process consisting of multiple procedures, donor-site morbidity and pain and the&#xD;
      possibility of cartilage resorption leading to poor ear projection and loss of auricular&#xD;
      definition (2). Tjellström (3) and Korus et al (4) described the osseointegrated implant for&#xD;
      auricular reconstruction in traumatic congenital and oncological conditions. It also had&#xD;
      disadvantages as the need for long-term commitment of both patient and prosthetic team, high&#xD;
      costs of maintenance visits, regular change of the prosthesis every 2 to 5 years and the&#xD;
      prosthesis is considered as a foreign body (5). Medpor is a synthetic biocompatible porous&#xD;
      polyethylene implant (5) that was used as an alternative to conventional autologous rib&#xD;
      cartilage graft for ear reconstruction for the first time by Reinisch (6). This technique was&#xD;
      faced by many arguments like implant fracture, necrosis and failure of healing of the&#xD;
      overlying soft tissue due to foreign body reactions to the Medpor implant (5). Many studies&#xD;
      were conducted to compare those various techniques specially the Medpor implant and rib&#xD;
      cartilage graft but, the superiority of neither of them proved clearly (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Research :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the outcome of auricular reconstruction in microtia by Medpor implant following&#xD;
      tissue expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods and techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be held in the otorhinolaryngology department of Assiut university hospital&#xD;
      within duration of three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects: The study will include ten patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo auricular reconstruction by using a prolonged tissue expansion&#xD;
      technique and a Medpor framework at the otorhinolaryngology department of Assiut university&#xD;
      hospital following preoperative evaluation which includes:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General examination to detect any other medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete ENT examination with special emphasis on describing the deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Audiological and radiological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full face right and left profile photograph will be taken to be used in the&#xD;
           postoperative comparison between the operated auricle and the normal one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed in steps:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implantation of the suitable tissue expander in the area of the deformed auricle then&#xD;
           after wound healing it will be inflated for three months following removal of&#xD;
           postauricular sutures and wound healing during weekly based visits to the department&#xD;
           out-patient clinic till it will reach full capacity or even beyond to provide adequate&#xD;
           skin for draping the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tissue expander will be removed and the Medpor implant &quot;single or double piece&quot; will&#xD;
           be applied and covered by the expanded skin flap. All the ten patients will be followed&#xD;
           postoperatively for at least six months following the final surgical intervention of the&#xD;
           last patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data will be collected from hospital records about every patient,&#xD;
      preoperative, operative and postoperative notes and reports of the physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer software Qualitative data will be presented as percentages. Chi-square test (or&#xD;
      Fisher's Exact test when applicable) will be used for comparisons between the normal and&#xD;
      operated ears regarding qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical tests Statistical analysis will be performed with IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20&#xD;
      for Windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Risk - benefit assessment. Risks and benefits to the participants will&#xD;
      be assessed throughout the research in each step. In case of complications as severe&#xD;
      infection , tissue necrosis and implant extrusion, the research will be terminated, the case&#xD;
      will be considered as failed one and the traditional rib cartilage multistage technique of&#xD;
      microtia reconstruction will be performed instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality (dealing with data and data dissemination should be confidential).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be reassured before their participation in the research about the&#xD;
      confidentiality of their personal and medical data as only research team members will deal&#xD;
      with these data. The participants will be reassured that their data will be published in&#xD;
      medical journals only after their permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement describing the research procedure to be given to the participants. Each participant&#xD;
      will receive a statement describing the research procedure that will be explained and signed&#xD;
      by one of research team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent. Patients or their guardians will be counseled about their participation in&#xD;
      the research and the steps of the surgery including application of the tissue expander, the&#xD;
      weekly visits for inflation of the expander till it will reach the suitable size permitting&#xD;
      enough skin to cover the future device, the possibility of tissue expansion and necrosis and&#xD;
      what will be done in such situations. Also they will be counseled about possible&#xD;
      complications may occur after each step of the surgery and their important role in assessment&#xD;
      of the outcome of the surgery. All the above mentioned points will be written in an informed&#xD;
      consent that will be signed by the patient or his guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other ethical concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The research should be conducted only by scientifically qualified and trained personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted only by physicians in charge. - The research should be based&#xD;
      on relevant pre-clinical investigations in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is based on previous similar researches performed on patients published in&#xD;
      international medical journals mentioned in the proposal form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The consent form must be provided with the proposal Consent of research participation and&#xD;
      surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      I, the undersigned ................, the child's guardian.............. I agree to&#xD;
      participate in a research which includes a surgical procedure to repair &quot;microtia&quot; a&#xD;
      congenital defect in the ear pinna in two steps. Firstly, tissue expansion by using silicone&#xD;
      bag that are placed under the skin behind the ear for a period of about three months, then&#xD;
      the second stage is to rebuild the deformed ear pinna by using the Medpor stent. The two&#xD;
      stages will be done through a wound behind the deformed ear with knowledge of all the&#xD;
      complications received such as failure to reach the optimal shape. Hematoma under the skin or&#xD;
      severe infections during any stage of the process, damage or refusal of the stent, severe&#xD;
      infections and suppuration of the ear cartilage, which may result in the operation being&#xD;
      completely canceled and another surgical intervention will be performed.&#xD;
