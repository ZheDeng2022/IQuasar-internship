      This study is a single-arm, open label, multicenter phase II study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of SG001 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with unresectable locally&#xD;
      advanced, or recurrent, or metastatic TNBC. Eligible patients will receive SG001 intravenous&#xD;
      infusion at a dose of 240 mg on Days 1 and 15 of every 4-week cycle and nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle until&#xD;
      disease progression, or intolerable toxicity, or other discontinuation or termination&#xD;
      criteria are met, for a maximum of 2 years.&#xD;
