  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this trial is to inform about long-term safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      eptinezumab in participants with chronic cluster headache.&#xD;

      The participants who take part in this trial will be asked to stay in the trial for about a&#xD;
      year. The participants will be asked to visit the trial site 7 times during the trial. In&#xD;
      between trial site visits, they will have scheduled phone calls with the trial site staff.&#xD;
      They will also be asked to keep track of their cluster headaches at home with a headache&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
