  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research proposal is to investigate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in patients with lymphoedema of the upper limb or lower limb (P)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the added value of reconstructive lymphatic surgery (I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to the decongestive lymphatic therapy (usual care) (C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the lymphoedema-specific quality of life (QoL) (O)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at 18 months post-surgery/ no surgery (T)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, a multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial is performed to give an&#xD;
      answer on following research question: 'Is, in addition to usual care - i.e. decongestive&#xD;
      lymphatic therapy -, reconstructive lymphatic surgery (intervention group) superior to no&#xD;
      surgery (control group), for the treatment of upper or lower limb lymphoedema?'&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoedema is a chronic and often debilitating condition caused by lymphatic insufficiency.&#xD;
      It leads to swelling of the limb and an increased risk of infection. It can be classified as&#xD;
      primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired) lymphoedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphoedema is very burdensome for the patient and therefore is it often associated with&#xD;
      mental problems for example frustration and stress. In addition, because of the increase in&#xD;
      volume of the limb, patients also develop physical problems, such as pain, heaviness, loss of&#xD;
      strength, and develop functional problems, such as problems with household, mobility or&#xD;
      social activities. These mental, physical and functional problems all have a negative impact&#xD;
      on quality of life and have an influence on the ability to work. Consensus exist that the&#xD;
      first choice of treatment is a conservative treatment. This conservative treatment consists&#xD;
      of skin care, compression therapy (i.e. multilayer bandaging and compression garments),&#xD;
      exercises and lymph drainage. Reconstructive lymphatic surgery is another option, also often&#xD;
      performed: i.e. lymphovenous anastomoses, on the one hand, and a lymph node transfer, on the&#xD;
      other hand. By (partially) restoring the lymphatic transport, the reconstructive lymphatic&#xD;
      surgery may possibly lead to a larger decrease of the lymphoedema volume and therefore&#xD;
      greater discontinuation of the compression garment. Consequently, patients will have an&#xD;
      improvement in functioning and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, scientific evidence for reconstructive lymphatic surgery for the treatment of&#xD;
      lymphoedema is missing. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to investigate the added value of&#xD;
      reconstructive lymphatic surgery of the lymphatic system in addition to the conservative&#xD;
      treatment, for the treatment of lymphoedema.&#xD;
