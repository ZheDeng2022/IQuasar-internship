  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate if BioXmark™, a surgical marker, may efficiently and safely be&#xD;
      used to preoperatively mark the proximal and distal resection line 5 cm proximal and distal&#xD;
      to the tumor margin of gastroesophageal-junction adenocarcinoma (GEJ AC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, to determine if placing the resection margin according to the resection margin&#xD;
      defined by BioXmark™ is superior to the current standard of a proximal resection line&#xD;
      estimation by the individual surgeon based on the intraoperative findings.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, the national guidelines for GEJ AC surgery are an R0 resection with a minimum 5&#xD;
      cm proximal and distal resection margin, measured in vivo. During the operation, the primary&#xD;
      surgeon sets the resection margin according to the guidelines, with 5 cm on either side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish national guidelines are clear, but the literature behind them is not, and the&#xD;
      recommendations for resection margins vary worldwide. With the lack of a strong&#xD;
      literature-backed guideline and a surgical approach that is heavily dependent on the&#xD;
      individual surgeon's estimate, the risk of a microscopic positive resection margin (R1&#xD;
      resection) increases. Both problems, namely resectability at the definitive surgery and the&#xD;
      incidence of microscopic positive resection margins after resection, may be improved by&#xD;
      preoperatively marking the tumor margins in vivo. This could be achieved with an&#xD;
      endoscopically placed surgical marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such surgical marker is BioXmark™, a liquid injectable and adherent fiducial marker that&#xD;
      has shown promising results for image-guided adaptive radiotherapy in lung, bladder, and&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. BioXmark™ is implanted during endoscopy and has appropriate visibility&#xD;
      with good positional stability on CT, CBCT, and MRI. Furthermore, no adverse reactions or&#xD;
      events have been reported yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed as a feasibility study of BioXmark™ at the Department of Surgery&#xD;
      &amp; Transplantation, Centre of Cancer and Organ Diseases. We plan to include 10 patients who&#xD;
      are scheduled to undergo curatively intended surgery for GEJ AC. The patients will be drawn&#xD;
      from the existing operating program.&#xD;
