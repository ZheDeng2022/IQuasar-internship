  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-armed, open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of CT103A in subjects with relapsed and refractory MM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture CT103A chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      (CAR) modified T cells. Bridging therapy is allowed between PBMC collection and&#xD;
      lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was performed for&#xD;
      three consecutive days. After 1-day rest, subjects will receive a single dose infusion of&#xD;
      CT103A at 1.0 x 10^6 CAR+ T cells/Kg. Subjects will be followed in the study for a minimum of&#xD;
      2 years after CT103A infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be&#xD;
      followed for up to 15 years after CT103A infusion.&#xD;
