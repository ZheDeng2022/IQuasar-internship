      Clinical trials on cranberry juice and UTI prevention yielded both positive and negative&#xD;
      results for unknown reason. Gut microbiome in women affect the absorption and metabolism of&#xD;
      cranberry bioactives. The variation of gut microbiome is a probable mechanism for metabolic&#xD;
      polymorphisms and disparity in UTI prevention in women.&#xD;

      The American cranberries, especially cranberry juice, have used for centuries as a folk&#xD;
      medicine to prevent urinary tract infections (UTI), which affect 50% of women in their&#xD;
      lifetime. Over 40 clinical trials have been conducted in the last 20 years to verify the UTI&#xD;
      preventatively activity of cranberry juices, but the results were contradictory. About 90% of&#xD;
      UTI are initiated by the adhesion of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) on urinary tract epithelia.&#xD;
      It was reported that human urine after consumption of cranberry juice inhibited the adhesion&#xD;
      of UPEC. The A-type proanthocyanidins and xyloglucans are the presumed bioactives in&#xD;
      cranberries, however, this is unlikely because these two classes of compounds have extremely&#xD;
      low bioavailability in human body. Preliminary research suggested that women can be either&#xD;
      &quot;resistant&quot; or &quot;susceptible&quot; to UTI depending on the inherent anti-adhesion activity in their&#xD;
      urine against UPEC before consuming cranberry juice. Not all but a fraction of &quot;UTI&#xD;
      susceptible&quot; women had increased urinary anti-adhesion activity after consuming cranberry&#xD;
      juices. These women are classified as &quot;responders&quot; and others are &quot;non-responders&quot;. The&#xD;
      variation of gut microbiome is a probable mechanism for metabolic polymorphisms and disparity&#xD;
      in UTI prevention. The objective of this trials is to identify gut microbes and anti-adhesive&#xD;
      urinary biomarkers which significantly contribute to the anti-adhesion of UPEC.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 21 days of each intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the statistical differences between the changes from baseline in the an-adhesion activity against uropathogenic E. coli in UTI-susceptible women after consuming the cranberry juice for 3 weeks versus after consuming the placebo juice for 3 weeks. Anti-adhesion activity in urine will be measured using a fluorescence-based microplate method. The anti-adhesion activities of urines will be expressed by its equivalence to myricetin level. The unit for urine anti-adhesion activities is µg myricetin/mg creatinine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the compositional differences of gut microbiome in responders and non-responders after the cranberry juice intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 21 days of each intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the differences in the gut microbiomes between responders and non-responders after consuming the cranberry juice for 3 weeks versus after consuming the placebo juice for 3 weeks. Human feces collected from responders and non-responders will be analyzed for microbiota composition. Relative abundance of gut microbiome at phylum level, family level, genus level, and Firmicutes over Bacteroidetes ratio will be evaluated. Genomic microbial DNA will be extracted from fecal samples using DNA isolation kits. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene (V1-3 region) of each sample will be amplified and sequenced using a barcoding system on a MiSeq sequencer. Sequence data will be analyzed using the latest version of QIIME.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify anti-adhesion urinary biomarkers in responders versus non-responders after the cranberry juice intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upt to 21 days of each intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impacts of cranberry juice intake on the urinary metabolome and identify anti-adhesion urinary biomarkers in responders and non-responders after consuming the cranberry juice for 3 weeks versus after consuming the placebo juice for 3 weeks. Metabolites in urine will be detected using UHPLC-HRMS and annotated using combination of m/z and retention time. Metabolites that significantly contribute to the anti-adhesion activity of urine revealed by PLS regression analysis are the potential anti-adhesion biomarkers. A list of potential biomarkers will be generated. Structures of these biomarkers will be tentatively determined through spectral analysis and database searching. Structure of tentatively identified biomarkers will be confirmed by comparing with authentic standards.</description>
