  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of FWD1509 MsOH in&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC patients and establish the maximum tolerable dose (MTD), recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) in advanced NSCLC patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a first-in-human study evaluating the safety and tolerability of FWD1509&#xD;
      MsOH in subjects with advanced NSCLC, when FWD1509 MsOH is administered once daily as a&#xD;
      single agent. FWD1509 MsOH is an oral TKI (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) that blocks the&#xD;
      function of tyrosine kinase. TKIs such as gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib are recommended as&#xD;
      the first-line therapy for EGFR mutated (exon 19 deletions or L858R point mutations in exon&#xD;
      21) NSCLC patients. However, the majority (&gt;50%) of patients will develop acquired resistance&#xD;
      after initially responding to gefitinib or erlotinib due to the occurrence of secondary&#xD;
      mutations (mostly T709M) in EGFR. Osmertinib was subsequently developed to such secondary&#xD;
      mutations, but for EGFRex20ins mutations, on which there is still no effective therapies&#xD;
      focusing. FWD1509 MsOH is new generation EGFR-TKI targeting EGFR mutations such as exon 19&#xD;
      deletion, L858R substitution as weel as T790M nytatuibs. In particular, FWD1509 MsOH targets&#xD;
      the EGFRex20ins mutation in NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The develpment of FWD1509 MsOH at this stage is mainly focused on treatment of NSCLC tumors&#xD;
      with EGFRex20ins mutations, followed by further exploration against other targets.&#xD;
