  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a common and morbid complication of&#xD;
      critical illness. Sepsis contribute to a lot of ARDS cases, but mechanisms by which&#xD;
      non-pulmonary insults such as extrapulmonary sepsis propagate lung injury remain unclear.&#xD;
      Most eukaryotic cells release small anuclear membrane-bound vesicles into the extracellular&#xD;
      environment in either physiological or pathophysiological conditions, often called&#xD;
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) .Through their cargo containing bioactive molecules such as&#xD;
      proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs and their interaction with target cells, EVs are recognized as&#xD;
      important mediators of cellular communication. Mitochondrial contents are clearly present in&#xD;
      EVs, and mitochondrial cargo within EVs have been shown to stimulate the production of&#xD;
      proinﬂammatory cytokines, further enhancing LPS-induced inﬂammation. Among the mitochondrial&#xD;
      contents, mtDNA was present at higher levels in EVs.Therefore, we hypothesis, EVs containing&#xD;
      mtDNA play an important role in the occurrence and development of ARDS caused by&#xD;
      extrapulmonary sepsis.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria: Patients with ARDS caused by abdominal infection Exclusion criteria: age&#xD;
      &lt;18 years old or pregnancy; death or discharge within 24 hours after admission; advanced&#xD;
      tumor The pathological information of the patients was collected on 24h, 48h after admission&#xD;
      including demographic data, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score&#xD;
      , number of organ failures included in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.&#xD;
      The levels of lactate and inflammatory mediators (i.e., plasma C-reactive protein and&#xD;
      procalcitonin) were detected on 24h and 48h after admission. All patients were followed up&#xD;
      for 28 days, and all-cause mortality was recorded. The durations of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and ICU stay were also recorded. The primary outcome was mortality on Day 28. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included the ventilator days and ICU length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples (2 mL) were collected on 24h and 48h after admission to the ICU. EVs&#xD;
      were isolated from the plasma, and mtDNA concentration of plasma DNA was evaluated by&#xD;
      RT-qPCR.&#xD;
