  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent and significant public health problem.&#xD;
      Behavioral treatments based in the principles of social learning theory and cognitive&#xD;
      behavior therapy have been developed and tested for AUD, yet effect sizes are relatively&#xD;
      small and rates of relapse following treatment are high. Theoretically informed adjunctive&#xD;
      interventions may help to enhance the effects of extant AUD treatments. In particular,&#xD;
      evidence suggests that environments lacking in substance-free (SF) activities contribute to&#xD;
      the development and maintenance of AUD and that the availability of rewarding SF activities&#xD;
      may serve as viable alternatives to compete with alcohol use. Building on the advantages of&#xD;
      accessibility and low-cost option afforded by the use of mobile technology, this proposal&#xD;
      outlines a well-integrated research and training plan to investigate a mobile health&#xD;
      intervention to increase engagement in rewarding SF activities among patients in AUD&#xD;
      treatment. This proposed research aims to develop and evaluate a mobile phone ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment plus ecological momentary intervention (EMA+EMI; entitled: mobile -&#xD;
      Rewarding Activity Centered Treatment (m-ReACT)) app to augment existing AUD treatment. The&#xD;
      m-ReACT app will monitor self-reported rewarding SF activity engagement in real-time and&#xD;
      deliver personalized feedback that encourages participants to engage in highly rewarding&#xD;
      activities that are goal-oriented and support positive treatment outcomes. This proposed&#xD;
      intervention will be developed in two phases. Phase 1 will develop the m-ReACT app and Phase&#xD;
      2 will evaluate its efficacy in randomized control pilot trial with a sample of 50 AUD&#xD;
      patients who have recently initiated outpatient AUD treatment. Participants in the pilot RCT&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either the m-ReACT condition or an active control condition. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that m-ReACT will result in increased rates of percent days of alcohol&#xD;
      abstinence and increased reinforcement from SF activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is strongly linked with deficits in alcohol-free alternative&#xD;
      rewards. Individuals with AUD have limited sources of substance-free (SF) natural rewards.&#xD;
      Increasing SF rewards in the context of treatment is of immediate public health relevance as&#xD;
      it has the potential to improve AUD treatment outcomes. Yet, this is not a focus of standard&#xD;
      outpatient treatment. Prior studies demonstrate that interventions focused on SF alternatives&#xD;
      in addition to standard treatment improve outcomes above and beyond standard treatment alone.&#xD;
      However, these efficacious treatments can be difficult to implement and sustain within a&#xD;
      real-world AUD treatment facility. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the approach used in&#xD;
      these studies to meet the needs of patients and treatment facilities alike. Novel&#xD;
      methodologies that are cost effective, technologically enhanced, and less time intensive are&#xD;
      needed to better incorporate this intervention within a treatment setting. The proposed study&#xD;
      would make use of mobile technology to aid patients engage in alternative behaviors, who&#xD;
      otherwise may have limited access to activities other than drinking, and thereby potentially&#xD;
      help reduce risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal aims to develop and evaluate an ecological momentary intervention&#xD;
      (EMI) supported by an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) aimed at increasing reinforcement&#xD;
      from substance-free activities among AUD patients in order to improve treatment outcomes.&#xD;
      Towards this end, this research will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will entail an&#xD;
      iterative process of EMA plus EMI development of a smartphone app, called mobile-Rewarding&#xD;
      Activity Centered Treatment (m-ReACT), designed to collect real-time data on substance-free&#xD;
      activity engagement and obtained reward. The data will then be provided back to the&#xD;
      individuals to encourage engagement in activities that were most rewarding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon app successful app development, this study will implement phase 2. Phase 2 will consist&#xD;
      of a pilot RCT (N=50) to evaluate m-ReACT as an adjunctive intervention for AUD&#xD;
      treatment-seekers compared to a brief advice (BA) session on engaging in SF pleasant&#xD;
      activities. Participants will be randomized to either an in-person informational session&#xD;
      consisting of BA on the importance of engaging in SF rewarding activities or brief in-person&#xD;
      app orientation session that will collect daily reporting of substance free activity&#xD;
      engagement and enjoyment and provide personalized feedback on level of substance free&#xD;
      activity engagement and enjoyment with encouragement to continue engagement. Feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of m-ReACT will be assessed with self-report measures, qualitative end-of&#xD;
      treatment interviews, and examination of app usage from the app metadata. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted at 3 (end of treatment) and 6-months to evaluate for drinking&#xD;
      related outcomes and SF reinforcement.&#xD;
