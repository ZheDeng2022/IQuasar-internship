      This is an observational study to determine the feasibility of assessing tumor response&#xD;
      utilizing ctDNA in patients of locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      (LA-EA/GEJ) cancer undergoing total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) consisting of systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy (modified FOLFOX or FLOT/DFOX) followed by concurrent chemoradiation [50.4 Gray&#xD;
      (Gy) over approximately six weeks with concurrent radio sensitizing dose of&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the feasibility of assessing tumor response utilizing ctDNA in&#xD;
      patients of LA-EA/GEJ adenocarcinoma undergoing TNT consisting of systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
      (modified FOLFOX or FLOT/DFOX) followed by concurrent chemoradiation (50.4 Gy over&#xD;
      approximately six weeks with concurrent radio sensitizing dose of carboplatin/paclitaxel).&#xD;
      The study schema in the following section illustrates the study design. In this observational&#xD;
      study, patients with LA -EA/GEJ ca who are selected for the standard-of-care TNT will be&#xD;
      enrolled. After obtaining informed consent, a venous blood sample and the archival tissue&#xD;
      block from the initial diagnostic tumor biopsy will be sent to the Natera Inc. Patients that&#xD;
      have an excellent response (defined by &gt;35% reduction in standardized uptake value (SUV) max&#xD;
      on PET scan) from four cycles of standard-of-care induction chemotherapy (FOLFOX, DFOX or&#xD;
      FLOT) will be treated with four additional cycles of therapy followed by chemoradiation and&#xD;
      then assessed for curative intent surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and don't have an excellent&#xD;
      clinical response on the PET scan will not receive additional induction chemotherapy. They&#xD;
      will be started on chemoradiation (50.4GY, radiation dose at radiation oncologists discretion&#xD;
      with concurrent weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel) followed by assessment for surgery. Dose&#xD;
      adjustment of radiation and chemotherapy will be allowed as per standard of care. Additional&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained for subsequent ctDNA measurements (after four cycles of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy within +/- five days of the imaging study; after eight cycles for&#xD;
      PET responders only; after the completion of chemoradiation around one to 14 days before&#xD;
      surgery and 10 to 14 days after surgery). All patients may also choose to undergo additional&#xD;
      serial ctDNA level measurements for surveillance after the surgery every three months for two&#xD;
      years (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response rate assessed by ctDNA will be compared with the response rate assessed by&#xD;
      standard methods (PET scan ,endoscopic ultrasound or CT/MRI) at different time points to&#xD;
      explore if a significant correlation exits between these two response assessment methods.&#xD;
      Imaging studies will also be discussed in tumor board. If preliminary data support the&#xD;
      hypothesis that peripheral blood ctDNA can be utilized for tumor response assessment in this&#xD;
      scenario, a larger study will be conducted to validate this method. Once validated, ctDNA&#xD;
      measurement can potentially supplement other expensive, uncomfortable, and time-consuming&#xD;
      methods of tumor response assessment, such as endoscopic ultrasound and PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not involve any investigational therapeutic intervention. The only&#xD;
      intervention planned in this study is obtaining multiple peripheral venous blood samples at&#xD;
      prespecified time points described above for ctDNA level measurements (please refer to the&#xD;
      schema in the next section).&#xD;
