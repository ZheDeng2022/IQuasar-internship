  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see how useful it is to look at biomarkers in the&#xD;
      blood and tumor tissue of participants with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer who have previously received treatment with a drug called a PARP inhibitor, and using&#xD;
      the results to determine the best treatment for these participants. Biomarkers are molecules&#xD;
      such as genes (molecules that contain instructions for the development and function of cells&#xD;
      in the body) and proteins that may be used to see how well a body responds to certain&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who join the study will first have samples of their blood and tumor tissue&#xD;
      collected for biomarker testing. The testing will involve a method called &quot;sequencing&quot;. This&#xD;
      test will look for changes in the genes of your tumor. The results of the testing will be&#xD;
      what is called the participant's molecular profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will first receive bevacizumab and niraparib for 3 cycles. A cycle will be&#xD;
      21-days in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant's molecular profile has been determined, the study doctor will discuss&#xD;
      the results with the participants and they may be referred to a genetic counsellor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be assigned to a study cohort (group) and receive a combination of the&#xD;
      study drugs based on the results of their genetic testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: Participants who do not have the required gene changes will be assigned to&#xD;
           receive niraparib, bevacizumab, and dostarlimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: Participants who have certain gene changes will receive paclitaxel,&#xD;
           bevacizumab, and dostarlimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: If the participant and the study doctor think that the participant is&#xD;
           benefitting from the combination of bevacizumab and niraparib, or the molecular profile&#xD;
           shows that bevacizumab and niraparib is the most suitable, the participant may continue&#xD;
           to receive this drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study drug combination until disease worsening or they meet the&#xD;
      criteria for discontinuation.&#xD;

    <description>Niraparib works by blocking poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) 1 and PARP 2 from working. PARP 1 and PARP 2 are proteins that are involved in cell growth, cell survival, and cell death, including cancer cells. It is believed that blocking PARP1 and PARP 2 from working will slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.</description>

    <description>Dostarlimab is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections. A monoclonal antibody is a special kind of antibody that is created in a laboratory that seeks out specific proteins in the body that may be involved in cancers to stop tumor growth. Dostarlimab attaches to PD-1 and inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 and PD-L2 with PD-1.</description>
