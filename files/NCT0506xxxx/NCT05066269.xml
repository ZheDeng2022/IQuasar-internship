  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an important clinical and research tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of cardiovascular structure and function can vary according to scanner vendor,&#xD;
      scanner field strength, imaging sequence and patient population. As such, the Society for&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) and the European Association for Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Imaging (EACVI) state that local normal reference ranges for CMR measurements should be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to establish reference ranges for measurements of cardiovascular structure&#xD;
      and function at the British Heart Foundation Manchester Centre for Heart and Lung Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Research (MCMR). The work will underpin many other research projects and clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve volunteers having a CMR scan that will last around 30 minutes. No&#xD;
      contrast agent will be administered. MRI scanning uses magnetic fields to make the pictures.&#xD;
      The NHS website describes MRI scanning as &quot;a painless and safe procedure&quot; and &quot;one of the&#xD;
      safest medical procedures available&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has evolved into a gold standard non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      tool in cardiovascular medicine, especially for visualising and quantifying cardiovascular&#xD;
      anatomy and function, and evaluating heart muscle tissue character. It has unique&#xD;
      capabilities in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected cardiovascular disease, and&#xD;
      for cardiovascular research, including disease characterisation and evaluation of&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of cardiovascular structure and function can vary according to MRI scanner&#xD;
      vendor, scanner field strength, imaging sequence and local patient population. The major&#xD;
      Societies in the field, specifically the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR)&#xD;
      and the European Association for Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI), therefore state that local&#xD;
      normal reference ranges for CMR measurements should be established. This will be a&#xD;
      prospective, single-centre observational study in volunteers without a history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The British Heart Foundation Manchester Centre for Heart and Lung Magnetic Resonance Research&#xD;
      (MCMR), based at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, is a recently-opened,&#xD;
      state-of-the-art imaging centre. Greater Manchester has the highest rates of heart disease&#xD;
      and lung disease in England, and the highest rate of premature cardiovascular death. The&#xD;
      overall aims of MCMR are to facilitate cardiovascular and thoracic-related research in&#xD;
      Manchester, in order to understand why people develop heart and lung disease, diagnose heart&#xD;
      and lung disease at an earlier stage when it is more likely to be treatable, guide patient&#xD;
      care more effectively and evaluate new treatments, so as to improve the length, and quality&#xD;
      of life, of people living with, or at risk of, heart and lung disease.&#xD;

          1. Written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Aged 18 and over&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No known history of cardiovascular disease. It is recognised that it may be difficult&#xD;
             to recruit older participants entirely free from cardiovascular disease, thus&#xD;
             participants with relatively milder cardiovascular disease may be permitted, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindication to MRI scanning, such as pacemaker, defibrillator, intraocular metal,&#xD;
             prohibitive intracranial aneurysm clips or severe claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unable to provide complete written or verbal consent in English.&#xD;
