  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ONCO-FIRE proposes to build a novel hyper-architecture and a common data model (CDM) for&#xD;
      oncology, as well as a rich, modular toolset enabling significantly increased&#xD;
      interoperability, exploitability, use and reuse of diverse, multi-modal health data available&#xD;
      in electronic Health Records (EHR) and cancer big data repositories to the benefit of health&#xD;
      professionals, healthcare providers and researchers; this will eventually lead to more&#xD;
      efficient and cost-effective health care procedures and workflows that support improved care&#xD;
      delivery to cancer patients encompassing support for cancer early prediction, diagnosis, and&#xD;
      follow-up. The applicability, usefulness and usability of the proposed hyper-architecture,&#xD;
      CDM and toolset for oncology and the high exploitability of health data will be demonstrated&#xD;
      in diverse data exploitation scenarios related to breast and prostate cancer involving a&#xD;
      number of Virtual Assistants (VAs) and advanced services offering to health care&#xD;
      professionals (HCPs), hospital administration/healthcare providers and researchers&#xD;
      data-driven decision-support and easy navigation across large amounts of cancer-related&#xD;
      information. Through the above mentioned outcomes and the (meta)data interoperability&#xD;
      achieved, ONCO-FIRE contributes to the exploitation of large volumes, highly heterogeneous&#xD;
      (meta)data in EHR and data repositories including imaging data, structured data (e.g.&#xD;
      demographics, laboratory, pathological data), as well as diverse formats of unstructured&#xD;
      clinical reports and notes (e.g. text, pdf), including (but not limited to) temporal&#xD;
      information related to the patient care pathway and genomics data currently &quot;hidden&quot; in&#xD;
      unstructured medical reports, and more. Importantly, ONCO-FIRE interconnects, following a&#xD;
      federated approach, large, distributed cancer imaging repositories, currently used for AI&#xD;
      tools training and validation, with patient registries and EHRs of cancer-related data and&#xD;
      supports exploitation of relevant unstructured data through novel Natural Language Processing&#xD;
      (NLP) tools. The ultimate goal is to establish a patient-centric, federated multi-source and&#xD;
      interoperable data-sharing ecosystem, where healthcare providers, clinical experts, citizens&#xD;
      and researchers contribute, access and reuse multimodal health data, thereby making a&#xD;
      significant contribution to the creation of the European Health Data Space.&#xD;
