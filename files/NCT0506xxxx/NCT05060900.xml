  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to review the clinical outcomes following hand ligament&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery using allograft (cadaveric) knee collateral ligaments. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no standard procedure or devices used for hand ligament reconstruction surgery,&#xD;
      although most techniques use some form of autograft (patients' own tissue) for the&#xD;
      reconstruction. We believe that the use of allograft ligaments in reconstruction may&#xD;
      eliminate the pain associated with procuring the patients' own tissue for the procedure, and&#xD;
      prove to be a viable and preferred alternative to the multiple techniques currently used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main procedures of this study include wrist and hand ligament reconstruction surgery (for&#xD;
      wrist scapholunate (SL) ligaments, thumb ulnar collateral ligaments (UCL), and finger&#xD;
      proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint collateral ligaments) using allograft ligament, and&#xD;
      subsequent follow up appointments where measurements and questionnaires will be completed to&#xD;
      evaluate how hand function is doing after surgery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-surgery 6 week, post-surgery 6 month, post-surgery 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The qDASH questionnaire asks about symptoms of upper extremity disability as well as the ability to perform certain activities. It generates a score from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater severity of disability.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in pain, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-surgery 6 week, post-surgery 6 month, post-surgery 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS generates a scale from 0 to 100 with 0 indicating no pain and higher scores indicating greater pain.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in key pinch strength, as measured with a pinch gauge.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-surgery 6 week, post-surgery 6 month, post-surgery 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A pinch gauge is a device that measures key pinch strength in units of pounds or Newtons.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in wrist and finger range of motion angles.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-surgery 6 week, post-surgery 6 month, post-surgery 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion to be assessed includes wrist extension, wrist flexion, wrist ulnar deviation, wrist radial deviation, finger proximal interphalangeal joint flexion and extension, thumb metacarpophalangeal joint flexion and extension, thumb abduction and adduction.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in wrist and finger radiographs.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-surgery 6 week, post-surgery 6 month, post-surgery 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic images obtained can help indicate the success of surgery by demonstrating joint stability.</description>
