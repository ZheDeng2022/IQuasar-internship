  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the role of GLP-1 in the pathogenesis of T2D in&#xD;
      youth and explore their potential salutary effects and ability to delay the progressive loss&#xD;
      of ß-cell function and reduce hepatic steatosis in youth with prediabetes/new onset T2D and&#xD;
      NAFLD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent publication by the TODAY Group Study, it was reported that &quot;diabetes-related&#xD;
      complications appear early in youth-onset T2D and accumulate rapidly at a mean age of 26.4&#xD;
      years,&quot; and 60.1% of participants developed at least one microvascular complication. The same&#xD;
      has been reported in RISE Studies and was suggested that the rapid decline in β-cell function&#xD;
      and its insensitivity to two of the most frequently used treatments for T2D in pediatrics is&#xD;
      further aggravated by the rising prevalence in NAFLD. These alarming results indicate a&#xD;
      pressing need for effective and innovative approaches at preserving β-cell function and&#xD;
      reducing hepatic steatosis in obese youth in order to prevent disease progression and&#xD;
      associated complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kelly et al showed recently that Liraglutide 3 mg a day reduces BMI and body weight in obese&#xD;
      adolescents. Moreover, its efficacy and safety in youth with T2D was found to be more&#xD;
      effective than metformin. These findings provide a strong rationale for further evaluation of&#xD;
      Liraglutide as a therapy in the context of pediatric obesity associated with prediabetes/new&#xD;
      onset T2D and NALFD. This study will use a rigorously designed mechanistic study to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of Liraglutide (Victoza up to 1.8 mg) in restoring or halting the loss of beta&#xD;
      cell function and reducing hepatic steatosis in pediatrics. The study design is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (RCT) using Liraglutide (Victoza up to&#xD;
      1.8mg) for 6 months followed by a wash-out period of 3 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will undergo baseline tests at the beginning of the study and will be randomized to receive experimental drug or placebo. Dose escalation will be achieved within 3 to 6 weeks to reach up to 1.8mg of Liraglutide daily, which they will be on for 6 months. All tests will be repeated after 6 months of treatment followed by a wash-out period of 3 months, after which the same tests will be repeated.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Oral Disposition Index (oDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The oDI value is the product of total responsivity index and insulin sensitivity. The change in oDI from baseline to 6M on treatment is calculated as the difference between 6M oDI value and baseline oDI value. The oDI measures the ability of beta-cell to respond to a glucose stimulus.</description>
