  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Nutrition-Supported&#xD;
      Diabetes Education Program (NU-DSMP). This study will test the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      impact of providing diabetes-tailored food support and individualized case-management on&#xD;
      glycemic control and other intermediate outcomes including food security, diet, mental&#xD;
      health, and health care behaviors, among Medicaid-enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes in a&#xD;
      safety-net county health system.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Together with Contra Costa Health Services, a safety-net county health system, and Project&#xD;
      Open Hand, a non-profit organization with extensive experience providing nutrition services&#xD;
      to low-income, chronically ill individuals in the San Francisco Bay Area, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct the Nutrition-Supported Diabetes Education Program (NU-DSMP) Pilot Study. The&#xD;
      goal for this pragmatic, pilot randomized trial is to test the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      preliminary impact of providing 12 weeks of diabetes-healthy food support (i.e. medically&#xD;
      tailored meals and groceries) supported by individualized case-management to low-income&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participating in the evidence-based Diabetes&#xD;
      Self- Management Program (DSMP), compared to DSMP participation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will randomize 72 individuals 1:1 to intervention and control arms, following them&#xD;
      at 0, 12 and 24 weeks with surveys and medical record review (with an interim brief 6 week&#xD;
      assessment with the survey only), to understand the impact on diabetes health. Data from this&#xD;
      pilot study will inform the planning of a full-size randomized trial to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      the NU-DSMP model, with a long-term goal to inform policy debates about the value of&#xD;
      implementing medically tailored food interventions as part of healthcare.&#xD;

    <description>Control participants will receive standard of care as offered by clinical partners to all T2DM patients, including referral to nutritional counseling, T2DM support groups, and participation in local diabetes self-management programs. Control participants are also often provided referral information for locally available food support services in the region that provide diabetes-appropriate foods. Control participants will participate in the Diabetes Self-Management Program, an evidence-based program that takes place over 6 weeks that meets the standard of care for diabetes education.&#xD;
At the end of follow up, the control arm will receive three months diabetes-tailored food support consisting of diabetes-tailored grocery boxes and nutrition case-management.</description>

The intervention will be delivered in addition to a base condition consisting of remote participation in the Diabetes Self-Management Program, an evidence-based diabetes education program that takes place over 6 weeks also received by the control group as part of the standard of care.</description>
