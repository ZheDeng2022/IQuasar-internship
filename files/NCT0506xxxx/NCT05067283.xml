  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~21 days</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as an event with toxicity including the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the probable association with study treatment that are not due to pre-existing conditions as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0). Number of participants who experience a DLT will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who experienced an adverse event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~50 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. The number of participants who experienced an AE will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~50 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~50 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR as assessed by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~50 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The DOR as assessed by the investigator will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of MK-1084</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 2, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 2, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1 and Day 1 of every third cycle (up to ~50 months). Each cycle = 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported.</description>
