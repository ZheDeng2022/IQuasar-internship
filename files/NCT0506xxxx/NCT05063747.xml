  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality within one year after intensive care unit (ICU) admission with Coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID-19) will be assessed. Risk and risk factors for one year mortality in ICU&#xD;
      patients will be compared to patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and general&#xD;
      population controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICU population comprises all Swedish ICU patients with COVID-19 with at lease one year of&#xD;
      follow up. The hospital admitted cohort comprises four hospital admitted patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 per ICU patient, matched on age, legal gender and region. The general population&#xD;
      controls are matched to the ICU patients in a one to four fashion on age, legal gender and&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU patients are identified in the Swedish intensive care registry. The hospital admitted&#xD;
      patients are identified in the national patient registry and the population controls are&#xD;
      identified in the population registry. Data on socioeconomics and income are provided by the&#xD;
      Statistics Sweden. Data on comorbidity, medications and death are provided from the National&#xD;
      board of health and welfare.&#xD;
