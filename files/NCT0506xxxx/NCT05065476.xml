  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of Isha Kriya, a freely available guided meditation, on&#xD;
      mental health - specifically anxiety and depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, over 15% of the population experienced symptoms of anxiety. This was highest amongst&#xD;
      18-29-year-olds. Amongst these adults, 9.5% experienced mild, 3.4% experienced moderate, and&#xD;
      2.7% experienced severe symptoms of anxiety. About 1 in 6 adults is expected to suffer from&#xD;
      depression at some point in their lives. Due to the pandemic, rates of anxiety and depression&#xD;
      increased significantly. In December 2020, 42% of people surveyed by the US Census Bureau had&#xD;
      symptoms associated with anxiety or depression. This is compared to 11% of adults having&#xD;
      similar symptoms from Jan-June 2019. The rapidly diminishing mental health in the general&#xD;
      population, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, has raised the concern for an emerging&#xD;
      new pandemic: the mental health pandemic. Mental health leaders and organizations are urging&#xD;
      the federal and state authorities to make mental health a top priority and allocate resources&#xD;
      to areas including early identification and prevention, establishing integrated health and&#xD;
      mental health care to ensure &quot;whole-person&quot; well-being, assuring evidence-based standards of&#xD;
      prevention, treatment and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meditation has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms associated with anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. A recent study using a meditation called Isha Kriya showed improved perceived&#xD;
      stress amongst operating room professionals in one sitting. Isha Kriya is a simple meditation&#xD;
      practice (15minutes) that can be done by anyone over 12 years of age. It is offered free&#xD;
      globally via in-person sessions, online webinars, and online videos. A meditation which is&#xD;
      available electronically and freely could be an attractive option to include in prevention&#xD;
      and treatment strategies for anxiety and depression. Furthermore, such intervention is easily&#xD;
      scalable and accessible to everyone with access to the internet and if found effective, can&#xD;
      be a valuable resource for addressing disparities in access to mental health resources in&#xD;
      minority and underserved populations. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      meditation on reducing symptoms associated with anxiety and depression over 6 weeks.&#xD;
