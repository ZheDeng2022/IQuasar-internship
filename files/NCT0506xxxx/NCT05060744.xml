      A Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial off the Efficacy and Rapidity of Action of a&#xD;
      Product Containing Sodium Alginate, Calcium and Magnesium Salts, Hyaluronic Acid and Aloe&#xD;
      Vera to Control Oesophageal-Gastric pH and Reduce Symptoms of Gastric Reflux and&#xD;
      Hyperacidity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will include patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and heartburn&#xD;
      (more than 3 weekly episodes of heartburn for at least 4 consecutive weeks) not related to&#xD;
      medication intake and don't use proton pump blockers or H2-receptor antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre clinical trial with two-phase design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and rapidity of action of the medical device to reduce clinical symptoms of gastric reflux&#xD;
      and hyperacidity under normal conditions of use. This phase I will be performed in primary&#xD;
      care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: A non-comparative, non-controlled clinical trial to objectively assess, using&#xD;
      continuous pH monitoring, the magnitude and rapidity to control gastric and oesophageal pH&#xD;
      after taking the product. This phase II will be performed at the Department of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology of Medic Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin with the baseline visit (day 0) in which the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be confirmed, the signing of informed consent will be obtained, GERD-Q&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be done and treatment will be prescribed, followed by a home recording&#xD;
      where patients will record data on episodes of acidity and heartburn occuring during the&#xD;
      follow-up week. A face-to-face visit will be at 7 days after to recollect information about&#xD;
      total number of daytime and nighttime episodes of acidity/heartburn since the previous visit&#xD;
      and repeat the GERD-Q Questionnaire.&#xD;
