    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a clinical trial is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and the safety of one&#xD;
      administration of OVX836 influenza vaccine at different dose levels (180µg, 300μg and 480μg)&#xD;
      in order to assess the dose response of the OVX836 influenza vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, controlled study in 138 adult subjects to&#xD;
      compare the immunogenicity and the safety of OVX836 influenza vaccine at two dose levels&#xD;
      (300μg and 480μg) to lower dose level (180µg) and to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One single dose of OVX836 influenza vaccine (180µg or 300µg or 480µg) or of placebo will be&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly in healthy subjects aged 18-55 years.&#xD;

         16. Treatment that can affect immune response such as systemic or high dose inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids (&gt;800μg/day beclomethasone or equivalent; occasional inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids for asthma therapy are allowed), radiation treatment, cytotoxic drugs,&#xD;
             or current or recent (within 30 days before study entry) chronic or prolonged (&gt;10&#xD;
             days) use of systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, interferon,&#xD;
             immunomodulators, allergy shots, as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
