  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, 23 control individuals, 38 patients with systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS), 20 septic and 45 sepsis-related acute kidney injury (AKI) patients were&#xD;
      enrolled. Blood samples were collected from septic and sepsis-related AKI patients at the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) at three time points (T1-3): T1: within 12 hours after admission;&#xD;
      T2: second day morning of follow-up; T3: third day morning of follow-up. Sampling points for&#xD;
      SIRS patients were the first (T1) and third (T3) postoperative morning. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were patients under 18 years of age, unobtainable consent, end-stage renal disease requiring&#xD;
      chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation and patients with malignancies needing palliative&#xD;
      care. Not more than one sample (venous blood) was collected from control patients. Plasma&#xD;
      presepsin levels were determined by an automated Point of Care instrument while serum&#xD;
      gelsolin levels were measured using an automated immune turbidimetric assay. Plasma presepsin&#xD;
      concentrations were expressed as pg/mL, while serum gelsolin levels were expressed as mg/L.&#xD;
      Data were compared with laboratory and clinical parameters. Patients were categorized by the&#xD;
      Sepsis-3 definitions and 14-day mortality data were investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presepsin is the 13-kDa soluble N-terminal fragment of the 55-kDa cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      (CD) marker protein CD14, which is the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding&#xD;
      protein complexes. CD14 is a glycoprotein expressed mostly on the membrane surface of&#xD;
      macrophages, monocytes and granulocytes which is released and degraded during inflammation&#xD;
      after the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), thus probably&#xD;
      resulting in earlier elevation of plasma presepsin (PSEP) levels than the conventional sepsis&#xD;
      biomarkers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin). However, there is a concern that PSEP levels&#xD;
      are affected by kidney function. Although its exact physiological activity is unclear, it is&#xD;
      presumed that PSEP is filtered by the glomeruli, then reabsorbed and catabolized within&#xD;
      proximal tubular cells. There is a growing body of evidence indicating increasing PSEP levels&#xD;
      as kidney function decreases (e.g. during chronic kidney disease or sepsis-related AKI).&#xD;
      Gelsolin (GSN) is a multifunctional protein existing in three different isoforms. Secreted or&#xD;
      plasma GSN (MW = 83 kDa) is an essential component of the so-called extracellular actin&#xD;
      scavenger system, therefore, decreasing serum GSN levels were reported in various clinical&#xD;
      conditions (e.g. severe sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), extensive trauma,&#xD;
      acute liver failure, myocardial infarction). As albumin levels also tend to decrease in&#xD;
      severe catabolic conditions, the simultaneous measurement of PSEP and GSN might yield&#xD;
      additional information regarding the early diagnosis and severity of sepsis and&#xD;
      sepsis-related AKI. Therefore, a new potential marker was investigated: Presepsin:gelsolin&#xD;
      (PSEP:GSN) ratio. The main focuses of this study were investigating the kinetics of PSEP:GSN&#xD;
      ratio and exploring the time course of PSEP levels in septic and sepsis-related AKI patients,&#xD;
      as the early recognition of kidney injury - especially in sepsis - is essential in the aspect&#xD;
      of therapy and survival.&#xD;
