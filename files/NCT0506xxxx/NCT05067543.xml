    <description>The EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of quality of life. It is cognitively simple, takes only a few minutes to complete, and provides a simple descriptive profile as well as a single index value for quality of life that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system which comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and a visual analog scale which measures the respondent's self-rated health on a 0-100 scale.</description>
