  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This this study is for individuals who have treatment-na√Øve extensive-stage small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (small cell lung cancer that wont respond to treatment). Doctors leading this study&#xD;
      hope to learn if combining durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide with hyofractionated&#xD;
      ablative radiation therapy (radiation focused on certain parts of the body) will help treat&#xD;
      your cancer and improve how long you can live with extensive-stage small cell cancer without&#xD;
      it getting worse (progression-free survival). Your participation in this research will last&#xD;
      about 48 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab along with chemotherapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for the treatment of small cell lung cancer along with chemotherapy. This study is&#xD;
      testing the addition of radiation to durvalumab and chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>This arm will involve all participants in the study who have extensive small cell lung cancer that has not responded to previous treatments. All participants will receive the same treatment of study drugs and radiation treatment in &quot;cycles&quot; (a specific window of time).&#xD;
You will receive up to four 21-day cycles of chemotherapy using carboplatin, etoposide and durvalumab (immunotherapy) as part of a standard care treatment plan recommended by your doctor. These drugs will be combined with ablative radiation treatment during the second cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
After completing these four cycles of chemotherapy (with radiation treatment added in cycle 2), you will continue to receive a fixed dose of durvalumab until your cancer progresses, you experience serious side effects, you decide to no longer be part of the study or the study doctor request to take you off the study for medical reasons.</description>

             contrast of the brain prior to study entry. Patients whose brain metastases have been&#xD;
             treated may participate provided they show radiographic stability (defined as 2 brain&#xD;
             images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These&#xD;
             imaging scans should both be obtained at least two weeks apart and show no evidence of&#xD;
             intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either&#xD;

             result), hepatitis C, or HIV. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined&#xD;
             as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction is negative for hepatitis C (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
