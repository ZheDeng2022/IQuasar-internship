      Main objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effect of using a virtual reality mask during the peripheral intravenous&#xD;
      catheter insertion in a pediatric day hospital on the pain and anxiety in children from 6 to&#xD;
      11 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using virtual reality mask during the peripheral intravenous catheter insertion would reduce&#xD;
      the 6 to 11 child's pain, the children and parents' anxiety, would improve satisfaction of&#xD;
      children, parents and nurse about the care and would reduce time and cost of the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral intravenous catheter insertion is a difficult, painful and anxiety-provoking&#xD;
      procedure for hospitalized children, with the possible memorization of pain being even more&#xD;
      present for children with chronic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memorization of painful events plays an essential role in anticipating the next experience&#xD;
      and can lead to long-term consequences. The child, whose cognitive faculties are gradually&#xD;
      developing and whose emotions are very invasive, is particularly concerned by this&#xD;
      repercussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different techniques can be used to prevent pain during care (apart from &quot;human&quot; techniques&#xD;
      such as comfort, distraction by voice, information on gesture... which are part of good&#xD;
      practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national drug safety agency recommends the use of the local anesthetic cream and/or an&#xD;
      equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide causing surface anesthesia and relaxation and&#xD;
      amnesia of the gesture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immersion in virtual reality allows to saturate the child's sensorially (3D vision, hearing&#xD;
      and kinesthetic proprioception) thus reducing nociceptive perceptions and anxiety. His&#xD;
      attention is focused by the virtual animation proposed during this experience. There are many&#xD;
      devices (glasses, masks...) as well as various programs more or less specific to care&#xD;
      situations, some of them allow to interact with games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no randomized study comparing the efficacy on pain, satisfaction and anxiety of&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous catheter insertion with the three possible analgesia techniques: local&#xD;
      anesthetic cream / local anesthetic cream and anesthetic and anxiolytic gas / local&#xD;
      anesthetic cream and virtual reality mask, nor on the medico-economic impact respecting&#xD;
      standard 6 on homogeneous pediatric age groups in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open-label, three-armed, parallel, single-center therapeutic trial&#xD;
      comparing an analgesic strategy using two authorized medical devices (conventional strategy)&#xD;
      with a virtual reality mask distraction technique for intravenous catheter insertion in&#xD;
      children aged 6 to 11 years old hospitalized in the day hospital of Clermont Ferrand&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm is the local anesthetic cream arm, the experimental arms are the local&#xD;
      anesthetic cream + anesthetic and anxiolytic gas arm on the one hand and the local anesthetic&#xD;
      cream + virtual reality mask type Oculus quest® with interactive program on the other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informing and obtaining the consent of the child and his parents, will be measured the&#xD;
      pain/anxiety/salivary cortisol/heart rate of the child; anxiety of the parents. The nurse&#xD;
      evaluates the venous capital of the child then times the time of care and collects (among&#xD;
      other things) the number of operators required. Immediately after the treatment, and then 15&#xD;
      to 30 minutes after the insertion will be measured the pain/anxiety/heart rate of the child;&#xD;
      anxiety of the parents. The salivary cortisol at 20 minutes after catheter insertion will&#xD;
      reflect the stress felt by the child during the procedure. Finally, the satisfaction of the&#xD;
      child, parents, nurses will be collected 30 minutes after the care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After statistical analysis of these three arms, it will be possible to determine the value of&#xD;
      the anesthetic and anxiolytic gas and the virtual reality mask to reduce the child's pain and&#xD;
      anxiety during the intravenous catheter insertion.&#xD;
