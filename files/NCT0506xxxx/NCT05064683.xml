      Purpose: Newborns go through biochemical and physiological changes involving all their&#xD;
      systems in the first days of their lives and may experience difficulties in adapting to&#xD;
      extrauterine life due to various reasons. For newborns whose systems are still immature,&#xD;
      leaving the warm, dark, quiet, calm, fluid-filled mother's womb and placing them in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit with many stimuli creates intense stress and negatively affects the&#xD;
      sleep-wake order necessary for brain development and maturation. Newborns have extensive&#xD;
      sleep requirements for the development of their neurosensory system. It is known that the&#xD;
      brain activity of newborns in the intrauterine period is similar to the REM (Rapid Eye&#xD;
      Movement) sleep activity, and they sleep more than adults and spend most of their sleep in&#xD;
      the REM sleep period.Therefore, sleep quality in the newborn period is directly related to&#xD;
      healthy development.In this direction, our research was carried out to examine the effects of&#xD;
      fetal position and white noise on stress and sleep in newborns with nasal CPAP(Continuous&#xD;
      Positive Airway Pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods: . This randomized experimental study was conducted on 108 newborns at the&#xD;
      gestational week of 26 or higher in the newborn intensive care unit of a university hospital.&#xD;
      The researcher applied white noise (n:36), and facilitated tucking(n:36) to the newborns. The&#xD;
      control group (n: 36) received no intervention except for the routine clinical practices.&#xD;
      Facilitated tucking white noise interventions were applied to the newborns included in study&#xD;
      for 24 hours, their stress levels were monitored with the neonatal stress scale, and their&#xD;
      sleep durations were monitored with a sleep-wakefulness measurement device and recorded in&#xD;
      the newborn follow-up form. Statistical analysis was performed using percentages, means, and&#xD;
      ANOVA test.&#xD;

      Sleep is very important for human life and includes both physiological and mental processes&#xD;
      in development. Sleep is considered not only as a resting state, but also as a state of&#xD;
      intense brain development in which neurotransmitters specific to each sleep stage affect&#xD;
      brain maturation. Sleep constitutes a large part of the life of newborns and children.&#xD;
      However, total daily sleep time, time to fall asleep, daytime sleep and sleep structure may&#xD;
      differ according to the age of the child. It is known that the brain activity of newborns in&#xD;
      the intrauterine period is completely similar to the sleep activity of the REM period, and&#xD;
      they sleep more than adults and spend most of their sleep in the REM sleep period. Therefore,&#xD;
      sleep quality in the newborn period is directly related to healthy development. Newborns who&#xD;
      are separated from the warm, dark, quiet, calm, fluid-filled mother's womb, which is the&#xD;
      natural environment for them after birth, undergo biochemical and physiological changes&#xD;
      involving all their systems in the first days of their life, and may experience difficulties&#xD;
      in adapting to extrauterine life due to various reasons. Respiratory problems are among the&#xD;
      leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period. Nasal CPAP and mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation support are the leading techniques used to provide oxygenation and ventilation in&#xD;
      the treatment of infants with or without respiratory distress. Nasal CPAP is widely used in&#xD;
      newborns, especially preterm infants, both as primary therapy and as a respiratory support&#xD;
      method after extubation. However, complications such as hyperemia in the nose, crust&#xD;
      formation, bleeding, forehead and face injuries, and infection may develop due to CPAP&#xD;
      application. In order to prevent possible complications, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      nurses should be trained about these risks and complications, specialist nursing care and&#xD;
      infection. control protocols should be implemented.Nurses who spend the most time in the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit are members of the profession responsible for ensuring the&#xD;
      adaptation of newborns to the external environment, optimal growth and development,&#xD;
      protection from diseases and maximizing the condition of the newborn, as well as basic&#xD;
      nursing practices. The neonatal intensive care nurse monitors the clinical signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of the newborn, evaluates and interprets in line with evidence-based information, and&#xD;
      determines the care needs with a family-centered approach, makes the nursing diagnosis, plans&#xD;
      and implements the care, provides training and counseling . When determining the care needs,&#xD;
      it takes into account the risk status of the newborn, the length of hospitalization, the&#xD;
      stimuli to which he is exposed, the level of pain and stress, the application of surgical&#xD;
      intervention and the presence of invasive applications . In order to prevent situations that&#xD;
      reduce or consume the energy resources required for physiological growth of the newborn, to&#xD;
      protect the energy resources that are wasted, to accelerate the healing process, to reduce&#xD;
      pain, stress, autonomic response and oxygen consumption, to provide sleep pattern, comfort&#xD;
      and immobilization, the neonatal intensive care nurse has and non-pharmacological methods.&#xD;
      Facilitated tucking white noise are among the non-pharmacological methods frequently used by&#xD;
      neonatal nurses.The facilitated tucking is a method that allows the baby to feel and calm&#xD;
      down in the womb, to develop behaviors to cope with pain and stress, to feel safe, and to&#xD;
      provide body control. In addition, it is a position that improves the sleep pattern that&#xD;
      supports motor development, growth and development, and creates a synergistic effect in pain&#xD;
      control. It has been reported that this position provides heat and tactile stimulation in&#xD;
      newborns, activating the newborns' regulatory systems, preventing painful stimuli from the&#xD;
      external environment and reducing the pain experienced by the newborns. Studies have also&#xD;
      shown that the facilitated tucking warmth and tactile stimulation in newborns, activates the&#xD;
      newborn's own regulatory systems, activates the newborn's attention, prevents painful stimuli&#xD;
      originating from the external environment, increases the release of endogenous endorphins,&#xD;
      helps the distribution of pain impulses in the spinal cord, and reduces the pain felt by&#xD;
      newborn . It has been stated that it is an effective method in reducing the crying time and&#xD;
      pain after the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White noise is a continuous monotonous sound such as the sound of wind, waterfall, ocean&#xD;
      waves or rain coming from the environment, and it is a sound that is prepared digitally by&#xD;
      mixing different frequency sounds in equal proportions in the laboratory environment and is&#xD;
      prepared by calibrating all the frequencies in the sound and it is pleasant to the ear. White&#xD;
      noise sources include rain, waterfall, water sounds, hair dryer sound, vacuum cleaner sound,&#xD;
      aspirator sound, clock sound, heart sound. When the literature is examined that white noise&#xD;
      played during the heel blood collection process in newborns reduces the baby's pain score and&#xD;
      shortens the crying time. Similarly, preterm newborns were listened to during the white noise&#xD;
      vaccination process and it was found to have a pain-reducing effect compared to the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White noise is similar to the sound in the womb as it is a humming and continuous monotonous&#xD;
      sound. It is known that the newborn is affected by the mother's heartbeat while in the womb,&#xD;
      and finding this sound and rhythm after birth has a relaxing effect on the newborn. In&#xD;
      experimental studies conducted in the relevant field, it has been observed that newborns&#xD;
      sleeping in a room where the sound of the uterus is heard fall asleep earlier than those in&#xD;
      the room where no sound is heard, and this shows that newborns begin to gain a certain&#xD;
      sensitivity to music before they are born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the literature is examined, it has been stated facilitated tucking white noise may&#xD;
      affect the sleep quality of newborns. However, it has been observed that there is no study&#xD;
      examining the difference between facilitated tucking and white noise. In this direction,&#xD;
      research was carried out to examine the effects of facilitated tucking and white noise on the&#xD;
      stress and sleep of newborns in Nasal CPAP.&#xD;
