  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the investigators know that there is a high and increasing prevalence of sleep&#xD;
      quality and quantity deficits in the general population with the social and health&#xD;
      consequences that this entails. There are numerous activity wristbands linked to mobile apps&#xD;
      that analyze sleep, but none can generate individualized recommendations for improvement&#xD;
      interacting with the person. The main objective of the current project is to develop a&#xD;
      virtual and interactive sleep assistant to increase the quantity and quality of sleep.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives being the improvement of daytime sleepiness and the quality of life of&#xD;
      the persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: 202 participants in active employment who meet the criteria of &quot;poor sleepers&quot;&#xD;
      (defined by a Pittsburg test score &gt;5) are divided into 2 study groups. 1. Intervention&#xD;
      group: Sleep data will be collected using validated questionnaires (SATED and the Sleep&#xD;
      Hygiene Index) and objectively employing an activity bracelet, in which weekly, through a&#xD;
      live chat, the medical staff of the sleep units will offer recommendations for the&#xD;
      improvement of the deficits detected. 2. Control group: Same protocol as the intervention&#xD;
      group, but the participants will not receive the recommendations via the interactive chat.&#xD;

    <description>It is a medical device that collects, among other things, movement data by means of an accelerometer, from which it accelerometer, from which it estimates the total time of sleep (TTS) and wakefulness, and waking time, also offering the efficiency of the same (time asleep in relation to time in bed). time in bed). In addition, it collects data not related to sleep, such as energy expenditure (in kilocalories), energy expenditure (in kilocalories) (in kilocalories), heart rate, and daily activity (in steps), among others.</description>

    <description>In the Intervention group, in addition to having the philips band, the subjects will interact through the live chat system that they will have to download to their mobile phones. This live chat offers the possibility to consult in real time, thus initiating a process of relationship between researcher/subject.</description>

    <description>Subjects from the intervention group will be able to ask for a medical intervention if needed with the phisycians from the sleep unit. After the following period, we expect to see better sleep habits in this group when compared to the no intervention one</description>
