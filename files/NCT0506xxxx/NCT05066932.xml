    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterised by elevated plasma&#xD;
      LDLC levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causal role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) in the progression of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) is indisputable: genetic, epidemiological and interventional&#xD;
      trials have unanimously shown that a reduction in LDL-C is associated with a reduced risk of&#xD;
      CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some drawbacks related to the limitations of the analytical methods are slowly surfacing due&#xD;
      to the lower LDLC target achieved with the combination of several new treatments. This is&#xD;
      mainly due to the fact that LDLC is not a comprehensive marker to stratify cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk in subjects with increased levels of other atherogenic lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct measurement of the concentration of apolipoproteins involved in cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglycerides transportation, may provide more information than the simple measure of the&#xD;
      cholesterol contained in these particles. There is an interest in measuring the various&#xD;
      players involved in the lipoprotein processing chain. These apolipoproteins are increasingly&#xD;
      being considered as possible biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, there is increasing evidence that advanced lipoprotein testing methods, such as&#xD;
      multiplexed measurements of apolipoprotein panels (ApoA-I, A-II, A-IV, B-100, C-I, C-II,&#xD;
      C-III, E), provide more detailed information on the dyslipidaemic profiles of patients&#xD;
      compared to conventional lipid testing, finally allowing a better understanding and&#xD;
      stratification of subclinical atherosclerosis in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare the apolipoprotein profile of patients with FH&#xD;
      by comparing those with associated hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTG) to those with isolated&#xD;
      hypercholesterolaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult subjects with a molecular diagnosis of Familial Hypercholesterolemia, treated by a&#xD;
      statin, on primary prevention, asymptomatic for cardiovascular symptoms, will be recruited&#xD;
      and stratified according to the presence/absence of hyperTG in a case-control prospective&#xD;
      observational study design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The crucial role of dyslipidaemia, in particular hypercholesterolaemia, in the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases is particularly well documented. The causal role of LDLC in the&#xD;
      progression of CVD is indisputable: genetic, epidemiological and interventional trials have&#xD;
      unanimously shown that a reduction in LDL-C is associated with a reduced risk of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some drawbacks related to the limitations of the analytical methods are slowly surfacing due&#xD;
      to the lower LDLC target achieved with the combination of several new treatments. This is&#xD;
      mainly due to the fact that LDLC is not a comprehensive marker to stratify cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk in subjects with increased levels of other atherogenic lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterised by elevated plasma&#xD;
      LDLC levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma levels of key lipoproteins, including LDLC levels, are major determinants and triggers&#xD;
      of vascular endothelial damage; monocyte to macrophage differentiation and foam cell&#xD;
      formation, leading to the development of atherosclerotic lesions; premature coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD); peripheral arterial disease; and supra-aortic stenosis. The earlier these&#xD;
      events occur, the higher the cholesterol level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence suggests that triglyceride-rich&#xD;
      lipoproteins (TRL), and in particular remnant particles, contribute to atherogenesis and thus&#xD;
      to the progression of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, these lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) circulate in blood&#xD;
      plasma as lipoproteins, supramolecular assemblies whose structure is provided by specific&#xD;
      proteins: apolipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct measurement of the concentration of atherogenic particles involved in the metabolism&#xD;
      of cholesterol and TG could therefore provide more information than simply measuring the&#xD;
      cholesterol contained in these particles. There is an interest in measuring the various&#xD;
      players involved in the lipoprotein processing chain. These apolipoproteins are increasingly&#xD;
      being considered as possible biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Indeed, there is&#xD;
      increasing evidence that advanced lipoprotein testing methods, such as multiplexed&#xD;
      measurements of apolipoprotein panels (ApoA-I, A-II, A-IV, B-100, C-I, C-II, C-III, E),&#xD;
      provide more detailed information on the dyslipidaemic profiles of patients compared to&#xD;
      conventional lipid testing, allowing for a better understanding and stratification of&#xD;
      subclinical atherosclerosis in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the apolipoprotein profile of patients with FH by comparing those with associated&#xD;
      hyperTG to those with isolated hypercholesterolaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the subclinical impairment of FH patients with and without hyperTG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the coronary atherosclerotic burden, assessed by the Calcium Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare carotid atherosclerotic burden, assessed by echodoppler&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare femoral atherosclerotic burden, assessed by echodoppler&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of the research :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be informed of the study and if agree to participate, additional blood tubes&#xD;
      will be collected for the research during the blood sampling carried out as part of the usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed in collaboration with LNE, the France's national metrology&#xD;
      laboratory as part of the European CARDIOMET project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biobank and serum library will also be constituted during the study for further and&#xD;
      additional analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be enrolled :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) without hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTG)&#xD;
