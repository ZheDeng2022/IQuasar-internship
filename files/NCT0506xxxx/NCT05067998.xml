      Herbal Medicine is known as the medicinal use of herbal substances as a means of treating&#xD;
      different conditions in the human body to ensure that the body remains in optimal health and&#xD;
      wellness. These substances are known to contain very active ingredients in it and as such is&#xD;
      also a very potent means of managing diseases and ailments in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herbal medicine has always been a standby source of getting relief from various conditions&#xD;
      over centuries, however, it can be categorically said that the mode of usage of these herbal&#xD;
      substances has changed over time. Traditional healers help individuals to make meaning out of&#xD;
      the natural herbs seen around that can be useful to one's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herbal medicine is the use of plants to treat disease and enhance general health and&#xD;
      wellbeing. Herbs can interact with other pharmaceutical medications and should be taken with&#xD;
      care. Always seek a regular medical doctor (GP) about any health concerns and tell them about&#xD;
      any herbal medicines you are taking or thinking of taking. Never stop taking prescribed&#xD;
      medications in favor of herbs without first discussing it with your GP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major use of herbal medicines is for health promotion and therapy for chronic, as opposed&#xD;
      to life-threatening, conditions. However, usage of traditional remedies increases when&#xD;
      conventional medicine is ineffective in the treatment of disease, such as in advanced cancer&#xD;
      and in the face of new infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some popular options include vitamin C, B12, and, increasingly, vitamin D, while also&#xD;
      offering vitamin D3 drips. Vitamin D, sometimes called the &quot;sunshine vitamin&quot; because it can&#xD;
      be obtained through sun exposure, helps the body absorb calcium, according to the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health. Some people may be turning to drips of the vitamin because they aren't&#xD;
      getting their share of sunshine this time of year and because they want to maintain a strong&#xD;
      and healthy immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D3 is the version to go for since the body absorbs it better than vitamin D2,&#xD;
      Taub-Dix says. But she advises against getting your vitamin D from an IV and instead shop for&#xD;
      an oral supplement, since it's readily available on pharmacy and grocery store shelves and is&#xD;
      easy to take by mouth. It's safe to take at dosages of up to 4,000 international units (IU).&#xD;
      IV therapy has recently enjoyed a spike in popularity in people who rely on it as a sure-fire&#xD;
      way to obtain all the health benefits and vitamins necessary to help them combat ailments as&#xD;
      well as to feel their best as they cope with the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several types of intravenous vitamin therapies and vitamin injections to choose&#xD;
      from. The ones containing a large assortment of vitamins necessary to combat the flu are in&#xD;
      highest demand. These are the ones containing Vitamin C, D, Zinc, and Vitamin B12 - all of&#xD;
      which are vitamins known to play an essential role in assisting the body in its production of&#xD;
      red blood cells and common immune system boosters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;The benefit of IV therapy is that by intravenously or intramuscularly administering&#xD;
      vitamins, you are able to absorb 100 percent of what is being put in versus supplements which&#xD;
      must be broken down. The therapy itself only takes about 30 minutes to an hour and is&#xD;
      monitored. Once the infusion is finished, the IV is removed and the person who received the&#xD;
      treatment is free to go home without restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous vitamin therapy has proven helpful in the treatment of several different&#xD;
      conditions that affect not only the immune system but other parts of the body as well. Some&#xD;
      of the ailments of this type of therapy can help with constant fatigue, headaches, &quot;brain&#xD;
      fog&quot; dry or tired looking skin, dehydration or frequent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For years, people have turned to Vitamin C pills or multivitamins to help boost their immune&#xD;
      systems. But with IV therapy, the options are endless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we are looking to strengthen our body and give our immune system a boost, intravenous IV&#xD;
      therapy is the best option to do so, quickly and effectively. The body needs many different&#xD;
      types of vitamins and nutrients to maintain normal function throughout day to day life.&#xD;
      However, the body cannot create these vitamins on its own. Most vitamins and nutrients come&#xD;
      from external sources, mostly from what we eat and drink. However, as efficient as the&#xD;
      metabolic process is, the body does not absorb all the nutrients. IV therapy circumvents this&#xD;
      problem and ensures 100% absorption because the nutrients are delivered directly into the&#xD;
      bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of IV drip therapy is especially valuable during illness, when the body's&#xD;
      demand for nutrients is greater than usual. Supplements are invaluable to the healing process&#xD;
      and helping the body recover more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drip Hydration offers many IV drip therapy options to quickly and effectively improve the&#xD;
      symptoms of a wide variety of conditions. There will also custom-blend formulas upon request.&#xD;
      Each of our treatments contain a unique combination of ingredients. Intravenous&#xD;
      administration of nutrients can achieve serum concentrations not obtainable with oral, or&#xD;
      even intramuscular (IM), administration. For example, as the oral dose of vitamin C is&#xD;
      increased progressively, the serum concentration of ascorbate tends to approach an upper&#xD;
      limit, as a result of both saturation of gastrointestinal absorption and a sharp increase in&#xD;
      renal clearance of the vitamin. (3) When the daily intake of vitamin C is increased 12-fold,&#xD;
      from 200 mg/day to 2,500 mg/day, the plasma concentration increases by only 25 percent, from&#xD;
      1.2 to 1.5 mg/dL. The highest serum vitamin C level reported after oral administration of&#xD;
      pharmacological doses of the vitamin is 9.3 mg/dL. In contrast, IV administration of 50 g/day&#xD;
      of vitamin C resulted in a mean peak plasma level of 80 mg/dL. (4) Similarly, oral&#xD;
      supplementation with magnesium results in little or no change in serum magnesium&#xD;
      concentrations, whereas IV administration can double or triple the serum levels, (5,6) at&#xD;
      least for a short period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various nutrients have been shown to exert pharmacological effects, which are in many cases&#xD;
      dependent on the concentration of the nutrient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to having direct pharmacological effects, IV nutrient therapy may be more&#xD;
      effective than oral or IM treatment for correcting intracellular nutrient deficits. Some&#xD;
      nutrients are present at much higher concentrations in the cells than in the serum. For&#xD;
      example, the average magnesium concentration in myocardial cells is 10 times higher than the&#xD;
      extracellular concentration. This ratio is maintained in healthy cells by an active-transport&#xD;
      system that continually pumps magnesium ions into cells against the concentration gradient.&#xD;
      In certain disease states, the capacity of membrane pumps to maintain normal concentration&#xD;
      gradients may be compromised. In one study, the mean myocardial magnesium concentration was&#xD;
      65-percent lower in patients with cardiomyopathy than in healthy controls, (10) implying a&#xD;
      reduction in the intracellular-to-extracellular ratio to less than 4-to-1. As magnesium plays&#xD;
      a key role in mitochondrial energy production, intracellular magnesium deficiency may&#xD;
      exacerbate heart failure and lead to a vicious cycle of further intracellular magnesium loss&#xD;
      and more severe heart failure.&#xD;
