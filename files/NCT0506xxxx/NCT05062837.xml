  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to prospectively enroll CNLC stage IIIb HCC cases with extrahepatic&#xD;
      metastasis and intrahepatic lesions that are expected to be radical resected in several&#xD;
      domestic clinical centers, and observe the OS and ORR, DCR, DOR, TTP and PFS of patients&#xD;
      receiving hepatectomy combined with apatinib + carrelli pearl treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carrelizumab was approved by CFDA for second-line indication of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) in 2020. The AHELP study led to the CFDA approval of apatinib for second-line&#xD;
      indication of HCC in 2021. RESCUE study (phase II) reported the efficacy and safety data of&#xD;
      apatinib combined with carrelizumab in first-line (n= 70, 68.6% of CNLC stage IIIb) and&#xD;
      second-line (n= 140, 75.8% of CNLC stage IIIb) in the treatment of advanced HCC. ORR was 46%&#xD;
      and 25%, 2-year OS was 43% and 45%, median OS was 20.1 and 21.8 months, PFS was 6.4 and 5.5&#xD;
      months, and grade ≥3 adverse events were 78.6% and 76.7%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local progression of intrahepatic lesions of HCC is the most important and direct cause of&#xD;
      death, while extrahepatic metastases such as lung and bone metastases progress slowly and&#xD;
      pose a much lower threat to life than intrahepatic lesions. For CNLC stage IIIb HCC, although&#xD;
      liver resection is not recommended by officical guidelines, for cases with resectable&#xD;
      intrahepatic lesions, a number of retrospective studies suggest that patients in the&#xD;
      hepatectomy (even palliative resection) group had significantly better OS than those in the&#xD;
      nonsurgical group, with a median OS of up to 32 months in the hepatectomy group,&#xD;
      significantly higher than 19.2 months in atzuzumab plus bevacizumab or 20.1 months in&#xD;
      apatinib plus carrelizumab. Previous retrospective studies in our center also suggest that&#xD;
      some HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis can still benefit from hepatectomy for&#xD;
      long-term survival. Other studies suggested that the larger the preoperative diameter of HCC&#xD;
      tumor, the greater the probability of postoperative lung metastasis. The more advanced the&#xD;
      intrahepatic tumor or the larger the tumor load, the more likely the extrahepatic metastasis.&#xD;
      Therefore, hepatectomy combined with targeted drugs +ICI may be the best treatment for HCC&#xD;
      with extrahepatic metastasis and radical resection of intrahepatic tumor.&#xD;
