  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesised that the MyoVista wavECG has the potential to show non inferior&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity compared to the current heart failure pathway screening tools of&#xD;
      BNP/NT-proBNP and 12 lead resting ECG, but has the advantage of providing a single, familiar,&#xD;
      inexpensive point of care test which provides point of care results and can act as a&#xD;
      prescreen, or in circumstances replacement to BNP/NTpro-BNP testing, and eliminate a&#xD;
      proportion of the unnecessary testing and echo referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative performance analysis of the modalities will form the basis for the study with&#xD;
      subsequent reporting on the financial impact and societal benefits of any potential pathway&#xD;
      change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-interventional, single arm, non-inferiority clinical study of the&#xD;
      MyoVista wavECG ability to identify primary care patients for referral to secondary care for&#xD;
      diagnosis of heart failure (as defined by BSE (British Society of Echocardiography)&#xD;
      guidelines for echo), in direct comparison to BNP/NT-proBNP. The study will be conducted at a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 investigational secondary care sites within the United Kingdom, and some/all&#xD;
      referring primary care centres for each site. Study subjects presenting at primary care with&#xD;
      shortness of breath, risk factors for and/or suspicion of heart failure will be referred to&#xD;
      secondary care for 2D transthoracic echocardiogram based on borderline and abnormal&#xD;
      BNP/NT-proBNP results as part of the current heart failure pathway as defined by the NICE&#xD;
      (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, with the MyoVista wavECG used&#xD;
      for the conventional 12 lead ECG reporting and comparison purposes only. MyoVista wavECG&#xD;
      results will not be used in the diagnosis of a patient, and/or for the basis of a patient&#xD;
      referral to echocardiography for the study duration. In commercial use the MyoVista wavECG&#xD;
      will be intended for use in a population of patients being considered for such a referral by&#xD;
      providing CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) derived&#xD;
      informatics surrounding an overall summary of left ventricular relaxation abnormalities (High&#xD;
      Negative, Negative, Borderline, Positive and Highly Positive). The design of this study will&#xD;
      allow for an appropriate evaluation of safety and effectiveness for that population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will consist of a single visit for all study subjects, after which the&#xD;
      subject's participation in the trial will conclude unless longitudinal study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria met and agreed at enrollment (Normal BNP/NT-proBNP, MyoVista wavECG result Negative,&#xD;
      Borderline, Positive, Highly Positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will provide written informed consent for the procedures consistent with&#xD;
      the study protocol.&#xD;
