  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time from randomization to first independently centrally adjudicated relapse (TTFR) during the DB Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to EDB/EWD Visit (until a confirmed relapse or up to 132 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The TTFR (days) will be defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the first date of the objective relapse.&#xD;
During the Double Blind (DB) Treatment Period (Part A); EDB/EWD = End of Double-Blind/Early Withdrawal Visit</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during OLE Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>OLE Treatment Period (OLE Week 1) to EOS/EWD Visit (up to OLE Week 52)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP.&#xD;
Open-Label Extension (OLE) Treatment Period (Part B); EOS/EWD = End of Study/Early Withdrawal Visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to permanent withdrawal of investigational medicinal product (IMP) during OLE Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>OLE Period (OLE Week 1) to EOS/EWD Visit (up to OLE Week 52)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study are reported.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Low-Contrast Monocular Visual Acuity (Worst Affected Eye) measured by low-contrast Landolt C Broken Rings Chart at the EDB/EWD Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 1) to EDB/EWD Visit (up to 132 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity is a measurement of the capacity for visual discrimination of fine details. Visual acuity tests are used to determine the smallest characters that can be read on a standardized chart. The Landolt C Broken Ring Chart uses standardized incomplete rings or &quot;C&quot;, which are positioned in any direction in the chart (up, down, left, right, and 45 degree positions in between). The participant has to be able to indicate where the break of the &quot;C&quot; is located, by describing the position or by giving gesture.&#xD;
During Part A.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability as assessed by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores at the EDB/EWD Visit (with confirmation at 3 months)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), EDB/EWD Visit (up to 132 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death) in half-point increments with half steps from 1.0 to 9.5. The higher the value the higher is the level of impairment and disability.&#xD;
During Part A.</description>

    <measure>Number of MOG-AD related inpatient hospitalizations during the DB Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to EDB/EWD Visit (up to 132 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of inpatient hospitalizations from Baseline through EDB/EWD Visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Independently centrally adjudicated annualized relapse rate (ARR) during the DB Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to EDB/EWD Visit (up to 132 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An on-study ARR will be calculated for each participant based on the confirmed adjudicated relapse(s) observed in the Double-Blind Treatment Period.&#xD;
During Part A.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Low-Contrast Monocular Visual Acuity (Least Affected Eye) measured by low-contrast Landolt C Broken Rings Chart at the EDB/EWD Visit (with confirmation at 3 months)</measure>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to EOS/EWD Visit (up to OLE Week 52)</time_frame>
    <description>An ARR will be calculated for each participant prior to randomization into the Double-Blind Treatment Period (based on available historical data), and 2 ARRs after randomization to study treatment: first for relapses occurring during the Double-Blind Treatment Period and the second for relapses occurring during the OLE Treatment Period. The relapse episodes for each participant will be recorded throughout the entire study.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
