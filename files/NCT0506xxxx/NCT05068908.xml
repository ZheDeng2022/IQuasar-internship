    <textblock>
      This study addresses the timely problem of painful temporomandibular disorders (TMD), the&#xD;
      most common cause of orofacial pain second only to tooth pain. Findings from previous studies&#xD;
      suggest that dysregulation of connectivity within specific brain circuits is part of chronic&#xD;
      pain pathophysiology. This study will identify connectivity patterns within those brain&#xD;
      circuits as potential signatures for pain- related disability in chronic TMD pain&#xD;
      participants. New knowledge regarding these brain connectivity patterns is expected to be&#xD;
      significant because it will support improved phenotyping of this heterogeneous participant&#xD;
      population. It is also expected that this finding can potentially be extrapolated to other&#xD;
      chronic pain conditions, such as back pain, migraine headache, and fibromyalgia that are&#xD;
      frequently comorbid conditions in chronic TMD participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence of dysregulation of brain circuits in chronic pain in general and in chronic&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain specifically is well documented. Among putative brain&#xD;
      circuits involved in chronic pain pathophysiology are thalamocortical brain pathways, which&#xD;
      transmit nociceptive signals centrally from peripheral tissues. Pathways between the medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are considered part of an&#xD;
      antinociceptive brain circuit, since they are necessary to engage endogenous pain modulation.&#xD;
      Dysfunction of endogenous pain modulation has been systematically reported in chronic pain&#xD;
      patients, and a meta-analysis of clinical studies of TMD patients done by the Principal&#xD;
      investigator and others showed increased pain facilitation and impaired pain inhibition in&#xD;
      patients relative to pain-free controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endogenous pain modulation can be assessed by psychophysical methods. For instance, pain&#xD;
      facilitation can be assessed with temporal summation of pain (TSP) using brief noxious&#xD;
      stimuli presented repeatedly over peripheral tissues at &gt;0.3 Hz. Pain inhibition can be&#xD;
      assessed with conditioned pain modulation (CPM) by presenting noxious stimuli over a body&#xD;
      site during concurrent noxious stimuli elsewhere to induce pain inhibition. Neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies in pain-free controls showed that functional connectivity within thalamocortical and&#xD;
      antinociceptive brain circuits are related to increased TSP and reduced CPM responses,&#xD;
      respectively. It is unknown if connectivity patterns within the thalamocortical and&#xD;
      antinociceptive brain circuits are altered in chronic TMD patients, reflecting endogenous&#xD;
      pain modulation dysfunction. Corticolimbic pathways connecting the mPFC, amygdala and nucleus&#xD;
      accumbens are thought to play a key role in chronic pain and specifically, in emotion-driven&#xD;
      modulation of nociceptive signals. Recently a longitudinal study showed that functional and&#xD;
      structural connectivity patterns determined from neuroimaging data between these regions&#xD;
      predict transition from acute to chronic back pain. A population study of TMD pain patients&#xD;
      showed that approximately 64% of these patients also present with comorbid low back pain,&#xD;
      thus it is possible that chronic TMD pain patients may display brain connectivity patterns&#xD;
      that are similar to those identified in persistent back pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional brain connectivity is usually assessed from resting-state functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI), where participants lay at rest during fMRI scans to measure&#xD;
      intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). Connectivity patterns within the thalamocortical,&#xD;
      corticolimbic and antinociceptive circuits described above were determined using this&#xD;
      traditional approach for FC assessment. Recent studies departed from this traditional&#xD;
      approach and assessed FC during presentation of noxious stimuli during fMRI data acquisition&#xD;
      and identified evoked FC changes. These studies' results suggest that noxious stimuli affect&#xD;
      connectivity patterns in brain circuits involved in pain processing in pain-free participants&#xD;
      and in fibromyalgia patients. Thus, it is reasonable that psychophysical testing for pain&#xD;
      facilitation (e.g., TSP) and pain inhibition (e.g., CPM) could reflect changes in&#xD;
      connectivity patterns within brain circuits associated with pain modulation. If confirmed,&#xD;
      these evoked connectivity patterns identified from engaging endogenous pain modulation could&#xD;
      serve as a &quot;signature&quot; for pain modulation in individuals, similar to a &quot;functional&#xD;
      connectome fingerprinting&quot; demonstrated to predict fluid intelligence in healthy participants&#xD;
      using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together these results suggest new approaches to investigate dysregulation of brain&#xD;
      circuits in chronic TMD pain with a focus on brain connectivity, that can serve as unique&#xD;
      chronic pain &quot;signatures&quot; related to endogenous pain modulation function. There is a critical&#xD;
      need to determine the potential of brain circuits' connectivity patterns to serve as&#xD;
      signatures for pain- related disability. Addressing this critical need will provide novel&#xD;
      ways to identify subgroups of chronic TMD pain patients who respond poorly to treatment.&#xD;
      Closing this gap in our knowledge has reasonable potential to provide the opportunity for&#xD;
      development of precise and valid brain imaging methods supporting refined phenotyping of&#xD;
      chronic TMD pain patients leading to early identification of patients with poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain causes suffering to more Americans than heart disease, diabetes and cancer&#xD;
      combined, and TMD is the second most commonly occurring musculoskeletal condition resulting&#xD;
      in pain and disability after chronic back pain. TMD affects approximately 5-12% of the&#xD;
      population, with annual estimates of economic impact ranging between $4 billion per the NIDCR&#xD;
      and $32 billion according to a study sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and&#xD;
      Quality . Pain-related disability significantly impacts patient's quality of life, and a&#xD;
      subgroup of chronic TMD pain patients present with high pain-related disability, as&#xD;
      identified by the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS), and these patients have poor prognoses -&#xD;
      even with treatment - and greater health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About half to two-thirds of individuals with TMD seek treatment, and of those approximately&#xD;
      15% will develop chronic pain. Chronic TMD pain patients present with pain persisting â‰¥6&#xD;
      months, and it is well accepted that chronic TMD pain pathophysiology includes dysregulation&#xD;
      of brain circuits. Recent evidence suggests that brain functional and anatomical&#xD;
      characteristics, namely connectivity patterns within specific brain circuits, are related to&#xD;
      processing, modulation and persistence of pain. Brain connectivity patterns within the&#xD;
      thalamocortical circuit are associated with expression of endogenous pain facilitation, while&#xD;
      connectivity patterns between prefrontal cortex and brainstem nuclei, an antinociceptive&#xD;
      circuit, are related to endogenous pain inhibition. In addition, brain connectivity patterns&#xD;
      within corticolimbic pathways involved in the emotion-driven modulation of nociceptive&#xD;
      signals predict transition from acute to chronic back pain. These connectivity patterns&#xD;
      within thalamocortical, antinociceptive, and corticolimbic brain circuits have not been&#xD;
      described in chronic TMD patients, and it is unknown if connectivity patterns within these&#xD;
      brain circuits can distinguish chronic TMD patients based on pain-related disability.&#xD;

    <description>To assess correlations between functional connectivity and anatomical connectivity matrices and individual endogenous pain modulation responses, TSP testing will be conducted. TSP testing uses calibrated instruments to deliver a single pinprick stimulus perceived as &quot;slightly painful&quot; by the participant, followed by 10-stimuli series repeated at 1 Hz. TSP testing protocol is done in triplicate, generating three pain ratings on a 0-100 numerical rating scale for single stimulus and for 10-stimuli series.

    <description>To assess correlations between functional connectivity and anatomical connectivity matrices and individual endogenous pain modulation responses, CPM testing will be conducted. CPM testing uses a pressure algometer as test stimulus to deliver increasing pressure (50kPa/s rate) to the test site until the participant presses a switch signaling when the pressure sensation first becomes painful. The conditioning stimulus (CS) used to elicit pain inhibition for CPM testing is tonic noxious contact heat applied to the non-dominant volar forearm. CPM testing is done in triplicate on two occasions: at baseline and during CS applied to the forearm. CPM responses will be assessed during Visit 2 and reported as a percentage value.</description>
