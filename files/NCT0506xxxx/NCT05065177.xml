    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a live attenuated&#xD;
      mumps vaccine in healthy infants between 8 - 18 months old with a commercialized live&#xD;
      attenuated mumps vaccine as the control vaccine.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, blind, single-center, controlled phase III clinical trial. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a live attenuated mumps&#xD;
      vaccine manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd. The control vaccine is&#xD;
      a commercialized live attenuated mumps vaccine manufactured by ZheJiang VACN&#xD;
      bio-pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. All participants are healthy infants between 8 - 18 months old,&#xD;
      and will be randomly assigned into experimental group or control group in the ratio 1:1.&#xD;
