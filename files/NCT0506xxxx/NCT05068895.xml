  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) in patients with diabetes increases&#xD;
      significantly and are characterized with obvious arteriosclerosis that are caused by multiple&#xD;
      metabolic disorders. Metabolomics measures the metabolites in biological fluids or tissues&#xD;
      that generated under certain conditions via rapidly evolving high-throughput technology.&#xD;
      Herein, the investigators designed the study to characterize the serum metabolic profiles of&#xD;
      LEAD patients and identify metabolic biomarkers using metabolomics. The serum of volunteers,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) patients with or without LEAD were collected and analyzed&#xD;
      using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(LC-MS) coupled with a series of multivariate&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;

    <description>Metabolomics is a rapidly evolving high-throughput technology that allows the measurement of the entire complement of metabolites generated by biochemical reactions under certain conditions in biological fluids or tissues. This technology has been used extensively to identify biomarkers in various cancers, nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, pituitary diseases, and other diseases. The identification of biomarkers can be clinically useful for a more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choice as well as disease monitoring. Among mass spectrometry (MS) methods, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been recognized as a robust metabolomics tool and has been widely applied in metabolite identification and quantification due to its high sensitivity, peak resolution, and repro- ducibility.</description>
