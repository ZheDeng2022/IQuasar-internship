  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of synthetic mesh to repair infected defects of the abdominal wall remains&#xD;
      controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term outcomes of using PVDF mesh to&#xD;
      treat infected abdominal wall defects in the elective setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From May 2016 until February 2021, 38 patients presenting with chronic mesh infection and/or&#xD;
      enteric fistulas were enrolled in this prospective study. The active infection group (AI) was&#xD;
      compared to a cohort of 38 patients submitted to clean ventral hernia repairs (CC). The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria in the AI group were the presence of active chronic mesh infection&#xD;
      (non-healing sinus, exposed mesh, or mesh-related enteric fistulas) resulting from a previous&#xD;
      repair, or the presence of an enteric/enteroatmospheric fistula, with or without an&#xD;
      associated abdominal wall defect. The patients invited to participate as controls had a&#xD;
      primary or recurrent ventral hernia without previous history of infection and were eligible&#xD;
      for clean operations. The operations in the AI group were classified as Class IV&#xD;
      (dirty-infected), according to the CDC Wound Classifications, as adopted by the European&#xD;
      registry for abdominal wall hernias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were giant ventral hernias, patients on immunosuppressive or&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy, patients with portal hypertension, Crohn's disease, acute&#xD;
      postoperative mesh infection, chronic infections following inguinal hernia repair, and&#xD;
      emergency operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data included age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, smoking status, cancer history, and the number of&#xD;
      previous abdominal operations. Perioperative details included the list of associated&#xD;
      procedures, the defect width, the extension of the pre-aponeurotic dissection, operative&#xD;
      time, and anesthesia time. Further analysis in the AI group included the clinical&#xD;
      presentation, the onset of symptoms, the type and position of the infected mesh, the possible&#xD;
      causes for mesh infection, and the microbiology of mesh explants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed and operated at the Abdominal Wall and Hernia Repair Unit at the&#xD;
      Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo, Brazil. Six surgeons of the team conducted&#xD;
      the operations in both groups. The local ethics committee approved the study. Informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all individual participants. The study was registered at the&#xD;
      national registry, Plataforma Brasil (https://plataformabrasil.saude.gov.br/login.jsf), CAAE&#xD;
      52383615.0.0000.0068, and Identifier 1.412.367.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the mesh samples used were provided by the manufacturer (FEG Textiltechnik, Aachen,&#xD;
      Germany) through their local dealer (BMR Medical, www.bmrmedical.com.br), at no cost. None of&#xD;
      the authors or our institution received any financial support to undertake the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes were the presence of any surgical site occurrences (SSO) or surgical&#xD;
      site infection (SSI) during the first 30 days after the operation. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
      included developing hernia recurrence or the recurrence of mesh infection during a 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up period. An SSI was defined as an infection occurring where the surgery took place&#xD;
      and was further defined as superficial, deep, and organ space. An SSO was described as any&#xD;
      surgical infection, wound breakdown, soft tissue ischemia, seroma, and hematoma formation. A&#xD;
      surgical site occurrence requiring procedural intervention (SSOPI) was described as any wound&#xD;
      event requiring the opening of the wound, wound debridement, suture excision, percutaneous&#xD;
      drainage, hematoma evacuation, or mesh removal [14]. The Clavien-Dindo classification [15]&#xD;
      (Table 2) was applied to all surgical complications. Suspected recurrences of a hernia or&#xD;
      infection were determined by physical examination and CT scan imaging. Non-surgical&#xD;
      complications, other operations, and deaths were recorded during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis was performed using the computer software Stata: version 16.0 (Stata&#xD;
      Corp. 2019. Stata: Release 16. Statistical Software. College Station, TX: Stata Corp LLC).&#xD;
      The frequency distribution was used by means to describe categorical variables (number of&#xD;
      cases and relative percentage) and for continuous variables, measures of central tendency&#xD;
      (median and mean) and variability (range and standard deviation). The nonparametric&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test was applied for the statistical evaluation of the association between&#xD;
      groups and continuous variables. The Student t-test was adopted when data normality was&#xD;
      identified. Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to verify the normality of data. The association&#xD;
      between categorical variables in contingency tables was analyzed using the frequency&#xD;
      Chi-square test and the Fisher exact test adopted in 2x2 tables whenever at least one&#xD;
      expected frequency was less than five. The 5% significance level was considered for all&#xD;
      statistical tests.&#xD;
