  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information on how NovoPen® 6 works with Tresiba® &amp;&#xD;
      Fiasp® for treatment of people with type 1 diabetes and see if the use of NovoPen® 6 can help&#xD;
      participants achieve better blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use Tresiba® &amp; Fiasp® in NovoPen® 6 as prescribed to participants by the&#xD;
      study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NovoPen® 6 is a smart pen, which collects and stores the date and time of injections and&#xD;
      number of units of insulin participants have taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NovoPen® 6 can transfer participants insulin dosing information to the mobile application,&#xD;
      which participants use to see their continuous blood sugar level. This will allow&#xD;
      participants to see their insulin doses along with continuous blood sugar level in the mobile&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep using their own continuous blood sugar monitoring device and the&#xD;
      mobile application to see these data during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 9-11 months. Participants will be asked to complete 2&#xD;
      questionnaires in this study. One questionnaire is about overall satisfaction of using a&#xD;
      digital health solution and other is about quality of life. Participants will complete these&#xD;
      questionnaires during their normally scheduled visit with the study doctor, on 2 separate&#xD;
      occasions&#xD;
