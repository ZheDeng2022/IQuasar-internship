    <textblock>
      Three new protein substitutes have been developed to help with compliance in PKU and TYR&#xD;
      patients, which are powdered protein substitutes, low in Phe and, low in Phe and Tyr&#xD;
      respectively, with a mixed balance of glycomacropeptide (GMP), essential and non-essential&#xD;
      amino acids, carbohydrates, fats and micronutrients for the dietary management of PKU and&#xD;
      TYR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This series of case-studies will evaluate the acceptability, compliance, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance and safety of the three GMP-based products for PKU and TYR in 45 patients with PKU&#xD;
      and TYR, in both adults and children over 3 years (15 patients per product). The case study&#xD;
      will last 29 days in total, including a 1-day baseline period followed by a 28-day&#xD;
      intervention period. The case studies will be conducted across multiple specialist metabolic&#xD;
      centres in the UK, to meet the UK ACBS and GMS requirements for acceptability studies. A&#xD;
      series of case studies is undertaken due to the rarity of these conditions and the difficulty&#xD;
      in recruiting these patients to trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) and Tyrosinaemia (TYR) are rare inherited metabolic disorders of amino&#xD;
      acid metabolism requiring dietary management. PKU is characterised by an inability to&#xD;
      metabolise the essential dietary amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine (Tyr). As such,&#xD;
      without appropriate management, PKU can lead to extremely elevated levels of Phe within the&#xD;
      blood and brain, which can be detrimental to neurological health. The dietary management of&#xD;
      PKU involves restricting dietary sources of Phe. Tyrosinaemia (TYR) is characterised by the&#xD;
      inability to metabolise the dietary amino acid Tyr. If left uncontrolled, TYR can lead to&#xD;
      serious hepatic, renal and neurological complications. The dietary management of TYR involves&#xD;
      restriction of dietary sources of Tyr and Phe (as Phe is converted into Tyr). The dietary&#xD;
      management of PKU and TYR involves restricting dietary protein intake to promote optimal&#xD;
      metabolic control, whilst meeting all other amino acid and nutrient requirements. As Phe and&#xD;
      Tyr are present in significant quantities in nearly all dietary proteins, this usually&#xD;
      requires a very low protein diet from food, supplemented with a Phe-free (for PKU) or Phe-&#xD;
      and Tyr-free (for TYR) amino acid-based protein substitute. However, compliance with the diet&#xD;
      is often poor, with patients commonly going &quot;off diet&quot; during adolescence and in adulthood.&#xD;
      This can lead to entirely preventable, lifelong mental and physiological impairments. Reasons&#xD;
      for non-compliance often revolve around the strong taste of amino acid-based protein&#xD;
      substitutes, alongside the inability to conform to the normal eating habits of peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three new protein substitutes have been developed to help with compliance in PKU and TYR&#xD;
      patients, which are powdered protein substitutes, low in Phe and, low in Phe and Tyr&#xD;
      respectively, with a mixed balance of glycomacropeptide (GMP), essential and non-essential&#xD;
      amino acids, carbohydrates, fats and micronutrients for the dietary management of PKU and&#xD;
      TYR. The protein in GMP-based products for PKU and TYR are based on GMP, a peptide isolated&#xD;
      from milk during cheese manufacturing and the only known naturally derived protein source low&#xD;
      in Phe and Tyr. The GMP is supplemented with appropriate quantities of other amino acids&#xD;
      which are naturally low or not present in GMP, as well as carbohydrates and fats. This&#xD;
      differs from traditional formulae which are based wholly on individual, synthetically&#xD;
      produced amino acids to provide the source of dietary nitrogen, supplemented with vitamins&#xD;
      and minerals. Studies to date have illustrated that PKU patients who replace their regular&#xD;
      Phe-free amino acid-based formula with GMP-based foods may have better diet compliance,&#xD;
      prefer the taste and may have improved blood Phe control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This series of case-studies will evaluate the acceptability, compliance, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance and safety of the three GMP-based products for PKU and TYR in 45 patients with PKU&#xD;
      and TYR, in both adults and children over 3 years (15 patients per product). The case study&#xD;
      will last 29 days in total, including a 1-day baseline period followed by a 28-day&#xD;
      intervention period. The case studies will be conducted across multiple specialist metabolic&#xD;
      centres in the UK, to meet the UK ACBS and GMS requirements for acceptability studies. A&#xD;
      series of case studies is undertaken due to the rarity of these conditions and the difficulty&#xD;
      in recruiting these patients to trials.&#xD;
