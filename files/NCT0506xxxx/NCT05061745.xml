  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label prospective pilot study of two neuromodulation interventions for&#xD;
      patients suffering from dysphoria. Dysphoria is a transdiagnostic symptom of unease or&#xD;
      dissatisfaction experienced across a range of diagnoses, including mood disorders and pain.&#xD;
      There is a significant gap of treatment options across conditions with dysphoria,&#xD;
      particularly non-medicated and self-care alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many neuromodulation therapies require extensive medical resources or time to deliver. Thus,&#xD;
      the investigators will test two non-invasive technologies administered in a manner that would&#xD;
      reduce resources and/or time. Virtual Reality (VR) overlays the sensory system to block the&#xD;
      external environment and provide vast range of meaningful sensory experiences. Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) involves a magnetic pulse passing through the scalp to depolarize&#xD;
      neurons in the outer cortex of the brain, and daily treatments over 6 weeks are currently FDA&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Accelerated TMS is the delivery of&#xD;
      treatment in a shorter period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study to demonstrate the preliminary effectiveness,&#xD;
      tolerability, and feasibility of these two interventions: Guided Meditation VR for Wellness&#xD;
      and Accelerated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.&#xD;
