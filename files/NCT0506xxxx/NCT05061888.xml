  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to reduce household food waste and improve individual&#xD;
      nutrition. This will be achieved using the FoodImageTM smartphone app 1, a novel method for&#xD;
      measuring household food acquisition, food intake, and food waste decisions, to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of a smart intervention that targets food waste reduction and diet quality&#xD;
      improvement. The intervention is designed to improve nutrition by offsetting intake of less&#xD;
      nutritious foods with increased fresh fruit and vegetable (FV) intake while simultaneously&#xD;
      reducing household food waste via strategies tailored to participating households.&#xD;

      Data collected will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the effects of free FV provision on: (a) household food waste levels, (b) total FV&#xD;
           acquisition (free FV provision plus purchases post-intervention vs. pre-intervention FV&#xD;
           purchases), and (c) the consumption of FV (Food Patterns Equivalents Database, FPED). We&#xD;
           hypothesize that free FV provision will increase food waste, total FV acquisition, and&#xD;
           diet quality (increase the Healthy Eating Index [HEI]). We will test these hypotheses by&#xD;
           comparing baseline and follow-up data from participants randomly assigned to the control&#xD;
           condition, which features free FV provision and a placebo (stress management)&#xD;
           intervention not focused on food waste. Exploratory analyses will examine the effects on&#xD;
           dietary energy intake and if the freely provided FV replace non-FV foods in the baseline&#xD;
           diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test if a smart intervention to reduce food waste and replace less healthy foods with FV&#xD;
           significantly reduces post-intervention food waste compared to the control group while&#xD;
           increasing FV acquisition and consumption compared to pre-intervention baseline. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that this smart intervention will increase total FV acquisition and FV&#xD;
           consumption compared to baseline, and these increases are not expected to differ&#xD;
           significantly from control. It is further hypothesized that those receiving the smart&#xD;
           intervention will significantly reduce food waste compared to controls. Exploratory&#xD;
           analyses will examine the extent to which the smart intervention had the intended effect&#xD;
           of replacing less healthy foods with FV consumption.&#xD;
