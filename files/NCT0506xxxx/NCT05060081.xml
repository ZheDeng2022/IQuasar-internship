  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SEBT was performed with the player standing at the center of a grid placed on the floor, with 8 lines extending at 458 increments from the center of the grid. The 8 lines were labeled according to the direction of excursion relative to the stance leg: Antero-lateral (AL), Anterior (A), Antero-medial (AM), Medial (M), Poster-medial (PM), Posterior (P), Poster-lateral (PL), and Lateral (L). To perform the SEBTs, the player maintained a single-leg stance while reaching with the opposite leg as far as possible. The player lightly touched the farthest point possible on the line with the most distal part of the reach foot then returning to a bilateral stance while maintaining their balance. The distance was measured from the center of the grid to the touch point with a tape measure in centimeters. There will be two assessments, at baseline before the start of exercise program and at the end of six weeks intervention.</description>

    <measure>One Min Sit Up Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Core muscles Strength was measured by one min Sit up test and Prone Bridge Test (Plank Test).The subject lay supine on the floor with 90° flexion in the knee joints, hands at the side of their head, and with elbows pointing straight forward. To do a correct sit-up execution the elbows should touch the knees and then go back so the shoulders touch the floor. The number of repetitions performed was recorded. There will be two assessments, at baseline before the start of exercise program and at the end of six weeks intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Badcamp Agility Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Badcamp Agility test was performed with players standing at the middle of the badminton court. Six targets were placed at six ends of the court. The players were give warning signal and the examiner started marking the corners which players have to follow. The players have to touch all 6 markers as marked by the examiner in an undecided manner. Each participant performed the test 3 times, and the shortest time was considered for analysis. At least 1 minute of rest was given between trials. There will be two assessments, at baseline before the start of exercise program and at the end of six weeks intervention.</description>
