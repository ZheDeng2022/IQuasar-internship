  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital Acquired and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (HAP/VAP) pose a significant burden to&#xD;
      patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Reported incidence ranges from 10-16% in&#xD;
      all ICU patients (including HAP and VAP) and around 20-30% in ventilated patients (VAP).&#xD;
      Patients with HAP/VAP have a high mortality rate. The estimated attributable mortality of VAP&#xD;
      is 6-13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating medical&#xD;
      interventions, but are difficult to perform in this population. Several preventive and&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment options are being developed that will require evaluation in phase-III&#xD;
      trials. These trials are challenging due to the relatively low incidence of the outcome (e.g.&#xD;
      HAP/VAP) or of the domain under study (e.g. specific antibiotic resistant infections) and the&#xD;
      requirement of informed consent in critically ill patients. There is a need for a&#xD;
      well-organized and well-trained international RCT network that enables efficient execution of&#xD;
      a series of RCTs in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to set up an infrastructure to prospectively enroll patients&#xD;
      at risk of HAP/VAP in ICUs in several European countries. Site personnel will be trained to&#xD;
      obtain a GCP (Good Clinical Practice) certification (if not already done), to timely identify&#xD;
      and enroll patients at risk of HAP/VAP, to timely identify occurrence of HAP/VAP, collect&#xD;
      informed consent forms, collect source data, enter data into a clinical database, and use a&#xD;
      dedicated system to reply to queries. Site sample collection, processing, identifying the&#xD;
      causative organism, and antibiotic susceptibility testing will be validated and adapted if&#xD;
      required where possible. Where site infrastructure and regulations allow, the possibility of&#xD;
      automated data collection of included participants will be explored to ensure sustainability&#xD;
      of the future platform. Furthermore, collected data will be used to inform future diagnostic,&#xD;
      preventive and therapeutic trials. E.g. they may support assumptions in sample size&#xD;
      calculations and expected number of enrolled participants, they may help in prioritizing&#xD;
      interventions, or they may be used in simulations of adaptive trials to optimize decision&#xD;
      rules.&#xD;
