    <textblock>
      This goal of this randomized control trial is to test whether a web application that provides&#xD;
      sexual and gender minority youth ages 13-19 (N=200) with tools for affirming their identities&#xD;
      and coping with minority stress can affect key psychosocial outcomes, such as coping&#xD;
      self-efficacy and symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
