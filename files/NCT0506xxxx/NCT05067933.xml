      Part 1: An open label, dose and age escalation phase to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of VXA-CoV2-1.1-S with a repeat-dose vaccination schedule in healthy adults&#xD;
      aged 18 - 75 years old that are either vaccine naive or have received prior vaccination with&#xD;
      an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: This phase will assess the efficacy of prophylactic VXA-CoV2-1.1-S against confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 occurring from 7 days after second dose with a repeat-dose vaccination schedule in&#xD;
      healthy adults compared to placebo. Safety and immunogenicity of VXA-CoV2-1.1-S will also be&#xD;
      evaluated in this phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1: This is an open-label, dose-ranging phase of the study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of an orally administered adenoviral-vector based vaccine (VXA-COV2-1.1-S)&#xD;
      expressing a SARS-CoV-2 antigen and dsRNA adjuvant. Post screening activities, healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers, either naïve or prior vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, aged 18 - 55 yrs&#xD;
      old, and then 56 - 75 yrs old, will be enrolled into the study in 8 subgroups. Participants&#xD;
      will receive either a low or a high dose of an oral tableted vaccine at Days 1 and Day 29.&#xD;
      The total study period will last ~ 2 months during the active phase, with a total 12 month&#xD;
      safety follow-up period post last vaccination. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity&#xD;
      assessments will be performed at set times during the study active and follow-up periods.&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the duration of the study&#xD;
      follow-up period. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will provide safety&#xD;
      oversight through the duration of the trial. Safety and immunogenicity data will inform on&#xD;
      the dose selection for Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: This will be a placebo-controlled phase with the vaccine dose level selected from&#xD;
      Part 1. Subjects will receive two doses of vaccine or placebo at Days 1 and 29. Subjects will&#xD;
      be followed as in Part 1 for safety and immunogenicity. They will also be followed for 6&#xD;
      months for efficacy.&#xD;
