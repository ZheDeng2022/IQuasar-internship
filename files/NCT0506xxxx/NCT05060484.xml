      A phase II random, double blind, positive and placebo control trail was conducted in 1200&#xD;
      healthy women in the arm A: 18-26 years old and 600 healthy women in the Arm B: 27-45 years&#xD;
      old. The 1800 subjects to be inoculated with middle, and high dose vaccine. Middle dose&#xD;
      SCT1000: hight dose SCT1000: placebo: positive control =1:1:1:1.Two arms can be recruited at&#xD;
      the same time. If the DSMB assessment shows that the adverse events of a certain dose group&#xD;
      meet the criteria of suspension / termination, the dose group will be suspended / terminated.&#xD;
