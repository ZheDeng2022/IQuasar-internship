    <textblock>
      To date, there is no objective data to help in the choice of the type of catheter to offer to&#xD;
      the patient according to his or her needs. Although it is now known that the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients practicing intermittent self catheterisation is dependent on multiple factors,&#xD;
      there is little data on the factors that facilitate or hinder adherence to intermittent self&#xD;
      catheterisation during the first six months after initiation of intermittent self&#xD;
      catheterisation. The prospective multicenter exploratory observational study that the sponsor&#xD;
      wishes to conduct aims to determine what criteria preside over patient choice of SpeedyCath&#xD;
      (SC) leads. This information would allow us to set up a personalized advice with each patient&#xD;
      in the future, with the aim of proposing the SC catheter best adapted to his needs. The study&#xD;
      population will consist of adults with neurogenic or non-neurogenic urinary disorders that&#xD;
      warrant the use of intermittent self catheterisation, with intermittent self catheterisation&#xD;
      education occurring at the time of inclusion. Patients should be autonomous in the practice&#xD;
      of intermittent self catheterisation, and the minimum expected duration of follow-up should&#xD;
      be greater than or equal to 6 months. Only patients who choose to use SpeediCath leads will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary self-catheterization consists of emptying the bladder oneself by inserting a catheter&#xD;
      into the urethra. It is the reference method in case of dysfunctions of the bladder emptying&#xD;
      phase, in particular in case of complete urinary retention or complete or incomplete bladder&#xD;
      emptying with sub bladder obstruction. Neurological pathologies such as spinal cord injury,&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, multisystematic atrophy, peripheral neuropathies, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      and stroke, may be the cause of bladder disturbances. These disturbances may also be caused&#xD;
      by pelvic denervations as a result of enlarged pelvic surgeries or radiotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of gynecological, urological or digestive cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the implementation of intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) is to reduce&#xD;
      the morbidity related to bladder and bowel dysfunction and to improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients by making them more autonomous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It involves a rigorous learning phase for the patient and a phase of acceptance of this new&#xD;
      mictional mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When ISC is indicated, training is provided to the patient to enable him/her to manage daily&#xD;
      catheterization. The objectives of this training are to understand, perform, monitor and&#xD;
      adapt self-care. This training, mainly provided by the nursing staff and/or a specialist&#xD;
      physician, is usually provided during a hospitalization. After returning home, the patient&#xD;
      continues to be monitored by the specialist physician and the nursing team to evaluate the&#xD;
      mastery of the technique (possibly reviewing the gesture and ensuring the adequacy of the&#xD;
      catheter), the patient's adaptation to the practice of ISC, his compliance with the&#xD;
      associated rules (frequency and regularity of catheterization, volume of urine) and any&#xD;
      complications. A first visit is usually made between 3 and 12 weeks, then a second one after&#xD;
      6 months of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this therapeutic patient education (TPE), even when carried out by trained&#xD;
      personnel, is not necessarily sufficient for immediate acceptance and adherence to&#xD;
      self-catheterization in the medium to long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that the patient is involved in his or her choice of equipment, since the&#xD;
      decision to self-catheterize is usually made by the physician, and that the benefits of&#xD;
      self-catheterization outweigh the constraints. The patient must be guided and involved in the&#xD;
      choice of catheter during this learning phase, which will ensure better compliance and future&#xD;
      adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of this study is therefore to better understand the real motivations of the&#xD;
      patient in the choice of the catheter. This will undoubtedly make it possible to improve&#xD;
      either the equipment itself or certain FTE sequences in the future by insisting on the&#xD;
      problematic or questioning points in terms of the choice of catheter proposed to the patient&#xD;
      by the caregiver. The determinants of the patient's choice are all the more important as&#xD;
      there are a very large number of catheters on the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coloplast offers the SpeediCath® (SC) range of ready-to-use self-lubricating hydrophilic&#xD;
      catheters. This range is designed to cover the different needs of patients, providing them&#xD;
      with probes of different length, flexibility, shape and ergonomics. There are 3 types of&#xD;
      catheters adapted to women (SC Standard®, SC Compact® and SC Compact Set, SC Compact Eve®),&#xD;
      and 3 types of catheters adapted to men (SC Standard®, SC Compact® and SC Compact Set, SC&#xD;
      Flex®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the technical specificities, a systematic review of the literature concluded that&#xD;
      hydrophilic catheters (with a lubricant attached to the catheter) provide a benefit in terms&#xD;
      of safety and quality of life, particularly in patients with spinal cord injuries. SC®&#xD;
      catheters significantly reduce trauma to the urinary tract by reducing friction. Another&#xD;
      study also showed that SpeediCath catheters were significantly faster, more convenient, and&#xD;
      more discreet to use than a non-ready-to-use hydrophilic catheter (need to activate&#xD;
      lubricant). The superiority of SpeediCath Compact Male and Female catheters in terms of&#xD;
      quality of life compared to reference catheters was demonstrated in a randomized study using&#xD;
      the specific validated ISC-Q questionnaire and has been retained and valued by the CNEDiMTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no objective data to help in the choice of the type of catheter to propose&#xD;
      to the patient according to his needs. Although it is now known that the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients using ISC is dependent on multiple factors, there is little data on the factors that&#xD;
      facilitate or hinder adherence to ISC during the first six months after initiation of ISC.&#xD;
      The prospective multicenter exploratory observational study that the sponsor wishes to&#xD;
      conduct aims to determine the criteria that govern patient choice of SC leads. This&#xD;
      information would allow us to set up a personalized advice with each patient in the future,&#xD;
      with the aim of proposing the SC catheter best adapted to his needs. The study population&#xD;
      will consist of adults with neurogenic or non-neurogenic urinary disorders that warrant the&#xD;
      use of ISC, with ISC education occurring at the time of inclusion. Patients should be&#xD;
      autonomous in the practice of ISC, and the minimum expected duration of follow-up should be&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 6 months. Only patients who have chosen to use SpeediCath leads will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous criteria will be collected to allow a detailed analysis of the modalities of choice&#xD;
      of the type of SC probe. This collection involves the use of self-questionnaires for the&#xD;
      patients. These questionnaires will be collected during the usual follow-up of the patient,&#xD;
      including a visit at the time of the ASI education, a follow-up visit around 3 to 12 weeks&#xD;
      (depending on the practices of the investigating center) and a second follow-up visit around&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance of ISC will be measured by the Intermittent Catheterization Acceptance Test&#xD;
      (I-CAT). This is a patient questionnaire developed by the Groupe d'Études de Neuro-Urologie&#xD;
      de Langue Française (GENULF) and validated in French in 2016 during a prospective multicenter&#xD;
      study of 201 neurological and non-neurological patients. The I-CAT allows for a better&#xD;
      assessment and understanding of the psychological barriers encountered by patients in&#xD;
      relation to ISC. The questionnaire consists of 14 questions, with a minimum score of 0 for&#xD;
      perfect acceptance and a maximum score of 56 characterizing the least possible acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difficulties encountered by patients during ASI will be measured by the &quot;Intermittent&#xD;
      Catheterization Difficulty Questionnaire&quot; IC-Di-Q. This is a patient questionnaire validated&#xD;
      in French, and its purpose is to evaluate the difficulties encountered during the performance&#xD;
      of ISA. In 13 questions, it explores numerous factors such as pain, blockage, bleeding,&#xD;
      spasticity, and urethral sphincter spasm, in terms of frequency of occurrence and intensity.&#xD;
      The purpose of this questionnaire is to identify the difficulties encountered by patients,&#xD;
      and to monitor their evolution after the implementation of alternatives or solutions&#xD;
      (including the adaptation of the type of catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient adherence to ISC will be measured by the Intermittent Catheterization Adherence Scale&#xD;
      (I-CAS). This is a patient questionnaire validated in French with 8 questions, 7 of which&#xD;
      have a binary answer (yes/no), and one with 5 suggested answers. The score ranges from 0 for&#xD;
      strong adherence to ISC to 8 for very weak adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study-specific self-questionnaire was also created with the support of the Scientific&#xD;
      Advisory Board to determine the reasons for the patient's choice of catheter. This&#xD;
      questionnaire includes criteria independent of the patient (e.g. advice from the nurse), and&#xD;
      criteria specific to the patient (e.g. ease of use, discretion).&#xD;
