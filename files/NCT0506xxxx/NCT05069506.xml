  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated any potential associations between two preloads offered as snacks and&#xD;
      postprandial glycemic response, subjective appetite and energy intake in healthy, normal&#xD;
      weight adults&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed at 1. firstly determine the glycemic index (GI) of a) goat milk yogurt b)&#xD;
      goat milk yogurt with currants, c) currants and d) sultanina raisins, all containing 25 gr&#xD;
      available carbohydrates and 2. test the hypothesis that a goat milk yogurt consumed as a&#xD;
      snack before a meal, compared to milk with lactic acid would: a) have greater short-term&#xD;
      effect on satiety measured by subsequent ad libitum meal intake, b) induce greater satiety as&#xD;
      assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS) and c) reduce postprandial glycemic response.&#xD;

    <description>Forty-five healthy subjects (male: 12, female: 33) were offered a standardized breakfast and 2h after consumed one of the two preloads (goat milk yogurt and milk with lactic acid) served as snack in random order. Three hours after, subjects were given ad libitum access to a meal (lunch and dessert). Foods were weighed at the time of serving and any leftovers were weighed again after meal to determine the amount of food consumed. Fingertip capillary blood glucose samples were collected before and after foods. Subjective appetite ratings were collected using 100mm visual analogue scales (VAS).</description>
