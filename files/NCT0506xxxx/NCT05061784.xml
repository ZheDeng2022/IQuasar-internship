      A case series was built after review of available literature by searching four databases&#xD;
      (PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library) for observational studies or case reports on&#xD;
      routine prophylactic TCT for MEN-1 and the development of thymic carcinoids.&#xD;

      Introduction and Importance Malignant thymic carcinoids are uncommon but important entities&#xD;
      among patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). Current treatment guidelines&#xD;
      advise the performance of a routine transcervical thymectomy (TCT) during parathyroidectomy,&#xD;
      to prevent its development, although data on the yield of this prophylactic TCT is scarce. We&#xD;
      aimed to revisit available literature to investigate and summarize the efficacy of routine&#xD;
      TCT during neck exploration for parathyroidectomy, for the prevention of thymic carcinoid&#xD;
      tumours among MEN-1 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A case series was built after review of available literature by searching four&#xD;
      databases (PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library) for observational studies or case&#xD;
      reports on routine prophylactic TCT for MEN-1 and the development of thymic carcinoids.&#xD;
