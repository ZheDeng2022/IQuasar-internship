    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to evaluate the safety and immune response to a booster dose of&#xD;
      Ad26.ZEBOV Ebola vaccine in HIV+ adults from Kenya and Uganda. Only participants who have&#xD;
      received the 2-dose Ebola vaccine regimen &quot;Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo &quot; in the VAC52150EBL2002&#xD;
      vaccine trial about 4 years ago are eligible to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50 healthy HIV+ adults, aged 18 - 50 years at the time of the parent trial,&#xD;
      will be invited. Participants will first be asked to provide consent to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Upon receiving the booster vaccination, participants will be followed up for&#xD;
      approximately 28 days (+/- 3 days) to collect information on side effects and provide blood&#xD;
      samples for antibody measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to provide descriptive information regarding vaccine safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity. There is no formal treatment comparisons and no formal testing of statistical&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;

      TITLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label, Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an Ad26.ZEBOV&#xD;
      booster dose in Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive (HIV+) adults previously vaccinated&#xD;
      with the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous Phase 2 and 3 trials, HIV+ adult participants were vaccinated with a 2-dose Ebola&#xD;
      vaccine regimen of adenovirus serotype 26 expressing the Ebola virus Mayinga glycoprotein&#xD;
      (Ad26.ZEBOV) followed by Modified Vaccinia Ankara Bavarian Nordic vector expressing multiple&#xD;
      filovirus proteins (MVA-BN-Filo). This Ebola vaccine regimen elicited humoral immune&#xD;
      responses in HIV+ adults comparable to those in HIV-negative adults 21-days after dose 2.&#xD;
      However, the durability of vaccine-induced humoral responses was not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a Ad26.ZEBOV booster dose in HIV+ adults&#xD;
           previously vaccinated with the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess humoral responses induced by the booster dose against EBOV glycoprotein (GP),&#xD;
           as measured by Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group (FANG) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent&#xD;
           Assay (ELISA) at 7 and 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label study to evaluate the immune response to a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV&#xD;
      administered to HIV+ participants who previously received the 2-dose Ebola vaccine regimen&#xD;
      with Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo 28 days or 56 days later in the VAC52150EBL2002&#xD;
      vaccine trial. The Ad26.ZEBOV will be administered as a booster dose in this population&#xD;
      approximately 4 years from the time participants received MVA-BN-Filo. Approximately 50 HIV+&#xD;
      adult participants, aged 18 - 50 years at randomisation in the parent trial, VAC52150EBL2002,&#xD;
      from Kenya and Uganda will be invited to participate in this trial. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      consent to participate in this study. Upon receiving the booster vaccination, participants&#xD;
      will be followed up for immunogenicity and safety for approximately 28 days (+/- 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be healthy (based on physical examination, medical history, and clinical&#xD;
      judgment) HIV+ adults who participated in the VAC52150EBL2002 trial. Participants will have&#xD;
      to be virologically suppressed and immunologically controlled on highly active antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (HAART) regimen (HIV viral load &lt; 50 copies/millilitres (mL) and CD4+ T cell count&#xD;
      &gt;/= 350 cells/microlitres (uL) within 28 days of study vaccination). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at VAC52150EBL2002 sites in Kenya and Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Travel to an area with active Ebola outbreak during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential should use adequate birth&#xD;
           control measures from at least 14 days before and 28 days after vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No disallowed concomitant therapies are being used&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad26.ZEBOV is a replication-incompetent monovalent vaccine against Ebola. It consists of an&#xD;
      adenovirus serotype 26 vector expressing the full-length Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly known as&#xD;
      Zaire ebolavirus) Mayinga GP. A single dose of Ad26.ZEBOV at a dose of 5x10^10 viral&#xD;
      particles (vp) will be administered intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solicited local (i.e. injection site) and systemic adverse events (AEs) will be assessed on&#xD;
      the day of vaccination and using a diary for a period of seven days following the booster&#xD;
      vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be tracked for 28 days following booster&#xD;
      vaccination, while serious adverse events will be tracked for the duration of the study. The&#xD;
      Principal Investigators, together with the sponsor's medical safety officer, will be&#xD;
      responsible for the safety monitoring of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solicited local AEs to be collected in this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection Site Tenderness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection Site Erythema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection Site Swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Itching&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solicited systemic AEs to be collected in this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fatigue/malaise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nausea/vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  muscle pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  joint pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOGENICITY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for assessments of immune responses at Day 1 (prior to vaccination), Day&#xD;
      8 and Day 22. The site staff will perform sample collection and processing according to&#xD;
      current versions of approved standard operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future scientific research may be conducted to further investigate Ebola vaccine- and&#xD;
      disease-related questions and to study other infections of public health importance in Kenya&#xD;
      and Uganda, and neighboring countries. This may include the development of new, or the&#xD;
      improvement of existing, techniques to characterise EBOV-directed immune responses or&#xD;
      diagnostic tests. No additional samples will be taken for these analyses, however, residual&#xD;
      samples from the study tests may be retained for these purposes and analysed after the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDEPENDENT DATA AND MONITORING COMMITTEE (IDMC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine has already been shown in HIV+ adults in previous&#xD;
      studies. Therefore, the role of the IDMC will be designated to an Independent Medical&#xD;
      Reviewer (IMR) to provide medical oversight and detect trends in safety signals. The IMR will&#xD;
      periodically review the safety data collected and call for ad hoc safety meetings should any&#xD;
      of the pre-specified pausing rules are met or in any situation that could affect participant&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAUSING RULES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death of a participant, considered related to study vaccine or if the causal&#xD;
           relationship to the study vaccine cannot be excluded; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One or more participants experience an serious adverse event (SAE; solicited or&#xD;
           unsolicited) that is determined to be related to study vaccine; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. One or more participants experience anaphylaxis or generalised urticaria within 24 hours&#xD;
           of vaccination, clearly not attributable to other causes than the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) AND MONITORING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic QA and monitoring of study activities during the clinical study will serve to&#xD;
      assure the data reliability and validity, as well as ensure the close adherence to the&#xD;
      protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and contribute to protecting the participant's safety.&#xD;
      Automatic data queries will be generated by the Sponsor Data Manager. These queries will be&#xD;
      posted in the electronic Data Capture system or sent to the site Investigators via email, if&#xD;
      necessary. The QA Committee and external monitors will periodically review these queries and&#xD;
      follow up with the sites to ensure resolution. External monitors will also conduct on-site&#xD;
      monitoring visits to perform 100% source document verification.&#xD;
