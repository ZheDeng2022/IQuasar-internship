      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially conceived of as a method to address healthcare needs of underserved rural&#xD;
      populations, Mobile Integrated Healthcare and Community Paramedicine (MIH/CP) is a new model&#xD;
      of inter-professional, community-based outpatient healthcare delivery that primarily utilizes&#xD;
      the resources and training of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to fill gaps in local&#xD;
      healthcare infrastructure, expanding existing scope of practice in most cases while not&#xD;
      detracting from acute transport capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although programs have been in existence since the early 1990s, there are few objective&#xD;
      studies of the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of MIH/CP programs, many of which are&#xD;
      limited-scope pilot projects. The limited data already published on these measures by&#xD;
      established programs shows substantial Medicare charge-avoidances in patients enrolled in&#xD;
      CHF-readmission prevention and EMS frequent user programs, and a significant reduction in&#xD;
      Emergency Department visits overall, especially in austere environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, MIH/CP is an attempt at formalization of long-standing practices to collaborate&#xD;
      with and supplement other healthcare system components such as primary care and home health&#xD;
      services. Standardized, objective data collection and publication of results will be needed&#xD;
      to support continuation and financial support of this emerging concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the existing resources of the MD-, RN- and Paramedic-staffed Lifespan Pediatric and&#xD;
      Adult Critical Care Transport (LifePACT) service, investigators aim to study whether&#xD;
      implementation of an MIH/CP pilot program tailored to the needs of an urban, underserved&#xD;
      population in Providence, Rhode Island, will reduce the rate of 30-day hospital readmissions&#xD;
      for patients after discharges for community-acquired pneumonia, acute MI, and COPD. In&#xD;
      addition, investigators will study whether such a program is considered to be safe (in terms&#xD;
      of not increasing the number of adverse events post-discharge for patients or compromising&#xD;
      the efficacy of the LifePACT transport role) and considered satisfactory by patients (rated&#xD;
      comparably to visits by other outpatient health care services such as VNA services).&#xD;

    <description>Initial Home Visit: MIH/CP provider team will visit the patient's home at the scheduled time following a specific General Followup Protocol involving 1. Assessment of patient understanding of recent illness and medical therapy including reinforcement of medical adherence, 2. Any other disease-specific concerns, 3. Performance of a home safety evaluation, 4. If patients have concerns relating to their ability to manage their disease process at home, 5. MIH/CP providers and an on-call social worker will provide assistance in the form of on-site, telephone, and electronic referrals or provision of appointments with appropriate services.&#xD;
Subsequent visits: The MIH/CP team will decide in conjunction with Medical Control and the PMD if further followup is needed, and the most appropriate followup interval., At 30 days from initial hospital discharge, the patient will be discharged from the MIH/CP program in conjunction with the PMD.</description>
