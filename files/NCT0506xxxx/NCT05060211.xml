  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50 % of children and adults with cerebral palsy experience lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms (LUTS). This can negatively influence quality of life of the child and the total&#xD;
      social environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research demonstrated that the brain lesion, characteristic for cerebral palsy (CP),&#xD;
      is a prognostic factor for the functional abilities of a child with CP. Previous research&#xD;
      within our department demonstrated functional impairment as a risk factor for incontinence.&#xD;
      This demonstrates an indirect connection between the brain lesion and incontinence of a child&#xD;
      with CP. However, this connection isn't alway correct as some children with high&#xD;
      functionality also demonstrate incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As bladder control is also regulated by higher brain centers, the present study wants to&#xD;
      investigate a direct connection between the brain lesion of the child, visible by means of&#xD;
      MRI, and the incontinence status of the child. .&#xD;

      The current study is a cross-sectional observational study in which a correlation is&#xD;
      investigated between known anatomical MRI results and the continence status of a child with&#xD;
      CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although neuroimaging isn't seen as a requirement for the definition and diagnosis of CP2,&#xD;
      MRI imaging is often part of diagnostic evaluation. The Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in&#xD;
      Europe (SCPE) working group composed the MRI classification system or MRICS classifying&#xD;
      neuroimaging results in maldevelopments, predominant white matter injury, predominant grey&#xD;
      matter injury, miscellaneous and normal. These results will be correlated with results of the&#xD;
      validated Vancouver symptoms score for dysfunctional elimination syndrome.&#xD;
