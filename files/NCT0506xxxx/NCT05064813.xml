  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the neural mechanisms that drive response to MBSR&#xD;
      compared to stress education in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and to&#xD;
      examine the degree to which sex differences in MBSR response are explained by sex differences&#xD;
      in these mechanisms. A total of 150 eligible participants with a primary diagnosis of GAD&#xD;
      will be randomized to either an 8-week group MBSR or stress education program. The study will&#xD;
      include preliminary screening, experimental visits, including fMRI, group intervention&#xD;
      visits, and assessments at baseline, endpoint, and 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has demonstrated efficacy for Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder (GAD), yet there remains a major knowledge gap about its neural mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine functional activation of brain regions associated with the fear&#xD;
      extinction network (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus, and amygdala) as a&#xD;
      specific probe of the 'instinctual' type of emotion regulation as well as large-scale&#xD;
      functional connectivity as a marker of neural plasticity changes. Sex differences in&#xD;
      MBSR-induced neural changes and their relationship to sex differences in clinical GAD&#xD;
      response will be examined. Finally, a novel statistical approach will be used to explore&#xD;
      whether baseline neural measures can predict neural changes and clinical symptom reduction to&#xD;
      identify likely MBSR responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unique combination of a focus on GAD, an anxiety condition with established emotion&#xD;
      regulation difficulties implicating target neural circuits, previously demonstrated MBSR&#xD;
      efficacy, and sex differences with rigorous fMRI behavioral probes with novel analytic&#xD;
      approaches ought to provide major new insights about MBSR versus stress education mechanisms&#xD;
      and sex considerations, moving towards precision medicine that could guide future treatment&#xD;
      development research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants with Generalized Anxiety Disorder will be 2:1 randomized to group&#xD;
      intervention with MBSR or stress education classes. They will participate for 13-14 weeks&#xD;
      plus one 3 month follow up assessment (23-24 weeks from screening). Full participation&#xD;
      includes screening, baseline, endpoint and 3 month follow up assessments, two sets of&#xD;
      experimental days 12 weeks apart which include fMRI scans, and 8 weeks of the assigned group&#xD;
      intervention (either MBSR or stress education).&#xD;

    <description>The primary clinical outcome measure will be treatment response. This is measured by The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale is a single clinician-reported item that assesses how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to baseline and is rated as 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse,) 6 (much worse), or 7 (very much worse). The CGI-I scale is widely used and well validated, and is sensitive to changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms.</description>

    <description>MBSR is an 8-week group-based course developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn (1990) and colleagues at the University of Massachusetts' Center for Mindfulness. Weekly 2.5 hour long classes are given once a week, as well as one day-long weekend class. The classes instruct participants in the theory and practice of several forms of mindfulness meditation, breathing awareness, and mindfulness stretching exercises. Teaching of the theory of mindfulness and experiential practice are both utilized during weekly classes and at-home CD-guided practice sessions.</description>

    <description>Stress Education (SE) was designed to provide an active comparator condition that does not include overlapping active components of mindfulness meditation with MBSR. It will also be delivered over 8-weekly, in-person, 2.5 hour group sessions of the same size (n=4 to 6). In SE, participants receive extensive information about stress and health, but will not receive any MBSR or other mind-body training. Instead, stress relevant psycho-educational information will be taught.</description>

          -  Patients must be free of concurrent benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, and stimulant&#xD;
             medication for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of randomized treatment. Other&#xD;
