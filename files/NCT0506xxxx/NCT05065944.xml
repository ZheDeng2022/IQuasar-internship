  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of patients scheduled for hysterectomy or prostatectomy&#xD;
      surgeries who undergo a pre-anesthesia evaluation at Moffitt Cancer Center PreAnesthesia&#xD;
      Testing (PAT) clinic. Traditionally, patients who met certain criteria based on type of&#xD;
      surgery or comorbidities would undergo an in-person evaluation in our clinic. In order to&#xD;
      make our patient's care more convenient and accessible, investigators have introduced&#xD;
      telemedicine evaluation for a certain subset of patients meeting specific criteria.&#xD;
      Investigators aim with this randomized trial to investigate the hypothesis that telemedicine&#xD;
      pre-anesthesia evaluation is non-inferior to in-person evaluation from the standpoint of day&#xD;
      of surgery cancellation rate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide signed and dated informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presurgical patients at Moffitt Cancer Center scheduled to undergo any type of&#xD;
             hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy or prostatectomy surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possesses appropriate equipment (i.e., computer, tablet, smartphone) to undergo&#xD;
             telemedicine evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with documented or observable significant cognitive barriers, hearing, or&#xD;
             speech impairment. Examples include a patient who is not alert or oriented, who is&#xD;
             unable to sign his or her own surgical consent due to cognitive issues or who cannot&#xD;
             understand and repeat back to study coordinator reason for study. If these barriers&#xD;
             will not be an issue for a video phone call and can be reasonably accommodated, we&#xD;
             will do so. However, our telemedicine technology is still very basic, and these&#xD;
             patients may be more comfortable communicating with providers and expressing their&#xD;
             needs during an in-person visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery 3 days or less away from clinic visit. As in-person assessment is the gold&#xD;
             standard, we need to allow some time in case a patient cannot work the technology for&#xD;
             a telemedicine visit or an issue comes up where visit needs to be converted to&#xD;
             in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Out of state patients as there are currently medical licensing concerns with&#xD;
             conducting telemedicine on patients physically located out of state during the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Determined to be ineligible for surgery during evaluation&#xD;
