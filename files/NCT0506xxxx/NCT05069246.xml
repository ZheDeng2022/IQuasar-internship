  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted for 14 days with 37 systemically&#xD;
      healthy patients having chronic generalized gingivitis. The current study was designed to&#xD;
      investigate the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial efficacy of Nigella Sativa oil compared&#xD;
      with chlorohexidine; assessing clinical parameters and gingival interleukin 6 (IL6) and&#xD;
      interleukin 18 (IL18) levels and supra-gingival plaque analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 37 systemically healthy patients, aged between 20 to 40 years with chronic&#xD;
      generalised gingivitis were recruited based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, from the&#xD;
      Dental Clinic at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University. The sample size was based on&#xD;
      previously reported studies conducted to assess gingival crevicular interleukin levels using&#xD;
      mouthwashes. A study information sheet was provided to each patient and the methodology of&#xD;
      the clinical trial was explained. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant&#xD;
      before enrolling on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted Ethical clearance was obtained from&#xD;
      the Institutional Review Board at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (Registration&#xD;
      number: 20-0261).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were assigned computer-generated random numbers and were blindly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two groups; Group 1- Nigella Sativa (NS) or Group 2- Chlorohexidine (CHX) (n=20) according to&#xD;
      the sequence of the computer-generated random numbers by an investigator not directly&#xD;
      involved in the clinical examination and sample collection. The interventions were either N.&#xD;
      sativa oil (Al-Hussan Food Products Factory, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), which was&#xD;
      brought from the local market in Riyadh or Chlorohexidine (Middle East Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Industries Ltd, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). Group 1: Maintained adequate plaque control&#xD;
      levels using mechanical methods + N.sativa oil (5ml oil + 5ml water) pulling for 3 mins twice&#xD;
      daily in the morning and at night, and Group 2: maintained adequate plaque control levels&#xD;
      using mechanical methods + chlorohexidine rinse twice daily 10ml in the morning and at the&#xD;
      night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unified oral hygiene instructions and instructions for each intervention were provided to all&#xD;
      participants. A 24-hour contact number was provided to each participant, to report any&#xD;
      concerns, adverse reactions or for any further information. Participants were told that they&#xD;
      were free to drop out at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral prophylaxis was performed on the same day of recruitment to bring the plaque score to&#xD;
      almost zero, and the subjects in each group were given either N.sativa oil or chlorohexidine&#xD;
      according to the blind randomised allocation by a third person. On day zero (baseline) of the&#xD;
      trial after scaling, and on day 15 at the end of the trial; the following clinical parameters&#xD;
      were assessed; plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) and plaque samples, as well as&#xD;
      gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the study, two dental examiners were calibrated to measure PI and GI, to reduce&#xD;
      inter-examiner variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data were analyzed using Graphpad PRISM (San Deigo, USA). Non-parametric signed&#xD;
      Rank tests and parametric t-tests were used, as well as Fisher's exact test for contingency&#xD;
      analysis. P values were calculated and a p value below 0.05 was deemed as a significant&#xD;
      difference.&#xD;
