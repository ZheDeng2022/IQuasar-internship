             classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Positive CD79B mutation confirmed by the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previously received at least 1 line of adequate systemic anti-DLBCL therapy, defined&#xD;
             as an anti-CD20 antibody-based chemoimmunotherapy for at least 2 consecutive cycles,&#xD;
             unless patients had disease progression before Cycle 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease before study entry, defined as either&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Recurrent disease after having achieved disease remission (CR or partial response&#xD;
                  [PR]) at the completion of the latest treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Stable disease or PD at the completion of the latest treatment regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ineligible for high dose therapy/stem cell transplantation, which is defined as&#xD;
             meeting any of the following criteria:&#xD;

               1. Significant organ dysfunction (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% by&#xD;
