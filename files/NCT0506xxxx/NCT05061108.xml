  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black adults have a higher incidence of hypertension (HTN) and a greater risk of HTN-related&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with White adults. Even mild elevations in blood (BP)&#xD;
      above 115/75 mm Hg are associated with increased CVD risk. Accordingly, emphasis is being&#xD;
      placed on early interventions for high BP, particularly in those who have &quot;elevated BP&quot;&#xD;
      (systolic BP 120-129 and diastolic BP &lt; 80 mm Hg), for participants lifestyle modification is&#xD;
      recommended. Although lifestyle modifications are effective to lower BP, implementation is&#xD;
      suboptimal in Black communities, especially those participants residing in low-income urban&#xD;
      settings. Pervasive negative social determinants of health (SDoH), such as poor access to&#xD;
      healthcare, food insecurity, limited availability of healthy foods, lack of safe places to&#xD;
      engage in physical activity, and low health literacy are major drivers of inequities in HTN&#xD;
      and a critical barrier to implementation of recommended lifestyle modifications in Black&#xD;
      communities. To achieve health equity, effective strategies must address negative SDoH that&#xD;
      are root causes of racial disparities in health outcomes as clearly demonstrated by the&#xD;
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Predominantly Black cities like Detroit, Michigan,&#xD;
      where the mortality rate from heart disease is nearly twice the national average, have been&#xD;
      devastated by COVID-19. To address this, the investigators developed an innovative mobile&#xD;
      health unit (MHU) program that uses geospatial health and social vulnerability data to direct&#xD;
      deployment of testing and vaccination services to communities with highest needs. Since April&#xD;
      2020, the investigators conducted 500 events with 220 community partners where 40,000 people&#xD;
      have been tested or vaccinated for COVID in MHUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design in the proposed Linkage,&#xD;
      Empowerment, and Access to Prevent Hypertension (LEAP-HTN) study, the investigators will&#xD;
      implement a novel approach that links Black adult participants with elevated BP to&#xD;
      collaborative care delivered in deprived neighborhoods by community health workers (CHWs)&#xD;
      using a personalized, adaptable approach to lifestyle and life circumstance (PAL2)&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will leverage our MHU program, layering on top of existing&#xD;
      services to streamline access for screening, recruitment and all ongoing follow-up throughout&#xD;
      the study period. Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To compare the effect of PAL2 intervention versus usual care (MHU engagement without&#xD;
      PAL2) on BP reduction and prevention of stage-1 HTN among 500 Black adults with elevated BP.&#xD;
      Systolic BP (primary outcome) will be reduced more in those randomized to PAL2 intervention&#xD;
      versus usual care at 6 and 12 months. Diastolic BP levels and the incidence of stage-1 HTN at&#xD;
      12 months (secondary outcomes) will be lower in participants randomized to the PAL2&#xD;
      intervention versus usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To use the RE-AIM framework to assess the reach, adoption, sustainability and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of LEAP-HTN at 12 months and 24 months post-randomization. The rates of&#xD;
      adoption and sustainability of the PAL2 intervention will increase from baseline to 12 and 24&#xD;
      months, respectively. PAL2 intervention will be more cost-effective than usual care at 24&#xD;
      months and projected to be more cost-effective at 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Equity Impact: Targeted deployment of MHUs and PAL2 can mitigate several key adverse&#xD;
      SDoH. LEAP-HTN contributes to the RESTORE Network by testing a sustainable and scalable&#xD;
      approach to advance health equity and prevent HTN in Black adults participants. If&#xD;
      successful, the use of MHU can be easily implemented in similar urban Black communities&#xD;
      across the U.S.&#xD;
