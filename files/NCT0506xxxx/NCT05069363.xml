  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a common long-term condition that can affect any area throughout the body.&#xD;
      Individuals suffering with chronic pain often have associated fatigue, sleep and mood&#xD;
      disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for chronic pain include a variety of both medicine-based approaches and&#xD;
      non-medical approaches such as exercise and psychology treatments. Patients often take a&#xD;
      combination of medications such as antidepressants and strong medications like morphine -&#xD;
      which are not always effective, and often associated with several troublesome side effects.&#xD;
      Despite physical activity being a common and helpful treatment, evidence shows that patients&#xD;
      with chronic pain can find it difficult to engage for a variety of reasons. It would be&#xD;
      helpful to see if other non-medication based approaches will be an acceptable treatment to&#xD;
      those suffering with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy describes a safe, non-invasive low-energy light therapy that&#xD;
      has been successful in treating a variety of chronic pain conditions. Cells absorb light to&#xD;
      produce a series of reactions that culminate in pain relief, reduced inflammation, and tissue&#xD;
      repair. Most studies examining effects of PBM have consisted of a small hand-held probe&#xD;
      focused on specific painful areas. There are a cohort of chronic pain conditions that&#xD;
      encompass widespread throughout the back, neck and joints, such as fibromyalgia (FM).&#xD;
      Whole-body PBM therapy is able to treat a large area of the body in a short space of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to determine feasibility, with a view to guiding a&#xD;
      definitive Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), in terms of: feasibility of eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, recruitment rates, acceptability of trial device in the chronic pain population,&#xD;
      and acceptability of outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>All participants entering the trial will receive a course of whole-body PBM therapy&#xD;
The NovoTHOR Whole-Body PBM therapy device consists of a hinged, clamshell design with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged to emit near-infrared and visible red light therapy is delivered to the entire body at once.&#xD;
Participants will be expected to lie horizontal in the device with the lid as closed as they are comfortable with.&#xD;
18 sessions is the currently recommended and widely instituted and accepted practice with the NovoTHOR device.&#xD;
The LED equipment delivers red and near infrared light therapy to the participant&#xD;
Session 1 = 6 minutes&#xD;
Session 2 = 12 minutes&#xD;
Sessions 3-18 = 20 minutes&#xD;
Timescale: 3 treatments/week for 6 weeks&#xD;
The dosage of LED light (also known as 'fluence') will be equivalent to 25J/cm2. The device will supply a dual wavelength of red and near-infrared light with a 50:50 ratio; 660nm and 850nm respectively</description>
