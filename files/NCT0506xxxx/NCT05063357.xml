  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omburtamab is a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody, recognizing CD276 (also known as B7- H3).&#xD;
      Omburtamab is 131I-labeled at designated radio pharmacies and will be provided as a final&#xD;
      radiolabeled product to treatment site. The proposed intervention includes surgical placement&#xD;
      using standard stereotactic techniques of a small caliber cannula into the tumor in the pons&#xD;
      followed by positive pressure infusion (i.e. CED) of 131I-omburtamab. Iodine-131 conjugated&#xD;
      omburtamab (131I-omburtamab) administered via the intracerebroventricular route for the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic CNS neuroblastoma was shown to be tolerable and improve survival.&#xD;
      Furthermore, 124I-omburtamab administered by convection enhanced delivery (CED) was shown to&#xD;
      have a tolerable safety profile in an ongoing dose escalation trial (in doses up to 4mCi) in&#xD;
      patients with diffuse pontine gliomas that have not progressed following external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The aim of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      131I-omburtamab in patients with DIPG that have not progressed following external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IMP infusion volume for CED will be adjusted to 4, 6 or 8 mL dependent on the size of the&#xD;
      tumor as estimated by MRI. The maximum volume of 8 mL was tested, and safety cleared in the&#xD;
      11-011 trial. Assuming a ratio of approximately 1:3 between the infusion volume and the&#xD;
      distribution volume the infusion volume will be adjusted to ensure coverage of the tumor and&#xD;
      0.5 cm of the surrounding margin. The infusion volume will be 4 mL if tumor size (+0.5 cm&#xD;
      margin) &lt;10 cm3, 6 mL if tumor size (+0.5 cm margin) ≥10 and &lt;15 cm3, and 8 mL if tumor size&#xD;
      (+0.5 cm margin) ≥15 and ≤20 cm3. The maximum infusion rate will be 10 μL/min. Infusions will&#xD;
      be initiated using an escalating flow rate plan with 10-min intervals until the maximum rate&#xD;
      is achieved (0·5 μL/min, 1·0 μL/min, 2·0 μL/min, 5·0 μL/min, 7·5 μL/min and 10 μL/min).&#xD;

    <measure>Determining the safety of up to 36 participants with 131I-omburtamab administered directly into the tumor by CED in patients with DIPG assessed by CTCAE v.5.0</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years after last patient has received final dose of 131I-omburtamab administration</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 36 patients may be enrolled in the dose escalation phase in planned cohorts of 3 patients with a maximum of 3 cohorts at a dose level.All patients may receive up to three cycles of 131I-omburtamab. Patients will be followed until the last patient has had the last follow-up visit at 2 years after the 131I-omburtamab administration. End of trial is defined as last patient's last visit in the two-year follow-up period, or death whichever comes first. All Non-serious AEs should be reported from the time of CED placement surgery administration until 30 days after the IMP administration. All SAEs should be captured from signing the ICF until 30 days after IMP administration. Starting at day 31 after dosing of 131I-omburtamab only SAE's or ≥ grade 3 non-serious AEs considered at least possibly related to 131I-omburtamab or new onset of cancers regardless of causality should be reported.</description>
