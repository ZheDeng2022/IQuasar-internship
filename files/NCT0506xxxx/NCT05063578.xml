  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The arteriovenous fistula creation (AVF creation) surgery is essential among patients with&#xD;
      end stage renal disease who require hemodialysis. The fistula usually locates at forearm, and&#xD;
      is created by connecting artery and vein through surgery. Patients undergone hemodialysis&#xD;
      through the fistula six weeks later if fistula becoming mature, which means patent vessel&#xD;
      diameter and enough flow for hemodialysis. The primary failure rate of arteriovenous fistula&#xD;
      creation is about 20% to 40% according to previous research data. Thrombosis is the most&#xD;
      common cause of fistula failure, which require surgical intervention after arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique influences surgical outcome of arteriovenous fistula. General&#xD;
      anesthesia, regional anesthesia, and local anesthesia are both wide-used methods. Regional&#xD;
      anesthesia with nerve block remains the most popular method for arteriovenous fistula&#xD;
      creation. The vessel dilation effect of regional anesthesia helps not only dilatation of&#xD;
      artery and vein, but also the fistula itself, and promotes the successful functional&#xD;
      dialysis. Various type of nerve block are used as anesthetic method for AVF creation surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People requiring hemodialysis usually have multiple underlying disease involving other major&#xD;
      organ such as heart, lung, liver, and the endocrine system. They are more vulnerable to&#xD;
      systemic intravenous anesthetic medication. The metabolic rate and pharmacodynamics of local&#xD;
      anesthetic may also alter due to multiple systemic disease when compared with healthy adults.&#xD;
      The optimal concentration of lidocaine for AVF creation when using axillary block has not yet&#xD;
      been studied. This research is conducted for dosing response of different concentration of&#xD;
      lidocaine when using axillary block for AVF creation surgery. We aim to investigate the&#xD;
      optimal low effective concentration, the MEC90, which defined as 90% of patients can tolerate&#xD;
      the operation at this concentration.&#xD;
