  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised, open, parallel controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy of a digital&#xD;
      brief behavioural therapy for insomnia (dBBTi) against online sleep health education on&#xD;
      insomnia symptom severity in older adults aged 60 years and over. The trial will be totally&#xD;
      online with participants recruited from the community across Australia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a highly prevalent sleep disorder affecting up to 10% of the adult population and&#xD;
      reports of over 40% in the older population. Current insomnia treatments focus heavily on&#xD;
      symptom management with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi), in both digital&#xD;
      and face-to-face form as the recommended first-line treatment. Despite the strong evidence&#xD;
      for digital CBTi, there are a lack of data related to older people and whether digital brief&#xD;
      behavioural therapy is efficacious in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a fully online study comparing 6-weeks of digital brief&#xD;
      behavioural therapy for insomnia (dBBTi) against online sleep health education. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited, screened and determined eligibility and consent will be conducted online.&#xD;
      Thereafter, participants will be randomly allocated to either dBBTi delivered via a mobile&#xD;
      application called SleepFix or wait-listed control. The SleepFix app delivers sleep&#xD;
      restriction therapy using a 4 stage approach to improve sleep efficiency. The control will&#xD;
      consist of 3 online sleep health education modules provided bi-weekly with information about&#xD;
      sleep and sleep hygiene without any specific insomnia therapy. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      using social media and directed to a website to determine eligibility and then provided&#xD;
      access to either the dBBTi (SleepFix) or the control with a link to the first online module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, all participants will complete self-reported measures of insomnia, sleep,&#xD;
      fatigue, sleepiness , anxiety, depression, quality of life, cognition and digital health&#xD;
      literacy. These will be repeated at follow-up at weeks 8, 16 and 26.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be provided with a digital brief behavioural therapy (SleepFix app) which provides personalised sleep retraining therapy. Participants will also be provided a sleep-tracking wearable device (Fitbit) that synchronises the going to bed and getting out of bed times with the SleepFix app. Participants will complete a daily sleep diary and can modify the sleep-tracking wearable device sleep data. The program will provide an individualised sleep window of when to go and when to get out of bed. There are five stages focusing on bed timings, sleep efficiency and a maintenance phase for consolidating the new sleep pattern. The program provides information related to sleep hygiene and stimulus control. This will be available for participants for 6 weeks. An active wait-listed control of sleep health education will consist of 3 modules delivered biweekly of generalised sleep health information that could be found on the internet.</intervention_model_description>

Note: the study project coordinator will not be blinded as they will be managing the study such as sending sleep-tracking wearable devices to the intervention arm and communicating with participants. All investigators and data analysts will be blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a 7-item questionnaire used to examine overall insomnia severity. It consists of a five-point Likert type scale for each item (ranging from &quot;no problem&quot; = 0 to &quot;severe problem&quot; = 4) regarding symptoms over the past 2 weeks.

    <description>Participants randomised to the digital brief behavioural therapy for insomnia (SleepFix app) will be provided an unique access code to download the app. The intervention uses sleep retraining therapy to reduce excess time spent in bed and retrain sleep by matching time in bed (minimum of five and a half hours) to total sleep time. All participants in the intervention arm will also be provided a sleep-tracking wearable device (Fitbit) which will synchronised bed times (going to bed and rising) and are synchronised with the SleepFix app. Participants wil complete a daily sleep diary, rate sleep quality and mood. The intervention is provided for 6 weeks.</description>
