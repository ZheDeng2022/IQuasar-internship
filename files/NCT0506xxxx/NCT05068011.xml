    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the effectiveness of differential target multiplexed spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      for treatment of chronic back and leg pain. Additionally, a subgroup analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate potential differences between paddle/surgical leads versus percutaneous&#xD;
      leads.&#xD;
