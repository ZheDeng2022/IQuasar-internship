  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the quantitative and qualitative optical outcomes between single-step&#xD;
      transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) and off-flap epipolis laser in situ&#xD;
      keratomileusis (Epi-LASIK) in moderate to high myopia.we included patients with moderate to&#xD;
      high myopia who were randomized to have TransPRK in one eye and Epi-LASIK in the other eye.&#xD;
      All patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, including uncorrected&#xD;
      (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuities (CDVA), manifest refraction, intraocular&#xD;
      pressure, anterior and posterior segment examination, corneal topography measured by&#xD;
      Scheimpflug scanning-slit topographer (Pentacam, Oculus Optikgerate GmbH), contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity (CS) under photopic and mesopic conditions (CSV-1000E, Vector Vision Inc.,&#xD;
      Greenville, OH, USA) with correction by spectacles, ocular wavefront aberrometry (OPD-Scan&#xD;
      II, Nidek Co. Ltd). At each follow-up, CS and aberration measures were repeated 3 times and&#xD;
      the average value was analyzed. Optical parameters were repeated 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 22.0, SPSS, Chicago,&#xD;
      Inc.). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the normal distribution of variables.&#xD;
      Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used based on the normality of data. A P value&#xD;
      less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>contrast sensitivity and contrast sensitivity under glare condition measurements were performed by the CSV-1000E which could test four spatial frequencies: 3,6,12 and 18 cycles/degree (cpd) at 2.5m. The contrast sensitivity was measured under photopic (596.7cd/㎡) and scotopic (0.01cd/㎡) conditions and the contrast sensitivity under glare condition was taken under scotopic condition with glare</description>
