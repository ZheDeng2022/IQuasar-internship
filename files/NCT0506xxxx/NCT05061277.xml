             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be of Chinese ethnicity (individuals currently residing in mainland&#xD;
             China who were born in China and have both parents of Chinese descent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 19.0 to 27.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg and ≤ 120&#xD;
             kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, skin inflammation at infusion&#xD;
             site, acne, rash, scarring, tattoos, erythema, sunburn, deep tanning, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;

             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. Pulse rate &gt; 100 beats/minute. Oral&#xD;
             temperature (or ear temperature) &gt; 37.5 ℃.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline 12 lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may&#xD;
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline corrected&#xD;
             QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate age&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second&#xD;
             or third degree AV block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             Screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) level ≥ 1.5&#xD;
                  × upper limit of normal (ULN);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin level ≥1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study&#xD;
                  provided the direct bilirubin level is≤ ULN.&#xD;
