      In this research study, is combining a new treatment acalabrutinib with a standard treatment,&#xD;
      rituximab or other CD20 antibody, to determine whether this combination is safe and effective&#xD;
      for participants with Immunoglobulin (Ig) M monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined&#xD;
      significance ( IgM MGUS) or Waldenström macroglobulinemia WM related neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are/is:&#xD;

      This research study involves an experimental drug combination of a targeted therapy and a&#xD;
      CD20 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are/is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab or similar CD20 antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment for up to 4 years and will be followed for 2 years after completion of&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 33 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved acalabrutinib for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved rituximab or similar CD20&#xD;
      antibody for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib is a targeted therapy that blocks a type of protein called Bruton Tyrosine&#xD;
           Kinase (BTK) that helps cells live and grow. By blocking BTK, acalabrutinib may kill&#xD;
           abnormal cells or stop them from growing. It has been FDA approved for mantle cell&#xD;
           lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab, or biosimilar, is a type of therapy called an antibody that attacks CD20, a&#xD;
           protein found on B-cells. Rituximab is approved by the FDA for treating non-Hodgkin&#xD;
           lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab is often used to treat WM and IgM MGUS neuropathies.&#xD;
           Biosimilars are FDA approved drugs that have been determined to be interchangeable with&#xD;
           the original drug.&#xD;
