  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DREAM is a phase II B efficacy monocentric, prospective, randomized, controlled double&#xD;
      blinded trial, comparing intra-discal autologous adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (BM-MSC) therapy and sham treated controls in subjects with chronic (&gt; 6 months) Low Back&#xD;
      Pain (LBP) due to lumbar multilevel (max. 3 levels) intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD)&#xD;
      unresponsive to conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the recruitment period has been estimated to be 12 months. The efficacy of&#xD;
      intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC in reducing chronic LBP due to multilevel lumbar&#xD;
      IDD will be evaluated after 24 months in terms of pain relief (VAS), functionality (ODI) and&#xD;
      quality of life (SF36).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the global leading cause of disability, and furthermore rates sixth in&#xD;
      terms of overall disease burden, in both developed and developing countries. LPB is a&#xD;
      condition of all ages, from children to elderly, affecting 60-70 percent of the global&#xD;
      population during life, and ~700 million people each year. LBP prevalence increases with age,&#xD;
      and with populations ageing worldwide, the societal and economic burden associated with LBP&#xD;
      will increase substantially over coming years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current LBP therapies are aimed at pain reduction, and do not provide restorative treatment.&#xD;
      Such conservative strategies (e.g. painkillers and musculoskeletal rearrangement by manual&#xD;
      and physiotherapy) rarely address the actual cause of LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a healthy spine, intervertebral discs (IVDs) separate the vertebrae to provide complex&#xD;
      spinal flexibility while supporting large spinal loads. Intervertebral disc degeneration&#xD;
      (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent&#xD;
      of LBP cases. A key characteristic of IVD degeneration is loss of matrix integrity, thereby&#xD;
      causing biomechanical functional failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, no therapy can restore IVD function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD.&#xD;
      New treatment strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Stem cell research&#xD;
      offers exciting possibilities, and advanced cell-based therapies are considered highly&#xD;
      promising strategies in treating IVD degeneration and LBP. Encouraging results suggest that&#xD;
      cell-based, regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for this&#xD;
      common and debilitating disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of DREAM is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of a single&#xD;
      injection of 15 million of cells/ml of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to&#xD;
      3 discs) versus sham procedure. The potential of BM-MSC to lead to a disease-modifying&#xD;
      therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be&#xD;
      assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) after 6 months, 1 and 2 years.&#xD;

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The randomization will be centralized and stratified on the investigation center.

Blinding or masking will be carried out at all stages of packaging and conditioning for shipping following the treatment allocation. Injections used for all groups will be clear and indistinguishable from each other.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Change</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pain will be evaluated on Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) between baseline and month 24. VAS scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional disability index evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability changes will be assessed on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) at month 24 compared with baseline. ODI scale ranges from 0 to 50 and allows evaluation of disability (0 - 20 percent: minimal disability; 20 - 40 percent: moderate disability; 40 - 60 percent: severe disability; 60 - 80 percent: crippled; 80 - 100 percent: bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disability evolution includes Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) scores. SF-36 scores consist of eight 0-100 scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health) where a lower score corresponds to more disability and a higher score corresponds to less disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life evolution includes global assessment by the patient and the physician.&#xD;
The global assessment by the patient and the physician involves evaluation of: - Overall pain intensity in the lumbar spine (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, 5 = extreme); - patient's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor); - physician's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor).</description>

    <measure>Measurement of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>

    <description>For this the investigators will assign each of the patients to one of 4 categories designated as &quot;employable&quot; which included those who were unemployed due to pain, employed but on sick leave, laid off, or working. The other categories include retired, disabled, and elderly at least 60 years of age, eligible for social security.</description>

    <measure>Structural assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evolution of affected disc(s) by quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) density measurements in T2 and T1 spin/echo and T1 rho weighted images used as an indication of disc fluid and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) content. The &quot;quality&quot; of the patient's lumbar disc/discs will be monitored non invasively using T2 weighted MRI sagittal images and, in T1 spin/echo MRI. Lumbar disc grading will be performed in the sagittal T2 weighted images by two physicians independently who were experienced in MRI of the spine. They will review each intervertebral disc from L1-2 to L5-S1 by the modified Pfirrmann criteria. The modified Pfirrmann grading system assesses degenerated intervertebral discs by MRI for the asymmetry in disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and the annulus, signal intensity of intervertebral discs and height of intervertebral discs and assigns grade 1 to 8 for disc degeneration.</description>
