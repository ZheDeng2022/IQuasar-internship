  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation, and dose expansion study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 DNA plasmid vaccine&#xD;
      candidates, VB10.2129 (C1) and VB10.2210 (C2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a dose escalation phase and Part 2 is a dose expansion phase and both vaccine&#xD;
      candidates, ie, VB10.2129 (C1) and VB10.2210 (C2) will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 consist of two arms: one arm with each vaccine candidate and each arm investigating&#xD;
      three escalating dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 subjects previously vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine will be enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
      Each subject in will receive two vaccinations 21 days apart (Day 0 and Day 21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be one group of 10 subjects previously vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine who&#xD;
      will receive only one vaccination on Day 0 at the highest dose reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 bis a dose expansion phase with one arm for each candidate; VB10.2129 and&#xD;
      VB01.2210, in previousl vaccinated healthy adult subjects only. The dose to be investigated&#xD;
      will be selected based on safety and inital immune response data from Part 1. All subjects&#xD;
      will be folowed for up to 1 year after the first vaccination.&#xD;
