      This study is a single arm, open-label, intravenous infusion of Anti- Epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells modified by C-X-C Chemokine receptor&#xD;
      type 5 (CXCR 5) in patients with advanced adult non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

      In this study, the dose(number of cells by body weight) and time of infusion should be&#xD;
      recorded in detail according to the dosage of slope climbing and single infusion. The safety&#xD;
      of chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells treatment was evaluated by observing the adverse&#xD;
      events after cell therapy. The effectiveness of CAR-T treatment was initially assessed&#xD;
      compared with the results of the patient's own previous standard treatment plan. Blood was&#xD;
      collected before and within 12 months after infusion to detect the number and activity of&#xD;
      CAR-T cells and evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CAR-T cells.&#xD;
