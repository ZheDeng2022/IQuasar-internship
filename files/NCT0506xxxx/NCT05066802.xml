  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the next decade, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is expected to rise to the&#xD;
      second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. To increase the survival, various&#xD;
      peri-operative treatments have been tested, and adjuvant FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      capecitabine is now standard of care after surgical resection for localized PDAC. Even with&#xD;
      superior survival among various disease extent of PDAC, resectable PDAC still shows poor&#xD;
      outcomes with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This phase II study is investigating&#xD;
      the role of modified-FOLFIRINOX as neoadjuvant treatment for resectable PDAC.&#xD;

      This phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified FOLFIRINOX as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment for resectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma confirmed by histological or&#xD;
             cytopathological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients evaluated as resectable according to the following&#xD;
             criteria in imaging tests including CT or MRI (NCCN guideline criteria, if all of the&#xD;
             following criteria are satisfied) A. No tumor contact with the major arterial&#xD;
             structures of the Celiac axis [CA], superior mesenteric artery [SMA], and common&#xD;
