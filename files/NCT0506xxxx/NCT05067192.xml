    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to develop the first alpha-synuclein (a-syn)-specific PET tracer.&#xD;
      The research phase will exploit ACI's proprietary MorphomerTM library and extensively&#xD;
      optimized screening workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising PET-tracer candidates will be tested for their ability in detecting a-syn pathology&#xD;
      in patients with a range of Parkinsonian conditions with different a-syn levels and&#xD;
      distributions, comprising hereditary forms of PD and other synucleinopathies.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today there is no way of detecting a-synuclein pathology in life, and thus the diagnoses of&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) and the closely related synucleinopathies Dementia with Lewy Bodies&#xD;
      (DLB) and Multiple system atrophy (MSA) are clinical diagnoses, that can be supported by&#xD;
      dopamine (F-DOPA) imaging and biomarkers (f.ex cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light&#xD;
      chain), but where the ultimate diagnosis is not certain until at post mortem investigation of&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of this study is to assess a newly developed positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) tracers for a-synuclein and to study the ability of the tracer in detecting the&#xD;
      underlying pathology in PD, DLB and MSA. If the PET tracers can detect the pathology reliably&#xD;
      our hope is that this tracers can assist in future clinical trials for PD, DLB and MSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      • to assess the brain a-synuclein load in vivo using [18F]ACI-3847 PET in MSA, DLB and&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to explore the correlation in these patients between a-synuclein load assessed by&#xD;
           [18F]ACI-3847 PET and clinical features including cognitive impairment and severity of&#xD;
           neurological symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to detect a-synuclein pathology assessed by [18F]ACI-3847 PET in Parkinson cases with a&#xD;
           duplication in the gene coding for a-synuclein&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation: Neurodegenerative disorders mainly affect the elderly population and&#xD;
      approximately 1% of the population above 60 are affected by PD. DLB is likely underdiagnosed,&#xD;
      but represent approximately 10% of the patients in a specialist dementia center setting. MSA&#xD;
      is more uncommon and is often mistaken for PD, but carries a much worse prognosis. Due to the&#xD;
      poor prognosis of MSA it is important to as early as possible be able to give a correct&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnoses of PD, DLB and MSA are today mainly clinical diagnoses. The diagnosis of PD is&#xD;
      based on the triad of symptoms: rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia of movement,&#xD;
      followed by a rapid and sustained response of symptoms to levodopa treatment. Further, the&#xD;
      loss of dopaminergic neurons can be visualized with PET-imaging of dopamine storage capacity&#xD;
      (18F-DOPA PET). At symptom onset of PD it has been estimated that 50-70% of dopaminergic&#xD;
      cells are already lost, making it more difficult to successfully treat the disease to halt or&#xD;
      slow down disease progression. MSA causes similar symptoms as PD, and is often mistaken for&#xD;
      PD, but patients gradually also develop autonomic failure, with varying heart rate and&#xD;
      blodpressure, causing falls due to ortostatic drops in blood pressure. F-DOPA PET again shows&#xD;
      a loss of dopaminergic cells in the midbrain, but the levodopa response is much attenuated in&#xD;
      MSA. DLB shows similar symptoms of bradykinesia and rigidity, but also early on changes in&#xD;
      cognition and visual hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropathology: PD, DLB and MSA are all caused by aggregation of a-synuclein in the brain.&#xD;
      The midbrain and the brainstem is first affected in PD, and later in the disease the&#xD;
      pathology spreads throughout the neocortex. In DLB the a-synuclein often also involves the&#xD;
      occipital neocortex and limbic brain structures in addition to the midbrain. In MSA the&#xD;
      pathology affects the brain stem and basal ganglia, but also often the cerebellum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic work-up: As stated earlier there is today no reliable way to verify the diagnoses&#xD;
      or the a-synuclein in life. In this study we will include also 18F-DOPA PET that is today the&#xD;
      state-of-the-art technique for detecting a loss of dopamine producing cells in the midbrain.&#xD;
      18F-DOPA PET will strengthen the diagnostic accuracy, but there are still pitfalls even when&#xD;
      using 18F-DOPA PET for diagnosis. For example the Parkinson-related disorders Progressive&#xD;
      Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration (CDB), that both show dopamine cell&#xD;
      loss and a decreased 18F-DOPA retention in addition to PD-like symptoms like bradykinesia and&#xD;
      rigidity, but that both are caused by tau pathology and not a-synuclein pathology. It is well&#xD;
      known that the diagnostic accuracy of some of the diagnoses with parkinsonism is at best&#xD;
      moderate and that many diagnoses will have to be corrected at autopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hope is that [18F]ACI-3847 PET in the long run will help in the differential diagnosis&#xD;
      against PSP and CBD, but also that the different patterns of a-synuclein accumulation in PD,&#xD;
      DLB and MSA will provide a useful tool in tracking disease progression within the&#xD;
      synucleinopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment trials: There are currently no treatments that slow down or stop PD, DLB or MSA.&#xD;
      There are large efforts to develop therapies (e.g. immunotherapies) that remove aggregated&#xD;
      a-synuclein from the brains of the affected patients. However, there is no methods available&#xD;
      today that can be used to study whether such treatments really affect the levels of abnormal&#xD;
      a-synuclein in the living human brain. If [18F]ACI-3847 PET can visualize the a-synuclein&#xD;
      aggregates, then it might be used in the future to evaluate whether novel therapies can&#xD;
      remove a-synuclein from the brain of living humans.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography [18F]ACI-3847 PET (a-synuclein PET) will be performed in all&#xD;
      participants. 185 MBq (5 mCi) [18F]ACI-3847 is injected intravenously via an intravenous&#xD;
      cathether. Data acquisition is started at the time of injection and continues over 100&#xD;
      minutes (0-100 min). During this time the patient will need to keep as still as possible.&#xD;
      Image data will be collected on GE Discovery MI PET/CT cameras as LIST mode data (raw data)&#xD;
      and be reconstructed after acquisition and attenuation correction. Arterial sampling will be&#xD;
      performed in a subset of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [18F]DOPA PET for assessment of remaining dopamine producing cells will be performed by&#xD;
      intravenous injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi) [18F]DOPA. Data acquisition is started at either at&#xD;
      the time of injection and continues over 110 minutes, or starts 90 min after injection and&#xD;
      continues for 20 minutes. No arterial blood sampling is needed for this scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging 3 Tesla MRI (Siemens Prisma) will be done in all participants. No&#xD;
      contrast-enhancing agent will be used.&#xD;
