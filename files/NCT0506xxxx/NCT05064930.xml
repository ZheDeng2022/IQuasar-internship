  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common, yet still not fully understood,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders in adults. One suspected etiology involves intestinal dysbiosis,&#xD;
      i.e. both quantitative and qualitative alterations in intestinal microbiota composition,&#xD;
      which affects the gut-brain axis. Probiotics are live microorganisms, which-administered at&#xD;
      the right dose-are beneficial for human health; their mechanism of action involves modifying&#xD;
      the gut microbiota. Clinical study reports document that probiotic administration is&#xD;
      beneficial for patients with IBS. The ultimate clinical effects depend primarily on probiotic&#xD;
      strain selection. Our research team evaluated a multi-strain probiotic formulation and a&#xD;
      multi-strain synbiotic (a combination of probiotic strains with short-chain prebiotic&#xD;
      fructooligosaccharides) formulation as part of two randomized placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials in patients with IBS with predominant diarrhea. The results indicated a beneficial&#xD;
      effect of these formulations on the clinical course of IBS assessed with the international&#xD;
      IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), with each of the study formulations exhibiting efficacy&#xD;
      in different fields. The formulation composed of a mixture of Bifidobacterium and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus strains reduced the levels of pain and improved the quality of life, whereas&#xD;
      the synbiotic formulation effectively improved bloating and had a beneficial effect on the&#xD;
      general condition of the intestines. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2020&#xD;
      showed that high doses of single-strain formulations, particularly those containing&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus strains, may be more effective in IBS patients. Other&#xD;
      reports demonstrated a high efficacy of the new-generation probiotic Bacillus coagulans in&#xD;
      IBS. Therefore, the main objective of this research project is to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      single-strain probiotics containing Bifidobacterium lactis or Bacillus coagulans in patients&#xD;
      with IBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial included 120 adult patients, who&#xD;
      had been diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. The patients will&#xD;
      receive orally a probiotic formulation containing Bifidobacterium lactis or Bacillus&#xD;
      coagulans or placebo over a period of 12 weeks. Once the period of supplementation is&#xD;
      completed, the patients will be followed-up for the subsequent 4 weeks. The patients included&#xD;
      in the study will receive diaries, which they will complete daily. The patient's dairy will&#xD;
      include information about the number of stools, stool consistency (assessed based on the&#xD;
      Bristol Stool Form Scale) and IBS symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, bowel urgency, and&#xD;
      feeling of incomplete evacuation) rated in a 5-grade scale. The diary will also include&#xD;
      information on any adverse events and the use of any new medications during the study. Once a&#xD;
      week, the patients will be contacted by phone by interviewers who will collect the&#xD;
      information recorded in the patient's diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, the patients included in the study will be informed of the study&#xD;
      procedure and educated on the phone exchanges with the interviewers. One week prior to study&#xD;
      intervention, the patients will be asked to record their symptoms in their patient diaries&#xD;
      every day. Subsequently, the patients will visit their study doctor every four weeks (from&#xD;
      the beginning of the study intervention) in order to receive the next dose of the study&#xD;
      formulation/placebo. During each study visit, the patients will be evaluated with the use of&#xD;
      IBS-SSS and IBS Global Improvement Scale (IBS-GIS). The patients included in the study will&#xD;
      undergo a hydrogen breath test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) both prior to&#xD;
      receiving the study formulation/placebo and 12 weeks later, after intervention is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last a total of 16 weeks from the moment the intervention is initiated (12&#xD;
      weeks of interventions and 4 weeks of follow-up).&#xD;

    <time_frame>From baseline at 4, 8, 12 weeks of intervention, and 4 weeks (16 weeks of the study) after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-SSS is a 5-question survey that asks: 1. the severity of abdominal pain, 2. frequency of abdominal pain, 3. severity of abdominal distention, 4.dissatisfaction with bowel habit, and 5. interference with quality of life over the past 10 days. Subjects respond to each question on a 100-point visual analogue scale. Each of the five question generates a maximum score of 100 point, and total scores can range from 0-500 with higher scores indicating severe symptoms. A decrease of 50 points is associated with a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline at 4, 8, 12 weeks of intervention, and 4 weeks (16 weeks of the study) after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-Global Improvement Scale assesses IBS symptoms using a patient-defined 7 point Likert scale ranging from symptoms substantially worse to substantially improved.&#xD;
Patients answer the question &quot;Have you felt any change in the severity of your symptoms over the past 7 days compared to how you felt before the medicine was given?&#xD;
The answers are recorded based on the 7-point scale:&#xD;
= I feel that the symptoms have worsened significantly&#xD;
= I feel that the symptoms have moderately worsened&#xD;
= I feel that the symptoms have slightly worsened&#xD;
= I feel no change&#xD;
= I feel a slight improvement&#xD;
= I feel moderate improvement&#xD;
= I feel significant improvement IBS-GIS score indicates: improvement if is &gt;4 or worsening if is&lt;4, no change if is 4</description>
