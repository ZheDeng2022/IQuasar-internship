  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single center, open-label, single-arm study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of AK104 monotherapy in adult subjects&#xD;
      with previously treated recurrent or metastatic high grade neuroendocrine cervical cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To estimate progression free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) in response to AK104&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the&#xD;
      cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of AK104 monotherapy in terms of DoR and DCR in patients with&#xD;
           progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of AK104 monotherapy in terms of ORR in patients with&#xD;
           progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of AK104 monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
           progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine presence of HPV cell free DNA and if levels of HPV cell free DNA may serve&#xD;
           as a surrogate for response to AK104 monotherapy in patients with progressive/relapsed&#xD;
           high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix&#xD;
