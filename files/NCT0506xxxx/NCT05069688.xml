  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among children with HIV, yet insufficient&#xD;
      data are available on the pharmacokinetics of newer HIV/TB cotreatment strategies in&#xD;
      children. Current WHO-recommended rifampicin dosages result in low concentrations in most&#xD;
      children, and high-dose rifampicin may improve outcomes and shorten treatment duration. Yet&#xD;
      the impact of high-dose rifampicin on dolutegravir exposures has not been examined in&#xD;
      children. This study aims to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir twice&#xD;
      daily among HIV/TB coinfected children receiving standard-dose and high-dose rifampicin.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, intensive and sparse pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) and safety study to evaluate steady-state dolutegravir (DTG) concentrations among 20&#xD;
      HIV/TB coinfected children 4 weeks to &lt;6 years of age requiring concurrent TB treatment. Ten&#xD;
      patients will be recruited into each of two age cohorts: 4 weeks to &lt;2 years and ≥2 years to&#xD;
      &lt;6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited from two large pediatric HIV clinics in Nigeria. Children in this&#xD;
      study will receive HIV/TB cotreatment that is considered standard of care consisting of DTG&#xD;
      twice daily during rifampicin (RIF)-containing TB treatment. For this portion of the study,&#xD;
      the primary intervention is additional blood sampling for drug concentration determination&#xD;
      and biomarker assessment. Additionally, during a two week period (study weeks 20-21), the RIF&#xD;
      dose will be increased from standard-dose to high-dose RIF, during which two-way PK and&#xD;
      toxicity monitoring will occur. Clinical and laboratory monitoring for toxicity during HIV/TB&#xD;
      cotreatment is consistent with routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK sampling for drug concentration determination will occur at three time points during the&#xD;
      48-week study. Specifically, PK sampling will occur at week-20 to evaluate DTG twice daily&#xD;
      during standard-dose RIF, week-22 to evaluate DTG twice daily during high-dose RIF, and at&#xD;
      week-30 to evaluate DTG once daily after TB treatment is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the endogenous biomarker of CYP3A4 activity, 4-beta-hydroxycholesterol to&#xD;
      cholesterol ratio, will be evaluated to advance understanding of underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      drug action. Blood sampling to quantify this biomarker will occur at either 4 (among&#xD;
      ART-experienced children) or 5 (ART-naive) time points during the 48-week study.&#xD;
