  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there is growing interest in illustrating the health benefits of exercise&#xD;
      among epilepsy. Although exercise is recommended for patients with epilepsy, there is&#xD;
      uncertainty concerning the effects of yoga and aerobic exercise on multiple health outcomes&#xD;
      in epilepsy. The aim of this trial is to examine the effects of yoga and aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training on physical activity, health-related physical fitness, mental, emotional, and&#xD;
      psychological health status, seizure frequency and quality of life.&#xD;
