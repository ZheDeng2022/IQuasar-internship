      The multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ergoferon as a&#xD;
      non-specific preventive medicine for COVID-19 in individuals vaccinated against a new&#xD;
      coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Design: the multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll adult participants of either gender aged ≥18 years who receive a&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine. The participant signs an information sheet (Informed Consent Form) for&#xD;
      participation in the clinical study on the day of administration of component I of the&#xD;
      Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik-V) vaccine. The physician evaluates if the participant is eligible for&#xD;
      the study. A SARS-CoV-2 rapid test (BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag) is carried out. If the participant&#xD;
      tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, he/she is not enrolled in the study. The investigator's&#xD;
      approach should be in compliance with the current version of the guidelines &quot;Prevention,&#xD;
      diagnosis, and treatment of a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19)&quot; by the Ministry of Health&#xD;
      of the Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      then he/she is included in the study, and the physician fills in source medical&#xD;
      documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment in the study (Day 1, Visit 1), the participant is randomized into one of&#xD;
      two groups: participants of the Group 1 receive Ergoferon in the preventive regimen for 3&#xD;
      weeks, and participants of the Group 2 receive Placebo in the same regimen for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of administration of component II of the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine (day 22, Visit 2 +&#xD;
      3 days) the express test for SARS-CoV-2 (BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag) is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the component II of the vaccine has been administered, the participant is followed up&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, Visit 3 (&quot;phone visit&quot;) is carried out in order to interview the&#xD;
      participant about the health status (absence/presence of any ARVI symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are provided with classic thermometers for measuring axillary temperature.&#xD;
      Electronic diaries are used in the trial to record any potential deterioration in the&#xD;
      participant's condition (if applicable) for the assessment of efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      registration of adverse events. The investigator trains the participant how to fill in the&#xD;
      diary. Once a week, the participant receives an SMS reminder: &quot;If you have symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease, note them in your diary. The investigator will contact you&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant develops symptoms of an acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI)?&#xD;
      including an increase in body temperature to febrile/subfebrile values, weakness, headache,&#xD;
      chills, cough, sore throat, other symptoms, etc. within five weeks of the observation, the&#xD;
      investigator will perform an unscheduled visit to collect nasopharynx and oropharynx swabs&#xD;
      for the RT-PCR test (performing in the central laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant without ARVI symptoms will have a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (rapid&#xD;
      test) at Visit 1 or 2, his/her nasal and oropharyngeal swabs will also be collected for&#xD;
      RT-PCR testing in the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (with or without symptoms) is detected, the&#xD;
      participant will complete the participation in the trial as meeting the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, in accordance with the requirements of&#xD;
      Rospotrebnadzor Agency, the information about it should be transferred to the medical&#xD;
      facility where the participant is registered and where appropriate medical care will be&#xD;
      provided for the participant in accordance with the current standards. The employees of the&#xD;
      medical facility will report COVID-19 data in compliance with the requirements of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the rules of the medical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible post-vaccination symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general (a flu-like syndrome characterized by chills, fever, arthralgia, myalgia,&#xD;
           asthenia, general malaise, headache) and local (pain at the injection site, hyperemia,&#xD;
           swelling) reactions that develop on the first-second day and resolve within three&#xD;
           subsequent days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nausea, dyspepsia, loss of appetite;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enlarged regional lymph nodes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  allergic reactions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  short-term increase in serum levels of liver transaminases, creatinine, and creatine&#xD;
           phosphokinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These post-vaccination symptoms are not recorded as adverse events (either associated with&#xD;
      the investigational product administration or developing after discontinuation); they are&#xD;
      registered by the participant in the diary and assessed by the physician as post-vaccination&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term flu-like syndrome should not be diagnosed as ARVI, in this case, the RT-PCR&#xD;
      test for SARS-CoV-2 is not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is ill with COVID-19 or has been hospitalized for COVID-19, a delayed&#xD;
      &quot;phone&quot; visit is performed. The visit is scheduled by the investigator depending on each&#xD;
      case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study participants are allowed to take medications for their chronic conditions,&#xD;
      except for medicines listed as &quot;Prohibited concomitant treatment&quot;.&#xD;
