  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double blind, prospective, randomized trial to evaluate postoperative pain, narcotic use,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and function among shoulder arthroplasty patients receiving&#xD;
      interscalene block with and without the addition of liposomal bupivacaine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to reduce narcotic abuse potential, orthopaedic surgeons have explored multimodal&#xD;
      pain regimens in addition to regional anesthesia to improve postoperative pain control. One&#xD;
      commonly used intervention to reduce postoperative shoulder pain has been the interscalene&#xD;
      brachial plexus block. This block provides significant pain relief for shoulder procedures,&#xD;
      but has been limited to less than 24 hours even with long acting anesthetics. In the setting&#xD;
      of shoulder arthroplasty, this short-term pain control often leads to the need for increased&#xD;
      narcotic pain medication. Since shoulder arthroplasty has been steadily increasing in the&#xD;
      United States with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, it is imperative to control patients'&#xD;
      postoperative pain without increasing their risk for opiate abuse. A potential method for&#xD;
      achieving this is by using liposomal bupivacaine in the interscalene blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double blind, prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the postoperative&#xD;
      pain profiles among shoulder arthroplasty patients receiving interscalene block with and&#xD;
      without the addition of liposomal bupivacaine. The purpose of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty with an interscalene brachial plexus block with&#xD;
      liposomal bupivacaine (study group) or without liposomal bupivacaine (control group) will&#xD;
      have differences in postoperative opiate consumption, patient-reported pain, satisfaction&#xD;
      with surgery, and shoulder function.&#xD;
