  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study designed to investigate the potential effect of tezepelumab (210 mg subcutaneous [SC]&#xD;
      every 4 weeks [Q4W]) on antibody responses following seasonal quadrivalent influenza virus&#xD;
      vaccination in the fall/winter 2021-2022 in the USA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with moderate to severe asthma will enter the screening period of a minimum of 2&#xD;
      weeks to allow adequate time for all of the eligibility criteria to be evaluated. They will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to receive tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo SC Q4W, administered at Weeks 0,&#xD;
      4, 8 and 12. Randomization will be monitored to ensure at least 50% of the randomized&#xD;
      participants are between the ages of 12 to 17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single dose of inactivated quadrivalent seasonal influenza&#xD;
      vaccine intramuscularly at Week 12, prior to the fourth dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples for evaluation of antibody response will be drawn at Week 12 (pre-vaccination)&#xD;
      and at Week 16 (4 weeks post-vaccination) when humoral response to the vaccination is&#xD;
      expected to be fully developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The End of Treatment (EOT) Visit will be conducted at Week 16 and a final Follow-up Visit and&#xD;
      the End of Study Visit will be conducted at Week 28.&#xD;
