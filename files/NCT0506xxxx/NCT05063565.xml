    <textblock>
      The objective of the ROWAN clinical study is to assess the the durability of local tumor&#xD;
      control in HCC patients who receive TheraSphere followed by durvalumab and tremelimumab,&#xD;
      compared to those who receive TheraSphere treatment alone.&#xD;

      A global open-label, prospective, multi-center, randomized, Phase II trial with two treatment&#xD;
      arms designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TheraSphere administered before initiation&#xD;
      of Durvalumab with Tremelimumab in HCC patients not eligible for or who have declined&#xD;
      treatment with resection and/or ablation or liver transplant.&#xD;
