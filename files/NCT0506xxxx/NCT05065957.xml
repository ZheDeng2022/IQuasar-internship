      The primary objective are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of D07001-softgel capsules and&#xD;
      Xeloda/TS-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of D07001-softgel capsules and Xeloda/TS-1, as&#xD;
      assessed by disease control rate (DCR).&#xD;

      This open label, multicenter study will be conducted in 2 stages: a dose-finding stage (Phase&#xD;
      IIa) and a dose-expansion stage (Phase IIb/III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase IIa, eligible patients will be assigned to receive oral D07001-softgel on Days 1, 3,&#xD;
      5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19 of a 21-day cycle (9 doses per cycle) and Xeloda (or TS-1) twice&#xD;
      daily on Day 1-14 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified 3+3 dose-finding design method will be applied to identify dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) and establish the selected dose of D07001-softgel capsules plus Xeloda (or&#xD;
      TS-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase IIb/III,the first 40 subjects (20 subjects per arm) will be randomly allocated in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio in two arms. Arm A will receive active symptom control (ASC) with the selected dose&#xD;
      from dose-finding stage of D07001-softgel capsules and Xeloda (or TS-1), in 21-day cycles. In&#xD;
      arm B, subjects will receive ASC with mFOLFOX treatment. After the last subject of first 40&#xD;
      subjects will be completed the visit in the end of treatment, an adaptive interim analysis&#xD;
      will be planned to re-estimate the required sample size based on the result of DCR if needed.&#xD;
      The sponsor team will determine whether the study will be continued or stopped for futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study continues to proceed, the total subject number will be based on the decision&#xD;
      from the results of interim study. The rest of subjects will be randomized to receive the&#xD;
      combination of study drug or active-control drug with the same allocation in two arms. Both&#xD;
      groups will continue the therapy until disease progression, withdrawn consent, or when&#xD;
      another treatment discontinuation criterion is met.&#xD;
