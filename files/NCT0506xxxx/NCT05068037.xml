  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative stress is associated with various influences before and after surgery. Instead&#xD;
      of benzodiazepines, patients can be calmed by non-pharmacological methods. One of these is&#xD;
      perioperative medical hypnosis, which has also other beneficial effects such as lower opioid&#xD;
      consumption, better wound healing, shorter hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is used for analgesia. Is is effective for preventing and treating nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the study is that perioperative acupuncture reduces the consumption of&#xD;
      analgesics and anaesthetics during surgery. The investigators will also study the impact of&#xD;
      acupuncture on postoperative nausea and vomiting and analgesic consumption in the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery unit and the occurrence of postoperative delirium.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: Perioperative stress is associated with the procedure itself,&#xD;
      anaesthesia, as well as various influences before and after surgery. Patient's feeling of&#xD;
      discomfort and anxiety in the preoperative period are treated with benzodiazepines. Although&#xD;
      these drugs calm the patient, they are associated with the occurrence of postoperative&#xD;
      delirium, especially in elderly patients. Instead of benzodiazepines, patients can be calmed&#xD;
      by other non-pharmacological methods. One of these is perioperative medical hypnosis, which&#xD;
      also has other beneficial effects such as lower opioid consumption, better wound healing,&#xD;
      shorter hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Clinical Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care at the University Medical&#xD;
      Center Ljubljana, in cooperation with the Clinical Department of Neurosurgery, investigators&#xD;
      have been routinely using perioperative medical hypnosis in awake brain surgeries since 2016&#xD;
      and have very good experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of postoperative delirium is also reduced by the use of intravenous anesthesia and&#xD;
      reduced use of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture has been a recognized and well-established method for the treatment of acute and&#xD;
      chronic pain by the WHO for several decades. With the right choice of points, in addition to&#xD;
      treating pain, we can also reduce nausea and vomiting. It is a safe method in the hands of&#xD;
      trained doctors, with virtually no side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative acupuncture has a number of beneficial effects: it reduces the consumption of&#xD;
      anesthetics and analgesics, reduces the number of perioperative complications, and protects&#xD;
      vital organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the research, investigators want to determine if acupuncture reduces the consumption of&#xD;
      analgesics and anaesthetics during surgery. The investigators will study also the impact of&#xD;
      acupuncture on nausea, vomiting and analgesic consumption in the postoperative recovery unit&#xD;
      and the occurrence of postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional value of the research will be monitoring the quality of postoperative recovery&#xD;
      both in terms of drug consumption and recording of postoperative complications, as well as in&#xD;
      terms of patient satisfaction and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of perioperative complications, improved quality of patient recovery and the&#xD;
      implementation of complementary medicine methods are among the important challenges of&#xD;
      modern, evidence-based medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective randomised study will include surgical patients older than 18 years,&#xD;
      classified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) in groups I-III, who will be&#xD;
      scheduled for minor surgery under general anaesthesia (inguinal hernia, spine, minor plastic&#xD;
      surgery). Patients will sign the consent for the procedure, anaesthesia and participation in&#xD;
      the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women, psychiatric patients, children, and patients who will not sign the consent or&#xD;
      will not be capable to cooperate in the study will not be included..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included surgeries are not a risk factor for increased nausea and vomiting. In the study&#xD;
      group one of the team members will talk to the patient before the surgery and perform brief&#xD;
      medical hypnosis to improve the patient's well-being and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the patient will be under less stress in the perioperative period. Prior to&#xD;
      initiating anesthesia, patients will be randomized into three groups: patients with hypnosis&#xD;
      and acupuncture (study), patients with antiemetic therapy (standard), patients without&#xD;
      antiemetic and acupuncture therapy (control).The depth of anesthesia will be adjusted to&#xD;
      maintain BIS values of 40-55. The remifentanil infusion will be adjusted according to the&#xD;
      pain monitor values. Patients will receive analgesia according to the protocol. Investigators&#xD;
      will collect pain and POSB data in the postoperative recovery unit and in the ward after 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of surgery and anaesthesia and the consumption of analgesics and anaesthetics will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After three days, patients will be asked about their well-being and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be performed by specialist anesthesiologists and an anesthesiology&#xD;
      specialist who are trained in the pharmacological and non-pharmacological skills required for&#xD;
      the research.&#xD;
