  <brief_summary>

      This research is being done to assess the effect of radiofrequency (RF)-based treatment on&#xD;
      skin and skin conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency (RF)-based selective electrothermolysis is an increasingly utilized minimally&#xD;
      invasive technology for several dermatologic conditions, such as epilation, acne vulgaris,&#xD;
      and skin rejuvenation, with minimal side effects. This procedure targets and destroys&#xD;
      selective cutaneous and subcutaneous structures; therefore, allowing greater control and&#xD;
      specificity of treatment area and minimizing destruction to surrounding tissue. Here, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to utilize this technology on human axillary skin to establish safety&#xD;
      and biologic effects of selective electrothermolysis in this particular area of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the tolerability, safety, and histometric changes in&#xD;
      skin-radiofrequency interactions in the axillary skin of participants. The investigators will&#xD;
      collect skin samples from prospective volunteers and assess for biologic effects in human&#xD;
      axillary skin after selective electrothermolysis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the four months of study period, Participants in the study will receive clinical&#xD;
      assessments, photography, questionnaires, up to 3 treatments of RF-based selective&#xD;
      electrothermolysis to pre-selected areas of the axillary skin, up to 2 4-mm skin biopsies for&#xD;
      up to 5 study visits.&#xD;

    <description>RF-based treatments use electrothermolysis to deliver heat energy to targeted structures in the skin, such as hair follicles or glands by the use of insulated needles. The investigators will use radio frequency based treatment on a pre-selected skin area (about 3cm x 3cm or 1 ¼ x 1 ¼ inches in size) on either your left or right underarm that is eligible for assessment, study treatment, and biopsy.&#xD;
Participants will receive clinical assessments, photography, questionnaires, up to 3 treatments of RF-based selective electrothermolysis to pre-selected areas of the axillary skin, up to 2 4-mm skin biopsies for up to 5 study visits.</description>
