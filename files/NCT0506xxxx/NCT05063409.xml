  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if burn injured patients who receive blood&#xD;
      transfusions in the operating room have better outcomes when given transfusions at a set&#xD;
      ratio (1:1)of PRBC to FFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, patients that need blood transfusions during surgery are given mostly packed&#xD;
      red blood cells (PRBC) and some fresh frozen plasma (FFP). This is usually about 1:4 ratio of&#xD;
      FFP to PRBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will compare this traditional approach (1:4) to a 1:1 ratio of FFP to PRBC&#xD;
      during the operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that the use of FFP/PRBC ratio of 1:1, compared to a ratio of&#xD;
      1:4 will result in a(n)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. decrease in the amount of blood transfused in the operating room&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. decrease in the amount of blood transfused during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. improvement in coagulation parameters (PT/PTT, INR, antithrombin III, Protein C and&#xD;
           Fibrinogen in the operative period (from operation start to 12 hours post operatively)&#xD;
           and at 24 hours postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. decrease the hospital length of stay, lung dysfunction, infections, and mortality&#xD;

      The hypothesis of the study is that the use of a fresh frozen plasma/packed red blood cells&#xD;
      (FFP/PRBC) ratio of 1:1, compared to a ratio of 1:4 during operative excision of &gt;20% TBSA&#xD;
      will: result in a decrease in the amount of blood transfused in the operating room, a&#xD;
      decrease in the amount of blood transfused during hospitalization, an improvement in&#xD;
      coagulation parameters (PT/PTT, INR) in the operative period (from operation start to 12&#xD;
      hours postoperatively) and at 24 hours postoperatively, and a decrease in hospital length of&#xD;
      stay, lung dysfunction, number of infections, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if aggressive correction of intraoperative&#xD;
      coagulopathy during burn excision and grafting results in improved outcomes.&#xD;
