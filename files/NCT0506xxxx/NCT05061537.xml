  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, multiple dose, dose escalation&#xD;
      and expansion study intended to evaluate the safety, viral load kinetics and shedding,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic, and anti-tumor activity of PF-07263689, either alone or in combination with&#xD;
      sasanlimab (an investigational anti-programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1] antibody), in&#xD;
      patients with selected locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have exhausted all&#xD;
      available standard of care therapies available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 dose escalation for PF-07263689 monotherapy (Part 1A)&#xD;
      and in combination with sasanlimab (Part 1B), followed by Part 2 dose expansion for the&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
