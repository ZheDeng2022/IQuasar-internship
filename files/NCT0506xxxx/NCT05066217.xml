  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of EPX-100 orally in divided doses as adjunctive therapy compared&#xD;
      with placebo as measured by percent change in the frequency of seizures that result in drops&#xD;
      in participants with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome between the 4-week Observation Phase (Baseline&#xD;
      period) and the final 4-week period of the 12-week Maintenance Phase. The 20 week study to&#xD;
      include a 4-week Observation Phase (baseline) prior to initiation of study treatment, 4-week&#xD;
      Titration Phase, and 12-week Maintenance Phase. At the option of the participant, he/she can&#xD;
      continue oral administration of EPX-100 in an Open-Label Extension (OLE) Phase for another 52&#xD;
      weeks after the end of the Maintenance Phase.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female participants ages 14 years and older at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant must have a documented history of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of at least one type of generalized seizure (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Electroencephalogram (EEG) diagnostic criteria (abnormal background activity,&#xD;
                  slow spike-wave discharges (&lt; 2.5 Hz), and/or paroxysmal fast activity during&#xD;
                  sleep), and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abnormal cognitive development.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must have seizures not completely controlled by ASMs with the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Onset of seizures at 11 years of age or younger&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of multiple seizure types that must include tonic or tonic/atonic&#xD;
                  seizures as well as current countable seizures that result in fall/drop.&#xD;
                  Countable motor seizure types resulting in a drop that are eligible for inclusion&#xD;
                  are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Focal with clear, observable motor signs (i.e., automatisms, dystonic posturing,&#xD;
                  focal tonic stiffening)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Secondarily generalized tonic clonic (evolving to bilateral convulsive seizure&#xD;
                  from focal seizure)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Generalized tonic clonic convulsion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clonic (note bilateral: symmetric R and L), and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tonic/Atonic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All medication and/or interventions for epilepsy including ketogenic diet and vagus&#xD;
             nerve stimulation (VNS) must have been stable for ≥ 30 days prior to screening and the&#xD;
             participant is willing to maintain a stable regimen throughout the study. Note: The&#xD;
             ketogenic diet and VNS treatments are not counted as an ASM throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The participant must be approved to participate by the PI after review of the medical&#xD;
             history, baseline seizure calendars, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Independent&#xD;
             Reviewer will confirm Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome diagnosis for each participant enrolled&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Seizure criteria of ≥ 4 countable seizures that result in a fall/drop (tonic-clonic,&#xD;
             tonic, clonic, atonic, focal with observable motor signs) per 4-week Baseline period&#xD;
             (Observation Phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants should be on a stable regimen of ASMs ≥ 30 days prior to Visit 1 and&#xD;
             generally in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participant, parent, or LAR is able and willing to maintain an accurate and complete&#xD;
             daily seizure calendar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Sexually active women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must be using a medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control and have a negative urine pregnancy test at the&#xD;
             screening visit. A WCBP is defined as a female who is biologically capable of becoming&#xD;
             pregnant. A medically acceptable method of birth control includes intrauterine devices&#xD;
             in place for at least 3 months, surgical sterilization, or adequate barrier methods&#xD;
             (e.g., diaphragm and foam). Use of oral contraceptives in combination with another&#xD;
             method (e.g., a spermicidal cream) is acceptable. In participants who are not sexually&#xD;
             active, abstinence is an acceptable form of birth control and urine will be tested per&#xD;
             protocol. Women who are of non-child-bearing potential, i.e., post-menopause, must&#xD;
             have this condition captured in their medical history. Pregnant women are excluded&#xD;
             from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have participant, parent, or LAR available and willing to give written informed&#xD;
             consent, after being properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and prior&#xD;
             to engaging in any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known sensitivity, allergy, or previous exposure to EPX-100 (clemizole HCl).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Exposure to any investigational drug or device ≤ 90 days prior to screening or plans&#xD;
             to participate in another drug or device trial at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Seizures secondary to illicit drug or alcohol use, infection, neoplasm, demyelinating&#xD;
             disease, degenerative neurological disease, or progressive central nervous system&#xD;
             (CNS) disease, metabolic illness, recent anoxic episode within the last 6 months&#xD;
             requiring resuscitation, or progressive degenerative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent use of drugs known to interfere with EPX-100, including moderate or severe&#xD;
             inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5/7. Specifically, concurrent use of carbamazepine,&#xD;
             oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, phenobarbital, and/or fenfluramine are excluded.&#xD;
             Subjects who are unable to agree to refraining from grapefruits and grapefruit juice&#xD;
             during the study period. Refer to Appendix 1 for a list of prohibited drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Receiving concomitant therapy with: centrally-acting anorectic agents; monoamine&#xD;
             oxidase (MAO) inhibitors; any centrally-acting drugs with clinically appreciable&#xD;
             amounts of serotonin agonist or antagonist properties, including serotonin reuptake&#xD;
             inhibition (SRIs, SSRIs). Also, systemic corticosteroids (inhaled steroids are&#xD;
             allowed) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may reduce seizure frequency, thus are&#xD;
             excluded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has any medical condition that, in the PI's judgment, is considered to be clinically&#xD;
             significant and could potentially affect participant safety or study outcome,&#xD;
             including but not limited to: clinically significant cardiac disease (including&#xD;
             angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, history of arrhythmias,&#xD;
             and/or clinical valvulopathy), renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematologic or&#xD;
             hepatic conditions; or a condition that affects the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has an active suicidal plan/intent or have had active suicidal thoughts in the past 6&#xD;
             months or a suicide attempt in the past 3 years.&#xD;
