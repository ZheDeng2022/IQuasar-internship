  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in China is open to people with progressive lung fibrosis (chronic fibrosing ILDs&#xD;
      with progressive phenotype) who are at least 18 years old. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find out whether a medicine called nintedanib helps people with progressive lung fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. 1 group gets nintedanib&#xD;
      as capsules twice a day. The other group gets placebo as capsules twice a day. Placebo&#xD;
      capsules look like nintedanib capsules but do not contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 1 year. During this time, they visit the study site&#xD;
      about 10 times. At some visits, participants perform a lung function test. The doctors check&#xD;
      whether study treatment can slow down the loss of lung function. The doctors also regularly&#xD;
      check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.&#xD;

             one of the following criteria for Progressive Phenotype within 24 months of screening&#xD;
             visit (Visit 1) despite treatment with unapproved medications used in clinical&#xD;
             practice to treat ILD, as assessed by the investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) % predicted based&#xD;
                  on a relative decline of ≥10%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Marginal decline in FVC % predicted based on a relative decline of ≥5-&lt;10%&#xD;
                  combined with worsening of respiratory symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Marginal decline in FVC % predicted based on a relative decline of ≥5-&lt;10%&#xD;
                  combined with increasing extent of fibrotic changes on chest imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Worsening of respiratory symptoms as well as increasing extent of fibrotic&#xD;
                  changes on chest imaging [Note: Changes attributable to comorbidities e.g.&#xD;
                  infection, heart failure must be excluded. Unapproved medications used in the&#xD;
                  clinical practice to treat ILD include but are not limited to corticosteroid,&#xD;
                  azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), n-Acetylcysteine (NAC), rituximab,&#xD;

&#xD;
        [Note: Laboratory parameters from Visit 1 have to satisfy the laboratory threshold values&#xD;
        as shown above. Visit 2 laboratory results will be available only after randomization. In&#xD;
        case at Visit 2 the results do no longer satisfy the entry criteria, the Investigator has&#xD;
        to decide whether it is justified that the patient remains on study drug. The justification&#xD;
        for decision needs to be documented. Laboratory parameters that are found to be abnormal at&#xD;
        Visit 1 are allowed to be re-tested (once) if it is thought to be a measurement error (i.e.&#xD;
        there was no abnormal result of this test in the recent history of the patient and there is&#xD;
        no related clinical sign) or the result of a temporary and reversible medical condition,&#xD;
        once that condition is resolved].&#xD;

&#xD;
        Note: Patients whose Regulatory Authority (RA)/Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) is managed&#xD;
        by these medications should not be considered for participation in the current study unless&#xD;
        change in RA/CTD medication is medically indicated.&#xD;
