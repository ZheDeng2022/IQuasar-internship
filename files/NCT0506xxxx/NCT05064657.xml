  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of two different distraction methods on&#xD;
      reducing pain and fear during blood collection from children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted between January 2020 and May 2021.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a pretest-posttest, parallel group randomized controlled experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: The pain and fear mean scores of the intervention group, in which the distraction method&#xD;
      (ball squeezing and blowing bubbles) was applied during the blood collection process, was not&#xD;
      different from the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out with the participation of 111 children aged 6-12 years and their&#xD;
      parents, who underwent blood collection in the emergency department of a state hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children were randomly assigned to blowing bubbles (n:37), ball squeezing (n:37) and control&#xD;
      (n:37) groups. Bubble blowing and ball squeezing methods were used to distract attention&#xD;
      during the blood collection process. Data were collected with Child and Family Information&#xD;
      Form, Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale, Child Fear Scale. Pretest and posttest measurements were&#xD;
      recorded separately by the child, parent and researcher. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square&#xD;
      test, one-way analysis of variance, Tamhane's T2 test, t test for dependent groups were used&#xD;
      in the analysis of the data. The statistical significance of the results was taken as p&lt;0,05&#xD;

    <description>Wong-Baker Pain Faces Scale is widely used with people ages three and older, not limited to children. This self-assessment tool must be understood by the patient, so they are able to choose the face that best illustrates the physical pain they are experiencing. It is a tool to be used by a third person, parents, healthcare professionals, or caregivers, to assess the patient's pain. The scale is 0-10 scale. The six illustrated faces on the cards show a range of emotions, from a smiling face (0 'no pain) to a crying face (10 &quot;worst pain&quot;). 0 indicates no pain, 10 indicates the most severe pain. It defines the child's pain level before and after the blood collection.</description>

    <measure>Children's Fear Scale mean score</measure>
    <time_frame>First ten minute</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Fear Scale is a scale of 0-4 showing five faces ranging from a neutral expression (0 = no concern) to the feared face (4 = severe anxiety). A score of 0 indicates no fear and a score of 4 indicates extremely fearful. Defines the change of fear level before and after during the blood collection.</description>
