  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple dose, single fixed-sequence, 2-period study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of caffeine, efavirenz and&#xD;
      omeprazole in healthy adult participants. A total of approximately 13 healthy male and/or&#xD;
      female participants will be enrolled in the study to obtain at least 12 evaluable&#xD;
      participants who complete the study. Participants who withdraw from the study or are&#xD;
      considered non-evaluable may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor. Participants will&#xD;
      be screened within 28 days of the first dose of study intervention. Participants will have a&#xD;
      phone contact 3 days prior to Day 1 dosing (Day -3) in Period 1 as a reminder to abstain from&#xD;
      caffeine-containing products. Participants will be admitted to the clinical research unit&#xD;
      (CRU) at least 24 hours prior to Day 1 dosing (Day 1) in Period 1. Participants will remain&#xD;
      in the CRU for a total of 15 days and 14 nights. Participants will have a telephone contact&#xD;
      between 28-35 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product.&#xD;
