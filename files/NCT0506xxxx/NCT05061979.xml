  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to learn how a new contrast agent for magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) called BAY1747846 moves into, through and out of the body (pharmacokinetics)&#xD;
      after injection in participants with normal and impaired renal function. Impaired renal&#xD;
      function is a condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAY1747846 belongs to the class gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). The way the body&#xD;
      removes GBCAs including BAY1747846 from the blood is through the kidneys. So, when the&#xD;
      kidneys are not working normally, it takes longer to remove BAY1747846 out of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in this study will either have normal renal function, or will have mild or&#xD;
      moderate impaired renal function. The participants will receive BAY1747846 one time through a&#xD;
      needle into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the participants will visit the study site about 6 times. The participants&#xD;
      will stay at the study site for up to 9 days. Each participant will be in the study for up to&#xD;
      7 months. During the study, the doctors will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the participants' overall health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the participants about what medications they are taking and what adverse events they&#xD;
           are having An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a&#xD;
           study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do&#xD;
           not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments.&#xD;
