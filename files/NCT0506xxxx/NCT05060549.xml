    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a common condition that can cause significant disability and risk for&#xD;
      suicide. Second generation antipsychotic medications can be used to treat depression in&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, yet we do not know how they work. Here, we will use a recently approved&#xD;
      medication, cariprazine (Vraylar), to treat participants with bipolar depression. They will&#xD;
      have brain imaging with PET scans before and during treatment to understand how the&#xD;
      medication may be working. Particularly, we will look at the role of the D3 dopamine&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a common and disabling condition with a high rate of suicide. The&#xD;
      depressed phase of the disorder accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality. Only four&#xD;
      medications are FDA approved to treat bipolar depression. They all include a second&#xD;
      generation antipsychotic (SGA), yet the antidepressant mechanism of SGA's is unknown. Not all&#xD;
      bipolar patients respond to these treatments, and they can have problematic side effects.&#xD;
      There is therefore a great need to understand these medications' antidepressant mechanism of&#xD;
      action in order to design more effective treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an exploratory occupancy study with cariprazine (Vraylar) in unmedicated&#xD;
      participants with bipolar depression (n=8). Participants will have [11C]-(+)-PHNO scans&#xD;
      before treatment starts, after three weeks of cariprazine, and after six weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to two dose groups, 1.5 mg daily (n=4) and 3 mg daily (n=4). These are&#xD;
      typical doses of the medication for bipolar depression. Serum levels of cariprazine will be&#xD;
      measured at each PET scan.&#xD;

             defined as not achieving at least partial remission after an adequate dose of&#xD;
             medications for at least four weeks. Fluoxetine will not be allowed due to its long&#xD;
             half-life. Patients will be able to continue to take other mood stabilizer medications&#xD;
