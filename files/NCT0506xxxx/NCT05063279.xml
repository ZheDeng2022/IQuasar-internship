  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is an age-related gradual loss of muscle mass and strength and is associated with&#xD;
      physical disability and mortality risk. Currently, the most promising remedy for preventing&#xD;
      and treating sarcopenia is physical activity, particularly progressive resistance training.&#xD;
      Yet, the amount of resistance exercise needed to achieve optimal benefits remains largely&#xD;
      unknown. This lack of knowledge is underpinned by the notion that aging reduces the ability&#xD;
      to adapt to (and benefit from) resistance training, and is further complicated by a relative&#xD;
      large degrees of between-subject heterogeneity. The primary aim of the study is to compare&#xD;
      the effects of 10 weeks of resistance training with low- and moderate volume (one vs. three&#xD;
      sets per exercise) on muscle mass accretion in lower and upper body extremities in young (&lt;30&#xD;
      years of age) and elderly individuals (&gt;70 years of age). Specifically, the study addresses&#xD;
      the hypothesis that elderly individuals will benefit more from higher exercise volume&#xD;
      (moderate vs. low) compared to their young counterparts. In addition, the study aims to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of the two volume conditions for altering other characteristics such as&#xD;
      muscle strength and biology, including assessment of associations between individual changes&#xD;
      in muscle mass, strength and biology (e.g. the relationship between muscle mass accretion and&#xD;
      muscle content of rRNA/rDNA), and also to investigate the general health effects of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
