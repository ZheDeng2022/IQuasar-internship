      Most of the methods involved in the treatment of BV include antibiotics. Some of the&#xD;
      antibiotics used for this include metronidazole, clindamycin and fluconazole. The antibiotics&#xD;
      inhibit the growth of anaerobes that support G. vaginalis and other microbes without&#xD;
      affecting lactobacilli. This leads to the treatment of BV while also preventing its&#xD;
      recurrence. However, the use of antibiotics may lead to antibiotic resistance and cause&#xD;
      various side-effects such as thrush, dizziness, rash, nausea, etc. In the case of many&#xD;
      antibiotics, the cure rates were incredibly poor and the BV recurrence rates reached as high&#xD;
      as 80 %. Probiotic therapy has slowly been replacing antibiotics for the treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of BV and other infections. These probiotics usually contain lactobacilli and help&#xD;
      maintain a healthy vaginal environment. They can either be consumed through curd and other&#xD;
      milk products that contain probiotics (mostly lactobacilli) or they can be used in the form&#xD;
      of suppositories that are placed in the vagina. In probiotics containing lactobacilli, the&#xD;
      lactic acid produced by the bacteria lowers the vaginal pH to the ideal range of 3.5 to 4.5&#xD;
      and prevents infection recurrence. Lactobacilli containing suppositories have been&#xD;
      successfully used in the past to treat BV, being marketed as a safe and effective way to&#xD;
      prevent and treat infections for women in various stages of their lives.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The vaginal microbiome is said to be the first line of defence against vaginal infection, due&#xD;
      to competitive exclusion and the destruction of pathogenic microbes. The vagina remains&#xD;
      relatively sterile until a woman reaches puberty, after which the hormonal changes cause the&#xD;
      colonization of lactobacilli in the vaginal environment. Any alterations in the microbiota&#xD;
      are seen to cause symptomatic conditions. These conditions may include bacterial vaginosis&#xD;
      (BV), vaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis. The reduction in circulating hormone levels in&#xD;
      older women as they near menopause triggers various physiological changes in the vagina.&#xD;
      Vulvovaginal atrophy, dryness, itchiness, redness, loss of elasticity, inflammation and&#xD;
      atypical secretions are some of the changes that occur in the vagina as estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone levels decrease in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned reduction in hormone levels would also lead to a decline in the&#xD;
      concentration of lactobacilli in the vaginal environment. The lactobacilli produce lactic&#xD;
      acid, which creates an acidic vaginal environment conducive to the growth of lactobacilli,&#xD;
      while preventing the growth of other anaerobic bacterial species. The dominant lactobacilli&#xD;
      also prevent the binding of other bacteria to the epithelial cells and the lactic acid&#xD;
      produced by lactobacilli blocks histone deacetylases, thereby enhancing gene transcription&#xD;
      and DNA repair within their cells. Moreover, the lactobacilli also inhibit the induction of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines while promoting homeostasis. Some of the species from the&#xD;
      Lactobacilli genus that have been identified as residents of the vaginal environment include&#xD;
      L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. iners, and L. jensenii Therefore, it is seen that women who&#xD;
      experience lowering of hormone levels i.e. as they approach menopause, the chances of&#xD;
      contracting vaginal infection increases due to the lower concentrations of lactobacilli.&#xD;
      Bacteria such as Gardnerella, Atopobium, Mobiluncus, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Ureaplasma&#xD;
      and Megasphaera, which were previously left dormant due to the lactobacilli, may increase in&#xD;
      concentration and increase the susceptibility of these women to contract infections such as&#xD;
      bacterial vaginosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial vaginosis is usually caused by the overabundance of G. vaginalis and other&#xD;
      anaerobes, and can be clinically diagnosed using the Amsel criteria. This technique requires&#xD;
      at least three positive findings of the four diagnostic criteria: a fishy odor after a 10%&#xD;
      potassium hydroxide test for vaginal secretion, the presence of non-inflammatory vaginal&#xD;
      discharge, clue cells on microscopic examination, and vaginal fluid pH &gt; 4.5. The nugent&#xD;
      score is also a well-validated technique to diagnose BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the safety and efficacy of the vaginal suppository VagiBIOM will be studied in&#xD;
      aging women with BV infection. The effect of the suppository on vaginal pH and the&#xD;
      physiological changes in the vagina will be examined, along with its impact on vaginal&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
