  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a longer-term follow-up study for patients who have been administered AAV2hAQP1&#xD;
      in the Phase 1 Open-Label, Dose Escalation Study to Determine the Optimal Dose, Safety, and&#xD;
      Activity in Subjects with Radiation Induced Parotid Gland Hypofunction and Xerostomia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to assess the long-term safety and activity of intra-parotid&#xD;
      administration of AAV2hAQP1 in subjects with radiation-induced parotid salivary hypofunction&#xD;
      and xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of their Month 12 Follow-Up visit in Study MGT016, subjects will be invited&#xD;
      to enroll in this 4 year follow-up study during which they will be assessed for up to 60&#xD;
      months following study drug administration. This follow-up trial is a non-interventional&#xD;
      study designed to collect data on longer-term safety and activity at 24, 36, 48, and 60&#xD;
      months following study drug administration (for a total of 4 visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the study, subjects will undergo physical and oral examinations; vital&#xD;
      sign measurements; weight measurements; AE assessments; concurrent medication assessments;&#xD;
      sample blood collection for hematology and chemistry; urinalysis; 12-lead ECGs; ear, nose,&#xD;
      and throat (ENT) screening for malignancy; imaging assessments (if indicated); salivary flow&#xD;
      assessments; and questionnaire assessments.&#xD;

This first part of this questionnaire asks the patient to evaluate how limited they are in daily activities due to dry mouth, relative to before treatment as better, worse, or the same. If better or worse, the patient is asked to rate the magnitude of change, on a scale of 1-7, with a higher score being a better outcome.</description>
