  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugammadex may prevent residual neuromuscular blockade by providing rapid reversal at the end&#xD;
      of the operation. Our goal is to compare the half-dose use of sugammadex for reversing&#xD;
      residual blockade after administration of neostigmine and atropine to the routine use of&#xD;
      reversal medication.&#xD;

      Background: Postoperative residual neuromuscular block (PONB) may be observed in patients in&#xD;
      the recovery room after surgery, and this event causes significant adverse events such as&#xD;
      respiratory muscle weakness, decreased tidal volumes causing hypoxemia, reintubation,&#xD;
      prolonged mechanical ventilation, and possible risk for a cardiopulmonary arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: The study investigators hypothesized to investigate the effects of the half-dose use of&#xD;
      sugammadex for reversing residual blockade after administration of neostigmine and atropine&#xD;
      and compare these results to the routine full-dose use neostigmine and atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators planned to perform a prospective, single-blinded, randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators enrolled patients undergoing lower abdominal tumor resection surgery under&#xD;
      general anesthesia who fulfill our inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is single-blinded because the anesthesia resident, anesthesia technician, and&#xD;
      anesthesia personnel, including the data collector, were blinded to the randomization. The&#xD;
      supervising anesthesiologist was also a data collector, and she was not blinded to the study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization into two groups required the use of a computer system. The study&#xD;
      investigators performed a random allocation sequence by the use of randomized block design&#xD;
      codes that are generated from a computer. Afterward, the study investigators opened an opaque&#xD;
      and sealed envelope that contained the generated codes and randomly divided patients into two&#xD;
      groups. During this process, they made sure that all study personnel was blinded to the&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators divide patients into two groups after the randomization process, and&#xD;
      the groups are as follows: The first group of 48 patients is called Group N. In this group of&#xD;
      patients, and we administer intravenous neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg in a&#xD;
      single syringe before extubation. The second group of 50 patients is called Group N+S. In&#xD;
      Group N+S, the study investigators administered the standard reversal medications of&#xD;
      intravenous neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg. Three minutes later, the study&#xD;
      'investigators administered an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg sugammadex in a different&#xD;
      syringe prepared earlier as a reversal agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Measurement of Parameters. The patients require general anesthesia induction with&#xD;
      an intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking age, rocuronium, at a dose of 0.06 mg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia and before administration of rocuronium, the investigators&#xD;
      monitored train-of-four (TOF) counts using a monitoring device of neuromuscular blockade at&#xD;
      the patient's ulnar nerve. For this purpose, they placed two surface electrodes above the&#xD;
      ulnar nerve near the wrist. To monitor the nerve stimuli at the adductor pollicis muscle&#xD;
      using acceleromyography (TOF Watch SX, Schering-Plough Ireland, Dublin, Ireland). After&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia, the TOF Watch device provided 50-Hz tetanic stimulation for&#xD;
      5 seconds, and one minute after this tetanic stimulation, it offered a train-of-four (TOF)&#xD;
      stimulation. Depending on the TOF-watch-related parameters, they decided to administer&#xD;
      rocuronium, the neuromuscular agent, or not. At the end of the surgery, all anesthetics&#xD;
      needed to be discontinued, including inhalational agents who were sevoflurane and nitrous&#xD;
      oxide. Once the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane reached a 0.4-0.6% level, the&#xD;
      investigators administered the previously randomized reversal study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the administration of the reversal agents, there was a need for a TOF count of 2 observed&#xD;
      in the TOF Watch device. A TOF count of 2 in TOF Watch monitoring provided information of a&#xD;
      shallow neuromuscular block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Collected Parameters. They observed the clinical signs of recovery using several&#xD;
      parameters. These parameters are level of consciousness, head-lift test, ability to sustain&#xD;
      head lift, general muscle weakness, laryngospasm, and desaturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators collected the periods between the last dose of intravenous rocuronium&#xD;
      and administering a reversal agent, administering a reversal agent to extubation, and&#xD;
      administering a reversal agent to operating room discharge. These periods were in minutes.&#xD;
      They also collected the recovery periods between the start of helping reversal agent to the&#xD;
      recovery of TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 to 0.7 and TOF ratio ≥ 0.9, which were in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They collected hemodynamical data, including; noninvasive mean arterial pressure, heart rate&#xD;
      measurements, and peripheral oxygen saturation values before and subsequently at 2, 5, 10,&#xD;
      and 30 minutes after administering the reversal drugs and in the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the incidence of a train-of-four (TOF) ratio less than 0.9 at&#xD;
      tracheal extubation. The secondary outcomes were periods between the start of administering&#xD;
      reversal agents and extubation or operating room discharge in minutes to achieve recovery of&#xD;
      TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 to 0.7 and TOF ratio ≥ 0.9.&#xD;
