  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized cross-over study is to investigate how consumption of protein and&#xD;
      fat affects the FGF21 response triggered by sucrose. The hypothesis is that the consumption&#xD;
      of protein, but not fat, will attenuate the FGF21 response triggered by sucrose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory, and in order to investigate mechanisms behind the potential attenuation in the&#xD;
      sucrose-induced FGF21 response after protein consumption, glucose, insulin, glucagon,&#xD;
      triglycerides, amino acids, glicentin and cholecystokinin (CCK) will be assessed before and&#xD;
      after consumption of sucrose, sucrose+protein and sucrose+fat. Furthermore, the association&#xD;
      between the FGF21 response after consumption of sucrose, sucrose + protein and sucrose + fat&#xD;
      and subjective rating of appetite for sweet will also be investigated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Difference in appetite for sweet between the three test days</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in appetite for sweet is measured using visual analog scales (VAS). The VAS consists of a 100 mm horizontal unbroken line with words anchored at each end describing the extremes. The participants respond to the question asked by placing a vertical mark through the horizontal line corresponding to their perceived feeling at that particular time. Appetite for sweet is assessed at time 0 and 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after consuming the test drinks.</description>
