  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot single-armed open-label intervention study of up to 10 individuals with Opioid&#xD;
      Use Disorder (OUD) and serious bacterial infections (SBI) organized into two consecutive&#xD;
      groups of up to 5 individuals each, the investigators will measure addiction outcomes and the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of adding Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a&#xD;
      promising mind-body therapy to gold standard in-hospital addiction consultation among&#xD;
      hospitalized individuals with OUD-SBI in advance of a planned two-arm pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot single-arm intervention study of up to 10 people with&#xD;
      OUD and SBI. Participants will be enrolled during a hospitalization and receive brief&#xD;
      mindfulness training individually in person in the hospital and 8 subsequent sessions of&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) delivered in small groups of up to 5 people.&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of an in-person brief mindfulness training prior to discharge&#xD;
      from Massachusetts General Hospital and 8 one-hour group MORE trainings sessions delivered&#xD;
      live by a trained addiction social worker over a Zoom telehealth platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will achieve 2 specific aims. Aim 1 is to quantitatively assess addiction&#xD;
      severity, pain, and psychological distress over 12 weeks among people with opioid use&#xD;
      disorder and serious bacterial infections receiving manualized Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery&#xD;
      Enhancement (MORE) mind-body therapy. Hypothesis 1 is that the receipt of MORE will be&#xD;
      associated with decreased addiction severity, pain, and psychological distress among enrolled&#xD;
      participants at the end of 12 weeks. Aim 2 is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      conducting a pilot RCT of MORE delivered to people with opioid use disorder and serious&#xD;
      bacterial infections. Hypothesis 2 is that more than 50% percent of eligible patients will&#xD;
      enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained clinical research coordinator (CRC) will attend Addiction Consult Team (ACT) rounds&#xD;
      3 days per week to identify eligible inpatients for this study. Study staff will screen&#xD;
      electronic health records (EHR) to confirm eligibility and ask a member of ACT clinical team&#xD;
      about the person's suitability to participate given that exclusion criterion may not be known&#xD;
      given EHR screening and ACT rounds alone. If the ACT clinician agrees that the participant&#xD;
      meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, the ACT clinician&#xD;
      will provide the patient with an information sheet about the study. The ACT clinician will&#xD;
      then inform the study CRC that the patient has received a brief introduction to the study and&#xD;
      is ready to be approached in the hospital using COVID-19 compliant procedures to initiate the&#xD;
      consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving the brief mindfulness intervention, enrolled participants will receive and&#xD;
      complete a series of quantitative baseline questionnaires (e.g., demographic and substance&#xD;
      use history, treatment history) administered by the CRC. These visits will take place in the&#xD;
      patient's hospital room (or another private room on the patient's floor in the hospital). At&#xD;
      this time, the CRC will also conduct a semi-structured, audio-recorded, qualitative interview&#xD;
      with participants. Study outcomes will be assessed in-person at baseline and via mobile phone&#xD;
      at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-week follow-up time points. Upon completion of the intervention and the&#xD;
      12-week follow-up surveys, participants will be asked to complete a 45-60 minute individual&#xD;
      exit interview. Informed by an embedded contextual mixed-methods approach, the invesitgators&#xD;
      will also conduct qualitative interviews to better understand why, how, and under what&#xD;
      circumstances participants may have achieved reductions in addiction severity in response to&#xD;
      MORE.&#xD;
