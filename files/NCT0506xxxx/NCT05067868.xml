    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical (study) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (study) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (study) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to study product or not) that at any dose results in death, life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality or birth defect, an important medical event.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</measure>

    <description>AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with study or use of investigational drug product (IP), whether or not the AE is considered related to IP. TEAEs: AEs occurring or worsening at or after first dose of IP or ongoing at time of enrollment. SAE :untoward medical occurrence that at any dose met one, more of the following criteria: results in death, life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent, significant disability/incapacity, a congenital abnormality/birth defect, an important medical event. Severity: Mild: event that does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living; Moderate: event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort, permanent risk of harm; Severe: AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.</description>

    <description>SF-36 is a generic quality-of-life instrument that has been widely used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) of participants. SF-36 consist of 36 items that are aggregated into 8 multi-item scales (physical functioning [1=yes, limited a lot to 3=no, not limited at all], role-physical [1=all of the time to 5=none of the time], bodily pain [1=very severe to 6=none], general health [1=poor to 5=excellent], vitality [1=none of the time to 5=all of the time], social functioning [1=all of the time: to 5=none of the time], role emotional [1=all of the time to 5=none of the time] and mental health [1=all of the time to 5=none of the time]). Four domains comprised physical component summary (PCS) score (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health) and remaining 4 domains comprised mental component summary (MCS) score (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health). The scores ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicating better HRQL.</description>
