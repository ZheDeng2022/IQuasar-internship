    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide continuous access to treatment with bintrafusp alfa for&#xD;
      eligible participants from ongoing bintrafusp alfa parent studies (NCT02517398, NCT03840902,&#xD;
      NCT02699515, NCT04246489, NCT04489940, NCT03840915, NCT03631706, NCT04551950, NCT03833661 and&#xD;
      NCT04066491) and to collect long-term safety and efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: All participants in this rollover study will be treated with bintrafusp alfa&#xD;
      until meeting defined criteria in the protocol for discontinuation, until study intervention&#xD;
      is commercially accessible and provisioned via marketed product, or until end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also includes a 5 years survival follow-up after last dose of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Duration: Treatment under the rollover protocol according to the interval and&#xD;
      dosing schedule in the parent protocol until discontinuation.&#xD;

    <description>Participants who are continuing treatment with bintrafusp alfa and were previously assigned to a bintrafusp alfa dose based on body weight which is (i.e.) milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) per dose in a parent protocol, will receive an intravenous infusion of bintrafusp alfa at the dose specified based upon the participant's parent protocol once every 2 week or, 2400 mg once every 3 weeks. Participants who are entering the rollover study after discontinuation of treatment in a parent study will receive bintrafusp alfa at a dose of either 1200 or 2400 mg once every 2 weeks or 2400 mg once every 3 weeks until confirmed disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or study withdrawal.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are currently enrolled in an eligible bintrafusp alfa parent study&#xD;
             where the primary/main analysis has been completed or after discontinuation of study&#xD;
             before primary/main analysis has been completed or after discontinuation of study&#xD;
             before primary/main analysis has been completed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are currently on active bintrafusp alfa treatment alone as a&#xD;
             monotherapy or following discontinuation of other combination treatment agents in the&#xD;
             parent study and without treatment interruption at the time of rollover study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who experienced a confirmed complete response (CR), partial response&#xD;
             (PR), or stable disease (SD) in an eligible parent study, discontinued bintrafusp alfa&#xD;
             treatment according to the parent study protocol, and subsequently developed disease&#xD;
             progression and are willing to re-start bintrafusp alfa treatment deemed potentially&#xD;
             beneficial by the participants' physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are.discontinued from bintrafusp alfa treatment in an eligible parent&#xD;
             study due to an adverse events (AEs) that was subsequently well controlled or&#xD;
             completely resolved after stopping therapy, provided that the parent study protocol&#xD;
             permits reinitiation of bintrafusp alfa if a participant discontinued treatment due to&#xD;
             toxicity and these participants are willing to re-start bintrafusp alfa treatment&#xD;
             deemed potentially beneficial by the participants' physicians. Participants who have&#xD;
             had AEs requiring permanent treatment discontinuation, like certain immune-related&#xD;
             adverse events (irAEs) or certain bleeding events are excluded from participation in&#xD;
             this Rollover study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with only SD at the time of discontinuation, the Investigator should&#xD;
             confirm that no other reasonable treatment options are available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have completed End of treatment (EoT) assessment of a parent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigator confirms that each participant agrees to use appropriate&#xD;
             contraception and barriers, if applicable. The contraception, barrier, and pregnancy&#xD;
             testing requirements are below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female participants of childbearing potential or for male participants who have&#xD;
             female partners of childbearing potential, the following applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants on active treatment must agree to continue to use highly effective&#xD;
             contraception for both male and female participants if the risk of conception exists&#xD;
             thus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective&#xD;
             contraception as stipulated in national or local guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Highly effective contraception must be used 28 days prior to the first study&#xD;
             intervention administration, for the duration of study intervention, and at least for&#xD;
             2 months (for female participants) or 4 months (for male participants) after stopping&#xD;
             study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, the treating physician should be informed immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are pregnant or currently in lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known hypersensitivity to any of the study intervention ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants reinitiating treatment with bintrafusp alfa at study entry: have received&#xD;
             any systemic anticancer therapies/treatments since discontinuing bintrafusp alfa&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who has withdrawn consent from the parent study for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes the participant&#xD;
             from participating in the study&#xD;
