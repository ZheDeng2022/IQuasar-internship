      The aims of this study are to evaluate if an intensified adjuvant treatment with FOLFOXIRI&#xD;
      could increase the rate of cases with undetectable ct-DNA after chemotherapy and to evaluate&#xD;
      if a further adjuvant treatment with Trifluridine/Tipiracil could increase the rate of cases&#xD;
      with undetectable ct-DNA and therefore improve DFS in a population at high-risk of relapse.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentre study, including two phase II randomized&#xD;
      trials. In Part 1 resected stage III and high-risk stage II colon cancer patients with&#xD;
      positive ct- DNA after surgery will be randomized to receive FOLFOX for 12 cycles or CAPOX&#xD;
      for 8 cycles (at investigator choice) versus FOLFOXIRI for 12 cycles; In Part 2 resected&#xD;
      stage III and high-risk stage II colon cancer patients with positive ct- DNA after the end of&#xD;
      a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy - either in the frame or outside of&#xD;
      Part 1 - will be randomized to receive observation or Trifluridine/Tipiracil for 6 cycles.&#xD;
