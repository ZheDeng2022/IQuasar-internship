  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More people are living with chronic or long-term disorders together and they live longer,&#xD;
      which gives an increase in patients who need health services. Seen in the context of the&#xD;
      shorter lengths of stay, and the outpatient clinics' increasing responsibility, there is a&#xD;
      need to increase outpatient capacity without leading to more patient readmissions. Further,&#xD;
      new services should take into account the patients capacity to benefit from the services, and&#xD;
      their level of health literacy is crucial. By developing new services using technology,&#xD;
      patients will be able to be followed up closely in their own home with adapted treatment and&#xD;
      information, a closer dialogue with the health service where there is a need, and the&#xD;
      utilization of scarce resources in the health care system can increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate a digital outpatient clinic, and assess any&#xD;
      differences over time in health literacy, digital health literacy, quality of life and&#xD;
      overall satisfaction with the outpatient services. Furthermore, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      the intervention group's satisfaction with the digital outpatient clinic. In addition, the&#xD;
      digital services will be tailored and revised throughout the study based on continuous&#xD;
      feedback and iterative processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a pragmatic controlled multicenter study with two study arms; one&#xD;
      control arm and one intervention arm. In total, eligible participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      one of four centers.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The HLQ is a standardized measure of health literacy, and the investigators will apply five of the nine domains; 1 Feeling understood and supported by healthcare providers; 2 Having sufficient information to manage my health; 3 Actively managing my health; 6 Ability to actively engage with healthcare providers; and 9 Understanding health information well enough to know what to do. the HLQ is is translated and validated in Norwegian.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Digital health literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will apply the eHLQ to measure level of digital health literacy. The eHLQ contains 35 items summarized in seven domains: 1) using technology to process health information, 2) understanding of health concepts and language, 3) ability to actively engage with digital services, 4) feel safe and in control, 5) motivated to engage with digital services, 6) access to digital services that work, and 7) digital services that suit individual needs. Higher scores indicate better digital health literacy. Domains 1-5 consist of 5 items, domain 6 consists of 6 items, and domain 7 consists of 4 items.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Health/ quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the patient reported health or quality of life the investigators will use the 12-Item Short Form Survey from the RAND Medical Outcomes Study (RAND-12) (Ware et al. 1996). The items summarizes into two scales; mental component score and Physical component score. Higher scores indicate better health, and the instruments is translated and validated in Norwegian.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the participants self-perceived safety in the pandemic the investigators will apply the item: &quot;How anxious are you to be infected with Covid-19 (corona)?&quot; with responses on a 5 point Likert scale from &quot;Not anxious&quot; to &quot;Very anxious&quot; .</description>

    <description>The Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ) is an instrument that can be used to measure user beliefs about the acceptability of digital services, and has the ability to discriminate and predict individual differences in beliefs and behaviour.&#xD;
