      OBJECTİVE The world population is getting older. The most common condition in the aging&#xD;
      population is comorbidity, which is a combination of more than one chronic disease or&#xD;
      condition. Contrary to the traditional view that specific symptoms are characteristic of a&#xD;
      single disease, the coexistence of multiple diseases and other age-related conditions in&#xD;
      elderly individuals leads to what is defined as geriatric syndromes. Geriatric syndromes are&#xD;
      quite common in the elderly population and are associated with poor quality of life, adverse&#xD;
      health status, and increased cost. Physicians who more frequently care and manage patients&#xD;
      with comorbid diseases and geriatric syndrome can cope better with these conditions when&#xD;
      faced with them. It is known that the frequency of comorbidity and geriatric syndrome&#xD;
      increases especially in the elderly. However, in the oldest age group, which is showing the&#xD;
      fastest increase in population, these rates are not clearly known. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to shed light on the management of elderly patients by identifying geriatric syndromes and&#xD;
      comorbidity prevalence, as well as chronic diseases and common geriatric syndromes, in&#xD;
      patients 90 years of age and older who applied to the geriatric outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD Data of patients 90 years and older who applied to the geriatric outpatient clinic&#xD;
      between November 2016 and January 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The drugs used by the&#xD;
      patients with their demographic characteristics such as age, gender, chronic diseases and&#xD;
      geriatric syndromes were gathered. The drugs used were also obtained from the&#xD;
      hospital-registered files and through the E-Pulse health system. Diabetes mellitus (DM),&#xD;
      hypertension (HT), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cerebrovascular occlusion (CVO), chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) were recorded as chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, delirium, depression, fall,&#xD;
      incontinence, malnutrition, sleep disorders, polypharmacy, and fall were recorded as&#xD;
      geriatric syndrome. The modified Charlson comorbidity index was used to calculate the&#xD;
      comorbidity index.&#xD;
