  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided blockage of the erector plane of the spine (known as ESP BLOCK) is a&#xD;
      recently described block and a very useful strategy in the perioperative period as it&#xD;
      provides effective analgesia in thoracic surgery. Ultrasound-guided type II pectoral nerve&#xD;
      block (internationally known by the acronym Pecs II block) is a very useful strategy in the&#xD;
      perioperative period because it provides effective analgesia in breast surgeries and can&#xD;
      optimize results. The aim of this study is to assess perioperative pain in mastectomies. This&#xD;
      is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study that will compare the effects of spinal&#xD;
      erector plane block versus pectoral nerve block in patients scheduled for mastectomy. The ESP&#xD;
      group will receive balanced general anesthesia associated with ESP BLOCK with 0.5%&#xD;
      ropivacaine guided by ultrasound. The Pecs II group will receive balanced general anesthesia&#xD;
      associated with Pecs II block with 0.5% ropivacaine guided by USG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The integration of ultrasound with anesthesia allowed for greater safety and risk reduction&#xD;
      in regional anesthesia, in addition to the possibility of creating new peripheral blocks that&#xD;
      contribute to multimodal analgesia, providing greater comfort for patients in the&#xD;
      postoperative period. The spinal erector plane block (ESP Block) and type II pectoral nerve&#xD;
      block (PECS II block) emerge as yet another analgesia strategy for breast surgeries, as they&#xD;
      are less invasive than thoracic epidural anesthesia and paravertebral block thoracic,&#xD;
      reducing the risk of complications. The ESP Block was initially described for analgesia in&#xD;
      chest surgery and for the management of chronic chest pain. PECS II block was inspired by the&#xD;
      infraclavicular approach, and aims at anesthesia of the lateral and medial pectoral nerves,&#xD;
      intercostobrachial, 4th, 5th and 6th intercostal nerves and the long thoracic nerves. Both&#xD;
      are technically simple and easily reproducible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both are safe techniques, easy to reproduce, have a low risk of complications and allow good&#xD;
      control of acute perioperative pain. Therefore, our study has as primary objective to compare&#xD;
      the quality of perioperative analgesia offered by ESP Block versus PECS II block by&#xD;
      intraoperative opioid consumption in oncologic mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study carried out in our service indicated the superiority of PECS II block over ESP&#xD;
      block in relation to intraoperative opioid consumption. The proposal is therefore a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, single-blind, superiority study to compare the hypothesis that PECS&#xD;
      II is superior to ESP block in oncological mastectomy performed at Hospital de Base do&#xD;
      Distrito Federal, Brasília, DF, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomized 1:1 by a previously generated random list&#xD;
      (https://www.randomizer.org). The allocation sequence was kept inaccessible to all&#xD;
      investigators during recruitment and treatment. The researcher responsible for the&#xD;
      postoperative period, the surgical team and the patients were not aware of the allocated&#xD;
      groups. The researcher responsible for the randomization list communicated the researcher&#xD;
      responsible for performing the ESP or PECS II block and conducting the anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival in the operating room, all patients will receive standard monitoring with&#xD;
      cardioscopy, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and temperature. After venoclysis of&#xD;
      the contralateral upper limb to surgery, all patients will receive 0.05 mg/kg intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) midazolam, 1mcg/kg fentanyl for anxiolysis, and IV dexamethasone 4 mg. After anxiolysis,&#xD;
      blockade will be performed according to the group to which the patient was previously&#xD;
      allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive general anesthesia, which will be performed with intravenous&#xD;
      induction of fentanyl, lidocaine, propofol and rocuronium at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane (approximately 1 to 1.5&#xD;
      minimal alveolar concentration expired fraction, to maintain a bispectral index between 40&#xD;
      and 60). Increases of more than 20% of baseline systolic blood pressure will be interpreted&#xD;
      as pain and increments of 1 mcg/kg of fentanyl will be made with each episode, judiciously&#xD;
      endorsed by two examiners. Reductions of more than 20% of the systolic arterial pressure or&#xD;
      less than 90 mmHg will be treated with ephedrine 5 to 10 mg. Heart rate reductions below 50&#xD;
      bpm associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure will be treated with 0.5-1 mg&#xD;
      atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sedoanalgesia has been performed, patients allocated to the ESP BLOCK group will&#xD;
      receive antisepsis with 70% alcohol at the block puncture site on the ipsilateral side to be&#xD;
      operated. Patient will be placed in a seated position with support from assistants. Applied&#xD;
      high frequency linear SonoSite M-Turbo® ultrasound probe, protected with a sterile plastic&#xD;
      cover. Probe apposition in the paravertebral region identifying the transverse process of the&#xD;
      T5 vertebra, the structures of the trapezius, rhomboid and erector spinal muscles, which are&#xD;
      arranged in sonoanatomy in this order from the most superficial to the deepest. Insertion of&#xD;
      the UniPlex NanoLine® 22Gx50mm needle in plane, towards the transverse process of the&#xD;
      vertebra. Viewed the entire path of the needle during puncture. An injection of 30ml of 0.5%&#xD;
      ropivacaine was performed between the transverse process and the erector muscles of the&#xD;
      spine, observing the dispersion of the local anesthetic in this plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing sedoanalgesia, patients allocated to Pecs II group will receive antisepsis&#xD;
      with 70% alcohol at the puncture site of the breast block to be operated. Patient in supine&#xD;
      position with his arm abducted at 90 degrees. Application of a SonoSite M-Turbo® ultrasound&#xD;
      high frequency linear probe, protected with a sterile plastic cover. Apposition of the probe&#xD;
      in the region inferior to the clavicle, deltopectoral sulcus, will identify the pectoral&#xD;
      muscles with the axillary artery and vein that meet at the level of the first rib. Then, the&#xD;
      probe will be displaced distally to the space of the 2nd and 3rd rib, identifying the&#xD;
      structures of the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor and serratus muscles, which are arranged&#xD;
      in the sonoanatomy in this order from the most superficial to the deepest. Insertion of the&#xD;
      UniPlex NanoLine® 22Gx50mm needle in plane. Viewed the entire path of the needle during&#xD;
      puncture. An injection of 10ml of 0.5% ropivacaine will be performed between the pectoralis&#xD;
      major and minor muscles. Progression of the needle to the interfacial plane of the pectoralis&#xD;
      minor and serratus anterior muscles with an injection of 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre, intra and postoperative information will be recorded in a clinical record and&#xD;
      intraoperative values of systolic and mean blood pressure, heart rate, expired sevoflurane&#xD;
      fraction, perioperative side effects (nausea and vomiting), consumption of anesthetics,&#xD;
      analgesics, vasopressors will be recorded , antiemetics, adverse events. Pain will be&#xD;
      assessed by the numerical scale of pain at rest and under exertion (END, ranging from 0 to&#xD;
      10, zero being verified when the patient is without pain and ten, with maximum or unbearable&#xD;
      pain) at arrival and discharge of the post-anesthesia care unit, 12 hours and 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. Rescue medications will be noted in the amount and time of the first dose requested,&#xD;
      if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 24 hours after surgery, patients who present moderate pain (above 2 by END)&#xD;
      will receive as their first analgesic 1g intravenous Dipyrone, every 6 hours. As a second&#xD;
      analgesic, in case of persistent pain, tramadol 100mg intravenously, every 6 hours. Patients&#xD;
      who experience nausea and/or vomiting will receive 8 mg intravenous ondansetron every 8&#xD;
      hours. The occurrence of adverse events, the length of stay in the PACU and the length of&#xD;
      hospital stay will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital discharge, in the sixth month after surgery, patients were interviewed using a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire. Specifically, an investigator blinded to treatment allocation&#xD;
      assessed patient-reported outcomes over the telephone. To determine the prevalence of chronic&#xD;
      pain, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; dichotomous questions were used. In case of a positive response, patients&#xD;
      were asked to provide detailed information about pain and/or discomfort. Participants then&#xD;
      completed the Douler Neuropathique 4 (DN4) questionnaire and the Short Form McGill Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from our previous trial and a pilot study involving 26 participants, we&#xD;
      estimated that the proportion of patients consuming fentanyl would be approximately 30% in&#xD;
      the PECS-II group. The pilot study indicated an increased risk of fentanyl consumption among&#xD;
      patients undergoing ESP, whose magnitude was compatible with a relative risk of 2.0. Thus,&#xD;
      considering that the proportion of participants using tramadol would be approximately 60% in&#xD;
      the ESP group, a total of 84 participants (42 per group) yielded 80% power to detect this&#xD;
      difference between groups at an alpha level of 5% (two tails, two-sample proportions test).&#xD;
      The number of participants per group was increased to 92 (46 participants per group) to allow&#xD;
      for a 10% dropout rate.&#xD;
