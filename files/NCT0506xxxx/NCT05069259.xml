  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is expected to contribute to the body of real-world data of tofacitinib's safety&#xD;
      and efficacy profile in ulcerative colitis. Conventional clinical outcomes will give a better&#xD;
      understanding of response and remission rates in a representative, post-marketing population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular patient questionnaires and measurement of a biomarker of gut inflammation will&#xD;
      provide detail on how patients experience induction treatment and contextualise the efficacy&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

    <description>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire remission is defined as an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score ≥ 170.&#xD;
The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire is a 32-item questionnaire grouped into four dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function.
