      This is a multi-center, prospective post-approval clinical Phase IV study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Benvitimod cream, 1% twice daily for the treatment of mild to moderate&#xD;
      stable psoriasis vulgaris in adults. Approximately 2000 adult participants with mild to&#xD;
      moderate stable psoriasis vulgaris will be enrolled and they will use the Benvitimod cream at&#xD;
      the skin with psoriasis for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI scoring system is a widely-used standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis that takes into account the overall severity of erythema (redness), induration (plaque thickness), and scale, and the extent of %Body Surface Area (BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs are each graded on a 5-point scale (0 to 4) and the %BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6) for each of the 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities). The individual scores are multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region; the sum of these scores gives the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. PASI is a static assessment made without reference to previous scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage decline in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant's psoriasis at a given timepoint. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness/elevation as guidelines. Higher PGA scores represent more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Change in percent of total body surface area (%BSA) affected from Baseline to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of %BSA affected is an estimate of the percentage of total involved skin with psoriasis. For the purpose of clinical estimation, the total palmar surface of the participant's palm and digits may be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% BSA. The %BSA affected by psoriasis will be evaluated (from 0% to 100%). %BSA is a static assessment made without reference to previous scores.</description>
