  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our central hypothesis is that patient response to treatment, evaluated by full spectrum of&#xD;
      outcome measures including tumor control, survival, toxicity, and quality of life (QoL), will&#xD;
      correlate with biomarker expressions, which can be tested in the blood, other body fluid,&#xD;
      imaging as well as tumor tissue (if available).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary biomarkers of our interest are those obtained from minimally invasive procedures&#xD;
      and those associated with immune/inflammatory treatment responses such as lymphocyte count,&#xD;
      immune cell subtype distribution, TGF-beta1, immunomodulating interleukins and IDO&#xD;
      metabolites. We will measure the biomarkers pre-, during- and post-anticancer treatment for&#xD;
      hypothesis driven studies, and bank residual biological specimen, in combination with&#xD;
      prospectively collected data including patient/tumor/treatment factors, imaging, tumor&#xD;
      control outcome, treatment toxicity and QOL measures. We will classify the tumor response&#xD;
      according to RECIST criteria and qualify QoL by using the PROMIS grading system and correlate&#xD;
      them with the corresponding biomarkers. This study will serve young investigators who are&#xD;
      interested in biomarker studies for early diagnosis, tumor control outcome and treatment&#xD;
      toxicity/QOL prediction, aiming to guide personalized cancer care in future.&#xD;
