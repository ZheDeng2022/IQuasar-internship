      This trial is a Phase 3 Pivotal, Double-Masked, Randomized, 2-stage, Multicenter Study of the&#xD;
      Efficacy and Safety of OCS-01 Eye Drops in Subjects With Diabetic Macular Edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 will confirm the safety and efficacy of OCS-01 versus Vehicle alone in subjects with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema (DME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCS-01 in subjects with DME.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial outlined here is a randomized, double-masked, Vehicle-controlled clinical study of&#xD;
      OCS-01 in the treatment of DME. The trial will consist of two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive OCS-01 in the study eye 6 times a day for the&#xD;
      first 6 weeks then 3 times a day dosing (TID) for the remaining 6 weeks, or 6 times a day&#xD;
      Vehicle dosing for 6 weeks followed by TID Vehicle dosing for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive the OCS-01 or Vehicle in the dosing regimen from&#xD;
      Stage 1 in the study eye for the first 12 weeks (6 times a day for 6 weeks, TID for 6 weeks),&#xD;
      then both arms will continue at TID dosing through the Week 52 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No subjects from Stage 1 will be enrolled into Stage 2. All treatments will be&#xD;
      self-administered in the study eye only.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a signed informed consent form before any study-specific procedures are&#xD;
             performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be a male or female adult subject age 18-75 years. Race and ethnicity information will&#xD;
             be collected based on National Institutes of Health criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have DME with presence of intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid in the study eye, with&#xD;
             central subfield thickness (CST) of ≥310 µm (may be adjusted based on gender specific&#xD;
             requirements) by SD-OCT at screening (Visit 1) (as assessed by an independent reading&#xD;
             center); CST is not part of the eligibility reconfirmation on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants require BCVA ETDRS letter score &gt;34 letters (&gt; 20/200 Snellen equivalent)&#xD;
             in the non-study eye at screening (ie, as per definition of monocular blindness).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have an BCVA ETDRS letter score ≤ 65 (Snellen 20/50) and ≥ 24 (Snellen 20/320) in the&#xD;
             study eye at screening and baseline (Visit 1 and Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a documented diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and a glycosylated&#xD;
             hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of ≤ 12.0% (≤108 mmol/mol) at Visit 1 (Screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        OCULAR&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have macular edema considered to be because of a cause other than DME; Note: an eye&#xD;
             should not be considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered to be&#xD;
             related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction;(2) clinical exam and/or OCT&#xD;
             suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities disease (eg, a taut posterior&#xD;
             hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of the macular edema, or (3) the&#xD;
             macular edema is considered to be related to another condition such as age-related&#xD;
             macular degeneration, uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, or drug toxicity. If the DME&#xD;
             consists of circumscribed, focal leakage that the evaluating Investigator believes&#xD;
             should be treated with laser and no other treatments, the eye is not eligible to be a&#xD;
             study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a decrease in BCVA because of causes other than DME (eg, foveal atrophy, pigment&#xD;
             abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, previous vitreoretinal surgery, central&#xD;
             serous retinopathy, non-retinal condition, substantial cataract, macular ischemia)&#xD;
             that, in the Investigator's opinion, is likely to be decreasing BCVA by three lines or&#xD;
             more (ie, cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise&#xD;
             normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have significant macular ischemia which would prevent gain in visual acuity in the&#xD;
             study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have any other ocular disease that may cause substantial reduction in BCVA, including,&#xD;
             retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, vitreous hemorrhage or fibrosis involving the&#xD;
             macula in the study eye, ocular inflammation (uveitis), other retinal inflammatory or&#xD;
             infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have active or suspected peri-ocular or ocular infection in the study eye (eg,&#xD;
             blepharitis, keratitis, scleritis, or conjunctivitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a history of non-infectious uveitis in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of herpetic ocular disease in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who plan to continue using contact lenses as a main source of vision&#xD;
             correction during the study in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who plan to use cosmetic contact lenses in the study eye during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of major intraocular ocular surgery within 3 months including cataract surgery&#xD;
             in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
             SYSTEMIC&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participants who are currently enrolled in or have participated in any other clinical&#xD;
             study involving an investigational product (IP) or device, or in any other type of&#xD;
             medical research, within 30 days prior to screening and up to completion of the&#xD;
             current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone) either oral or injectable&#xD;
             are not allowed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The use of acute inhaled corticosteroids is permissible during the study for up to 14&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any prior or concomitant systemic anti-VEGF treatment within 6 months prior to Day 1.&#xD;
