  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a major risk factor for lower limb amputation.&#xD;
      Microvascular reactivity assessed with near-infrared spectrometry has been studied in people&#xD;
      with PAD but not in people with limb loss (PLL) who have PAD. The purpose of this research is&#xD;
      to explore whether near-infrared spectrometry measures can contribute to identifying people&#xD;
      at risk for amputation. Specific aims include: 1) Determine the test-retest reliability of&#xD;
      near-infrared spectrometry measures in people with peripheral artery disease with or without&#xD;
      major unilateral amputation. 2) Determine construct validity of near-infrared spectrometry&#xD;
      measures compared to 6-Minute Walk Test, and time to claudication onset; and self-reported&#xD;
      prosthetic mobility in people with transtibial amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This methodologic prospective study with repeated assessments and long term phone follow-up&#xD;
      every year to identify any subjects that undergo revascularization or amputation will include&#xD;
      2 groups of subjects: a PAD group enrolled from an out-patient walking program, and a PLL+PAD&#xD;
      group who receive no care but have their walking step counts monitored.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects: Subjects with peripheral artery disease (PAD) with or without lower limb amputation&#xD;
      will be recruited from PAD rehabilitation programs or support groups for people with limb&#xD;
      loss (PLL) in the Columbia University Irving Medical Center system and New York City&#xD;
      metropolitan area. Equal numbers (n=10) will be assigned to the people with PAD group and the&#xD;
      PLL plus PAD (PLL+PAD) group. All subjects will be 35-80 years old at risk for amputation as&#xD;
      determined by meeting any of the following criteria. 1) People with peripheral artery disease&#xD;
      diagnosed by ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.9 or 1.4. 2) People who have a history of&#xD;
      endovascular or surgical revascularization for critical ischemia, or 3) People with previous&#xD;
      major or minor unilateral lower limb loss due to PAD, with or without diabetes. Once informed&#xD;
      written consent has been obtained Assessment sessions will depend on group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PLL+PAD group will attend 2 assessment sessions: initial and 1-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments only. The PLL+PAD group will receive no intervention. However, a monitor will be&#xD;
      used to remotely assess their general walking activity. At the end of the initial assessment,&#xD;
      PLL will have daily step count assessed with a StepWatch4 step activity monitor strapped just&#xD;
      above the lateral prosthetic ankle. The average daily step count will be derived from the&#xD;
      last full week of 24- hour/day data collection closest in time to the next assessment, at&#xD;
      which time the StepWatch4 will be removed. Between sessions, subjects will be encouraged to&#xD;
      continue their usual activities; no directions regarding exercise, physical activity, or&#xD;
      walking will be given. Data from the two sessions will be used to determine test-retest&#xD;
      reliability (Aim 1). Near infrared spectrometry measurement data from the 1st session will be&#xD;
      used to determine associations with walking performance measures (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PAD group will attend 3 assessment sessions: initial, 1-month, and 2-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments. The PAD group will already be enrolled in a PAD rehabilitation&#xD;
      program-independent of this research program-that consists of 2-3 times per week 1-hour&#xD;
      sessions. Sessions include progressive treadmill training for 30- minute-including rest&#xD;
      breaks as needed-with inclination added if tolerated. Also included is 30-minutes of calf and&#xD;
      hamstring stretching and general strengthening including free weights for the upper limbs,&#xD;
      cuff weights for the lower limbs, and repeated sit-to-stand and step functional training. The&#xD;
      rehabilitation program consists of 24 sessions over 2 months and the number of sessions&#xD;
      attended will be counted. If subjects opt for an additional 1-month of training session, they&#xD;
      will undergo a 3-month follow-up assessment. Repeated measures data from the PAD group will&#xD;
      be used to determine effect size change of the primary outcome measures (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: All subjects at each session will complete a questionnaire and undergo clinical&#xD;
      assessments. Follow up calls every 6 months will be made to determine medical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire data will include individual characteristics, medical history, and self-report&#xD;
      claudication scale. General health perception will be assessed with SF-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment will occur at each session and include vital signs, ankle brachial index,&#xD;
      near infrared spectrometry during strength and walking assessments. General lower extremity&#xD;
      strength will be assessed with heel raises up to 25 repetitions and the 30-sec sit-to-stand.&#xD;
      Walking performance will be assessed using the 6-Minute Walk Test using a standard 20m&#xD;
      walkway with rests allowed as needed. Walking speed will be obtained from the first 20m.&#xD;
      Clinical assessment of strength and walking are expected to be of moderate intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will include group descriptions, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients for&#xD;
      test-retest reliability, and Pearson correlation coefficients for convergent or divergent&#xD;
      validity between near infrared spectrometry and clinical outcome measures.&#xD;
