  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA have long been acknowledged for their capacity to&#xD;
      counteract inflammatory responses in the human body. Understanding the impact of the dietary&#xD;
      intake of these fatty acids along with others (such as ARA) involved in inflammation is&#xD;
      essential for prevention and treatment of chronic non-communicable diseases as it is obesity&#xD;
      and its comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role that the EPA and DHA play in the inflammatory processes can be understood by&#xD;
      studying the capacity of certain immune cells and their genetic background to respond under&#xD;
      the constant exposure to an adjusted diet in omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids in individuals with&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 80 subjetcs will be invited to be enrolled in a nutrigenomics/nutrigenetics study&#xD;
      approaching the properties of a dietary plan (mild calorie restriction and adjusted at an&#xD;
      omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids ratio of 4:1, and supplemented with fish oil rich in EPA and DHA&#xD;
      or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double blind, randomized, parallel clinical trial will consist in a 12-week intervention&#xD;
      with recurrent visits every 4 weeks. Subjects will be required to follow the dietary plan&#xD;
      provided in a recipee book produced and edited by our research group along with a capsule in&#xD;
      every major meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 12 weeks. In every visit, all subects&#xD;
      will undergo a body composition analysis as well as blood tests that include: total cell&#xD;
      count, glucose and lipid homeostasis, serum inflammatory markers, DNA extraction for genetic&#xD;
      tests (SNPs involved in inflammation), isolation and ex vivo stimulation of neutrophils,&#xD;
      determination of and isolation of PBMCs for further analysis of gene expression and protein&#xD;
      abundance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes three distinct but closely related approaches for reaching a further&#xD;
      understanding of the actions of EPA and DHA intake:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Through the conversion of EPA and DHA to specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) such&#xD;
           as resolvins (E and D) determined by an ex vivo assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Through the study of the involved enzyme coding-genes in the previously mentioned&#xD;
           conversion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Through the study of the activation of specific membrane receptors (FFAR4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these approaches will have in common the correlation with serum inflammatory markers (TNF&#xD;
      alpha, MCP1, IL-6, and IL-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the project is finished, the research strategies for new studies will be improved. In&#xD;
      the same way, the application of the knowledge generated in it will be encouraged towards the&#xD;
      health care of patients with obesity who could attend our service on future occasions.&#xD;
      Finally, we would disseminate the knowledge generated in our institutional community, which&#xD;
      would increase the impact of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the impact is divided into the following points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of genetic markers relevant to the treatment of obesity and its&#xD;
           comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bases for new strategies aimed at reducing chronic low-grade inflammation inherent in&#xD;
           obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Useful information on gene-nutrient interaction for the public and private sector in the&#xD;
           field of genetic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population benefited from the results of the intervention and the information of&#xD;
           their genetic and biochemical profiles Data from this study would strengthen the&#xD;
           inflammatory knowledge of obesity comorbidities from distinct standpoints&#xD;
