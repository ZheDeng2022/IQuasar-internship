      Treated Group) in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STAGE 1: This is an open-label safety study of enobosarm 9 mg QD coadministered with a CDK&#xD;
      4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib), 150 mg BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 2: This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, two treatment arm, efficacy and&#xD;
      safety study. Subjects will be randomized to the two treatment arms (Enobosarm Combination&#xD;
      Group versus Control Treated Group) in a 2:1 fashion. The determination of the treatment to&#xD;
      be used in the control arm will be declared prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If first line of therapy for metastatic breast cancer is a non-steroidal AI plus palbociclib,&#xD;
      then the patient will be randomized to either enobosarm + abemaciclib inhibitor OR&#xD;
      fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If first line of therapy for metastatic breast cancer is fulvestrant plus palbociclib, then&#xD;
      the patient will be randomized to either enobosarm + abemaciclib OR AI (steroidal or&#xD;
      non-steroidal). If the patient is randomized to the Control Treated Group to receive&#xD;
      steroidal AI, exemestane. The patient may receive exemestane with or without everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be the median rPFS. Subjects will continue&#xD;
      study treatment until disease progression confirmed by blinded independent central reader&#xD;
      (BICR) is observed. A safety follow up visit will occur approximately 30 days after last dose&#xD;
      of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After radiographic progression (by RECIST 1.1) is observed in the subjects in the Control&#xD;
      Treated Group, the subjects will be crossed over to enobosarm treatment (9 mg per day) plus&#xD;
      abemaciclib (150 mg BID). Treatment will continue in this population (Enobosarm Extension&#xD;
      Group (EEG)) until radiographic progression (by RECIST 1.1) is observed. The efficacy data&#xD;
      analysis for the EEG will be completely separate from the main portion of the study.&#xD;
