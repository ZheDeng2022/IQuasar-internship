  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with spastic diplegia are at an increased risk of spinal deformities. The most&#xD;
      common types of these spinal deformities are scoliosis and kyphosis. Thoracic hyper-kyphosis&#xD;
      may adversely affect balance in children with cerebral palsy . The treatment approaches for&#xD;
      hyper-kyphosis involved both conservative and surgical treatments. The Conservative approach&#xD;
      includes corrective exercises, positioning, and spinal braces. This study aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of conservative orthotic management for kyphotic posture on balance control, and&#xD;
      fall risk in cerebral palsied children of spastic diplegia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kyphosis is a posterior convexity of the spine. Children with cerebral palsy show a higher&#xD;
      probability of progression of the kyphotic curve. If it is not adequately treated, it becomes&#xD;
      fixed where it requires surgical management. Children with cerebral palsy have more&#xD;
      probability to balance impairment and falls than normal children and the consequences of that&#xD;
      fall are great. The current studies do not properly examine the effectiveness of conservative&#xD;
      orthoses on the therapeutic management of kyphosis in children with cerebral palsy. Also,&#xD;
      there is a shortage of studies that evaluate how correction of the thoracic kyphosis&#xD;
      influences the balance performance and fall risk in children with cerebral palsy. TheraTogs&#xD;
      orthosis which consists of an orthotic undergarment and external strapping system has been&#xD;
      designed to provide a soft and passive body compression to maintain a typical body postural&#xD;
      alignment and to improve posture control. Therefore, the objective of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate how the correction of dorsal hyper-kyphotic posture by the TheraTogs orthotic&#xD;
      system could influence balance control, and fall risk in cerebral palsied children of spastic&#xD;
      diplegia.&#xD;

    <description>The following device (DIERS Formetric 3D/4D spine &amp; posture analysis system) was used to examine the change in the thoracic kyphosis angle (°). This device supplies a thorough report about the alignment of the whole spine in one assessment session. It was used for assessing the sagittal plane of the back surface of the body according to a contactless 3D - scan.</description>

    <description>Spinal mouse, a computerized spinal evaluating device, was used for evaluating the range of motion of the spinal segment in a non-invasive way. The extension and flexion range of motion of the spine were measured by the spinal mouse. The measurements were recorded from the standing position of the children.</description>

    <description>The Biodex Balance System was used to assess the Change in the Overall Stability Index of the Fall Risk Test. In this study, the dynamic level 12 was selected for applying the fall risk test. The result for every child was registered and compared to the normative data stored in the software of the device based on children age range.</description>

    <time_frame>[Data was collected at baseline, and 12 weeks after intervention commencement.]</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Balance Scale is a functional test that is used to evaluate balance impairments in children with motor deficits. The test consists of 14 tasks that assess balance performance in children. 0-4 is the rating score for each item, where zero is the minimum score and 56 is the maximum score for all tasks.</description>
