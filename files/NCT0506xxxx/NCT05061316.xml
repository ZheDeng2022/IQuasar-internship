      The purpose of this study is to understand how a pre-operative nutritional intervention&#xD;
      alters the gut microbiome and improves outcomes after major head and neck cancer surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer (HNC) arises from the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive system.&#xD;
      Tumor-associated pain and physical obstruction from the tumor can impair a patient's ability&#xD;
      to eat, and this combined with the catabolic nature of cancer leads to significant weight&#xD;
      loss.HNC patients have a high burden of moderate to severe malnutrition and cachexia with a&#xD;
      rate of approximately 40%, and malnourishment at the time of HNC diagnosis is associated with&#xD;
      poor survival. In addition, these malnourished patients have longer post-operative hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, increased post-operative complications including infection, delayed wound&#xD;
      healing, muscle weakness, impaired cardiac and respiratory symptoms, reduced response to&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment, and decreased quality of life. Inflammation increases the risk of&#xD;
      malnutrition and may play a role in the suboptimal response to certain nutrition&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in diversity and relative abundance of gut bacteria in malnourished patients with&#xD;
      head and neck cancer after a pre-operative nutrition intervention will be determined.&#xD;
      Post-operative outcomes including wound complications, other surgical and medical&#xD;
      complications, hospital length of stay, unintended readmission within 30 days and mortality&#xD;
      after a pre-operative nutrition intervention will be recorded and compared to a historic&#xD;
      control. Finally, changes in known markers of nutritional status (albumin, prealbumin,&#xD;
      c-reactive protein (CRP), transferrin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), comprehensive&#xD;
      metabolic panel (CMP), and complete blood count (CBC)) and systemic inflammatory markers&#xD;
      (Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17) will be measured&#xD;
      after a pre-operative nutrition intervention. The pre-operative nutrition intervention is&#xD;
      Nestlé Impact Advanced Recovery Immunonutrition administered orally or through a feeding tube&#xD;
      two times daily for 5 days leading up to the date of surgery (day -5 to -1). Nestlé Impact&#xD;
      Advanced Recovery provides 280kcal, 11g total fat, 20g carbohydrates, and 26g protein per&#xD;
      unit (250mL). In addition, it is enriched with L-arginine and omega-3 fatty acids, two&#xD;
      components found to be essential for the beneficial effect of immunonutrition in a systematic&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunonutrition is a specially formulated diet that contains nutrients to modulate&#xD;
      inflammation. Pre-operative nutrition interventions with immunonutrition have demonstrated a&#xD;
      decrease in post-operative complications (35% vs 50%, p=0.034) and unplanned readmissions and&#xD;
      shortened hospital stays (17 vs 6 days, p&lt;0.001) in patients with HNC. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that dietary interventions can improve wound healing and post-operative survival. Currently,&#xD;
      nothing is known about the composition of the gut microbiome in malnourished patients with&#xD;
      HNC and how that composition changes with an immunonutrition intervention. There is evidence&#xD;
      that remote tissue healing is influenced by the gut microbiome. In mice undergoing a&#xD;
      pre-operative nutrition intervention, there is a shift in the gut microbiome composition from&#xD;
      Proteobacteria and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, which produce metabolites that impact the&#xD;
      systemic immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is the gut microbiome can serve as a marker of readiness for major&#xD;
      surgery after a pre-operative nutrition intervention in patients with HNC. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to treat malnourished patients with HNC with immunonutrition and examine changes in the&#xD;
      gut microbiome composition to define a gut microbiome associated with decreased&#xD;
      post-operative complications, improved markers of nutritional status, and decreased markers&#xD;
      of systemic inflammation.&#xD;
