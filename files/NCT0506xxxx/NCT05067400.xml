      Prospective, observational SARS-CoV2 serological surveillance single London HIV outpatient&#xD;
      center study using NHS participants&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to find out how many people living with HIV (PLWH) attending a&#xD;
      major HIV centre in London, have already been infected with SARS-CoV2 so far which will be&#xD;
      determined through serological blood tests detecting the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV2,&#xD;
      or have developed antibodies in response to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is not know whether the presence of antibodies from natural infection means&#xD;
      anything more than a marker that someone has been exposed to SARS-CoV2 previously. It is not&#xD;
      know whether this means someone is any less likely to be reinfected in the future or how it&#xD;
      will affect possible future infections with SARS-CoV2. Whilst further data on natural and&#xD;
      vaccine induced antibody responses is awaited, those with the presence of anti-SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      antibodies continue to be advised to take the same precautions as everyone else in terms of&#xD;
      reducing the risk of getting COVID-19: regularly washing hands, wearing a mask and remaining&#xD;
      socially distant where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now that vaccination has commenced it is also unclear what markers of vaccine induced&#xD;
      immunity will develop, including in PLWH. This study will help better determine whether HIV&#xD;
      should be an additional 'priority' group for vaccination, and also what antibody responses&#xD;
      exist in PLWH who have been vaccinated&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention is to invite the cohort in for an annual set of HIV related blood tests,&#xD;
      covering those who are scheduled for bloods, as well as those who may have missed scheduled&#xD;
      blood monitoring appointments during the COV19 lockdown period. In addition to these tests&#xD;
      the study proposes offering serological testing for SARS CoV-2 as part of this surveillance&#xD;
      study. Participation will be voluntary, and informed consent will be obtained. Participants&#xD;
      will be informed of their result along with information about the uncertainty of its meaning,&#xD;
      beyond indicating previous infection or vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to test for the presence of specific antibodies that target SARS-CoV2 in&#xD;
      people living with HIV, as a marker of whether someone has been infected before. This will&#xD;
      help create a better understanding of whether living with HIV puts people at a higher risk of&#xD;
      becoming infected with SARS-CoV2 compared to the general population, and which other factors&#xD;
      or characteristics may affect this risk. This will help identify who might be more at risk of&#xD;
      getting COVID-19 in the future and will help plan for future COVID-19 vaccine strategies.&#xD;
