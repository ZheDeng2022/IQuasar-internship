  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a school-based multi-component&#xD;
      universal programme for the reduction of internalising problems (i.e. anxiety and low mood)&#xD;
      in primary school pupils.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood and adolescence are important developmental phases for wellbeing and mental health.&#xD;
      School has been noted in psychological literature to be a favourable environment for mental&#xD;
      health initiatives, such as school-based programmes. Universal programmes are programmes&#xD;
      delivered to all pupils irrespective of perceived need and have several advantages, including&#xD;
      having a wide reach, avoiding the need for screening and are less stigmatising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Lust for Life is a universal school-based multi-component intervention whose target is to&#xD;
      build well-being and emotional resilience in children. The programme was informed by&#xD;
      evidence-based psychological approaches including cognitive behaviour therapy, positive&#xD;
      psychology and mindfulness and consists of six lessons, each delivered by the pupils' school&#xD;
      teacher on a weekly basis. The lessons involve classroom discussions, videos, classroom&#xD;
      activities and homework assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will complete the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale Short&#xD;
      Format, Coping strategy indicator and Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children&#xD;
      pre-intervention. Following this, schools randomly assigned to the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive A Lust for Life, while those randomly assigned to the control group will be placed on&#xD;
      a sixteen-week waiting list. The questionnaire measures and a Brief Satisfaction Scale will&#xD;
      be completed by participants at post-intervention. In addition, a six-week follow-up&#xD;
      assessment will determine whether the effects of the programme are sustained over a period of&#xD;
      time. The programme will be delivered in the waiting list control group schools after the&#xD;
      six-week follow-up assessment.&#xD;
