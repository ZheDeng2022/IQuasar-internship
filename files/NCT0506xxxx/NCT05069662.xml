  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed the organisation of care. Teleconsultation has&#xD;
      replaced hospital medical consultations in order to reduce the risk of patient exposure to&#xD;
      the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the framework of the Oncoral multidisciplinary outpatient / hospital program of&#xD;
      follow-up, carried out by the Hospices Civils de Lyon for ambulatory patients treated with&#xD;
      oral anticancer drugs, interviews with the pharmacist and/or nurse, which were previously&#xD;
      organised face-to-face, have been replaced by telephone interviews, ensuring continuity of&#xD;
      follow-up for patients without having to come to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on a telephone survey to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      health crisis on the drug exposure of cancer patients followed in the Oncoral program, their&#xD;
      treatment management, their perception of teleconsultation and their IT resources for remote&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
