  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised study aims to compare the utilization of high-flow humidified nasal&#xD;
      oxygenation (HFNO) with standard care, using apnoeic facemask oxygenation, during rapid&#xD;
      sequence induction (RSI) of anesthesia in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      170 children aged less then 11 years, admitted to the operating room for surgery and with a&#xD;
      medical indication of a RSI of anesthesia will be recruited in one university hospital&#xD;
      (Necker-Enfants-Malades in Paris).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be randomly assigned into two groups: the control group will benefit of&#xD;
      standard care and the HFNO group will receive heated and humidified oxygen through a nasal&#xD;
      cannula device during pre-oxygenation and apnoea time prior to tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFNO has been evaluated and showed benefits in rapid sequence induction of anesthesia in&#xD;
      adults and prolonged apnea time before desaturation in children. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge the potential benefit of HFNO during RSI in young children remain to be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic events during rapid sequence induction (RSI) in children remain more frequent than&#xD;
      during standard induction. Although the exact incidence is difficult to appreciate. However&#xD;
      the deleterious consequences of hypoxemia during tracheal intubation procedures are well&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFNO is an effective technique to supplement oxygen including during apnoea. Studies in&#xD;
      children have shown benefits both during breathing and apneic situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monocentric controlled randomized study including children, aged less then 11 years, will&#xD;
      be conducted in order to assess the potential benefits of this technique during RSI. The rate&#xD;
      of successful tracheal intubation without oxygen desaturation is the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be randomly assigned into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will benefit of standard RSI. Pre-oxygenation will be given through&#xD;
           facemask with 100% oxygen during 2 minutes, with a flow of 6 to 8 L.min-1 depending on&#xD;
           the age of the child. No oxygen will be delivered during laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The HFNO group will be given 2 L.Kg-1.min-1 of humidified and heated 100% O2 through a&#xD;
           nasal cannula during a 2 minutes pre-oxygenation and then throughout laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded and follow-up continued until discharge from the post&#xD;
      anesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
