    <textblock>
      The Health in Aging, Neurodegenerative Diseases and DementiaS in ONTario (HANDDS-ONT) Study&#xD;
      is an observational study that takes place in the comfort of participant's home, with no&#xD;
      study visits occurring in a clinic. The study is recruiting people living with a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease or the effects of stroke, along with healthy, aging individuals.&#xD;
      Studying both groups will help ONDRI researchers to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. understand how the diseases affect different people&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. discover ways to potentially detect diseases earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. find ways to help people manage their daily health related behaviours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant data is collected virtually through wearables - small sensors worn on the wrist,&#xD;
      ankle and chest -- for 7-10 days, as participants go about their daily activities. Data is&#xD;
      also collected from questionnaires regarding mood and quality of life. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected to understand how one's genetic makeup could provide for earlier detection of some&#xD;
      conditions, and for analysis of certain risk factors. Combining the information from the&#xD;
      sensors (walking patterns, sleep, heart rate/rhythm, etc.), the questionnaires and the blood&#xD;
      samples will allow researchers to better understand aging, with and without a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative condition, over a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a personalized health and activity report, describing sleep and&#xD;
      activity during the time the wearable sensors were worn. This information may help&#xD;
      participants better understand and manage some aspects of their overall health and it can be&#xD;
      shared with their circle of care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HANDDS-ONT is designed with the following principal research question in mind:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can the integration of biosamples, clinical data and remote wearable biosensor data across&#xD;
      aging and neurodegenerative disease cohorts i) provide valuable diagnostic data, ii)&#xD;
      demonstrate predictive utility for important clinical outcomes and iii) guide daily decisions&#xD;
      and care for individuals living with neurodegenerative diseases? Ultimately we aim to improve&#xD;
      the lived-experience of individuals affected by dementia. This protocol focuses on building&#xD;
      the foundation for this long-term objective by adapting the NIA-AA framework to link genetic,&#xD;
      proteomic, and free-living behavioural signatures across NDD cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 will examine the expression of single proteins or sets of proteins (i.e., protein&#xD;
      biomarkers), and different gene mutation inheritance patterns (e.g. mutation negative,&#xD;
      monogenic mutation, polygenic mutations), to help identify unique cohorts with similar&#xD;
      symptoms and free-living behavioural profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 will examine the relationship between multidimensional data (genomic-proteomic&#xD;
      signatures, functional behaviours extracted from free-living data collected with wearable&#xD;
      biosensors), and the risk for adverse health outcomes (e.g., ED visits, hospitalizations,&#xD;
      long-term care admission, death, comorbid disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3 will examine the useability, acceptance and impact of feedback on self-management&#xD;
      activities. Feedback around functional activities will be provided in the form of a&#xD;
      participant report that conveys higher level metrics intended to inform and/or alter behavior&#xD;
      relative to overall health, symptom management, and/or quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HANDDS-ONT is designed as a &quot;Master Observational Trial&quot;&#xD;
      [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.12.009], connecting real-world clinical data with&#xD;
      cellular, protein marker and genetic data, free-living behavioural data measured by wearable&#xD;
      biosensors and longer-term health outcome data via linkage to administrative datasets at&#xD;
      ICES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will build on existing ONDRI research infrastructure and a central group of&#xD;
      research cores that reflect the evolving state of research in neurodegenerative disorders.&#xD;
      Specifically, there will be five complimentary research cores (Fluid biomarkers, Clinical,&#xD;
      Wearable biosensors, Health Systems, and Neuroinformatics) overseen by a central research&#xD;
      Administration Core.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve Objective 1, fluid biomarkers from serum and plasma, genetic data, clinical&#xD;
      information and free-living behaviours (e.g. sleep, physical activity and other markers&#xD;
      collected using wearable biosensors) will be integrated to identify groups based on NIA-AA&#xD;
      research framework. Participants will be asked to provide a blood sample, complete&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires for data collection by telephone or online, and wear wearable&#xD;
      biosensors for 7-10 days described in sections below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve Objective 2, the clinico-pathological cohorts identified in objective 1 (combining&#xD;
      protein and genetic biomarker data with clinical and free-living behaviour data) will be&#xD;
      linked to administrative datasets at ICES to identify risk factors for important clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g. death, long-term care need, comorbid diseases, falls) and patterns of health&#xD;
      systems utilization. Participants will be asked for permission to securely store Health Card&#xD;
      Numbers and link to ICES for outcomes (see Procedures and Assessments section, below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve Objective 3, surveys and interviews will be administered. As additional metrics&#xD;
      are validated, they will be integrated into the feedback form for evaluation using the&#xD;
      methods described in Objective 3, above. Participants may consent to being recontacted for&#xD;
      ongoing feedback and new study options (see Procedures and Assessments section, below).&#xD;
