      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vibration and kinesiology tape&#xD;
      applications applied to the affected side forearm extensor muscles on dexterity in children&#xD;
      with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.&#xD;

      Upper extremity in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy significantly more affected than&#xD;
      the lower extremities. Child mostly does not use the affected side and activity and weight&#xD;
      uses the solid side in the overlay. in the upper extremity One of the muscles most affected&#xD;
      by spasticity is the wrist and wrist. finger flexors. Secondary in antagonist of these&#xD;
      muscles weakness develops and posture disorders occur. In this study The kinesiology tape,&#xD;
      which has been increasingly used in recent years, affected by the application and local&#xD;
      vibration application. hand with application to the lateral forearm extensor muscle group&#xD;
      comparing their effects on their skills with the control group. aimed to evaluate. As a&#xD;
      result of the study, this diagnosis hand skills of which application in children who are&#xD;
      studying has a greater effect on and in which rehabilitation that the application should be&#xD;
      preferred more It will be a guide for physiotherapists.&#xD;
