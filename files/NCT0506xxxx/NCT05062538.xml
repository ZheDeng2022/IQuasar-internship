      A web-based survey will be emailed to all adult women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer&#xD;

      A web-based survey will be emailed to all adult women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer&#xD;
      or ductal carcinoma in situ who have been seen as surgical consultations within the last year&#xD;
      (06/01/19-06/01/20). This will ensure that patients at various stages of treatment are&#xD;
      included, from initial diagnosis into survivorship. This will allow the investigators to&#xD;
      assess changes to initial consultations, surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation, as well as&#xD;
      patient perspectives as it relates to these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The web-based surveys will be given via Redcap. The study team will use a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire developed at the University of Miami (Penedo, 2020), which includes a&#xD;
      combination of multiple-choice questions, Likert scale ratings, and yes/no questions. A list&#xD;
      of potential questions is listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of patients will be contacted for semi-structured interviews via telephone as well if&#xD;
      (1) patients indicate willingness to participate on a separate RedCap survey or (2) if the&#xD;
      patient does not respond to this survey. Phone interviews will be recorded and transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim. Multiple members of the research team will separately code the information and&#xD;
      evaluate for themes.&#xD;
