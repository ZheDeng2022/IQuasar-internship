  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder manifesting stereotypic&#xD;
      behaviors and problem in communication and social interaction. Different physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions like aerobics help to improve recurrent behaviors and task performance of&#xD;
      autistic children. This study was focused to see the effect of jogging on the stereotypic&#xD;
      behaviors and task performance of autistic children. A single blinded randomized study was&#xD;
      conducted on 38 autistic children, randomly allocated to two groups, performing jogging and&#xD;
      ball exercises. Repetitive Behavior Scale-revised(RBS-R) and Jebsen Hand Function Test (JHFT)&#xD;
      was used for assessment. Exercise was performed for 3 weeks and 4 sessions per week.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RBS-R was used to assess the stereotypic behaviors of autistic children. It is 43 items questionnaire that is placed under six subscales. The sub-scales are Stereotyped Behavior Subscale Self-Injurious Behavior Subscale Compulsive Behavior Subscale Ritualistic Behavior Subscale Sameness Behavior Subscale Restricted Behavior Subscale Each subscale has different characteristics, which are classified from 0 to 3 (behavior is severe). Moreover, each behavior is also rated that how much this behavior occurs, cause interruption in activity and how much a child become agitated when he was interrupted. Global score rating was used by calculating the scores of all the six subscales and total score was given in range of 1 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Jebsen Hand Function Test (JHFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>JHFT was used to evaluate the task performance of autistic children.JHFT has seven variants and time was recorded, in seconds, taken by children to complete these seven tasks. These seven tasks are writing, card turning, small common objects, simulated feeding, stacking, lifting large lightweight objects and lifting large heavy objects. These piece of work was first performed by the non-dominant hand then by the dominant hand and at the end time required during all the task was summed up in minutes</description>
