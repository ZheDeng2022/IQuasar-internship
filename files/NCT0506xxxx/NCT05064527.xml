  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the feasibility of implementing digitally enhanced psychotherapy and research in a&#xD;
      community child and adolescent mental health center including the acceptability of the&#xD;
      digital technology to patients, parents and therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use passively collected physiological data and actively collected clinical and biochemical&#xD;
      data from the patient and parents to detect and predict episodes of obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      disorder (OCD) -related episodes in children and accommodating behaviour in parents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Psychiatric and specifically mechanistic research have stagnated mainly due to&#xD;
      the time, labour and bias inherent in human-based technologies that dominate the field. To&#xD;
      advance translational and precision psychiatry, researchers within psychiatry must forge&#xD;
      long-term collaborations with researchers and developers within technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To improve assessment and psychotherapy for youth obsessive-compulsive disorder&#xD;
      (OCD) through developing an artificial intelligence tool to support patients, parents and&#xD;
      therapists in cognitive behavioural therapy. To give an innovative push in the public sector&#xD;
      hospitals and research through integration of wearable sensors and machine learning&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 10 patients (8-17 years) and one of their parents from a child and adolescent mental&#xD;
      health center will be recruited as in the larger TECTO project. To examine whether the&#xD;
      algorithms can distinguish between patients and typically developing children, 10 typically&#xD;
      developing sex and age matched children and one of their parents or guardians will also be&#xD;
      recruited from the catchment area. Passively sensed physiological indicators of stress are&#xD;
      used as input to privacy preserving signal processing and machine learning algorithms, which&#xD;
      predict OCD-episodes, clinical severity and family accommodation. Oxytocin, as a biomarker&#xD;
      for family accommodation, is measured through saliva samples. Signal processing will be used&#xD;
      to extract acoustic and physiological features of importance for therapeutic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Results from the proposed project will be used to develop AI tools that&#xD;
      support clinicians, patients and parents, which will be implemented and evaluated in a&#xD;
      public-sector hospital. Technology-enhanced therapy can be used in a stepped care model, in&#xD;
      which subclinical symptoms are first monitored using passive sensors and then AI&#xD;
      interventions are offered, supported by a healthcare professional, and when outpatient care&#xD;
      is needed, the AI tool can support patient engagement. The results of this project will also&#xD;
      advance research in computational science and psychiatry by testing biomarkers of clinical&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;
