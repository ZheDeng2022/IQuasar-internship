  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is characterized pathologically by permanent bronchial dilatation and airway&#xD;
      inflammation. The pathogenesis of the disease and the inflammatory, infective and molecular&#xD;
      drivers of disease progression are not fully understood. The concept of &quot;treatable traits&quot;&#xD;
      was proposed as biomarker-directed approach, based on the recognition of clinical phenotype&#xD;
      and endotypes, help to personalized treatment options. Airway microbiota, including bacteria,&#xD;
      NTM and fungus, have important but different inflammatory process in bronchiectasis. Our&#xD;
      study will provide a new concept that airway microbiota might involve in the airway and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, as well as the airway damage, remodeling, and&#xD;
      frequent exacerbations in bronchiectasis, thus leading to the deterioration of disease&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis remains a major cause of respiratory morbidity and treatment is generally only&#xD;
      partly successful. Our study will give more clues about the mechanisms on the inflammatory&#xD;
      pathway and the probably different response among patients with different isolated microbiota&#xD;
      from airways.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is characterized pathologically by permanent bronchial dilatation and airway&#xD;
      inflammation, and clinically by productive cough, hemoptysis and periodic infectious&#xD;
      exacerbations. The pathogenesis of the disease and the inflammatory, infective and molecular&#xD;
      drivers of disease progression are not fully understood. Current available therapeutic&#xD;
      options have shown only a modest impact on disease outcomes in randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
      The concept of &quot;treatable traits&quot; was proposed as biomarker-directed approach, based on the&#xD;
      recognition of clinical phenotype and endotypes, help to personalized treatment options.&#xD;
      Potential treatable traits of airways disease into four broad categories: pulmonary,&#xD;
      extra-pulmonary, etiological, and behavior and lifestyle treatable traits. Airway microbiota,&#xD;
      including bacteria, NTM and fungus, have important but different inflammatory process in&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. Our study will provide a new concept that airway microbiota might involve in&#xD;
      the airway and systemic inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, as well as the airway damage,&#xD;
      remodeling, and frequent exacerbations in bronchiectasis, thus leading to the deterioration&#xD;
      of disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis remains a major cause of respiratory morbidity and treatment is generally only&#xD;
      partly successful. Our study will give more clues about the mechanisms by which the&#xD;
      immunomodulatory medications (macrolides) on the inflammatory pathway and the probably&#xD;
      different response among patients with different isolated microbiota from airways. Thus, our&#xD;
      results will not only shed light on the airway microbiota inflammatory mechanisms responsible&#xD;
      for disease severity, but also provide a new therapeutic direction.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inclusion criteria were as follows: bronchiectasis documented on chest HRCT,&#xD;
             idiopathic etiology of bronchiectasis, chronic sputum production (daily sputum ≥ 10&#xD;
             ml), absence of other major pulmonary diagnoses, and steady state defined by the&#xD;
             absence of change of symptoms noted by the patient over the past 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The exclusion criteria were as follows: bronchiectasis with defined etiology (i.e,&#xD;
             post-tuberculosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, allergic bronchopulmonary&#xD;
             aspergillosis), common variable immunodeficiency, and use of antibiotics within the&#xD;
             last 3 weeks. Patients with hepatic failure, malignancy, or pregnancy were also&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
