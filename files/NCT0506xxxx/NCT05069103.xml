      This is a implementation research study of a surgical wound tele-monitoring online tool&#xD;
      developed at the University of Edinburgh and demonstrated in the &quot;Tracking wound infection&#xD;
      with smartphone technology&quot; (TWIST) randomised control trial (NCT02704897) conducted in NHS&#xD;
      Lothian. The study design is based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) &quot;Guidance for&#xD;
      developing and evaluating complex interventions&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common complications following surgery with&#xD;
      significant costs to patients and health systems. Earlier diagnosis and treatment of SSI can&#xD;
      reduce its impact. We have previously developed a unique remote wound surveillance tool in a&#xD;
      University of Edinburgh research setting. We have demonstrated in a previous randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (NCT02704897), that wound infection can be diagnosed sooner (in the first 7&#xD;
      days postoperatively) when this tool is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 12-month implementation research study will be conducted across the general surgical&#xD;
      departments of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and the Western General Hospital (two large&#xD;
      tertiary hospitals). Informed consent will be required from all patients prior to enrolment,&#xD;
      with a target of 200 patients recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data during the study will be collected via online forms hosted on the ISLA care&#xD;
      platform, self-submitted by patients based on their own concerns with their wound or prompted&#xD;
      by a routine request to complete. These forms are based on the smartphone-delivered wound&#xD;
      assessment model developed and delivered in the TWIST trial (based on the Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (CDC) classification criteria, and the ASEPSIS model (Additional&#xD;
      treatment, Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, and Separation of the deep tissues,&#xD;
      the Isolation of bacteria, and the duration of Inpatient Stay)). Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to upload at least one photograph of their wound each time they use the smartphone-delivered&#xD;
      wound assessment tool. Participants will be sent one (1) reminder notification the following&#xD;
      day if they have not completed a requested response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On postoperative day 30-day, patients will be requested to complete an online questionnaire&#xD;
      based on two validated questionnaires: Bluebelle Wound Healing Questionnaire (WHQ) and&#xD;
      Telehealth Usability Questionnaire. Furthermore, a subset of patients will be asked to&#xD;
      indicate their interest to take part in a separate semi-structured interview regarding their&#xD;
      experience within the study, and views of telemedicine in routine postoperative care (target&#xD;
      20 patients).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Similar to the original TWIST trial, patients will receive access to the online tool hosted on the ISLA platform until postoperative day 30 which is composed of two parts:&#xD;
A series of simple questions related to the detection of surgical wound infection (e.g. redness, swelling, fluid leakage, etc). These questions would be expected to be routinely asked during in-person assessment, and these questions have been previously developed and tested within the TWIST trial (the only change being the addition of questions specifically relating to the change in these symptoms).&#xD;
At least one image of their surgical wound(s).&#xD;
Patients will receive automated requests via notifications asking to complete the online tool over the 30-day period (every 3 days +/- 1 day), however they may also complete the online form whenever wished.</intervention_model_description>
