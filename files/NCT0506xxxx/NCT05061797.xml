  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to examine the acute thermogenic effects of the active study product&#xD;
      (energy drink), in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The active study product and a control will be blinded with 3 digit codes. Human subjects&#xD;
      will consume the coded products in a randomized manner. Measurements of rest energy&#xD;
      expenditure via respiration will be performed throughout a 3 hour time span with controlled&#xD;
      intervention an observation. Additional metrics will be gathered relating to benefits and/or&#xD;
      side effects. The data gathered will be used to calculate the thermogenic impact of the&#xD;
      active study product on healthy adults. The study is designed based on statistical&#xD;
      confidence, with a minimum required number of active participants set to 26. 30 participants&#xD;
      will be recruited.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Thermogenic Effect through REE (Resting Energy Expenditure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks for all participants, 180 minutes per participant per session.</time_frame>
    <description>The quantified Thermogenic Impact of the ASP as measured from Resting Energy Expenditure testing with human participants following consumption of the ASP Thermogenic Energy Beverage. This is done via the difference in the net-incremental area under the curve (AUC) for the ASP Thermogenic Beverage vs. the Placebo. A larger difference in REE between the ASP Thermogenic Beverage and the Placebo indicates a greater Thermogenic (calorie expending) effect from the ASP Thermogenic Beverage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satiety (As Perceived by the Participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks for all participants, 180 minutes per participant per session.</time_frame>
    <description>A qualitative review of satiety experienced by study participants using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is measured on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no appetite and increasing values indicating higher appetite sensations. The VAS is designed to have participants assess their hunger, desire to eat, and fullness during the 180 minute time span of the test. Lower numerical scores for appetite would indicate improved satiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side Effects/ Gastrointestinal Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks for all participants, 180 minutes per participant per session.</time_frame>
    <description>A qualitative assessment of GI (Gastrointestinal Tolerance) The Participants will complete a Gastrointestinal Tolerance Questionnaire where they will asses and evaluate their symptoms on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no experience of the symptom and 3 indicating a severe experience of the symptom. These will include Gat/flatulence, Abdominal Bloating, Abdominal Pain/ Discomfort, Borborygmus/ stomach rumbling, Burping, Reflux, Nausea, Vomiting. Lower scores for all symptoms would indicate that the Thermogenic Energy Drink ASP is well-tolerated.</description>
