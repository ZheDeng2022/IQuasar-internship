      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with survivors of childhood cancer, there is sparse knowledge about the long-term&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients, who are&#xD;
      diagnosed at age 18-39 and have an 80% chance to survive. Following cancer treatment, many&#xD;
      cancer survivors, including those at AYA age, have an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Early ageing has been described in paediatric and certain adult cancer survivor&#xD;
      populations. One of the responsible mechanisms behind biological ageing is cellular&#xD;
      senescence, characterized by a stable arrest of the cell cycle which occurs in response to&#xD;
      stress and damage. In all organisms the number of senescent cells increases with age and&#xD;
      senescence has been associated with age-related diseases, like atherosclerosis and Alzheimer.&#xD;
      Early ageing as a result of intensive cancer treatment with systemic therapy and radiation&#xD;
      may result in early cardiovascular disease. However, information about senescence, early&#xD;
      vascular ageing and related patient and tumour characteristics is missing for AYAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to determine markers related to early ageing and senescence in AYA cancer patients before and&#xD;
      after systemic therapy, in order to assess treatment-related early vascular ageing and&#xD;
      associated tumour and patient characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal cohort study; measurements before start of systemic therapy and one year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 18-39 years, with a first histological and/or cytological diagnosis of a&#xD;
      haematological or solid malignancy, scheduled to start systemic therapy with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is change in senescence marker P16 between start of systemic therapy and one&#xD;
      year later. Secondary endpoints are: changes in senescence-associated secretory phenotype&#xD;
      (SASP) and vascular markers; prevalence of classical cardiovascular risk factors (smoking,&#xD;
      lipids, body mass index (BMI), glucose); tumour (treatment) and patient (age, sex,&#xD;
      pre-existent cardiometabolic status) factors related to the changes in senescence, SASP and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Study measurements will be performed twice and consist of blood withdrawal and&#xD;
      physical examination (weight, height, waist-hip ratio, and blood pressure).&#xD;

      Fasting blood samples (65 ml in total) will be drawn to measure circulating senescence marker&#xD;
      P16 (in circulating CD3+ (cluster of differentiation 3+) T-lymphocytes), markers of the SASP&#xD;
      (IL-6, IL-8, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) ), biochemical markers for vascular&#xD;
      damage (von Willebrand Factor, albuminuria, coagulation markers (i.e.FVIII, fibrinogen,&#xD;
      Plasminogen Activator inhibitor -1), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), NT-proBNP&#xD;
      (Brain Natriuretic Peptide), galectin-3, GDF-15 (Growth/Differentiation Factor-15)), and the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol (high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein), LDL-cholesterol (low density lipoprotein); glucose, insulin, and HbA1c). The&#xD;
