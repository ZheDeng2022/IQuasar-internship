    <measure>Frailty</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty is assessed by using the 'Groingen Frailty Indicator Questionnaire'.&#xD;
The GFI is a validated, 15-item questionnaire with a score range from zero to fifteen that assesses the physical, cognitive, social, and psychological domains. A GFI score of four or greater is considered the cut-off point for frailty.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional knowledge is assessed by using 'General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire'.&#xD;
This questionnaire consists of four independent sections, each assessing a different aspect of nutrition knowledge: Dietary recommendations; Food groups; Healthy Food choices and Diet, disease and weight management.&#xD;
Section 1 - Dietary Recommendations Each item carries one point for a correct answer. Maximum score = 18.&#xD;
Section 2 - Food groups Each item carries one point for a correct answer. Maximum score = 36&#xD;
Section 3- Healthy Food choices Each item carries one point for a correct answer. Maximum score = 13.&#xD;
Section 4 - Diet, disease and weight management Each item carries one point for a correct answer. Maximum score = 21.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite Level based on 'Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire'</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite level is assessed by using 'Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire'.&#xD;
The score is calculated by adding up the points (values) that are assigned to the individual answers. The maximum number of points possible for a patient to obtain is 40, while the minimum is 8. The lower the score, the worse the patient's appetite.&#xD;
8-16: The patient is at risk for anorexia and needs nutrition counselling. 17-28: The patient needs frequent reassessment. &gt;28: The patient is not at risk at this time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite Level based on 'The three-factor eating questionnaire'</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite level is assessed by using 'The three-factor eating questionnaire'.&#xD;
The TFEQ contains 51 items (questions) and measures three aspects of human eating behaviour: 'cognitive restraint of eating' (Factor I - 21 items); 'disinhibition' (Factor II - 16 items); 'hunger' (Factor III - 14 items). The minimum score for factors I-II-III is, therefore, 0-0-0, the possible maximum score 21-16-14.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Eating behaviour is assessed by using the 'Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire'&#xD;
The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire is a 33-item self-report questionnaire to assess three distinct eating behaviours in adults: (1) emotional eating, (2) external eating, and (3) restrained eating. Items on the DEBQ range from 1 (never) to 5 (very often), with higher scores indicating greater endorsement of the eating behaviour.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The experience of food craving is assessed by using the 'Control of Eating Questionnaire'.&#xD;
The Control of Eating Questionnaire comprises 21-items that are designed to assess the severity and type of food cravings individual experiences over the previous 7 days. The overall score ranges from 0 to 200 and higher scores mean that they have higher severity of food cravings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Level based on 'General Practice Physical Activity' questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity level is assessed by using 'General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire'.&#xD;
This questionnaire provides a simple, 4-level Physical Activity Index (PAI) of - Active, Moderately Active, Moderately Inactive, and Inactive.&#xD;
Inactive: Sedentary job and no physical exercise or cycling. Moderately inactive: Sedentary job and some but &lt; 1 hour physical exercise and / or cycling per week OR Standing job and no physical exercise or cycling.&#xD;
Moderately active: Sedentary job and 1-2.9 hours physical exercise and / or cycling per week OR Standing job and some but &lt; 1 hour physical exercise and / or cycling per week OR Physical job and no physical exercise or cycling.&#xD;
Active: Sedentary job and ≥ 3 hours physical exercise and / or cycling per week OR Standing job and 1-2.9 hours physical exercise and / or cycling per week OR Physical job and some but &lt; 1 hour physical exercise and / or cycling per week OR Heavy manual job.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Level based on 'Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)' questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity level is assessed by using 'Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)'.&#xD;
This questionnaire measures the level of self-reported physical activity in individuals aged 65 years or older and is considered of items regarding occupational, household, and leisure activities during the previous 7 day period. The total PASE score is computed by multiplying either the time spent in each activity (hours per week) or participation (i.e., yes/no) in an activity, by empirically derived item weights and then summing overall activities. The overall PASE score ranges from 0 to 400 or more.</description>

    <measure>Food shopping and cooking behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>

In this questionnaire, participant's food shopping and cooking behaviours will assess, no scale or score will be reported.</description>
