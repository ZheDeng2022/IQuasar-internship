  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this fully powered clinical trial is to investigate if using a solid&#xD;
      backrest on a manual wheelchair (MWC) will improve postural alignment, function and&#xD;
      wheelchair mobility, as compared with an upholstery backrest, and to explore the impact of&#xD;
      overall back height, contour, and seat gap when using a solid backrest in individuals with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A properly fit wheelchair and seating system can have a profound impact on the daily life of&#xD;
      people with spinal cord injury (SCI). A backrest that supports the natural spinal curves is&#xD;
      thought to enhance posture, functional mobility, and comfort for manual wheelchair (MWC)&#xD;
      users. In fact, therapists routinely prescribe after-market posture-backs based on clinical&#xD;
      reasoning. However, there is little research comparing the efficacy of an after-market&#xD;
      posture-back to the standard upholstery back, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to&#xD;
      justify these to group insurance payers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, investigators performed a pilot study to investigate whether there were&#xD;
      postural and/or functional differences between using a standard upholstery WC back and an&#xD;
      after-market solid posture-back. The results of that study have been presented at the&#xD;
      American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) annual conference in November 2019 and&#xD;
      the Combined Sections Meeting (CSM) of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) in&#xD;
      February 2020, and were also published in the Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine in 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the results of that study demonstrated clinical relevance and statistical trends for&#xD;
      improvements in postural alignment and functional outcomes when using a solid back, there was&#xD;
      not enough power to establish statistical significance. It also did not evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of backrest height and position or depth of contour in order to inform clinical practice. The&#xD;
      overall objective of this fully powered clinical trial is to further investigate if using a&#xD;
      solid backrest on MWC will improve postural alignment, function and wheelchair mobility, as&#xD;
      compared with an upholstery backrest; and to explore the impact of overall back height, seat&#xD;
      gap, and contour when using a solid backrest.&#xD;
