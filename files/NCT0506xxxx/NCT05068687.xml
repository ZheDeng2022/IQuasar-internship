  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients diagnosed with a pathology-proven malignancy of the head and neck&#xD;
      will receive a routine clinical activity of 18F-FDG ((18)F-luorodeoxyglucose) before&#xD;
      undergoing standard of care surgical resection of the malignancy. Following the resection,&#xD;
      the 18F-FDG-infused malignancy will be investigated utilizing a novel high-resolution&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) scan. Slicing of the&#xD;
      malignancy will be followed by additional PET/CT-scanning and autoradiography of the sliced&#xD;
      specimen. The results found during image analysis will be compared to the results of the gold&#xD;
      standard of histopathology. As this is no approved way of assessing the tumour's margin, the&#xD;
      conclusion of the scan will not be used as a method for changing the patients' treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The characterization of the ideal dose of 18F-FDG necessary for specimen imaging with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. This dose will be identified using post-processing image reconstruction on the specimen resulting from patients given a standard diagnostic activity of 18F-FDG.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week after administration</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the ability of high-resolution 18F-FDG-PET/CT to identify positive lymph nodes excised by neck dissection. This will be quantified as sensitivity and specificity compared to the gold standard of histopathological examination.</description>

    <description>To correlate the distribution of 18F-FDG in and around tumoral tissue with the histopathology of the specimen. This will be performed by correlating the results obtained from the PET/CT-scan of (sliced) tumoral specimens and autoradiography of a frozen section of the tumour.</description>

    <description>Included patients are given a single weight-dependent activity of 18F-FDG at the department of Nuclear Medicine. After administration, patients are brought to the operating room where standard of care surgical removal of the malignancy is performed.&#xD;
The resected specimen(s) are brought to the imaging lab and scanned using a preclinical PET/CT device. Following PET/CT imaging, the specimen is brought to the department of pathology, where it is sliced. Some of these slices are then rescanned using the preclinical PET/CT device. Moreover, frozen sections are made from one of these slices with macroscopically visible malignant tissue and placed on an autoradiograph overnight. Finally, the imaging results are then correlated to the results found during histopathological analysis of the specimens.</description>
