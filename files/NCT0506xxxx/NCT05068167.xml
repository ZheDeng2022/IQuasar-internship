  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) postoperatively has been identified to be 21.6% in&#xD;
      adults and 18.3% in hospitalized individuals. Surgery-related AKI is a severe complication&#xD;
      that is related not only to short-term complications as increases in mortality rate and&#xD;
      development of cardiac complications but also with complications on long term, such as&#xD;
      development of chronic kidney disease. A better understanding of the mechanism of this&#xD;
      hypthesis will lead to better management of this complication.&#xD;

      A randomized blinded prospective study included 206patients who the candidate for major&#xD;
      surgery at South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. From April 2018&#xD;
      till April 2019, a detailed history and careful examination, routine laboratory&#xD;
      investigations were done, Baseline ECG was recorded 24hours before surgery and 48hours&#xD;
      postoperative at ICU.&#xD;
