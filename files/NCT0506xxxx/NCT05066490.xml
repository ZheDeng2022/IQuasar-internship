  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of exercise-induced lipolysis on&#xD;
      vitamin D status in obese children. Two types of exercises that have different effects on&#xD;
      lipolysis were used. Lipolysis was assessed via monitoring the level of plasma level of the&#xD;
      free fatty acids and glycerol. Vitamin D was assessed through 25 (OH)D plasma levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      vitamin D status was monitored through 25 (OH)D levels, and the lipolysis status via the&#xD;
      plasma level of the free fatty acids and glycerol immediately after the exercise. All&#xD;
      subjects who participated in the study were under supervision for controlling the fat&#xD;
      contents and vitamin D in their food for one week prior to the exercise. the subjects fasted&#xD;
      eight hours before the exercise. All the exercises were performed between 9 am and 11 am.&#xD;
