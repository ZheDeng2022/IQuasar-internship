      The Brain microblEeds after TrAnscatheter aorTic ValvE Replacement (BETTER) registry is a&#xD;
      prospective, observational, multi-center registry aiming to assess the presence of new brain&#xD;
      microbleeds assessed on susceptibility-weighted imaging at 3 enrolling sites, in China (West&#xD;
      China Hospital, Sichuan University), UK (St Thomas' Hospital) and Denmark (Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      University of Copenhagen). The main study arm is planned to include 100 patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic severe aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVR of any devices and 50&#xD;
      isolated bioprosthetic SAVR patients treated during the enrollment period as a control arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      &quot;Silent&quot; stroke post-TAVR presents as asymptomatic brain ischemic lesions detected on&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), with an incidence ranging from 60% to&#xD;
      100% in different studies. On the contrary, hemorrhagic lesions are not systematically&#xD;
      studied given the poor visualization of small hemorrhage (i.e. microbleeds) on traditional&#xD;
      T1, T2 or DW-MRI sequences. We have previously identified an incidence of new brain&#xD;
      microbleeds early after TAVR of 100% with the routine use of susceptibility-weighted imaging&#xD;
      (SWI). We hypothesize that new brain microbleeds are prevalent in patients with aortic&#xD;
      stenosis after either TAVR or SAVR. The key objective of this registry is to evaluate the&#xD;
      incidence, distribution and clinical impact of new brain microbleeds after transfemoral TAVR&#xD;
      in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, in comparison with SAVR.&#xD;

    <description>Brain MRI will be scheduled within three days before the procedure and within seven days after the procedure, as well as at 6-month follow-up. MRI will be preferably performed using a 3.0-Tesla system unless patients are pacemaker-dependent after the procedure. In such case, a 1.5-Tesla system will be used. The MRI protocol consists of standardized conventional diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI), T2-FLAIR (fluid-attenuated recovery inversion) and SWI (susceptibility-weighted imaging) parameters.</description>
