  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a new type of imaging study, called&#xD;
      18F-Clofarabine (CFA) PET/CT, can be used to image cancer pyrimidine metabolism in&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET (positron emission tomography) imaging is a way of looking at cancers that can reveal&#xD;
      cancer metabolism. Presently, however, there are no imaging agents in routine use to look at&#xD;
      an aspect of cancer metabolism (pyrimidine metabolism) that dictates whether certain cancer&#xD;
      drugs, e.g., gemcitabine, are likely to be taken into the cancer cells. This clinical trial&#xD;
      will be testing whether 18F-Clofarabine (CFA) could be an imaging agent to measure this&#xD;
      aspect of cancer metabolism.&#xD;

      The participants will receive a CFA injection into a vein in their arm. The imaging drug is&#xD;
      attracted to and taken into certain cells in the body, including cancer cells.&#xD;
      18F-Clofarabine (CFA) is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be observed for side effects, and about 1 hour later, they will receive&#xD;
      a PET/CT scan. Additionally, they will be contacted the next day to inquire again about any&#xD;
      side effects. If the participant's routine care involves repeat imaging of cancer, then the&#xD;
      CFA PET/CT scan will be repeated at that time, which could be a month to about 4 months after&#xD;
      the first CFA PET/CT scan.&#xD;

    <description>Establish the image-based biodistribution of CFA, a new tracer for imaging DCK enzyme activity. DCK converts the inactive prodrug clofarabine into its active form. Thus, the degree of DCK expression in normal and abnormal tissues may predict drug effects and effectiveness.&#xD;
The uptake of the radiotracer (SUVs) will be measured quantitatively from PET images taken at 60 min post-injection of [18F]CFA.</description>

    <description>The participants enrolled will receive a baseline CFA PET/CT evaluation. Then, the participants will undergo the routine follow up would normally occur for their cancer and its treatment. If this routine follow up and care involves repeat imaging of the cancer, then the CFA PET/CT scan will be repeated at that time (timed according to standard-of-care follow-up imaging), which is expected between a month to about 4 months after the first CFA PET/CT scan. The study period will end 24 hours after this repeat PET/CT scan.</description>
