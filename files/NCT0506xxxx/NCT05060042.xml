  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trail to compare and analyze the&#xD;
      effects of both whole body vibrator (WBV) and proprioceptive training through Tai Chi program&#xD;
      on static and dynamic postural balance variables of the elderly population. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to determine that whether whole body vibrator is more evident or proprioceptive&#xD;
      training is more effective for promoting functional independency and improving balance in&#xD;
      older adults. Hence distinguishing choices to prevent fall and advancing functional&#xD;
      independency by using the appropriate intervention without using extreme loads.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Elderly population is defined as 'people aged 65 or above'. Aging is a complex and&#xD;
      challenging process of physiological changes and it is associated with decline of biological&#xD;
      functions. Increasing age is linked with impairments in visual, proprioception, vestibular&#xD;
      systems, decline in muscular strength and control of the lower limbs, balance/postural&#xD;
      control, and of the mobility patterns which are known to be substantial hazards for fall, and&#xD;
      these parameters have been found to be dynamically more disabled with getting older. Among&#xD;
      all these factors, there is obvious decline in normal functioning and balance related issues,&#xD;
      common in elderly population due to proprioceptive function loss that is the person is unable&#xD;
      to sense his joint position and motion which ultimately results in mobility impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, researchers have been looking for new approaches that are more feasible to improve&#xD;
      the independence and physical mobility in older individuals and over the past decade the&#xD;
      whole body vibrator (WBV) have been seeking attention for the beneficence of the elderly&#xD;
      population. It is a neuromuscular training modality used to improve muscle strength, power,&#xD;
      balance, mobility, cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, improves neuromuscular and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal functions and general health both in healthy and as well as in orthopedic&#xD;
      patients and neurologically diseased elderly population .Bilateral proprioceptive training is&#xD;
      also used for impaired balance, proprioception loss and decreased ROM in elderly population.&#xD;
      Proprioceptive receptors are present in our skin, muscles, tendons and joints with the help&#xD;
      of which we can sense position and movement of limbs and trunk, sense of force and sense of&#xD;
      heaviness in the absence of vision. The mechanoreceptors of the proprioception cause&#xD;
      activation of central nervous system by initiating action potential through release of stored&#xD;
      sodium in to the cells, this afferent sensory stimuli to the central nervous system is&#xD;
      essential for the control of body movements&#xD;

    <description>The assessment of functional mobility in community dwelling elderly population, is assessed precisely by a balance test called time up and go test.Time taken to complete the task is actually indicating the level of functional mobility. An elder participant taking less than 20 seconds to complete the task have been shown to be independent in ADLs. Time taken more than 30 seconds by an older subject, indicates more dependent in ADLs and requires assistive devices for ambulation.</description>

    <measure>Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA):</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline balance and gait to 8th Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>• The Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) is a widely used clinical assessment tool that gives an insight into the abnormalities in balance and gait, and it has the ability to predict fall risk in elderly population.• This scale has a total maximum score of 28 in which there is 12 score of gait assessment and 16 score of balance assessment. The overall score of 25-28 indicates low fall risk, 19-24 represents moderate fall risk and &lt;19 means there is high risk of fall in suspected elderly population. This scale has been declared has a valid and reliable tool to assess balance and gait impairments</description>
