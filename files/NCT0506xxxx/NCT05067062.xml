    <time_frame>baseline, acute, one week and two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use a beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring system (Portapres® Model 2, Finapres Medical Systems BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The Portapres® is a beat-to-beat finger pressure analyser that allows the non-invasive continuous measurement of hemodynamic parameters. The finger cuff will be positioned around the same finger of the left hand for each testing. All measurements will be taken in rest and during moderate-intensity exercise.&#xD;
Heart rate will be measured in beats/min.</description>
