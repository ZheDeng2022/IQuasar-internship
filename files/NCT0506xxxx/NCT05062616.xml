  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, demographic characteristics (age, gender, which toe is involved, family&#xD;
      history) of the patients who were operated because of ingrown nails were examined, and the&#xD;
      post-operative satisfaction score of the patients was noted, and the recurrence rate and&#xD;
      complications were recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as single-center, single-surgeon observational study. Approximately&#xD;
      4000 patients who were operated on by the same surgeon between 2015-2020 due to ingrown nails&#xD;
      were reached by phone, and patients' satisfaction was assessed by using the Surgical&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8). Outcomes such as retrospective treatment processes and&#xD;
      complications were asked using a questionnaire, and patients' demographic characteristics&#xD;
      were also recorded.&#xD;
