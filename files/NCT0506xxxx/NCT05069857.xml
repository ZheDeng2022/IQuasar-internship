  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 plus anti-VEGFR therapy for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced and resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma, and the CPS&gt;10 in the biopsy&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the previous &quot;Icemelting&quot; trial, neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 plus anti-VEGFR therapy was used in&#xD;
      20 patients with locally advanced and resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy was well-tolerated, with no grade 3-4 toxicity. The MPR rate was 40%&#xD;
      (8/20), including 5% (1/20) pathological complete response; furthermore, in the patients with&#xD;
      CPS&gt;10, the MPR rate was 100%. As we know, the MPR might transfer to survival benefit in the&#xD;
      patients received neoadjuvant therapy. Therefore, in this randomized phase II trial, we aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the survival benefit of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 plus anti-VEGFR therapy in the&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced OSCC and CPS&gt;10 (Icemelting-2 trial). A total of 46 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this trial, and the primary endpoint is 2-year disease-free survival&#xD;
      rate. The neoadjuvant therapy arm will receive three cycles of Carrelizumab plus Apatinib&#xD;
      with 14 days each, followed by the standard treatment of surgery and postoperative adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy. The control arm will received the standard treatment of surgery and postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
