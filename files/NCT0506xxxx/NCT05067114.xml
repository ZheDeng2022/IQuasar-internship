    <textblock>
      The aim of this demonstration project is to create an additional access point in the&#xD;
      community at local pharmacies for atrial fibrillation screening, detection, and referral to&#xD;
      physicians for follow-up and initiation of evidence-based therapy when appropriate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The APhA Foundation will implement the Solutions for Atrial Fibrillation Edvocacy (SAFE)&#xD;
      demonstration project integrating atrial fibrillation (Afib) screening, detection, and&#xD;
      referral services as a routine component of care in community-based pharmacies. The SAFE&#xD;
      solution is designed to improve awareness about Afib, increase access to screening and&#xD;
      education opportunities related to Afib, and offer a team-based approach to care that will&#xD;
      ultimately improve public health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-site study will utilize community pharmacies to identify patients at-risk for Afib&#xD;
      through point-of-care patient encounters, proactive patient profile reviews, risk assessment&#xD;
      tools, and AliveCor's FDA-cleared EKG technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of their usual and customary care, pharmacists can identify patients potentially&#xD;
      at-risk for Afib through routine patient encounters, proactive patient profile reviews, and&#xD;
      subsequent discussions with the patient. Identified patients will then be asked to complete a&#xD;
      stroke risk assessment which will help determine the patient's risk level. The pharmacist&#xD;
      will utilize the results from the stroke risk assessment to educate the patient on why these&#xD;
      factors could add risk, why it's important to monitor these factors, and how the patient can&#xD;
      work to reduce or improve upon certain modifiable risk factors. All patients will be educated&#xD;
      about the risks of Afib and the importance of future monitoring based on their risk level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be offered the opportunity to utilize the AliveCor EKG technology to&#xD;
      capture an EKG reading at the point-of-care. This FDA-cleared device is easy for patients to&#xD;
      use and a pharmacy team member will be available to guide the patient to ensure proper use.&#xD;
      Patients who are identified as having an abnormal heart rhythm, based on their EKG reading,&#xD;
      will be referred to their physician for evaluation and follow-up. Pharmacists will follow-up&#xD;
      with the patients that were referred to the physician to facilitate the transition of care&#xD;
      and inquire about confirmation of Afib and initiation of treatment. Coordination and&#xD;
      communication among patients, pharmacists, and physicians is the foundation of this&#xD;
      patient-centered team-based care approach.&#xD;
