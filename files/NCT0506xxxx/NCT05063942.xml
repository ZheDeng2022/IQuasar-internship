  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since emerging in the last months of 2019, over 127 000 000 individuals have suffered severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and the documented death&#xD;
      toll from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had reached 2788639 individuals globally by the&#xD;
      end of March 2021 (CDC, 2021).It is hoped that widespread vaccination will further limit&#xD;
      viral spread and shorten the length of the pandemic and its impact on morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. There are currently two vaccines against the new coronavirus: inactivated vaccines&#xD;
      and mRNA vaccines.Nationwide anti-COVID-19 vaccination began in China in March 2020, using&#xD;
      the inactivated vaccine. By the end of September 2021, 2206.054 million doses (including the&#xD;
      first and second doses of the vaccine) of the vaccines have been fulfilled.There is still a&#xD;
      lack of real-world data to assist clinicians in counseling their IVF patients regarding the&#xD;
      possible impact of recent recovery from COVID infection, or vaccination against it, on the&#xD;
      potential for success of ART. We aimed to determine the impact of confirmed COVID-19&#xD;
      immunization on IVF outcomes, by comparing live birth rate of the first transfer cycle in&#xD;
      patients undergoing IVF with and without COVID- 19 vaccination.&#xD;

      Since emerging in the last months of 2019, over 127 000 000 individuals have suffered severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and the documented death&#xD;
      toll from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had reached 2788639 individuals globally by the&#xD;
      end of March 2021 (CDC, 2021).Although a major victory has been achieved in the fight against&#xD;
      the epidemic since first case was reported in Wuhan City,, the cumulative death toll is 5,691&#xD;
      by the end of September in China . At the present time, mitigation strategies for controlling&#xD;
      the pandemic continue to rely heavily on universal masking, physical distancing, limiting&#xD;
      social interactions, and frequent sanitizing measures. It is hoped that widespread&#xD;
      vaccination will further limit viral spread and shorten the length of the pandemic and its&#xD;
      impact on morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently two vaccines against the new coronavirus: inactivated vaccines and mRNA&#xD;
      vaccines. Unlike inactivated vaccines, the mRNA vaccine does not use natural pathogens, but&#xD;
      artificially synthesizes the gene sequence encoding a specific antigen protein, and then&#xD;
      directly injects the mRNA encoding the antigen protein into the human body to induce the&#xD;
      immune system to produce antibodies against the new coronavirus. Although some studies have&#xD;
      shown that mRNA vaccines do not increase the risk of miscarriage in women, the conclusion is&#xD;
      limited due to the lack of non-pregnant women as a control group. At the same time, the&#xD;
      impact of inactivated vaccines on female pregnancy is still in a blank state. Nationwide&#xD;
      anti-COVID-19 vaccination began in China in March 2020, using the inactivated vaccine&#xD;
      vaccine. By the end of September 2021, 2206.054 million doses (including the first and second&#xD;
      doses of the vaccine) of the vaccines have been fulfilled. We aimed to determine the impact&#xD;
      of confirmed COVID-19 immunization on IVF outcomes, by comparing live birth rate of the first&#xD;
      transfer cycle in patients undergoing IVF with and without COVID- 19 vaccination.&#xD;
