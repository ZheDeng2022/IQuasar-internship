      The investigators aim to carry out a retrospective observational study, analysing lung&#xD;
      ultrasound images from patients who have presented to A&amp;E for routine diagnostic purposes&#xD;
      (ruling out cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, Pulmonary embolism and pericardial effusions) and&#xD;
      systematically assessing for abnormalities typical for COVID-19 infection (Pleural&#xD;
      irregularities, B lines, consolidations, pleural effusions). Doing this, the investigators&#xD;
      will also develop a suggestion for a standardised technique for lung ultrasound which can be&#xD;
      transferred to other clinical settings (Intensive Care, Acute medical Unit) and could form&#xD;
      the basis for an international standard. Thirdly, the investigators aim to correlate our&#xD;
      findings to clinical severity judged by oxygenation status on arrival in ED. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, this is the first study of this kind.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a new disease significant morbidity and mortality which has reached pandemic&#xD;
      status. Due to its highly contagious nature, is essential to characterise the disease&#xD;
      pathology quickly and reliably. The lung changes that can be seen in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      can precede clinical symptoms and are picked up on ultrasound more reliably than on&#xD;
      conventional chest XR. In addition, ultrasound is devoid of harmful radiation, is quick to&#xD;
      perform, and easily learned by doctors who routinely use ultrasound such as in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department. To date, there is no data systematically analysing the ultrasound changes in&#xD;
      COVID-19 and relating this to disease severity. The data from our study will be contribute&#xD;
      significantly to developing strategies for safe triage with regards to cohorting, diagnosis&#xD;
      and prognosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, lung ultrasound scans will be retrospectively analysed that were&#xD;
      obtained from patients who presented to the emergency department during March-May 2020 with&#xD;
      shortness of breath, who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 either by PCR test or&#xD;
      composite diagnostic criteria of lymphopenia and positive Chest XR or CT scan report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lung ultrasound images will be retrospectively scored for the presence of absence of 5&#xD;
      lung abnormalities (pleural irregularity, B lines, small peripheral consolidation, large&#xD;
      consolidation, small effusion (&lt;1cm) and large effusion (&gt;1cm). Scoring will be performed by&#xD;
      2 independent observers with experience in lung ultrasound. In addition, each abnormality&#xD;
      will be analysed for preferential location within the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be grouped into 4 groups of clinical severity (normal oxygenation, mild,&#xD;
      moderate and severe deficit in oxygenation) based on the BERLIN criteria for ARDS, and lung&#xD;
      abnormalities as seen on lung ultrasound will be analysed for correlation to clinical&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
