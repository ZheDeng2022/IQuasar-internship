  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the population occurrence rate of flat,&#xD;
      inverted, or retracted nipples (FIRN) in pregnant women in our obstetrical practice through&#xD;
      prenatal evaluation at the NOB visit and re-evaluation at the 28th-30th week of gestation, to&#xD;
      determine the benefit of using Supple Cups as treatment for FIRN for 6-8 weeks in the third&#xD;
      trimester to evert the nipples prior to delivery, and to evaluate the effect of prenatal&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of FIRN on establishment of latch and breastfeeding rates in the&#xD;
      postpartum period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that breastfeeding is the most clinically optimal method of feeding&#xD;
      for infants through the first year of life, however exclusive breastfeeding rates in the&#xD;
      United States remain low. Many women have difficulty establishing breastfeeding in the first&#xD;
      few weeks after birth which leads to the use of formula supplementation. For approximately&#xD;
      10% of women this difficulty is caused by flat, inverted or retracted nipples (FIRN) which&#xD;
      make it very difficult to latch when attempting to breastfeed. Many women are not diagnosed&#xD;
      with FIRN until after the baby is born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supple Cups are promising as a prenatal and postnatal intervention to elongate nipples in&#xD;
      cases of FIRN, allowing women with these biological variations to successfully breastfeed. If&#xD;
      women are diagnosed in the early prenatal period with FIRN, Supple Cup use can be initiated&#xD;
      to elongate and prepare the nipples for breastfeeding postpartum. Pre-natal diagnosis of FIRN&#xD;
      is critical to enable breastfeeding immediately postpartum.&#xD;
