  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has shown to have beneficial health effects for patients with breast, prostate and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Exercise programs have been successful at improving quality of life and&#xD;
      other important health indicators in controlled, lab-based exercise interventions. To&#xD;
      implement this knowledge into community programs, exercise programs must be trialed in&#xD;
      community settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an online community-based group&#xD;
      exercise program within a larger model of care, for patients with breast, prostate and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Participants will be randomized to a 3 month online exercise program or to&#xD;
      a usual care control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing timepoints are baseline, 3 months (end of intervention) and 6 months (3 month&#xD;
      followup). At these timepoints, patients will be asked to fill in online questionaires, and&#xD;
      and undergo physical tests. A subgroup of the patients, personal trainers and Healthcare&#xD;
      Professionals involved in the program will also be asked to participate in in depth&#xD;
      interviews about the experiences of being involved in the program.&#xD;

      The primary aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of Ex-Med Cancer Sweden on&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in people diagnosed with breast, prostate, and colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to examine the effect of the program on other important endpoints such&#xD;
      as physical activity level, physical function, muscle strength, exercise capacity, symptoms,&#xD;
      and body composition (lean and fat mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sustainability of the effects of the supervised program, the study includes&#xD;
      a 3-month follow-up time point (6 months post baseline)&#xD;
