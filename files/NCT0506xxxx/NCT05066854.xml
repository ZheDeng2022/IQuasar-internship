  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INVICTUS PED primary objective is to show the non-inferiority of an empirical antibiotic&#xD;
      therapeutic management guided by the early detection of integrons in the urine, compared to a&#xD;
      usual empirical antibiotic treatment, for the recovery of children admitted to the pediatric&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) with a non-severe urinary tract infection (UTI) with fever&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections with fever are common in children and require primary health care&#xD;
      management. Because of the risk of immediate evolution to a systemic infection with long-term&#xD;
      renal scars, empirical antibiotic treatment is recommended. The French Group for Pediatric&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases (GPIP) recommends the use of third-generation cephalosporins (3GC)&#xD;
      targeting enterobacteria, which are mainly involved in UTI and increasingly resistant to&#xD;
      antibiotics through the production of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases. However, use of 3GC is&#xD;
      a well-known risk factor for resistant germs selection and one of the main guideline to fight&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance, which is an important public health issue, is to reduce their use.&#xD;
      Integrons are genetic elements involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance in&#xD;
      enterobacteria. Preliminary studies showed that integron search using polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) directly on urine samples had a great NPV (&gt;98%) for&#xD;
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT). The hypothesis is that, in children presenting to the&#xD;
      pediatric ED with non-severe UTI with fever, absence of integron in their urine could allow&#xD;
      prescribing an empirical antibiotic treatment with SXT without decreasing the chance of&#xD;
      recovery, thus decreasing the use of 3GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two strategies is compare: i) In the control group: empirical antibiotic treatment according&#xD;
      to the usual practice of each center, in line with the GPIP guidelines, ii) in the&#xD;
      experimental group: empirical antibiotic treatment chosen depending on the results of the&#xD;
      integron search with PCR. When PCR is positive, treatment according to usual practice; when&#xD;
      PCR is negative, treatment with SXT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two follow-up visits, by phone, will be planned: at H48 (+ 24h), when the empirical&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment is assessed based on the urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility&#xD;
      test (AST) results, and on D30 (+/- 2 days) at the end of the follow-up.&#xD;
