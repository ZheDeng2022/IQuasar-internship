    <textblock>
      The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), a Swiss-based foundation, implemented a&#xD;
      complementary feeding project to improve dietary quality among children 6-59 months of age&#xD;
      living in Ethiopia by improving demand and access to safe and nutritious foods, in particular&#xD;
      eggs. Using a quasi-experimental design and two separate cross-sectional surveys at baseline&#xD;
      and end-line, the evaluation seeks to determine the effects of the program on egg&#xD;
      consumption, food diversity, availability of eggs, caregivers' behaviours toward eggs,&#xD;
      caregivers' willingness to pay for eggs, and consumption of commercially available&#xD;
      complementary foods.&#xD;

      The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), a Swiss-based foundation, implemented a&#xD;
      complementary feeding project to improve dietary quality among children 6-59 months of age&#xD;
      living in Ethiopia by improving demand and access to safe and nutritious foods, in particular&#xD;
      eggs. GAIN's complementary feeding project has four main components. Component one focuses on&#xD;
      facilitating availability of nutritious food to targeted consumers (children 6-59 month) with&#xD;
      the aim of improving suppliers' capacity to produce nutritious foods through formal and on&#xD;
      the job trainings as well as facilitating enabling environment for the distribution of the&#xD;
      products. Component two of the project involves distribution channels identification to&#xD;
      strengthen or activate Kiosks to increase availability of nutritious food especially eggs.&#xD;
      Component three, the demand creation component, seeks to stimulate demand among caregivers of&#xD;
      children 6-59 months of age for nutritious food for their children. Finally, component four,&#xD;
      the enabling environment component, seeks to strengthen the enabling environment for&#xD;
      sustainable production and distribution of nutritious food for children as one of the&#xD;
      solutions to improve nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a quasi-experimental design and two separate cross-sectional surveys at baseline and&#xD;
      end-line, the evaluation seeks to determine the effects of the program on egg consumption,&#xD;
      food diversity, availability of eggs, caregivers' behaviours toward eggs, caregivers'&#xD;
      willingness to pay for eggs, and consumption of commercially available complementary foods.&#xD;

    <description>The study promoted two main products: 1) Cerifam, a fortified complementary food popular in Ethiopia, and 2) eggs.&#xD;
GAIN supported Faffa Food to redesign and label their Cerifam product, developed a manual for the manufacturing of complementary food and trained processors and regulators, provided Faffa Food with technical expertise to develop a business model, and financially and technically support the Ethiopian Standard Agency to develop a national standard for formulated complementary foods.&#xD;
GAIN provided training to egg farmers to increase their egg production and marketing, helped increase mother's access to eggs by making them more available in local kiosks and getting retailers to display promotional messages around eggs, conducted sensitization workshops with retailers to increase egg purchases, and employed a demand creation campaign.</description>
