    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a public health condition, which causes great functional disability.&#xD;
      Conventional treatment modalities have been shown a very poor therapeutic response, in that&#xD;
      most individuals end up becoming poly-medicated and refractory to treatment.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological techniques with promising effects on the syndrome symptoms include both&#xD;
      hypnotic analgesia and the transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). Giving the&#xD;
      treatment limitations of this syndrome its important to better understand the pain processess&#xD;
      in fibromyalgia and treatments effect. This project was developed in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      synergistic effect of a hypnotic analgesia suggestion associated with tDCS over pain levels&#xD;
      and cortical excitability in individuals with fibromyalgia over a nociceptive stimulation&#xD;
      pattern.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a public health condition, which causes great functional disability. Its&#xD;
      consequences pervade the personal and social life of the patient, leading to significant&#xD;
      impairments in their interpersonal relationships, including work, family and social spheres.&#xD;
      The symptoms affect both the physical and emotional abilities. Conventional treatment&#xD;
      modalities have been shown a very poor therapeutic response, in that most individuals end up&#xD;
      becoming poly-medicated and refractory to treatment. Non-pharmacological techniques with&#xD;
      promising effects on the syndrome symptoms include both hypnotic analgesia and the&#xD;
      transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). Giving the treatment limitations of this&#xD;
      syndrome its important to better understand the pain processess in fibromyalgia and&#xD;
      treatments effect. This project was developed in order to evaluate the synergistic effect of&#xD;
      a hypnotic analgesia suggestion associated with tDCS over pain levels and cortical&#xD;
      excitability in individuals with fibromyalgia over a nociceptive stimulation pattern. It will&#xD;
      be performed as a blinded sham controlled cross-over randomized clinical trial. It will be&#xD;
      included 20 female subjects diagnosed with fibromyalgia, according to the 2016 revision of&#xD;
      the American College of Rheumatologycriteria (2010;2011), ranging in age from 18 to 65 years&#xD;
      old, highly susceptible to the hypnosis technique (score â‰¥ 8) according to the&#xD;
      Waterloo-Stanford Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (WSGC). They will be allocated in one of&#xD;
      two groups, receiving with each cross-over one of the following interventions: A&#xD;
      (active-tDCS), B (hypnotic analgesia suggestion), C (Rest), D (active-tDCS + hypnotic&#xD;
      analgesia suggestion) and E (sham-tDCS + hypnotic analgesia suggestion). The primary&#xD;
      endpoints will be the level of pain, measured by a numerical pain scale (NPS), during&#xD;
      nociceptive stimuli induced by the cold pressor test and Short Intracortical Inhibition&#xD;
      (SICI). The secondary endpoints will be descent pain modulation system power through the&#xD;
      Conditioned Pain Modulation test (CPM - task); and the cortical excitability assessed by&#xD;
      Motor Threshold (MT), Motor Evoked Potential (MEP), Cortical Silent Period (CSP) and Short&#xD;
      Intracortical Facilitation (SICF) tests during Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The&#xD;
      intra and inter-group comparisons will be made by means of two-way ANOVA followed by&#xD;
      Bonferroni. A type I error of 5% and type II error of 20%. The present study hypothesizes a&#xD;
      synergistic effect of both interventions on pain intensity reported on the Cold Pressor Test,&#xD;
      as well as the reduction in the inhibition of cortical excitability level assessed by the&#xD;
      TMS, compared to the same measures in an isolated manner.&#xD;
