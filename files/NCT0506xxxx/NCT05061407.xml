  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Access to safe surgery is a basic human right. This is highlighted by the work of the Lancet&#xD;
      Commission on Global Surgery. There is a large burden of surgical disease in the paediatric&#xD;
      surgical population with a large unmet need. In Africa, children comprise a significant&#xD;
      proportion of the population with approximately 50% of the population being ≤19 years old.&#xD;
      Limited data from Africa suggests the risk factors for, incidence and outcomes associated&#xD;
      with paediatric surgical complications differ from HICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The African Surgical Outcomes Study (ASOS) has described surgical outcomes in adult patients&#xD;
      in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to determine the burden of the complications in paediatric surgical patients&#xD;
      in Africa, and the risk factors for and the type of complications experienced. Once this&#xD;
      study is completed, the investigators will be able to target appropriate interventions to&#xD;
      improve surgical outcomes for children in Africa. The investigators have the capacity to do&#xD;
      this important work, through the African Perioperative Research Group (APORG) group.&#xD;

      Surgery is a cost-effective public health intervention. There are significant disparities in&#xD;
      access to and the safety of surgical and anaesthesia services in low and middle-income&#xD;
      countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries (HICs). There is a large burden of&#xD;
      surgical disease in the paediatric surgical population with a large unmet need. In Africa,&#xD;
      children comprise a significant proportion of the population with approximately 50% of the&#xD;
      population being ≤19 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications are an important determinant of surgical morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Limited data from Africa suggests the risk factors for, incidence and outcomes associated&#xD;
      with paediatric surgical complications differ from HICs. In the prospective, observational&#xD;
      South African Paediatric Surgical Outcomes Study (SAPSOS), the patients in this middle-income&#xD;
      country (MIC), had double the incidence of complications, and the types of complications&#xD;
      differed from HICs, with a predominance of infective complications. Furthermore, the risk&#xD;
      factors for complications (ASA physical status, urgency of surgery, severity of surgery and&#xD;
      infective indication for surgery) were different from HICs, where risk factors include&#xD;
      gestational age, ASA physical status &gt;3, a history of cardiovascular disease, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular, neurological, or orthopaedic surgical procedures. Postoperative mortality was&#xD;
      ten times higher in South Africa than in a prospective study in HICs. A prospective study of&#xD;
      paediatric perioperative mortality in 24 Kenyan hospitals showed a 7 day postoperative&#xD;
      mortality of 1.7%, which is 17 times higher than that reported in HICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The African Surgical Outcomes Study (ASOS) has described surgical outcomes in adult patients&#xD;
      in Africa. Patients had a lower risk profile and fewer complications compared to those in&#xD;
      HICs. However, the postoperative mortality was twice that of the global average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to determine the burden of the complications in paediatric surgical patients&#xD;
      in Africa, and the risk factors for and the type of complications experienced. Once this&#xD;
      study is completed, the investigators will be able to target appropriate interventions to&#xD;
      improve surgical outcomes for children in Africa. The investigators have the capacity to do&#xD;
      this important work, through the African Perioperative Research Group (APORG) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of in-hospital postoperative complications up to&#xD;
      30 days post-surgery in paediatric surgical patients &lt;18 years in Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Fourteen-day, international African multi-centre prospective cohort study of&#xD;
      paediatric patients (&lt;18 years) undergoing surgery. This study will be registered on&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov. Patients will be followed up for a maximum of 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the incidence of in-hospital postoperative complications in paediatric&#xD;
      surgical patients in Africa. Secondary outcome measures include mortality rate for patients &lt;&#xD;
      18 years undergoing surgery in Africa, risk factors associated with in-hospital&#xD;
      complications, time from first presentation to operation, incidence of severe intraoperative&#xD;
      critical incidents, level of qualification of anesthesia and surgery providers and number of&#xD;
      specialists per paediatric population, and rate of admission to critical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention is to present a representative sample of paediatric surgical outcomes across&#xD;
      all African countries. This study will run from October 2021 until December 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS APPROVAL A waiver of consent has been approved by the IRB with the proviso that an&#xD;
      approved broadcasting document and pictorial description are both placed for patients to see&#xD;
      around the hospital and in the relevant wards. The requirement for patient consent is&#xD;
      expected to vary according to regulations of the participating nations. the national leaders&#xD;
      will ensure ethics approval is obtained form their respective countries and centres. Centres&#xD;
      will not be permitted to record data unless ethics approval and an equivalent waiver is in&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREPARATORY WORK Prior leadership in the South African Paediatric Surgical Outcomes Study&#xD;
      (SAPSOS) and the African Surgical Outcomes Study (ASOS) have ensured tested resource&#xD;
      resources necessary to run this study. This will be the first continental collaborative study&#xD;
      of paediatric surgical outcomes in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE OF THIS STUDY Surgery is associated with significant morbidity. Accurate&#xD;
      information regarding the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with paediatric&#xD;
      surgery in Africa would allow for appropriate allocation of resources in the future, and the&#xD;
      implementation of interventions to improve paediatric patient outcomes. This study therefore&#xD;
      has important public health implications for Africa. This study will also provide the&#xD;
      necessary data to develop future collaborative work to improve African surgical paediatric&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
