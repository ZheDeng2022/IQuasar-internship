  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose, non-randomised, parallel group study. Participant will be&#xD;
      enrolled in 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 will include 8 participants with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular&#xD;
           filtration rate [eGFR] of ≥15 to &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 will include 8 healthy participants with normal renal function (eGFR of ≥ 90&#xD;
           mL/min/1.73 m^2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 will include 12 participants with ESRD on dialysis (eGFR of &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73&#xD;
           m^2). Cohort 3 will be sub-divided into 2 cohorts, Cohort 3a and Cohort 3b (8 and 4&#xD;
           participants respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants in Cohort 3a will receive a single dose of AZD8233 the day after&#xD;
                haemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants in Cohort 3b will receive a single SC dose of AZD8233 1 hour before&#xD;
                the start of the haemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive the study drug on Day 1, discharged on Day 2 followed by out-patient&#xD;
      follow-up visits on Day 3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 90.&#xD;
