  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study was conducted the patients with rotator cuff tears who underwent rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair surger.The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups and a total of 20 subjects&#xD;
      were randomized in a single block order using RandomAllocation Software 1.0.0 by simple&#xD;
      randomization.All evaluation and treatment was done by the same physiotherapist.The first&#xD;
      group was included in the traditional treatment program after rotator cuff repair, while the&#xD;
      second group was included in the myofascial release program, 2 sessions a week between the&#xD;
      4th and 7th weeks, in addition to the traditional treatment.&#xD;

      Patients in the 2 groups undergoing rc repair were also included in a similar physiotherapy&#xD;
      program.Immobilization with a sling was made for 4-6 weeks after surgery. In addition to&#xD;
      physiotherapy in group 2, myofascial release therapy was applied to the upper trapezius,&#xD;
      sternocloidomastoideus, pectoral muscles (major, minor) 2 days a week between the 4th and 7th&#xD;
      weeks after surgery, in addition to the conventional treatment. Myofascial treatment took&#xD;
      30-45 minutes per session.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>randomised controlled study this study was conducted with rotator cuff tear patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff treatment.&#xD;
The patients' pain intensity, joint range of motion, flexibility of shoulder muscles, grip and muscle strength, shoulder function evaluations and physical characteristics, age, differences between body mass index were evaluated with Mann Whitney-U test.Measurements before and after treatment were evaluated with the Wilcoxon test. Friedman test was performed for the measurements made at postoperative 3, 7, and 12 weeks before in-group treatment. Bonferoni correction was done for possible differences.</intervention_model_description>
