  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurodevelopmental follow-up of infants at high-risk such as preterm born is necessary in&#xD;
      order to early detect impairments and early start a supportive/therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
      Valid tools should be available for screening infants with developmental problems even where&#xD;
      resources are limited. Such screening would ensure an adequate medical care during and after&#xD;
      hospital discharge as well as evidence-based parental pre- and postnatal counselling. While&#xD;
      in Switzerland, these tools are specifically needed for the neurodevelopmental surveillance&#xD;
      of moderate to late pretem born infants, in low- and mid-income countries, they are needed to&#xD;
      monitor the whole population of preterm born infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fill this important gap, the present study aims to determine whether it is feasible to&#xD;
      extend neurodevelopmental screening (currently offered to only a very small part of children&#xD;
      born preterm), by using a new cost-effective neurodevelopmental assessment, the&#xD;
      INTERGROWTH-21st Neurodevelopment Assessment (INTER-NDA, www.inter-nda.com Assessment) at age&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;

      The pirmary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In very preterm born infants (born &lt; 32 weeks' gestation)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To assess the concurrent validity of the INTER-NDA with the Bayley-III[13] at 2 years&#xD;
           of corrected age in VPT infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In moderate to late preterm infants (born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation) - To&#xD;
           screen neurodevelopment performances at corrected 2 years of corrected age in MLPT&#xD;
           infants by means of the INTER-NDA and to compare values with international INTER-NDA&#xD;
           standard values.&#xD;
