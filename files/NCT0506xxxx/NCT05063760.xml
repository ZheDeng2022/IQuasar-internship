  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is effective in prevention &amp; treatment of chronic diseases. Exercise can&#xD;
      reduce late toxicity of chemotherapy, commonly found in cancer survivors, which is yet to be&#xD;
      translated into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of exercise benefits in oncologic patients are far from being elucidated, and&#xD;
      include increase in muscle mass, reduction of fat mass, systemic inflammation and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk. Synchronization of exercise adaptive response is, to an extent,&#xD;
      mediated by bioactive molecules released from muscle, with anti-inflammatory &amp;&#xD;
      tumor-suppressing properties. Muscle satellite cells are a source of regeneration, muscle&#xD;
      structural integrity &amp; functional capacity. Phenotypes of muscle cells, such as secretory&#xD;
      profile, lipid &amp; glucose metabolism, mirror clinical phenotypes of the donor. Importantly,&#xD;
      muscle cells' metabolism in vitro can be modulated by 8-12 week training in vivo. Epigenetic&#xD;
      mechanisms regulating muscle &amp; systemic metabolism in cancer survivors are not yet&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of 6-month supervised, individualized aerobic-strength exercise&#xD;
           training intervention in cancer survivors with chemotherapy-induced late toxicity . (i)&#xD;
           on the whole-body energy and glucose metabolism, anthropometric parameters, physical&#xD;
           fitness &amp; activity profile, motor functions and quality of life in testicular germ cell&#xD;
           cancer (TGCC) survivors, more than 3 years after cisplatin-based chemotherapy; with the&#xD;
           2-year follow up; . (ii) on skeletal muscle mass, morphology as well as functional and&#xD;
           metabolic state detected in vivo (31P-MR spectroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) on metabolic characteristics of primary skeletal muscle cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the impact of exercise intervention on circulating bioactive molecules&#xD;
           (exerkines), putative mediators of exercise health benefits as well as on levels of&#xD;
           circulating inflammatory cytokines, which likely contribute to the pathogenesis of&#xD;
           chemotherapy-induced late toxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the role of (a) selected exercise-regulated bioactive molecules, (b)&#xD;
           exercise-mimicking treatment (by electric pulse stimulation) and (c) cisplatin treatment&#xD;
           on metabolism and mitochondrial function of differentiated human muscle cells in&#xD;
           culture;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the associations between intervention-induced shifts in circulating&#xD;
           bioactive molecules and selected metabolic, anthropometric and motor parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The generated results will enable us (i) to gain a better insight into pathomechanisms of&#xD;
      muscle-associated chemotherapy-induced late toxicity and the role of skeletal muscle &amp;&#xD;
      systemic mediators in the exercise-induced health benefits in TGCC survivors; and (ii) to&#xD;
      validate the effectiveness of the individually-tailored exercise intervention in reducing&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related toxicity in patients with TGCC, with the aim to transfer this knowledge&#xD;
      into clinical practice.&#xD;
