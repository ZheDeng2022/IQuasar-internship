    <textblock>
      Case series of a retrospective study of patients operated for distal adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      stomach, either by total gastrectomy or distal gastrectomy at Ibn Rochd University Hospital&#xD;
      in Casablanca, with the analysis of outcome of patients on a follow up periode of three years&#xD;
      and eight months.&#xD;

      Thirty (30) patients were treated for gastric cancer and were included in this study. The&#xD;
      average age was 64 years, the sex ratio 1.5. Twenty eight patients underwent a distal&#xD;
      gastrectomy and 2 patients underwent total gastrectomy. The median number of lymph nodes&#xD;
      resected was 6 following distal gastrectomy versus 26 after total gastrectomy. Resection&#xD;
      margins were clean except for three patients who underwent a distal gastrectomy.&#xD;
      Postoperative complicationsoccured in 05 patients. They were mainly infectious, anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage. Two 2 cases of postoperative mortality (&lt;30 days) among patients with distal&#xD;
      gastrectomy was noted. A progression to metastasis was found in 3 patients with subtotal&#xD;
      gastrectomy, two of whom had insufficient lymph node clearance, compared to no cases of&#xD;
      metastasis in patients with total gastrectomy.&#xD;
