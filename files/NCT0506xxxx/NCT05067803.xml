  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The product is comprised of software that aids in automated guided ultrasound image&#xD;
      acquisition for novice users (medical professional without experience in performing&#xD;
      echocardiography, e.g. nurses, physicians assistants, medical doctors, medical student etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software provides real-time feedback during image acquisition to optimize image capture&#xD;
      and determine whether image quality is sufficient for medical evaluation. The software is&#xD;
      designed to be used with any echocardiographic ultrasound system. The Philips Lumify&#xD;
      hand-held ultrasound device will be used for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Images can be acquired manually by a novice user.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each novice user will have a training course of 8 hours, before the study commences.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is a single center, multi-reader multi-case study, primarily designed to&#xD;
      obtain the quality of the echocardiography exam, obtained by novice users when using the USEG&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subject will undergo the examination twice on a single study visit : once by one of&#xD;
      novice users when using the USEG software and once by one of the expert sonographers without&#xD;
      the aid of the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each novice user will perform the examination on 15-20 subjects (depending on the number of&#xD;
      novice user, with the aim that the number of examinations by each novice will be the same).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment of the novice user and expert sonographer to subjects and their order within a&#xD;
      subject will be based upon their availability once the subject's is enrolled. In case of more&#xD;
      than 1 available novice, the exam will be assigned to the novice with the least exams&#xD;
      performed so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 10 subjects will be enrolled from each of the following three BMI groups= &lt; 25; =25&#xD;
      to &lt;30; =&gt; 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an informed consent is obtained, screening was completed and eligibility has been&#xD;
      confirmed, each subject will undergo the examination twice on the day of visit (Day 1): once&#xD;
      by a novice user and once by an expert sonographer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of any administrative delay, the investigator may address the issue with the sponsor,&#xD;
      and upon approval, the second examination may be postponed in up to 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novice user will obtain 10 clips using the UltraSight guidance software for 10&#xD;
      pre-defined views from each patient, and an expert sonographer will obtain 10 clips for the&#xD;
      same 10 views without the aid of the UltraSight software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in which the novice user and expert sonographer performs the examination per&#xD;
      patient will be based on their availability once the subject's is enrolled. In case of more&#xD;
      than 1 available novice, the exam will be assigned to the novice with the least exams&#xD;
      performed so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored throughout the visit.&#xD;
