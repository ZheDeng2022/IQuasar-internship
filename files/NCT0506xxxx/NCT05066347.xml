  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope (fainting) is a common reason for emergency department (ED) presentation. Fainting&#xD;
      can be caused by heart conditions such as irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can be&#xD;
      life-threatening, structural heart problems, or serious conditions not related to the heart.&#xD;
      The standard or usual treatment for the majority of patients at-risk for irregular heart&#xD;
      rhythm is getting discharged home with no heart rhythm monitoring. If patients receive any&#xD;
      monitoring, only Holter monitoring device that records all heart beats for 24 hours to 72&#xD;
      hours will be used. One-third to half of irregular heart rhythm will be identified only after&#xD;
      patients are either discharged from the ED or hospitalized in an inpatient unit. One-third to&#xD;
      half of irregular heart rhythm will be identified only after patients are either discharged&#xD;
      from the ED or hospitalized in an inpatient unit. The study hypothesize that prolonged live&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm monitoring (15 days) of at-risk syncope patients, discharged from the ED, will&#xD;
      lead to identification of irregular heart rhythm, which can lead to improved patient safety&#xD;
      and lower healthcare costs.&#xD;

      Syncope is defined as a sudden, transient loss of consciousness followed by spontaneous&#xD;
      complete recovery.14 It is caused by transient global cerebral hypoperfusion due to decreased&#xD;
      cardiac output, excessive vasodilatation, or both. The most common causes include a)reflex&#xD;
      (i.e., vasovagal syncope); b)cardiac syncope; and c)orthostatic hypotension. Syncope accounts&#xD;
      for 1-3% of ED visits and ~6% of admissions from the ED to hospital. Each year, syncope&#xD;
      accounts for approximately 160,000 ED visits in Canada, with direct hospital costs of&#xD;
      approximately $130 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED management of syncope: Overall, up to 10% of patients seen in the ED for syncope will have&#xD;
      serious underlying conditions e.g., serious arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, significant&#xD;
      hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism] identified and/or die from these conditions within the next&#xD;
      30 days. Until recently, valid and reliable evidence to inform these decisions has been&#xD;
      lacking. Professional medical societies in Europe and North America have long called for the&#xD;
      development of practical and accurate tools to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and&#xD;
      high-risk groups to aid in management decisions. One-third to half of these serious&#xD;
      conditions will be identified ONLY AFTER they are either discharged from the ED or&#xD;
      hospitalized in an inpatient unit, emphasizing the challenge in risk-stratification and ED&#xD;
      disposition decision-making. Of these serious conditions that are identified after ED&#xD;
      disposition, 68.8% are arrhythmias. While the non-arrhythmias are identified in the first few&#xD;
      days after the ED visit , arrhythmias tend to be identified up to two weeks after the ED&#xD;
      visit. The hypothesis is that prolonged live cardiac rhythm monitoring of at-risk ED syncope&#xD;
      patients, defined as those with CSRS score ≥3 discharged from the ED, will lead to&#xD;
      identification of important arrhythmia or ruling out an arrhythmic etiology and consequently&#xD;
      to improved patient safety and lower healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work: Two large multicentre prospective studies were completed to derive and&#xD;
      validate the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS) by enrolling 8176 patients from 11 Canadian&#xD;
      EDs in whom no serious condition was identified during the index ED evaluation. The CSRS was&#xD;
      developed conforming to both methodological standards for clinical decision tool development&#xD;
      and reported as per the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for&#xD;
      Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guideline. Overall, 9.0% of patients were&#xD;
      hospitalized and 3.6% suffered 30-day serious outcomes after ED disposition. The CSRS score&#xD;
      ranges from -3 to +11. The risk categories were simplified into low, medium, and high, and&#xD;
      the 30-day serious outcomes for each of the three risk categories. The incidence of&#xD;
      arrhythmias in the medium and high-risk groups were 4.9% and 18.0% respectively. Given the&#xD;
      importance of occult arrhythmia and uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring, the time interval was analyzed from ED arrival to arrhythmias&#xD;
      detection/intervention or unexplained death and found that half of all arrhythmic outcomes&#xD;
      were identified within 2 hours among low-risk patients and within 6 hours among medium- and&#xD;
      high-risk patients. Furthermore, the more serious, ventricular arrhythmias occurred only in&#xD;
      medium and high-risk patients, and 92% of all arrhythmias among these risk groups were&#xD;
      identified within 15 days. These latencies are highly relevant to decisions regarding the&#xD;
      utility of cardiac monitoring during and after an ED visit for syncope, with implications for&#xD;
      the rational deployment of emerging technology such as outpatient telemetry which permits&#xD;
      real-time identification of serious arrhythmias. The above inferences regarding cardiac&#xD;
      rhythm monitoring are based on the secondary analysis of observational data. There are no&#xD;
      previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the role of outpatient prolonged&#xD;
      cardiac monitoring to detect occult arrhythmias among CSRS medium and high-risk syncope&#xD;
      patients discharged from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a wide variations in ED management, including admission rates (range from 5.3% to&#xD;
      19.6% among sites) and outpatient cardiac testing, very low yield for advanced neuroimaging,&#xD;
      and inefficiencies in hospital admission (among those hospitalized, 46.5% were for suspected&#xD;
      arrhythmias, of whom 71.2% had no cause for syncope identified during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Analyzing our cohort, the study found that CSRS low-risk patients will benefit the least from&#xD;
      hospitalization and CSRS high risk patients the most. Currently, 21.6% of CSRS medium-risk&#xD;
      patients are hospitalized primarily because of concern for underlying arrhythmia, yet the&#xD;
      mortality and the likelihood of identifying an underlying ventricular arrhythmia within 30&#xD;
      days among these patients is very low. Advances in ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring&#xD;
      suggest that this group is an ideal target for outpatient monitoring, forgoing hospital.&#xD;
      admission after ED assessment. A pilot study was recently with 15-day out of hospital live&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm monitoring of 72 CSRS medium and high-risk patients and found that live&#xD;
      cardiac monitoring of at-risk ED syncope patients is feasible, safe, and acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the study hypothesize that a strategy of prolonged outpatient cardiac rhythm&#xD;
      monitoring compared to usual care of at-risk syncope patients, defined as those with CSRS&#xD;
      score ≥3 when discharged from the ED will lead to improved detection of arrhythmias that&#xD;
      require treatment and improve patient safety, healthcare efficiency and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      What are the principal research questions to be addressed? The overall objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate a strategy of 15-day live cardiac rhythm monitoring versus usual care at&#xD;
      improving the identification of an arrhythmia that required treatment among at-risk syncope&#xD;
      patients discharged from the ED through a patient level RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate a strategy of 15-day live cardiac rhythm&#xD;
      monitoring versus usual care at improving the identification of an arrhythmia that required&#xD;
      treatment among at-risk syncope patients discharged from the ED through a patient level RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: prospective patient-level multi-center RCT involving 13 participating EDs&#xD;
      across Canada. During the trial period, syncope patients will be block randomized to usual&#xD;
      care or prolonged outpatient cardiac rhythm monitoring in blocks of variable sizes and&#xD;
      stratified by risk scores (3-5, ≥6) and study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to usual care will receive all care as prescribed by the discharging&#xD;
      physician and there will be no study specific interventions. Patients randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive 24/7 live cardiac rhythm monitoring for 15 days (cardiophone;&#xD;
      an external loop recorder). If a patient is randomized to the intervention arm and was&#xD;
      prescribed outpatient cardiac monitoring such as Holter monitor, this will be replaced by the&#xD;
      24/7 live monitoring and will be applied either prior or within 24 hours of discharge from&#xD;
      the ED. As the intervention arm provides 24/7 live cardiac monitoring which is a higher level&#xD;
      of care than the control arm, there is no safety risk to the patients in the intervention&#xD;
      arm. Cardiophone evaluates all cardiac beats and rhythm abnormalities that are detected as&#xD;
      per the algorithm programmed into the device. These abnormalities are then automatically and&#xD;
      immediately transmitted to a central monitoring station without the need of any patient&#xD;
      intervention (device-triggered transmission). Additionally, the cardiac rhythm can also be&#xD;
      transmitted to the monitoring station immediately in the event the patient experiences&#xD;
      symptoms, by the touch of a button on the device (patient-triggered transmission). The&#xD;
      central monitoring station is in Windsor, Ontario (Canadian Cardiac Care) and is staffed&#xD;
      round the clock by certified electrocardiographic technicians and a cardiologist on-call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline and follow up: the study timeline is 18 months of patient enrollment and data&#xD;
      collection. The duration of treatment period for patients in the intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive 15 days of cardiac monitoring. All study patients will be followed at 30 days either&#xD;
      by telephone or email and at 1-year through data linkage with provincial health database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embedded observational study: validation of the CSRS ultra-low-risk criteria and to evaluate&#xD;
      if the CSRS can be updated to improve its accuracy, ED physician to obtain verbal consent&#xD;
      from patients who are lower risk (score &lt;3) for 30-day follow-up and addition of cardiac&#xD;
      biomarker using the left-over blood at study centers that are able to accomplish such&#xD;
      additional testing for research purposes. These patients will not be enrolled in the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
