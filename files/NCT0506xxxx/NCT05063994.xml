    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase III study of Chronocort®&#xD;
      compared with immediate-release hydrocortisone replacement therapy in participants aged 16&#xD;
      years and over with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of twice daily Chronocort with&#xD;
      twice daily immediate release hydrocortisone replacement therapy (IRHC) (Cortef®) over a&#xD;
      randomized treatment period of up to 52 weeks in participants aged 16 years and over with&#xD;
      known classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 hydroxylase deficiency. The&#xD;
      primary efficacy assessment of biochemical responder rate and the key secondary assessment of&#xD;
      dose responder rate will be assessed after 52 weeks of randomized treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>To compare Chronocort to IRHC in terms of the impact on QoL using the remaining self-completed SF-36® sub domains (excluding vitality).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4, 10, 16, 34, and 52 weeks of randomized treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to 4, 10, 16, 34, and 52 weeks of randomized treatment in QoL using the remaining self-completed SF 36® sub-domains (excluding vitality) will be summarized and compared between treatment arms. The SF-36 measures eight scales: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). All components contribute in different proportions to the overall measures. Where the minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 100, a high score is a more favorable score.</description>

             device within the 12 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;

             evaluation of androgen levels during the study period outside of this protocol's&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have previously been exposed to Chronocort in any Diurnal study.&#xD;
