  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will pilot test &quot;Baby Feed&quot; online web portals among clinicians and parents to&#xD;
      learn about their experience with the portals. Baby Feed evaluates infant diets online using&#xD;
      a validated Infant Food Frequency Questionnaire, provides immediate results online to health&#xD;
      care providers on nutrients and foods/beverages consumed above or below the recommended&#xD;
      levels, provides current diet recommendations by infant's age online, and helps track&#xD;
      progress at home. The investigators will recruit 2 clinicians from Borinquen Health Care&#xD;
      Center in Miami and 50 of their patients (parents with infants) scheduled for a routine&#xD;
      Well-Child Visit when infants are 4-12 months old. Participants will be equally randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention group or the control group. If randomized to Baby Feed, parents will discuss&#xD;
      the results with the healthcare professional and track their infants' diets at home. Parents&#xD;
      in the Control group will only complete the infant FFQ online but will not have access to the&#xD;
      other features of Baby Feed. After 3 months, the investigators will evaluate the infant diet&#xD;
      and weight gain during this period.&#xD;

      This project will pilot test &quot;Baby Feed&quot; online web portals among clinicians and parents to&#xD;
      learn about their experience with the portals. Baby Feed can (1) Quickly and easily evaluate&#xD;
      infant diets online using a validated Infant Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) developed by&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator [Parental Portal]; (2) Provide immediate results online to health&#xD;
      care providers on nutrients and foods/beverages consumed above or below the recommended&#xD;
      levels [Clinician Portal]; (3) Provide current diet recommendations by infant's age online to&#xD;
      health care providers to discuss with parents, with the goal of improving their infant's diet&#xD;
      [Clinician Portal]; (4) Give online access of the infant diet recommendations to parents for&#xD;
      home implementation, with an online short tracking component [Parental Portal].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 2 clinicians from Borinquen Health Care Center in Miami and 50&#xD;
      of their patients (parents with infants) scheduled for a routine Well-Child Visit when&#xD;
      infants are 4-12 months old. Participants will be equally randomized to the intervention&#xD;
      group or the control group. All parents will first complete the Infant FFQ online. Those&#xD;
      randomized to Baby Feed will discuss the results as a part of the Well-Child Visit with the&#xD;
      healthcare professional, who will also have access to the results from the Clinician Portal.&#xD;
      They will discuss the most relevant results and the dietary recommendations to follow at&#xD;
      home. Parents will also be able to see the recommendations online in the Parental Portal in a&#xD;
      friendly and graphic way to follow easily at home. Parents will be prompted to complete the&#xD;
      online short tracking questions once per week to evaluate how well they are following the&#xD;
      dietary recommendations during the duration of the study: 3 months. Parents in the Control&#xD;
      group will only complete the infant FFQ online but will not have access to the other features&#xD;
      of Baby Feed. After 3 months, the investigators will evaluate the infant diet by reviewing&#xD;
      the results from the infant FFQ at baseline and 3 months later in both groups. The&#xD;
      investigators will also evaluate weight gain during this period and compare between groups.&#xD;
      For this, the investigators will ask all parents to complete online a short form with the&#xD;
      weight and length of the baby as recorded by the nurse in each Well-Child Visit at baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS/BENEFITS: The main risk or discomfort from this research is the disclosure of personal&#xD;
      information. The main benefit to those randomized to the intervention group is that&#xD;
      clinicians will be receiving automatic results and dietary recommendations in &quot;Baby Feed&quot;&#xD;
      online to discuss with parents, and for parents is receiving dietary recommendations from&#xD;
      &quot;Baby Feed&quot; online to improve their infant's diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE: Baby Feed could be an important tool to help promote adherence&#xD;
      to diet recommendations which could translate into healthy weight gain during the first year&#xD;
      and thus prevent long-term obesity.&#xD;

    <measure>Diet quality using the Diet Quality Index Score (DQIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the results from the infant FFQ, the investigators will calculate the DQIS score, which is composed of 9 food groups: breastfeeding and milk, grains, proteins, vegetables, fruits, 100% juices, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and salty snacks. A total of 5 points are assigned if the intake is within the recommended amounts, 2.5 points if the intake is slightly over or under recommended amount, and 0 points if the intake is excessive or not consumed. The points are summed, and diet quality is categorized as Excellent (score: 45-55), Good (score: 35-44), Needs Improvement (score: 25-34), and Poor (score: 0-24).</description>

    <measure>Rate of weight gain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will calculate the weight z score and weight-for-length z score using the WHO Anthro Survey Analyzer. The rate of weight gain will be calculated as the change in weight z score between visits and categorized as: (1) Adequate weight gain (change of -0.67 to 0.67 standard deviations; (2) Rapid weight gain in (change &gt; 0.67 standard deviations); (3) Slow weight gain (change of &lt; -0.67 standard deviations).</description>
