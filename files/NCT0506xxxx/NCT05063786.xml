      Randomized phase III trial of trastuzumab + Alpelisib +/- fulvestrant versus trastuzumab +&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with PIK3CA mutated previously treated HER2+ Advanced Breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, open-label, controlled phase III randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial in HER2+ advanced breast cancer (ABC) patients harboring PIK3CA mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 300 patients (144 in the HR- cohort and 156 in the HR+ cohort) will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central screening of PIK3CA mutations on the most recent available formalin-fixed&#xD;
      paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor sample is required for the purpose of eligibility.&#xD;
      Investigators will be encouraged to send the most recent tumor tissue, preferably from a&#xD;
      metastatic lesion. However, if this is not possible, archived tissue samples either from&#xD;
      primary tumor or metastatic lesion will be acceptable. Local screening of HR and HER2 status&#xD;
      is required (although there will be a central confirmation done retrospectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the screening process (locally at each site and at the central laboratory) is completed,&#xD;
      fully eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the control arm with&#xD;
      trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (CT) or to the experimental arm with trastuzumab + alpelisib&#xD;
      +/- fulvestrant (depending on HR status). The two patient cohorts defined according to HR&#xD;
      status will be randomized separately, with randomization in each cohort stratified by prior&#xD;
      treatment with pertuzumab (yes vs no) and number of prior anti-HER2 based therapy lines for&#xD;
      MBC (≤2 vs &gt;2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cohorts patients will continue to receive their assigned treatment until objective&#xD;
      disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After objective disease progression, patients in both treatment arms will be followed until&#xD;
      death or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to perform exploratory biomarker analysis, pre-treatment tumor and sequential blood&#xD;
      samples (at baseline, at week 9, at the end of treatment [EOT], and at progressive disease&#xD;
      [PD]) will be obtained. Additionally, blood samples from approximately 100 patients (50 HR+&#xD;
      and 50 HR-) screened and without PIK3CA mutation will be collected.&#xD;

          1. Written informed consent prior to any specific study procedures, showing patient&#xD;
             willingness to comply with all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Documented HER2+ status based on local laboratory determination, preferably on the&#xD;
             most recent available FFPE tumor sample, and according to American Society of&#xD;
             ClinicalOncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) international&#xD;
             guidelines valid at the time of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented HR status based on local laboratory, preferably on the most recent&#xD;
             available FFPE tumor sample, and according to ASCO/CAP international guidelines valid&#xD;
             at the time of the assay. In case of discordance in HR status by different biopsies,&#xD;
             we will consider the most recent one. HR+ will be defined as ≥1% positive cells by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry for Estrogen Receptor (ER) and/or Progesterone Receptor (PgR).&#xD;
             HR- will be defined as &lt;1% positive cells by immunohistochemistry for both ER and PgR.&#xD;
             Considering that there are limited data on endocrine therapy benefit for cancers with&#xD;
             1% to 10% of cells staining ER positive, for the purpose of this study, patients with&#xD;
             ER and PgR expression between 1 and 10% (considered to be HR low by the most recent&#xD;
             ASCO/CAP guidelines) will be eligible for inclusion in the HR- cohort.&#xD;

                  medication. Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is allowed&#xD;
                  prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Long QT syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT&#xD;

                  interpretable) or QTcF &gt; 460 msec for females (using Fridericia's correction).&#xD;
                  All as determined by screening ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Bleeding diathesis (i.e., disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC], clotting&#xD;
             factor deficiency) or long-term (&gt; 6 months) anticoagulant therapy, other than&#xD;
             antiplatelet therapy and low dose coumarin derivatives, provided that the&#xD;
             International Normalised Ratio (INR) is less than 1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of clinically significant bowel disease including abdominal fistula, or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Difficulties to swallow tablets, malabsorption syndrome disease significantly&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, alpelisib or fulvestrant or any of their&#xD;
             excipients. If known hypersensitivity to either vinorelbine, capecitabine, eribulin or&#xD;
             any of their excipients, patient will be eligible as long as the investigator's choice&#xD;
             avoids that drug in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If known hypersensitivity to all three cytostatics (vinorelbine, capecitabine and&#xD;
             eribulin), the patient will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known positive serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), or active infection&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for&#xD;
             entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patients with currently documented pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (the chest&#xD;
             Computed Tomography [CT] scan performed at screening for the purpose of tumor&#xD;
             assessment should be reviewed to confirm that there are no relevant pulmonary&#xD;
             complications present).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patient with liver disease with a Child Pugh score B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Patient with a history of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of screening or past&#xD;
             medical history of chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Patient has a history of Steven-Johnson-Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis&#xD;
             (TEN).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patient is nursing (lactating) or is pregnant as confirmed by a positive serum human&#xD;
             Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) test prior to initiating study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Patient is a woman of child-bearing potential or a partner of a woman of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential, unless agreement to remain abstinent or use single or combined non-hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the&#xD;
             treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment,&#xD;
             except for patients receiving fulvestrant in which this period should be of at least 2&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation&#xD;
                  methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per&#xD;
                  year include tubal ligation, male sterilization (only if he is the sole partner&#xD;
                  and have been performed at least 6 months prior to screening), and certain&#xD;
                  intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a&#xD;
                  cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Barrier&#xD;
                  methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male participants must not donate sperm during study and up to the time period&#xD;
                  specified above.&#xD;
