      In this open-label, 2-arms study, eligible participants will be enrolled and randomised in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive either Durvalumab + chemotherapy + Oleclumab before surgery followed by&#xD;
      Durvalumab + Oleclumab post-surgery (Arm 1) or Durvalumab + chemotherapy + Monalizumab before&#xD;
      surgery followed by Durvalumab + Monalizumab post-surgery (Arm 2).&#xD;
