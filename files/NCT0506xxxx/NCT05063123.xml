  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have measurable residual disease (MRDpos, defined as MRD &gt; 0.1% by flowcytometry&#xD;
      or detectable mutant Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)&#xD;
      after two cycles of intensive chemotherapy) prior to start conditioning for an allogeneic&#xD;
      Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) have a very high risk of relapse after&#xD;
      transplantation. Important questions in the field are whether patients with MRD after&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy can be converted to MRD negativity (i.e. undetectable MRD, MRDneg) and&#xD;
      whether this conversion impacts on the relapse rate after transplantation. This trial aims to&#xD;
      develop effective &quot;interphase&quot; treatment for patients in morphological complete remission&#xD;
      (CR) with MRD after at least 2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy and prior to start&#xD;
      conditioning for an allogeneic HCT. Flotetuzumab, a bispecific antibody-based molecule&#xD;
      against CD3 and CD123 in a dual-affinity re-targeting antibody (DART®) format is a new&#xD;
      treatment modality based on immunomodulation. The rationale to use flotetuzumab in this study&#xD;
      is: 1) its antileukemic activity reported in R/R AML; 2) its limited extra-medullary (i.e.&#xD;
      tissue) toxicity; and 3) its short halflife.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the rate of MRDneg remission after treatment with one cycle of flotetuzumab.&#xD;

    <description>1 - 3 cycles of Flotetuzumab. Flotetuzumab will be administered intravenously via continuous (pump) administration. At least for the first 7 days of cycle 1, the drug will be administered in an inpatient hospital setting, but afterwards may be administered in an outpatient setting using an ambulatory pump configuration. Flotetuzumab will be dosed using multi-step increments in dosing over the first week as follows: 30, 60, 100, 200, 300, and 400 ng/kg/day each for 24 hours. On day 7, the dose will be increased to 500 ng/kg/day and administered as a continuous infusion for the remainder of cycle 1. After 1 cycle of flotetuzumab patients will proceed with alloHCT. However if there is a delay in access to transplantation, patients are allowed to receive up to 2 additional cycles flotetuzumab provided all non-hematologic toxicities have resolved to Grade &lt;2.</description>
