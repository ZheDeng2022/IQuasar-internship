  <brief_summary>

      Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether Low Level Laser therapy (LLLT)&#xD;
      can improve the quality of life in women with Lichen Sclerosus (LS) and insufficient topical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a clinical trial study conducted between January 2016 and July 2018, the&#xD;
      investigators included 100 women with LS with insufficient topical treatment. All&#xD;
      participants received ten LLLT treatments (808 nm and 500 mW) over a period of 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      first four treatments where planned as two treatments per week. The remaining six treatments&#xD;
      where planned as once a week. The effect was monitored by a Danish health-related quality of&#xD;
      life tool (HRQoL test).&#xD;

      Hundred participants with LS were included in a clinical trial at Lillebaelt Hospital,&#xD;
      Denmark in the period from 02.01.2016 to 08.01.2018. The participants were informed about the&#xD;
      purpose of research and the fact that LLLT was not standard-of-care treatment in our&#xD;
      out-patient clinic. All participants who declined to take part in the study received&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment (topical steroid or topical calcineurin inhibitors) according to&#xD;
      Danish national guidelines. Participants enrolled in the study received both standard-of-care&#xD;
      treatment and LLLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants received 10 LLLT treatments of 808 nm and 500mW. Every treatment was with a&#xD;
      duration of 10 minutes. The first four treatments where planned as two treatments per week.&#xD;
      The remaining six treatments where planned as once a week due to logistic considerations. The&#xD;
      participants received the LLLT treatment while lying in the same position as during a&#xD;
      gynecological examination. The light waves were placed 10 centimeters from the anogenital&#xD;
      area covering the symptomatic area. If the participants had symptoms from both the vulva and&#xD;
      the area around the rectum, the light were replaced after 10 minutes of treatment making sure&#xD;
      no area were treated twice. All patients were recommended to continue their topical treatment&#xD;
      during the study period. A Danish health-related quality of life tool (DoloTest®) was used to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the treatment. The HRQoL test is a validated Danish tool developed for&#xD;
      pain patients. It is validated against the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Surveys&#xD;
      (SF36TM). The HRQoL test requires little time and is therefore easy to use in a clinical&#xD;
      setting. It is composed of eight domains arranged in a radar plot; pain, problems sleeping,&#xD;
      reduced social life, low spirit, reduced energy and physical strength, problems at work,&#xD;
      problems with more strenuous physical activity, and problems with light physical activity.&#xD;
      Starting with the domain pain the patient marks every domain horizontally moving clockwise&#xD;
      and thereby creates a graphic illustration, which helps the physician and the participant to&#xD;
      understand the impact of the condition. The larger the shaded area the more the patient feels&#xD;
      affected. Every mark represents a score. The maximum score of the HRQoL test is the total sum&#xD;
      of the eight domains multiplied by 100, the maximum score being 800. The participants&#xD;
      completed the HRQoL test before first LLLT treatment and after the last treatment. A written&#xD;
      informed consents was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
