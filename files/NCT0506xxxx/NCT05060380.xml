  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the 6 month randomized controlled trial is to investigate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      novel progressive muscle resistance exercise in postmenopausal women with low bone mass.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2008, medical cost of osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures was estimated to be&#xD;
      $22 billion. This is further expected to rise because of an increase of 20% in population&#xD;
      with osteoporosis, amounting to 12 million adults over the age of 50 years, by 2020, out of&#xD;
      which 80% will be postmenopausal women. Unfortunately, benefits due to pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions have plateaued. Consequently, there is a critical need to identify&#xD;
      complementary therapies to enhance the treatment of low bone mass in older adults. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the feasibility of novel progressive muscle resistance exercise in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with low bone mass. Muscle will be assessed via imaging techniques and&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer. Physical activity will be assessed via activity monitors. Blood will&#xD;
      be collected to assess bone and muscle biomarkers. Balance will be assessed via clinical and&#xD;
      biomechanical tests. Testing will be performed at 4 time points: baseline, 1 month, 3 month,&#xD;
      and 6 months except imaging which will be done at the baseline and 6 months. The findings&#xD;
      from this study will help us to understand the feasibility of resistive muscle exercise&#xD;
      program in postmenopausal women with low bone mass.&#xD;
