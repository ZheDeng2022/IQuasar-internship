      To compare the retentive strength of different form of commercially available denture&#xD;
      adhesives (paste, powder and cushion) on different form of residual ridges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of various denture adhesives on efficiency of complete dentures in&#xD;
      patients with different alveolar ridges.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Prior approval from ethical committee has been taken (Annexure-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As per protocol all patients presenting will be examined in general opd and those&#xD;
           patients in need of rehabilitation of their missing teeth will be referred to&#xD;
           Prosthodontics dept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo history and complete oral examination after informed consent&#xD;
           (Annexure-B). On the basis of these information the patient will be selected for the&#xD;
           study acc to exclusion and inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will then categorized into three groups based on clinical and radiographic&#xD;
           features of ridges according to Wical-Swoope classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A well-constructed denture will be fabricated and all the post op complaints will be&#xD;
           resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three forms of denture adhesives will be used including powder, cream and strips for all&#xD;
           three resorption classes as described by Wical-Swoope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A digital spring scale will be used to record the reading , All the measurements will be&#xD;
           recorded in grams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retentive strength will be recorded first before application of the adhesives for&#xD;
           baseline retention strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with denture in his mouth will be instructed to maintain max non-forced&#xD;
           intercuspation for fives minutes. Atfer that with mouth opened and lower lip relaxed in&#xD;
           order to avoid losing peripheral seal tip of the spring scale will be placed at the&#xD;
           margin of denture in recess to lingual frenum. Traction forced will be then applied&#xD;
           until denture is detached, the max retention force being recorded by sping scale. This&#xD;
           procedure will be repeated thrice and mean value will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second reading will be recorded after application of adhesive in similar manner&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean increase in denture retention strength will be calculated by subtracting denture&#xD;
           retention strength without adhesive from denture retentive strength with adhesive for&#xD;
           both study products&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scores calculated will be filled in Performa (annexure-A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The obtained data will be then used to compare diff form of commercially availble&#xD;
           denture adhesives (pastes, powder and cushion) for their mean increase in retention&#xD;
           strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then patient will be instructed about how to apply denture adhesives (based on&#xD;
           manufacturer' instructions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will fill out two attributed questionnaires, before and 1 week after using&#xD;
           the denture adhesive. In the questionnaire the satisfaction rating will be determined&#xD;
           using valid questionnaires with seven evaluation items: general satisfaction, ability to&#xD;
           speak, ease of cleaning, stability, retention, comfort and mastication performance (VAS?&#xD;
           Likert scale?)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quantitative variable, age of the patients and retention strength was presented as&#xD;
           mean+- SD. The qualitative varaible like sex was presented as frequency and percentages.&#xD;
           T-test was used to determine the existence if difference of mean retention strength b/w&#xD;
           the two form of denture adhesives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Chi-square tests in SPSS software version 25 software&#xD;
           (SPSS version 25.0, SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL, USA) (P&lt;.05)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The score calculated will be filled in the performa (Annexure-A)&#xD;
