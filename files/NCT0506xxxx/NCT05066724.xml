    <textblock>
      This single-group, open-label study of 50 subjects will explore the potential of&#xD;
      centanafadine in promoting smoking abstinence in adult smokers seeking to quit. The efficacy&#xD;
      and tolerability of centanafadine at a dose of 400 mg total daily dose (TDD) (200 mg twice a&#xD;
      day (BID)) approximately 4 to 6 hours apart (during a 7-week treatment period) will be&#xD;
      compared with a benchmark of abstinence based on historical data from clinical trials of&#xD;
      varenicline, viewed as the most efficacious pharmacotherapy currently approved by the FDA.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 -7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective will be to determine whether centanafadine yields a superior continuous smoking abstinence rate. Abstinence will be defined as self-report of no cigarette smoking (not even a puff), confirmed by an expired air CO reading of less than 5 ppm at week 7.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective will be to determine whether centanafadine yields a superior continuous smoking abstinence rate. Abstinence will be defined as self-report of no cigarette smoking (not even a puff), confirmed by response to open-ended questions at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>REDUCTION IN INCIDENCE OF NAUSEA</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>secondary objective will be to determine if centanafadine yields equivalent efficacy to that of varenicline, with a significant reduction in the incidence of nausea, the most prevalent side effect reported following varenicline treatment.</description>
