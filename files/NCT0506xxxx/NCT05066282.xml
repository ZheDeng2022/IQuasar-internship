  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from a series of Phase 2 and 3 studies of MDMA-assisted therapy conducted by the sponsor&#xD;
      provide preliminary evidence that chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), independent&#xD;
      of cause, is treatable with up to three sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy. This&#xD;
      non-interventional study will serve as the long-term follow-up (LTFU) protocol for&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted therapy clinical trials and will measure persistence of effectiveness using the&#xD;
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) as a measure of PTSD symptom severity.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will gather data to support health economics and cost effectiveness&#xD;
      analyses of this treatment. Participants who have received at least one dose of&#xD;
      Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in the main study will be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

      The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non-profit research and&#xD;
      education organization working as a clinical trial sponsor to obtain approval for the&#xD;
      prescription use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct to therapy for&#xD;
      treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Data from a series of Phase 2 and 3&#xD;
      studies of MDMA-assisted therapy conducted by the sponsor provide preliminary evidence that&#xD;
      chronic PTSD, independent of cause, is treatable with up to three sessions of MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      therapy. This non-interventional study will serve as the long-term follow-up (LTFU) protocol&#xD;
      for MDMA-assisted therapy clinical trials and will measure persistence of effectiveness using&#xD;
      the CAPS-5 as a measure of PTSD symptom severity. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term effectiveness of MDMA-assisted therapy for treatment of PTSD as&#xD;
      measured by the change in CAPS-5 Total Severity Score (actual or imputed) from the main study&#xD;
      Baseline and Study Termination to LTFU IR Assessments (Visit 1). Additionally, this study&#xD;
      will gather data to support health economics and cost effectiveness analyses of this&#xD;
      treatment. Participants who have received at least one dose of Investigational Medicinal&#xD;
      Product (IMP) in the main study will be eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;

    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-V (CAPS-5) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>
