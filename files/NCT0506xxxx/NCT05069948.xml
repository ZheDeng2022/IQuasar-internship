  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concussion is common and patients can go on to suffer with a constellation of symptoms which&#xD;
      impacts their functional outcome and quality of life. Patient provision with information&#xD;
      about their concussion and subsequent follow-up is highly variable. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed HeadOn - a web application that delivers a CBT programme to patients following&#xD;
      concussion. In this study, the investigators would like to examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      digitally delivering a course of CBT to patients following concussion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HeadOn study is a prospective feasibility study of patients presenting to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED). Potentially eligible patients will be contacted by a member of the research&#xD;
      team and their consent will be sought for participation. Those not recruited at presentation&#xD;
      to the ED will be contacted by telephone, text or email within two weeks of their concussion&#xD;
      date to seek their participation in the study, again by a member of the research team. After&#xD;
      consenting, the participant will be taken through the registration process for the HeadOn&#xD;
      program. For patients who are contacted after discharge they will be taken through&#xD;
      registration process over the telephone or if preferable will be able to return to the ED to&#xD;
      go over the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At registration the participant will be invited to complete a series of patient reported&#xD;
      measures including the Rivermead post-concussion questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
      Index, PHQ9 questionnaire and FAST alcohol questionnaire within the HeadOn program. Alongside&#xD;
      this, a series of researcher-led anonymised data points will be collected in a separate&#xD;
      specially designed database including demographics, date of concussion, neurological and&#xD;
      imaging findings which will all be collected from the medical notes and imaging reports. The&#xD;
      HeadOn program runs for five weeks following which the participant will be invited to&#xD;
      complete the same set of outcome measures. Alongside this, all the participant will be&#xD;
      contacted (via telephone, text or email) by a member of the research team at week 5 to&#xD;
      complete a further five measurements: Glasgow Outcome Score Extended, mHealth App Usability&#xD;
      questionnaire, time to return to work and a healthcare utility questionnaire. Interested&#xD;
      participants will be invited back within two months of enrolling in the study for a more&#xD;
      detailed qualitative interviews about HeadOn. The study will recruit for a period of 6-months&#xD;
      or up to 100 participants.&#xD;

During each stage of the program participants are required to input data as part of the CBT tasks. Participants will be divided into the following three groups: Fully compliant: participants who input data into the program during all five stages; Partially compliant: participants who input data but not during all five stages; Non-compliant: participants who do not enter any data into the program</description>

    <description>HeadOn is a web application which takes the participant through a 5-stage CBT programme including: (i) understanding post-concussion symptoms; (ii) sleep after a concussion; (iii) lifestyle habits and exercise; (iv) managing negative thought patterns and (v) returning to baseline. The programme is delivered through a combination of weekly tasks (such as completing symptom diary, setting exercise goals and setting up a sleep time routine), audio/video media and reading material.</description>
