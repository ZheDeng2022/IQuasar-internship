  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination of the population is crucial in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Although&#xD;
      most available vaccines have an estimated efficacy against symptomatic infection of 65-95%,&#xD;
      this can be significantly reduced if the patient has co-morbidities such as immunosuppression&#xD;
      or if the full vaccination schedule is not followed. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants,&#xD;
      carrying mutations, notably on the spike protein, may also be associated with escape from&#xD;
      immunity acquired by vaccination. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown a decrease in&#xD;
      sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies acquired after vaccination or even after infection for&#xD;
      certain variants such as variant B.1.351 (beta variant according to the WHO, first detection&#xD;
      in South Africa) or variant B.1.617.2. (delta variant according to the WHO, first detection&#xD;
      in India). On the other hand, cases of COVID-19 following a full vaccination regimen have&#xD;
      recently been reported. With the increasing detection of new variants and in the context of&#xD;
      increasing vaccination coverage of the population, one of the priority missions of the&#xD;
      National Reference Centre (NRC) for respiratory infection viruses is to clinically and&#xD;
      virologically investigate all cases of infection in vaccinated patients. The main objective&#xD;
      is to determine whether a particular variant is over-represented in vaccinated patients with&#xD;
      an infection. The secondary objective is to study the humoral immune response in COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccinated patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
