    <measure>Number of Vessels Where Hemostasis Achieved (Less Than or Equal to [&lt;=] Grade 3) Based on Grading Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Number of vessels where hemostasis is achieved (&lt;= Grade 3) using per below grading scale: a) Grade 1: no bleeding at transection site; b) Grade 2: minor bleeding at transection site, no intervention needed; c) Grade 3: minor bleeding at transection site, mild intervention needed, use of compression, basic energy devices (monopolar and/or bipolar) and/or touch-ups with ENSEAL X1 curved jaw tissue sealer (ENSEAL X1); or d) Grade 4: significant bleeding (example, pulsatile blood flow, venous pooling) requiring intervention such as extensive coagulation or use of additional hemostatic measures (example, hemoclips, staples, sutures, fibrin sealants, other advanced energy products).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distribution of 5-point Scale Scores for Various Tasks Completed by the ENSEAL X1 Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Distribution of 5-point scale scores for various tasks (adhesiolysis, lymphatics or tissue bundles divided, tissue grasping, tissue cutting, or tissue dissection) completed by the ENSEAL X1 device will be reported. The scale will be a 5-point scale (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neither satisfied or dissatisfied, satisfied, or very satisfied) asking how satisfied the surgeon was with the use of the device for each of the tasks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Distribution of Grades (1-4) Seen from the use of the Hemostasis Grading Scale for Each Vessel Transected</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of Grades (1-4) seen from the use of the hemostasis grading scale for each vessel transected will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Additional Hemostasis Measures Required to Achieve Hemostasis for Grade 4 Vessel Transections</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Number of additional hemostasis measures required to achieve hemostasis for Grade 4 vessel transections will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Device-related Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 6 weeks postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with device-related (possibly, probably, or causally) AEs will be reported. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, regardless of its relationship to the study device or the study procedure. An untoward medical occurrence includes any new, undesirable medical experience or worsening of a pre-existing condition, which occurs throughout the duration of the clinical study.</description>
