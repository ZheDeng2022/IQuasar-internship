    <textblock>
      Overall project aim: to develop, evaluate, and implement a digital behavioural health&#xD;
      treatment to improve well-being in individuals with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be integrated into the nationally available 1177 web-platform, which will&#xD;
      facilitate long-term use in clinical practice across Sweden. Within the project, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop the digital treatment and match it to patients' needs using focus&#xD;
      groups; pilot the treatment to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability, preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy, and individual change processes using the single case experimental design (SCED)&#xD;
      method; conduct a two-armed randomized controlled trial enhanced with SCED to assess the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and maintenance of change of the treatment&#xD;
      compared to treatment as usual; and monitor the implementation process of the treatment&#xD;
      through a business model and stakeholder interviews.&#xD;

      Study 1: Identifying and meeting patients' needs Design: Focus groups with individuals with&#xD;
      chronic pain and health care professionals. Aim: To identify participant's needs and utilise&#xD;
      user input to match the treatment content and design (prototype 1.0) to needs. Sample: People&#xD;
      with chronic pain (two focus groups, n=6-8 per group), health care professionals (HCPs)&#xD;
      (e.g., psychologists, psychotherapists trained in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) (one&#xD;
      focus group, n=6-8) will be recruited from primary care facilities in the region of Kalmar.&#xD;
      Data collection: Focus groups will follow a semi-structured guide and be audio- and&#xD;
      video-taped. Field notes will furthermore provide insights into relevant cues and&#xD;
      observations given by participants. Outcome: Intervention prototype 2.0 Time plan:&#xD;
      Autumn/winter 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: Feasibility, acceptability, preliminary efficacy, and individual change processes&#xD;
      Design: Piloting and optimising the treatment in an iterative process with 4-6 smaller&#xD;
      cohorts; user input from each optimisation 'sprint' will be integrated and tested in the&#xD;
      subsequent cohort/ sprint; single-case experimental design (SCED) method with randomised&#xD;
      baseline length, pre- post- and FU-assessment and post-treatment user interviews. Aim: To&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and acceptability, the preliminary efficacy, and individual change&#xD;
      processes of the digital behavioural health treatment within the 1177 web-platform. Sample:&#xD;
      People with chronic pain (n=10 per sprint; total of n=60) will be recruited from primary care&#xD;
      facilities in the region of Kalmar; the feasibility and acceptability will also be evaluated&#xD;
      in treating HCPs (note: one HCP might treat multiple patients at the same time, and also take&#xD;
      place in several sprints), who are therefore also considered participants. Data collection:&#xD;
      feasibility/ acceptability: semi-structured debriefing interviews of subjective experience&#xD;
      combined with objective measures such as drop-out rate, adherence, system-generated technical&#xD;
      use e.g. number of log-in time points, number of modules completed; preliminary efficacy:&#xD;
      Pre-, post- 3- and 6-month FU-assessment of self-reports on patients' well-being, data of&#xD;
      n=60 patients accumulated across all sprints as the treatment remains functionally constant&#xD;
      across all optimisation studies; individual change processes: Lunch and evening reports of&#xD;
      well-being at least four times per week over the course of the 6-week treatment using a&#xD;
      digital diary, also comparing to the baseline and post-treatment diary assessments. Time&#xD;
      plan: 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4: RCT enhanced with SCED evaluating the (cost-) effectiveness and maintenance of&#xD;
      change Design: Two-armed RCT enhanced with randomized baseline length SCED method comparing&#xD;
      the digital behavioural health treatment to primary care treatment as usual (TAU). Aims: To&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the treatment on behavioural health outcomes, and the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the treatment in comparison to TAU. Sample: Patients (n=360, n=180 per&#xD;
      group) will be recruited from pain clinics and primary care facilities in the region of&#xD;
      Kalmar and potentially other regions (e.g., Östergötland, Jönköping, Stockholm, Uppsala,&#xD;
      Örebro). Data collection: Self-report questionnaires will be completed over pre-, post-&#xD;
      FU-assessments. Furthermore, the digital diary information on daily well-being will be&#xD;
      collected at all assessment time points and over the course of the intervention, in both&#xD;
      treatment arms. To determine the cost-effectiveness, information from registers on sick&#xD;
      leave, medication, and health care consumption will be used . Time plan: 2023-2024.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 (pre-Implementation) and study 5 (post-implementation): business model, determinants,&#xD;
      and lessons-learned Design: Qualitative study using interviews with stakeholders; deductive&#xD;
      analysis of qualitative data mapped on the consolidated framework for implementation&#xD;
      research. Aim: Identify barriers and facilitators for the prospective implementation of the&#xD;
      treatment and prepare the implementation process using a business model canvas (at baseline,&#xD;
      study 2); review the actual use and implementation process at follow-up to present lessons&#xD;
      learned (at follow-up, study 5). Sample: Various stakeholders identified via&#xD;
      snowball-sampling (e.g., development team and facilitators of 1177 web platform at region&#xD;
      Kalmar, health care professionals, health care managers, municipality representatives).&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted until data satisfaction is achieved. Data collection: An initial&#xD;
      version of a business model canvas will be discussed with the development team and health&#xD;
      care managers. Furthermore, potential barriers and facilitators of prospective use will be&#xD;
      identified at baseline via a semi-structured interview with the stakeholders. The practical&#xD;
      use and implementation status after the treatment is released to the market (here also&#xD;
      referred to as follow-up (FU)) will be described using semi-structured interviews to&#xD;
      understand the process retrospectively and present lessons learned. Time plan: baseline&#xD;
      autumn 2021, FU in autumn 2024 (after RCT, treatment release to other regions).&#xD;
