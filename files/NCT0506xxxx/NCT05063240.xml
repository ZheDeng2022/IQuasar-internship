      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of breastfeeding, at a minimum, doubles the risk of infant death in the first six months&#xD;
      of life. Many infants in low resourced settings at high risk of infectious disease morbidity&#xD;
      and death are deprived of the immunological and nutritional benefits of breast milk, through&#xD;
      an attenuated duration of breast milk exposure. South Africa has one of the lowest exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding rates in Africa, 8% in infants under 6 months of age. Mobile phone text&#xD;
      messaging as a simple, low-cost intervention improves medication adherence among patients&#xD;
      with HIV, diabetes and tuberculosis. Motivational interviewing has been beneficial across&#xD;
      many health problems, including HIV viral load suppression, body weight loss, and alcohol and&#xD;
      tobacco use. Combining a number of intervention approaches is more likely to influence&#xD;
      behaviour change than an individual approach. Investigators assume that continued&#xD;
      breastfeeding is sustained among women living with HIV receiving weekly text messages&#xD;
      combined with motivational interviewing and that this contributes to improved infant health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effects of mobile phone text messaging combined with motivational&#xD;
           interviewing versus standard of care on: (a) Continued exclusive breastfeeding to six&#xD;
           month of child age, (b) Continued any form of breastfeeding to 6 month of child age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the contribution of the combined intervention on improved infant health&#xD;
           outcomes: (a) Infant morbidity (all -cause hospitalization) and death (all -causes, (b)&#xD;
           Infant growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a group sequential clinical trial to determine whether text messaging&#xD;
      combined with motivational interviewing will prolong breastfeeding and the contribution of&#xD;
      the combined intervention on improved infant health outcomes. The study will recruit 275&#xD;
      women living with HIV and HIV exposed infants at birth and randomly assign study&#xD;
      interventions for 6 months.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010, following changes to global HIV and infant feeding guidelines, the South African&#xD;
      vertical transmission prevention program stopped provision of formula milk and adopted&#xD;
      breastfeeding as the recommended infant feeding modality. However, in reality, there are&#xD;
      short-falls in attaining optimal infant feeding practices, which are contributing to failure&#xD;
      to achieving the Sustainable Development under-five child health targets in South Africa. It&#xD;
      is essential for the well-being of women living with HIV and their infants to establish&#xD;
      models for supporting optimal infant feeding practices to achieve the desired child health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite several proven interventions to improve breastfeeding practices, in practice there is&#xD;
      lack of progress in implementing these interventions to achieve optimal breastfeeding&#xD;
      practices. Telephonic support and motivational interviewing have been beneficial across many&#xD;
      health problems, including medication adherence among people living with HIV and to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol and tobacco use. Investigators propose to combine telephonic support with&#xD;
      motivational interviewing to support infant feeding among women living with HIV. Combining&#xD;
      these two interventions has great potential; it is likely to be cost-effective, simple to&#xD;
      implement and easily integrated within the established infant feeding counselling&#xD;
      conventional models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effects of mobile phone text messaging plus motivational interviewing&#xD;
           versus standard of care on: (a) Continued exclusive breastfeeding to six month of child&#xD;
           age, (b) Continued any form of breastfeeding to 6 month of child age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the contribution of the combined intervention on improved infant health&#xD;
           outcomes: (a) Infant morbidity (all -cause hospitalization) and all -cause death, (b)&#xD;
           Infant growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a permuted block method to&#xD;
      receive study interventions versus standard of care for 24 weeks. Electronic sequence&#xD;
      generation and random allocation will be done centrally. Participants meeting inclusion&#xD;
      criteria who consent to participate will be enrolled and immediately assigned to a study arm&#xD;
      sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions: All women and their infants, irrespective of study assignments, will&#xD;
      receive health services and treatment according to the respective provincial guidelines&#xD;
      applicable in the sector during the study. Participants will be evaluated soon after giving&#xD;
      birth and post-delivery until cessation of breastfeeding or until end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile phone text messaging: Every Monday morning, a research nurse will send text message to&#xD;
      women in the intervention group encouraging mothers to exclusively breastfeed and inquire if&#xD;
      mothers have any problems breastfeeding infants. Participants will be asked to respond by&#xD;
      text within 48 hours, indicating no problem or a problem with breastfeeding and require help.&#xD;
      The research nurse will review all the responses and then follow-up any participants who&#xD;
      indicate a breastfeeding problem or call participants who fail to respond within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational interviewing: In addition to text messaging, women will have individual&#xD;
      motivational interviews post-delivery at weeks 2, 6, and 10. During the interviews, the&#xD;
      research nurse will have to understand participant's frame of reference, reinforce&#xD;
      participant's own self-motivational statements, monitor the readiness to change, and affirm&#xD;
      the participant's freedom of choice. Advice will be given with participant's permission, and&#xD;
      when given, the participant will make her own choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual standard of care: Participants randomized to the usual standard of care group will be&#xD;
      counselled by primary healthcare nurses and trained lay counsellors to exclusively breastfeed&#xD;
      for the first six months. Participants will be free to call the clinic staff at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling plan, recruitment, study assessment and follow-up: Pregnant women living with HIV&#xD;
      and giving birth at a healthcare facility in Cape Town, South Africa, between October 2021&#xD;
      and September 2023 will be informed about the study and mothers who indicate interest in&#xD;
      participating will be consented for the study. Informed consent will be requested to conduct&#xD;
      an enrolment maternal interview, four in-person follow-up visits, child hospitalization&#xD;
      medical record review, and child height and weight measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have in-person follow-up at weeks 2, 6, 10, and 24 of child age. Research&#xD;
      nurses or counselors will administer a baseline questionnaire and follow up study&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
