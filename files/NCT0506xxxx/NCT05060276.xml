      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation study o STI-3258 administered intravenously&#xD;
      in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including ovarian, breast, lung,&#xD;
      esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular and urothelial cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine any dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), assessing safety and preliminary efficacy using ascending&#xD;
      dose cohorts and a conventional 3+3 study design.&#xD;
