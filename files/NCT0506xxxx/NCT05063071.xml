      TAF treatment for HBV prophylaxis could lead to significant reduction in ALT and significant&#xD;
      improvement in renal function. However, data are scarce regarding to TAF monotherapy without&#xD;
      HBIG for HBV prophylaxis in post orthotopic liver transplant with HBV-related disease. This&#xD;
      study is based on a real-world, multi-center, prospective study to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of TAF for HBV prophylaxis, which will fill in gaps with TAF monotherapy without&#xD;
      HBIG in post liver transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LT has evolved rapidly, becoming the standard therapy for acute and chronic liver failure of&#xD;
      a variety of aetiologies, with more than 80,000 procedures performed to date [13]. HBV&#xD;
      infection is a worldwide public health problem, especially in China. The need for an&#xD;
      antiviral treatment with NAs for liver transplant recipients has two objectives: the&#xD;
      improvement of liver function and to decrease the risk of HBV recurrence after transplant.&#xD;
      TAF, TDF and ETV are currently the first-line therapy in patients with CHB in all CHB&#xD;
      treatment guidelines, which have a greater potency and higher barriers to resistance. TAF&#xD;
      treatment for HBV prophylaxis could lead to significant reduction in ALT and significant&#xD;
      improvement in renal function. However, data are scarce regarding to TAF monotherapy without&#xD;
      HBIG for HBV prophylaxis in post orthotopic liver transplant with HBV-related disease. This&#xD;
      study is based on a real-world, multi-center, prospective study to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of TAF for HBV prophylaxis, which will fill in gaps with TAF monotherapy without&#xD;
      HBIG in post liver transplant.&#xD;
