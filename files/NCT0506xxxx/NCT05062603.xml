  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung ultrasound has been used to help diagnose COVID-19 as an alternative to CT scanning and&#xD;
      chest X-ray. CT scanning is onerous and there are difficulties taking critically unwell&#xD;
      patients there as well as decontamination issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-ray misses up to 40% of COVID diagnoses. Although lung ultrasound can diagnose, the&#xD;
      investigators do not know how long these lung ultrasound changes last. The investigators&#xD;
      would like to follow up patients to characterise the pattern of changes and how long they&#xD;
      last. This is particularly important given a potential second surge of COVID-19 is looming&#xD;
      and the investigators would like to know if lung ultrasound changes are new or old in&#xD;
      patients presenting during this second wave and in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound has been invaluable during this pandemic to diagnose COVID-19. The investigators&#xD;
      have used it alongside CT scanning to rationalise the number of CT scans especially when&#xD;
      patients are unstable. The investigators do not know how long these changes last on lung&#xD;
      ultrasound after discharge and the investigators wish to study this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is because patients will start presenting shortly who have a history of COVID-19 with&#xD;
      acute medical problems and if the investigators are to use lung ultrasound again the&#xD;
      investigators would like to know whether the changes the investigators see are new or old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is vitally important before a second surge and especially so before winter. This may&#xD;
      also facilitate triage of patients from the front door in the Emergency department to&#xD;
      different areas (such as COVID-19 zones or clean areas).&#xD;
