    <textblock>
      The aim of the present project is to analyze the impact from orthognathic surgery on the&#xD;
      upper airway respiratory volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is comparison of differences in the in the airway changes due to&#xD;
      maxillary movements and mandibular movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the analysis of any correlation between the magnitude of the&#xD;
      movement and the airway volume, correlation between the direction of the movements and the&#xD;
      changes in airway volume and correlation with Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL).&#xD;
      Expected confounding factors like smoking habits and Body Mass Index (BMI) will be analyzed.&#xD;

      Background Orthognathic surgery affects the position of the teeth and jaws. The upper airway&#xD;
      compartment is in close approximation to these tissues. Consequently, changes of the&#xD;
      respiratory volume after surgical treatment in this region is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthognathic surgery The correction of severe malocclusions and dentofacial deformities has&#xD;
      since the beginning of 20th century been treated with orthodontic and surgical methods.&#xD;
      Epidemiologic surveys reveal that about 5 % of the western population has dentofacial&#xD;
      disproportions of a magnitude that affect both function and facial aesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory disability Obstructive sleep apnea, estimated to occur in between 5% and 10% of&#xD;
      the western countries' population. Disabilities in the upper airway may affect the patient's&#xD;
      general health and quality of life. Breathing incapability often lead to impaired sleep and&#xD;
      consequently decrease the individual's overall capacity and performance. Known predisposing&#xD;
      factors are obesity, smoking and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of respiratory disabilities Medical, behavioral and surgical treatment options are&#xD;
      prospected methods and the treatment is individually planned in detail. The complex nature of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea may require multidisciplinary assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthognathic surgery as treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) Correction of&#xD;
      anatomical abnormalities may cure obstructive sleep apnea or improve compliance with positive&#xD;
      airway pressure treatment. Orthognathic surgery with an anterior movement of the jaws can&#xD;
      increase the airway volume and facilitate breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and evaluation of the upper airway volume Different methods of measuring the&#xD;
      upper airway, like physio metric and radiological are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project plan Subjects The study is performed retrospectively on a prospective material.&#xD;
      Sixty-two consecutive patients aged between 18 to 30 years with Angle class III occlusion&#xD;
      were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with systemic diseases in the musculoskeletal apparatus, drug abuse, poor psychic&#xD;
      status or disease in the temporomandibular joint were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is performed retrospectively on a prospective material. Examination with&#xD;
      clinical examination, BMI, HRQoL questionnaire, dental casts, photography and two- and&#xD;
      three-dimensional radiographs and cephalometric measures was performed prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's data (x-ray and photographs) were linked together in computer software programs&#xD;
      and used for cephalometric analysis and simulation of the orthodontic and surgical movements&#xD;
      (Fasad® and Simplant® PRO 12.00 OMS). The treatment was performed in accordance with this&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last follow up was performed 12 months after surgery including identical registrations as&#xD;
      prior to surgery, described above. HRQoL questionnaires consisted of Oral Health Impact&#xD;
      Profile (OHIP-S), Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS-20) and Orofacial Aesthetic Scale&#xD;
      (OAS-S). The results from the presurgical questionnaire will be compared with the&#xD;
      postsurgical results. Twenty subjects were asked to fill in the follow-up questionnaire twice&#xD;
      with two weeks interval for a reliability test of the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre- and postoperative CT will be compared in a software for measurements of upper airway&#xD;
      volume with the software Philips IntelliSpace® Portal, version 11. Measures will be performed&#xD;
      with an divided analysis of the upper airway according to the method described by Kim. Thus,&#xD;
      the upper airway segmented into four compartments. The measurements will be performed on the&#xD;
      sole segment volume and the total airway volume. A comparison of jaw movements, changes in&#xD;
      airway volume, BMI and HRQoL will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods The sample size, 62 patients, was based on numbers included in previous&#xD;
      similar studies from other centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple statistics, mean and standard deviation (SD), for all variables will be used.&#xD;
      Differences in airway volume and movements, preoperatively and postoperatively will be&#xD;
      compared with McNemar's-test. Wilcoxon's paired-sample test will be used for analyzing airway&#xD;
      volume before and after surgery as a numeric variable. The reliability test, performed as a&#xD;
      test-retest, will be analyzed with the intraclass correlation coefficient, Fisher's test for&#xD;
      pair comparisons and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Mann-Whitney-test will be performed&#xD;
      to detect differences between questionnaire responses and clinical findings, i.e. BMI, and&#xD;
      volumetric findings. The data will be assessed by using Spearman correlation analysis and&#xD;
      simple linear regression analysis. Two-sided tests and alpha level 0.05 will be used.&#xD;
      Confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. For all computations IBM® SPSS® statistical&#xD;
      software will be used.&#xD;
