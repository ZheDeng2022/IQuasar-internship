  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of coformulated&#xD;
      favezelimab/pembrolizumab (MK-4280A) in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer. The&#xD;
      study will also compare MK-4280A with the standard of care treatment of regorafenib and&#xD;
      TAS-102 (trifluridine and tipiracil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that coformulated favezelimab/pembrolizumab (MK-4280A) is&#xD;
      superior to standard of care with respect to overall survival.&#xD;

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant responses to the questions regarding Global Health Status (GHS; &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot;) and Quality of Life (QoL; &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot;) are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The change from baseline in GHS (EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 29) and QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 30) combined score will be presented. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
