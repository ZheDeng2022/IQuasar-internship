  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AIM HIGHer Clinical Trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cardiac Contractility&#xD;
      Modulation (CCM) therapy in patients with heart failure with LVEF ≥40% and ≤60%.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AIM HIGHer Clinical Trial is a prospective, multi-national, multi-center, randomized,&#xD;
      quadruple-blind, sham-controlled, two-part embedded trial of the safety and efficacy of CCM&#xD;
      therapy delivered via the OPTIMIZER Smart Mini System in subjects with heart failure and an&#xD;
      LVEF ≥40% and ≤60%. Subjects will be enrolled at approximately 150 sites in the US and 75&#xD;
      sites OUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo screening and baseline testing; eligible subjects will be implanted&#xD;
      with the Optimizer System. Subjects will be randomized to either CCM ON (CCM group) or to CCM&#xD;
      OFF (Sham group). The trial will be blinded to the treatment assignment of the device for&#xD;
      18-months. Subjects in the Sham group will have CCM turned ON after completion of the&#xD;
      18-month study visit. Subjects enrolled during Part I (450 subjects) of the trial will&#xD;
      continue follow-up through the end of Part II (up to an additional 1,050) and contribute data&#xD;
      to both parts of the trial. Each part of the trial is distinguished by a separate scientific&#xD;
      purpose. The specific purpose of each part is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I - Establish safety and effectiveness based on functional capacity and health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II - Establish safety and effectiveness based on clinical outcome data.&#xD;

    <description>Demonstrate that CCM therapy improves a composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality at 18-months, heart failure hospitalizations at 18-months, urgent heart failure visits requiring IV diuretics at 18-months and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ CSS) at 12-months. Comparison of a hierarchical composite endpoint between the two study groups will be based on the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld global rank method.</description>

    <description>Cardiac contractility modulation therapy, also known as CCM™, is a device-based therapy that may be an effective treatment modality for HF patients with a higher EF. In this study, CCM therapy will be delivered via the OPTIMIZER™ Smart Mini System. The Optimizer will be programmed to deliver 7 phases of CCM therapy per day that are distributed equally over a given 24-hour period.</description>
