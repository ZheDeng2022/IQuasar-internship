        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial-onset (focal) seizures (POS) with or without&#xD;
             secondarily generalized seizures according to the International League Against&#xD;
             Epilepsy's (ILAE) Classification of Epileptic Seizures. A diagnosis should have been&#xD;
             established at least 12 months prior to Visit 1 by clinical history and an&#xD;
             electroencephalogram (EEG) that is consistent with the diagnosis; normal interictal&#xD;
             EEGs will be allowed provided that the participant meets the other diagnosis criterion&#xD;
             (i.e., clinical history)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female participant, from age 2 to less than 18 years at the time of informed&#xD;
             consent/assent (dates including informed consent in YKP3089C039)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a minimum weight of 12.5 kilograms (kg) (27.5 pounds [lb])&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have had a brain imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan or computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) within 5 years before Visit 1 that ruled out a progressive cause of&#xD;
             epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For subjects new to Study YKP3089C040 during the 8 weeks prior to Visit 1,&#xD;
             participants must have had at least 1 POS seizure. Only simple POS with motor signs,&#xD;
             complex POS, and complex POS with secondary generalization are counted toward this&#xD;
             inclusion for POS&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are currently being treated with stable doses of 1 to a maximum of 3 approved&#xD;

             1; in the case where a new AED regimen has been initiated for a participant, the dose&#xD;
             must be stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1. A vagal nerve stimulator [VNS]&#xD;
             will be counted as one of the 3 allowed AEDs, with the settings stable for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening and maintain stable throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  regimenfor a minimum of 60 days prior to Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No prior or known history of hepatotoxicity or hematologic disorder due to&#xD;
                  felbamate.&#xD;
