      Anxiolysis and analgesia are of paramount importance when conducting medical procedures,&#xD;
      particularly in children. Nonpharmacologic techniques such as distraction and hypnosis&#xD;
      improve the patient experience when used in the correct setting and may reduce the need for&#xD;
      medications and pharmacological sedation. Virtual reality immersion is a novel approach to&#xD;
      anxiolysis and analgesia but the content (i.e. games) available on the market are limited in&#xD;
      their appropriateness for age, and the lack of specific design for medical procedures.&#xD;
      VRelief, designed using a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, hypnosis practitioners,&#xD;
      psychologists and computer scientists specializing in the Multimodal Modelling of Emotion &amp;&#xD;
      Feeling may present a safe and superior alternative to a similar game presented in a video&#xD;
      tablet format, in mitigating procedural anxiety and pain and improving the patient experience&#xD;
      during venipuncture.&#xD;

      Pain and anxiety experienced in the acute care setting remain a major global problem,&#xD;
      resulting in high costs for those involved as well as for health care institutions. Pain and&#xD;
      anxiety management techniques affect the quality of the care experienced by patients,&#xD;
      relatives, and healthcare workers. Pharmacological procedures remain the most widely used&#xD;
      approach, although they have important limitations, such as potential for adverse effects and&#xD;
      dosing errors, especially in the most vulnerable populations such as young children.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological approaches to analgesia and anxiolysis have been explored, among which&#xD;
      placebo, expectant, distraction, positive induction, reward, self-regulation, relaxation and&#xD;
      hypnosis. Unfortunately, translational applications have been only partially successful, due&#xD;
      to the limited and variable effectiveness of each approach, which often requires active and&#xD;
      continuous patient cooperation. Hypnosis is an effective but incomplete approach that&#xD;
      requires the presence of a specialist and can only be practiced from a certain age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality (VR) is a promising technology that combines all of these methods above into&#xD;
      an immersive and engaging tool for pain and anxiety relief that could equal or exceed the&#xD;
      effectiveness of other existing non-pharmacological techniques. In addition, it is relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive and provides a relevant alternative when hypnosis practitioners are not&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virtual reality contents (hereon ''games'') available on the market are varied. However,&#xD;
      these tools are mainly based on distraction and often do not take into account the&#xD;
      therapeutic communication and hypnosis principles proven useful in managing anxious children,&#xD;
      as well as other psychological factors facilitating, for example, the &quot;empowerment&quot; of&#xD;
      patients. Moreover, the quality of immersion in a virtual environment is essential for its&#xD;
      effectiveness, and the tools currently available remain limited in this respect (mini-games,&#xD;
      360-degree video). Moreover, these tools have little external control and even fewer&#xD;
      intelligent mechanisms to adapt content to the patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed a prototype VR tool, which, unlike tools from other clinical&#xD;
      studies of virtual reality, implemented a narration integrating several properties of&#xD;
      hypnosis induction (in particular relaxation and regulation) with a gameplay designed to&#xD;
      induce distraction and empowerment. The game was developed with the objective of engaging the&#xD;
      child in an environment where he or she is first familiarized and reassured, then engaged in&#xD;
      the missions of the game, and finally rewarded, all with the intent of decreasing anxiety and&#xD;
      pain during a procedure. The investigators have carefully adapted the initial versions of&#xD;
      this VR scenario to young, hospitalized children (starting from the age of 5 years of age)&#xD;
      undergoing painful and anxiogenic procedures such as venipuncture. This population is ideal&#xD;
      for our needs because they are often resistant to other non-pharmacological techniques&#xD;
      (hypnosis susceptibility peaks between 8 and 12 years and, at the same time, have a good&#xD;
      knowledge of artificial environments and computer games. A pilot study conducted in our&#xD;
      department showed that children who played the VR game rated their pain and anxiety less high&#xD;
      than children who received standard of care, during venipuncture. Venipuncture is some of the&#xD;
      most common procedures in pediatric emergency departments and one of the most common sources&#xD;
      of unrelieved pain and anxiety in hospitalized children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no study has attempted to isolate the added value of VR by comparing it with a&#xD;
      similar game offered in a format such as a video tablet (ie.g.: iPad, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When used in a correct subset of patients (excluding patients with light-sensitive epilepsy),&#xD;
      there are no risks anticipated aside from potential mild nausea or dizziness, which is rarely&#xD;
      described in children using virtual reality, which would make this study a risk category A&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
