  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries, with more than 20 million&#xD;
      performed globally each year. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients undergoing&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair will experience persistent post-surgical pain that could last months&#xD;
      to years. Evidence from related procedures indicates that better surgical preparation through&#xD;
      pre-operative exercise and education (i.e. Prehabilitation) followed by ongoing post-surgical&#xD;
      rehabilitation leads to more rapid recovery, return to activities and lower likelihood of&#xD;
      persistent post-surgical pain. The investigators will determine the feasibility of a&#xD;
      peri-operative rehabilitation program (pre- and post-surgery) and our study protocol for&#xD;
      patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair surgery. The investigators hypothesize that: 1)&#xD;
      our peri-operative intervention will be feasible and safe to undertake within a clinical&#xD;
      setting; 2) adequate numbers will be enrolled to justify a larger trial; and that 3) our&#xD;
      outcome measurement protocol will provide meaningful information with high response rate and&#xD;
      low attrition after 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed globally, with more than&#xD;
      20 million performed each year. Not only does this huge number of surgeries have a&#xD;
      substantial direct economic burden on healthcare systems, there is also indirect impact from&#xD;
      time off work and decreased productivity due ongoing post-surgical pain requiring extended&#xD;
      time spent on modified duties. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients undergoing&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair will experience persistent post-surgical pain that could last months&#xD;
      to years. Furthermore, current clinical guidelines for return to work and activity after&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair are inconsistently informed by evidence, highly variable, and&#xD;
      outdated. Forbes et al (2012) found that the average patient undergoing inguinal hernia&#xD;
      repair experiences more than 40 days of short-term disability despite indications that&#xD;
      earlier return to activity is safe (i.e. will not lead to repair failure) and likely&#xD;
      beneficial for reducing chronic pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from related procedures indicates that better surgical preparation through&#xD;
      pre-operative exercise and education (i.e. Prehabilitation) followed by ongoing post-surgical&#xD;
      rehabilitation leads to more rapid recovery, return to activities and lower likelihood of&#xD;
      persistent post-surgical pain. Prehabilitation was first described in the 1940's when the&#xD;
      British Army developed a prehabilitation program as part of an experiment to increase the&#xD;
      quality of recruits. The concept of prehabilitation gained traction within the medical&#xD;
      community when Topp et. al. and Ditmyer et. al. promoted a theoretical model of&#xD;
      prehabilitation, positing that patients who participate in presurgical exercise with the goal&#xD;
      of improving functional capacity may experience more rapid postoperative recovery than&#xD;
      patients who remain physically inactive through the preoperative period. Prehab has also been&#xD;
      shown to increase self-efficacy, a moderator of pain catastrophizing and fear avoidance&#xD;
      beliefs, that are important factors linked to the pain experience of those with persistent&#xD;
      pain. The investigators propose that this theoretical model can be extrapolated to inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair and theorize that prehabilitation will increase patients' preoperative&#xD;
      self-efficacy, allowing them to more rapidly regain abilities, subsequently shortening&#xD;
      duration of modified duties and decreasing likelihood of persistent post-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little information is available regarding the use of prehabilitation in the context of&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair. There have been numerous studies looking at prehabilitation in&#xD;
      orthopedics, cardiovascular surgery, and prior to major abdominal surgeries, but limited&#xD;
      studies for inguinal hernia repair. A randomized control study by Liang et. al. examined the&#xD;
      impact of prehabilitation on ventral hernia recurrence and post-operative complications. They&#xD;
      concluded that patients undergoing prehabilitation have a higher likelihood of being&#xD;
      hernia-free and complication-free 30 days postoperatively. Notably, this study is limited in&#xD;
      that only obese patients were included, and outcomes only included recurrence and&#xD;
      complications. No studies were located examining the impact of prehabilitation on recovery&#xD;
      time, post-surgical pain, and return to activity after inguinal hernia repair. However&#xD;
      psychosocial factors such as pain catastrophizing appear to be important predictors. Typical&#xD;
      practice guidelines often recommend limiting activity for at least 3 months to avoid&#xD;
      re-rupture. However, these guidelines are based on expert opinion due to a lack of quality&#xD;
      research and can pose a risk in building unhelpful beliefs about pain, fear of movement and&#xD;
      poor coping strategies. Research is needed to inform practice guidelines and&#xD;
      return-to-activity recommendations.&#xD;

    <description>The Short-Form Functional Capacity Evaluation is a performance-based test of work function. In this test, patients are tested on 5 key activities of work performance (lifting, standing, trunk rotation, crouching, forward trunk flexion). Performance on each scale is compared to required job demands and the number of &quot;failed&quot; items is summed (0 to 5 failures). Short-Form Functional Capacity Evaluation is a valid indicator of work ability that has been found predictive of future work ability.</description>
