  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Trep-AB clinical trial will test the efficacy of an investigational neuropenetrative&#xD;
      drug, Linezolid (LZD), compared to standard treatment, Benzathine penicillin G (BPG), for&#xD;
      early syphilis in humans. The overarching idea of the work proposed herein is to investigate&#xD;
      the use of LZD to treat syphilis, conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate this new indication of a known antibacterial agent. It is estimated to include 360&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The syphilis epidemic is rampant around the world, and therapeutic options are restricted to&#xD;
      an antibiotic, intramuscular (IM) BPG, which does not efficiently cross the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier. Treponema pallidum (T.p.), the bacteria that causes syphilis, invades the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) in 40% of patients, usually without symptoms. The prognostic&#xD;
      implications of CNS invasion are the potential for severe neurologic complications, and&#xD;
      treatment failure due to sequestered bacteria in the CNS. When indicated, the only way to&#xD;
      identify and treat neurosyphilis is by lumbar puncture to examine the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF), followed by intravenous (IV) Benzyl penicillin therapy. The invetigators have carried&#xD;
      out in silico studies showing that oxazolidinones are potentially active against T.p., are&#xD;
      neuropenetrative and can be administered orally. The invetigators have carried out&#xD;
      preclinical studies using an in vitro culture system for T.p. and the use of the syphilis&#xD;
      animal model with rabbits to test different antibiotics. The invetigators have confirmed that&#xD;
      LZD was the best compound that could go on to be tested in clinical trials to treat syphilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trep-AB clinical trial will test the efficacy of an investigational neuropenetrative&#xD;
      drug, LZD, compared to standard treatment BPG, for early syphilis in humans conducting a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical. Primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      LZD treatment compared with standard BPG treatment to cure patients with early syphilis.&#xD;
      Seconday objective is to isolate T.p. strains in clinical samples to subtype DNA from&#xD;
      patients at baseline and during recurrence or treatment failure. It is estimated to include&#xD;
      360 participants.&#xD;
