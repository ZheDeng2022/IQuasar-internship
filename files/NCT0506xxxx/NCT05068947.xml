      GBS-101 is a single center Phase 1, placebo-controlled, randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      first-in-human (FIH), sequential single ascending dose (SAD) study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK of GV101 in healthy subjects. 8 healthy subjects wills be enrolled in&#xD;
      each of 7 cohorts of the study (50 mg (tablet), 100 mg (tablet), 200 mg (tablet), 400 mg&#xD;
      (tablet), 400 mg (liquid), 800 mg (liquid), 1600 mg (liquid). Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 3:1 ratio, 1:1 for 2 sentinel subjects and 5: 1 GV101 drug to matching placebo&#xD;
      thereafter. Subjects in each cohort will receive a single oral dose of GV101 or matching&#xD;
      placebo under fasting conditions. A staggered schedule will be used for each dose level,&#xD;
      where 2 sentinel subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) will be dosed first, with the remaining 6&#xD;
      subjects (5 active and 1 placebo) dosed at least 24 hours after the sentinel subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study of GV101 will provide safety, tolerability, and plasma pharmacokinetic data in&#xD;
      healthy individuals. The PK component will characterize the PK of GV101 to inform dosing and&#xD;
      may help to correlate exposures treatment-related AEs.&#xD;
