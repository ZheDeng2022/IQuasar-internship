    <textblock>
      Hot flashes are a common and debilitating symptom among prostate cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Strong evidence from multiple rigorously designed studies&#xD;
      indicated that venlafaxine provides partial relief, but the tolerability is poor when the&#xD;
      dose is not tapered. Hence, an alternative therapy is needed. Previous studies reported that&#xD;
      acupuncture may be helpful in the management of hot flashes. However, the insufficient&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial limited the quality of evidence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of men surviving after being diagnosed with prostate cancer has increased rapidly.&#xD;
      According to population-based cancer registry data, 10-year survival has tripled in the past&#xD;
      40 years in the UK. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a mainstay of prostate cancer&#xD;
      treatment and has been shown in randomized controlled trials to improve overall survival when&#xD;
      used with radiation for intermediate- and high-risk localized disease, as well as locally&#xD;
      advanced and node-positive disease, and after surgery for the node-positive disease. Although&#xD;
      ADT can improve survival, it can also cause significant morbidity and a decrement in quality&#xD;
      of life. One of the most bothersome side effects is hot flashes. They are experienced as&#xD;
      sudden and transient episodes of heat and sweating, with possible co-occurring palpitations&#xD;
      and anxiety, usually persist long-term. The prevalence estimated that 44-80% of patients&#xD;
      undergoing ADT report hot flashes and up to 27% report this as the most troublesome adverse&#xD;
      effect. Although hot flashes are not fatal morbidity, it may interfere with adherence to&#xD;
      lifesaving therapies or ablative therapies that are used to prevent or treat cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, most intervention studies for hot flashes have evaluated treatments in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients or women who are postmenopausal. Venlafaxine, a selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor, appears to be effective and safe in both breast cancer women and prostate cancer&#xD;
      men with hot flashes. It has been recommended for practice in men with strong evidence from&#xD;
      multiple rigorously designed studies. However, some prostate cancer patients cannot take&#xD;
      venlafaxine because of side effects such as nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, insomnia,&#xD;
      and constipation. Thus, an alternative therapy is needed. A systematic review identified six&#xD;
      studies of acupuncture for hot flashes, of which none were randomized and placebo-controlled.&#xD;
      Although acupuncture is a nonpharmacologic therapy and has been confirmed that could be&#xD;
      helpful in the management of hot flashes among breast cancer survivors, there is no placebo&#xD;
      acupuncture-controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy in men.&#xD;

The severity of hot flashes is assessed based on the duration of hot flashes and physical and emotional symptoms; it is scored as mild, moderate, severe, and very severe (range 1-4, from mild to very severe).</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions, each describing a different aspect of health: MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT and ANXIETY / DEPRESSION. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems (labelled 1-3). The respondent is asked to indicate his / her health state by checking the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions.</description>

    <description>Licensed acupuncturists with more than 5 years of experience will be responsible for administering interventions three times per week for 6 weeks. The needles (30 or 40 mm and 0.25 mm gauge; Soochow, Hwato) will be inserted and manipulated until De Qi, a sensation of soreness and tingling. Acupuncture was defined as targeting the 10 bilateral acupuncture points: Xinshu (BL15), Shenshu (BL23), Zhongliao (BL33), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Yinlingquan (SP9). The needle will be left in place for 30 minutes with brief manipulation at the beginning, middle, and end of therapy.</description>
