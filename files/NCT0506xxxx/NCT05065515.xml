  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore and analyze the relationship between intestinal flora changes and the efficacy of&#xD;
      individualized immunotherapy in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer, and to find new&#xD;
      biomarkers to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy, bringing new breakthroughs in tumor&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      1. Compare the composition of intestinal flora of patients before and after immunotherapy&#xD;
           and in patients with different therapeutic effects of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Combine the results above with the patient's blood sample, which is carried out from the&#xD;
           metabolic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Combine the pathological data of the patient to determine the staging and pathological&#xD;
           types, and use blood samples to detect metabolites to find out different metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the metabolic data and the flora data are associated with the analysis to find the&#xD;
           bacteria species with higher correlation with the differential metabolites to guide the&#xD;
           subsequent animal experiments.&#xD;
