      The objective of this study is to collect baseline data from a normative population of&#xD;
      adolescents who participate in organized &quot;land-based&quot; sports, that gender and age matches&#xD;
      some of the population of patients expected to be treated at Mary Bridge Children's Therapy&#xD;
      Services, MultiCare affiliated therapy centers, and Mary Bridge Specialty Clinics who will be&#xD;
      seen in the Research and Movement Lab. This project will recruit 40 patients between the ages&#xD;
      of 13-18 years old. Non-invasive measurements of movement patterns will be collected during&#xD;
      common sport-related activities over a single data collection session.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of the sports normative data collection is to develop a baseline database from a normative population of adolescents who participate in organized &quot;land-based&quot; sports. Observation-based analyses are performed with a trained practitioner identifying events (e.g. max knee flexion) and general joint position (e.g. knee valgus) through visual observation, or with the aid of video. This project will recruit 40 patients between the ages of 13-18 years old. Non-invasive measurements of movement patterns will be collected during common sport-related activities over a single data collection session.</description>
