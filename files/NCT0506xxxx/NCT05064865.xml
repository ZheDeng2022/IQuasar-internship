  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging epidemics in Singapore are rapidly increasing and Age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD) prevalence is significantly associated with older age. This study aims to understand&#xD;
      the effect of consuming freeze-dried table grape powder on AMD in an older population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be carried out through a 16-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      of parallel study design. Thirty-eight men and women (aged between 60 and 85 years old&#xD;
      inclusive) will recruited and assigned to an intervention or placebo group. The intervention&#xD;
      group will consume 46 g/day of a freeze-dried table grape and the control group will consume&#xD;
      the same amount of a placebo, table grape placebo powder. Measurements of 1) macular pigment&#xD;
      optical density (MPOD), a clinical marker for eye health, 2) carotenoids status, 3) markers&#xD;
      of oxidative stress, 4) markers of endothelial function, 5) body size and blood pressure, and&#xD;
      6) dietary assessment will be assessed over the 16-week study. This study will consist of 1&#xD;
      screening visit and 5 study visits in 4-week intervals to the Food Science and Technology&#xD;
      Department, Occupational Health Clinic and National University Heart Centre.&#xD;
