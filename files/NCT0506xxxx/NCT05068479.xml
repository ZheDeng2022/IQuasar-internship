             posterior chamber surgery (e.g., vitrectomy, laser iridotomy); Previous retinal&#xD;
             surgery (e.g. retinal break, repair related to ocular trauma or detachment, or&#xD;
             pathology that is likely to require surgical intervention such as lattice degeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known pathology that may affect visual acuity and/or are predicted to cause future&#xD;
             acuity losses to a level of 20/30 (logMAR 0.18) or worse (e.g., macular degeneration);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Keratoconus or keratoconus suspect with CDVA of less than (&lt;) 20/20 (logMAR &gt; 0.00) at&#xD;
             distance;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Near visual acuity at 40cm equivalent to their distance vision with distance&#xD;
             correction (i.e., no evident effect of reduced accommodative range);&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision (the use of any miotic or&#xD;
             cycloplegic agent is specifically contraindicated);&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Acute or chronic disease or illness that could increase the operative risk or confound&#xD;
             the study outcome(s) (e.g., diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, connective tissue&#xD;
             disease);&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in EITHER eye;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Undilatable pupil such that one cannot examine the periphery of the retina;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Functional eye preference, defined as phoria measuring over 15dp horizontally and/or&#xD;
             over 2dp vertically, any strabismus, or suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of scleral ectasia, scleritis, or episcleritis; or thin sclera &lt; 400 microns,&#xD;
             as determined by taking the average of three measurements with ultrasound&#xD;
             biomicroscopy (UBM) pachymetry or optical coherence tomography (OCT);&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of nuclear sclerosis LOCS III grade 2 or worse and/or other cataracts reducing&#xD;
             CDVA or (where measured at select sites) OSI &gt; 2.5;&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known allergies tp study medications including topical steroids, antibiotics and&#xD;
             NSAIDs;&#xD;

        Note: This above list of exclusion criteria is not all inclusive. Investigators should use&#xD;
        medical judgement to exclude patients that have diseases/conditions which may compromise&#xD;
        study results and/or patients that are not ideal candidates. Patient affect and/or&#xD;
        expectations may be included in the evaluation of candidacy.&#xD;
