  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is aimed at meeting the support needs of community fathers who are expecting a&#xD;
      baby or who have recently had a baby. This work is being conducted in conjunction with&#xD;
      community partners through The Women's Clinic of Northern Colorado (WCNC). Researchers and&#xD;
      WCNC staff will work together to develop and implement programs for prenatal and postpartum&#xD;
      fathers. Participants will be invited to a group mentoring program and also will be provided&#xD;
      access to supplementary educational podcasts focused on topics relevant to prenatal and&#xD;
      postpartum fathers. The investigators are seeking to understand what participants like and&#xD;
      don't like about the program and how participation in the program affects participants'&#xD;
      stress, well-being, and parenting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are building on previous work to identify opportunities to meet the needs&#xD;
      of perinatal fathers. The term perinatal encompasses the time leading up to and immediately&#xD;
      following the birth of a child. Father involvement in child rearing is beneficial to mothers&#xD;
      and children, but fathers are routinely overlooked by available support opportunities at the&#xD;
      transition to parenthood. This pilot project seeks to apply research evidence and best&#xD;
      practices to address the disparity in socioemotional community support and education programs&#xD;
      serving perinatal fathers. In a previous pilot study, the investigators learned from fathers&#xD;
      participating in focus groups that participants were interested in opportunities to connect&#xD;
      with other fathers in the same life stage to talk about personal experiences and learn from&#xD;
      each other. The investigators also learned that fathers worry about meeting varied role&#xD;
      expectations, that available resources tend to overlook the unique experiences of fathers,&#xD;
      and that it can be challenging to find quality information in a digital world saturated with&#xD;
      conflicting information about parenting. This project seeks to address these primary issues&#xD;
      through community-based, father-centric support and educational programs. WCNC education&#xD;
      staff will facilitate a discussion-based group mentoring program for fathers who are&#xD;
      expecting or recently had a baby. This program seeks to increase connection with other&#xD;
      fathers, reduce stress related to parenting a baby, and increase parenting confidence. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to evaluate the feasibility of the program through satisfaction surveys&#xD;
      and other measures of the program's implementation. The investigators also plan to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the program by providing participants with surveys asking about their&#xD;
      well-being, knowledge, confidence in parenting, and their satisfaction with their social&#xD;
      networks. The investigators are additionally developing educational podcasts focused on&#xD;
      topics relevant to prenatal and postpartum fathers, which will be evaluated as a&#xD;
      supplementary component to the mentoring program. Research objectives are the following:&#xD;
      Study 1, Objective 1 (Primary): The investigators seek to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a program targeting perinatal fathers offered in a community clinic setting.&#xD;
      Study 1, Objective 2 (Primary): Examine whether participating in a discussion-based group&#xD;
      mentoring program increases the likelihood of positive short-term outcomes for fathers. Study&#xD;
      1 Objective 3 (Secondary): Identify whether listening to brief, targeted educational podcasts&#xD;
      predicts increased positive outcomes for fathers over and above the mentoring group alone.&#xD;
      Study 2 Objective 1 (Primary): Identify whether participants who listen to brief, targeted&#xD;
      educational podcasts find the podcasts satisfactory and acceptable as a method of gaining&#xD;
      information about perinatal fatherhood.&#xD;
