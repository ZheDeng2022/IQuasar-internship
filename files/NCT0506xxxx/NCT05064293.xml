    <textblock>
      The randomized, two-arm pragmatic trial will test the effectiveness of offering 6-months of&#xD;
      telephonic support from a mental health (MH) navigator to promote early access, engagement,&#xD;
      coordination, and personalization of mental health treatment and services for children naïve&#xD;
      to such treatments and services, and who are identified as being at risk for behavioral&#xD;
      health concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model includes: (a) automated identification of early symptoms for children meeting&#xD;
      criteria for behavioral health problems using a previously developed Natural Language&#xD;
      Processing (NLP) program and predictive algorithm; (b) standardized instruments for&#xD;
      assessment and diagnosis of mental health disorders (c) 30 minute assessment appointments&#xD;
      with a study psychologist (d) creation of an Epic &quot;reporting workbench&quot; and Epic &quot;smart form&quot;&#xD;
      to facilitate the outreach, monitoring and follow-up of families/children by the MH&#xD;
      navigator; (e) use of MH Navigators (e.g., clinical social workers) to conduct family&#xD;
      outreach, and coordination with and between clinicians; and (f) the offer of one to four&#xD;
      clinic-to-home videoconferencing brief therapy sessions to bridge families/children unwilling&#xD;
      or unable to access in-person MH services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of the pragmatic trial is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test a MH navigator model to promote early access, engagement, coordination, and&#xD;
      personalization of mental health treatment and services as soon as early symptoms of mental&#xD;
      health problems are detected in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The navigator model and implementation to be tested include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated identification of early symptoms for children meeting study criteria to&#xD;
           populate an Epic &quot;reporting workbench&quot; for eligibility screening and randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virtual collection of self-reported, standardized assessment scores;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychologists interpreting assessment scores and providing feedback to families and&#xD;
           PCPs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trained clinicians serving as MH &quot;navigators&quot; to conduct family outreach, engage them in&#xD;
           MH care, and coordinate with and between clinicians for up to 6-months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Epic reporting workbench for MN navigators to manage their active panel of patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Epic &quot;smart form&quot; to facilitate the MH navigator's outreach, monitoring and follow-up&#xD;
           to their panel;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 4 video-based behavioral health sessions with the MH navigator, as needed, while&#xD;
           barriers to initiation of ongoing mental health services can be explored and addressed&#xD;
           over the 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ an encouragement trial design, an alternative to a traditional RCT&#xD;
      design. Guardians of randomized youth are offered the opportunity to receive additional&#xD;
      services (navigation, FAST brief therapy sessions), but allowed to choose whether to receive&#xD;
      the services. That is, acceptance of or adherence to the offered study services is not a&#xD;
      condition of participation. Whether or not guardians choose to accept intervention services&#xD;
      from the beginning is a measure of the effectiveness of the program. Guardians who decline&#xD;
      the additional services (navigation, FAST sessions) must remain in the intervention arm in&#xD;
      order to measure the effectiveness of the intervention without bias. This allows an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat comparison between arms. That is, patients remain enrolled in the study&#xD;
      regardless of the navigators' ability to contact the family by phone or the family's&#xD;
      perceived need for or willingness to accept or participate in study-based services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a two-group, randomized and pragmatic encouragement trial to&#xD;
      compare outcomes between study arms (intervention; usual care control) in 2 health care&#xD;
      systems. The follow up period for the trial will be 6-months. A parallel arm design is used&#xD;
      to eliminate response bias stemming from the nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MH navigator will review the medical record for each patient automatically identified for&#xD;
      the study. This review will occur prior to any arm assignment. Those found to have exclusions&#xD;
      will be marked ineligible. Patients deemed eligible will then be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility review will be completed no earlier than 14 calendar days after the index event.&#xD;
      This is to allow for any follow-up after the clinic visit (e.g., patient initiates MH&#xD;
      specialty treatment). The review will occur no later than 21 days after the index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will use a predetermined randomization schedule. The lead biostatistician at KP&#xD;
      Washington will generate the master assignment sequence before the first patient is&#xD;
      randomized. Randomization allocation tables will be created by the lead biostatistician, who&#xD;
      will oversee randomization at each site. Randomization will be stratified by age (4-6, 7-9,&#xD;
      10-11/12 (depending on site, KPNC 10-11. KPWA 10-12)) and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only subjects assigned to the intervention will be contacted by the navigator and offered the&#xD;
      intervention. Outcomes for all subjects entering the intervention arm, regardless of whether&#xD;
      the family accepted the MH navigation program, will be attributed to the intervention. That&#xD;
      is, outcomes for subjects will be assigned on an intent-to-treat basis regardless of the&#xD;
      extent to which they engage with the study clinician or the study navigator. Cross over&#xD;
      prevention is therefore functionally not-applicable due to the study design and the analytic&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each intervention arm subject's primary care provider will be sent an introductory staff&#xD;
      message by the study navigator prior to contacting the patient. The message will invite the&#xD;
      provider to respond within 3 days if they do not wish their patient to be outreached by the&#xD;
      study for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families contacted by the navigator may decline mental health navigation at the onset or at&#xD;
      any time during the follow up period. Acceptance will be tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families who agree to navigation will first be offered a formal assessment in order to&#xD;
      ascertain the primary mental health diagnosis and any co-occurring mental health disorders&#xD;
      (e.g., substance use). After completing the online parent/guardian self-assessment,&#xD;
      parents/guardians will meet for 30 minutes with a mental health clinician to review their&#xD;
      answers, discuss diagnoses, and refer the family back to the navigator for connection to care&#xD;
      or study-provided tele-video visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families offered tele-video therapy visits may decline it at any time. Acceptance and&#xD;
      adherence will be tracked as outcomes for those to whom it is offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study clinician may withdraw an offer of tele-video visits if concerns regarding privacy&#xD;
      or safety of the child/family arise with regard to the treatment modality. If this occurs,&#xD;
      the family/child will be navigated to sessions with an in-person therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline and 6-month follow-up from the standardized instruments&#xD;
      and automated sources for all eligible subjects randomized to the control arm. Safety&#xD;
      monitoring data will be collected from automated data 3 times per year for NIMH DSMB reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families who agree to participate will first be offered a formal assessment in order to&#xD;
      ascertain the primary mental health diagnosis and any co-occurring mental health disorders&#xD;
      (e.g., substance use). After completing the online parent/guardian self-assessment,&#xD;
      parents/guardians will meet for 30 minutes with a mental health clinician to review their&#xD;
      answers, discuss diagnoses, and refer the family back to their primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study clinicians will document clinically relevant information from their assessment in a&#xD;
      telephone encounter and route these to the child's KP primary care provider in Epic as well&#xD;
      as the site navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study telephone encounters are not billable visits. Only clinically relevant information is&#xD;
      incorporated into telephone visit notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm participants do not receive navigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months of follow up data will be collected from the standardized instruments and&#xD;
      automated sources for all eligible subjects randomized to the intervention arm. Safety&#xD;
      monitoring data will be collected from automated data 3 times per year for NIMH DSMB reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Epic reporting workbench and smart form will support the MH navigator's in managing their&#xD;
      active panels. Navigators will be prompted to follow up with subjects at the appropriate time&#xD;
      points, log outreach attempts and outcomes, note subjects' acceptance or refusal of&#xD;
      navigation, and (if offered) tele-video therapy visits, and track subjects ongoing acceptance&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MH navigator will contact the patient's primary care/pediatrics provider via Epic staff&#xD;
      message within 2 business days of a new intervention subject appearing on their reporting&#xD;
      workbench.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigators will use a standardized message (Epic Smartphrase). The message will (a) introduce&#xD;
      the MH navigator to the provider, (b) briefly describe the extra support the study can offer,&#xD;
      and (c) inform the provider that s/he may reply to the message to decline navigation for&#xD;
      their patient for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigators will enter in their Epic smart form:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MH Nav Status = Started&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provider Agreed MHN = Pending&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Next Follow Up = +3 business days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers are allowed 3 business days to actively decline the offer of study support before&#xD;
      the navigator outreaches the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a provider declines navigation on their patient's behalf the patient will not be&#xD;
           contacted. The subject remains in the study; 6-months of automated data will be&#xD;
           collected for the intent to treat analysis. The navigator will enter onto the smart&#xD;
           form:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Provider Agreed MHN = Declined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a provider accepts or does not respond in the 3-day timeframe, subject outreach will&#xD;
           begin. The navigator will use the Patient Care Notes field as appropriate and set the&#xD;
           smart form to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provider Agreed MHN = Agreed or No Response&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient Agreed MHN = Pending&#xD;
&#xD;
      MH navigators at each site will outreach intervention arm families by phone to offer up the&#xD;
      navigation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 3 cycles of outreach, 2 weeks apart, will be made. For each of the 3 cycles of&#xD;
      outreach, the Navigator will make up to 3 attempts to reach the family with in a 1-week&#xD;
      period, with up to two messages left.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If not reached after 3 cycles of outreach are completed, the smart form will be coded:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Family Agreed MHN = No Response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If reached and family agrees, the smart form will be coded:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Family Agreed MHN = Agreed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If reached and family declines, the smart form will be coded:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Family Agreed MHN = Declined. The navigator will notify the provider to inform him/her&#xD;
           that the program was declined; the study will not outreach the family further.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Families who agree may choose to discontinue navigation at any time during the 6-month&#xD;
           follow up period. If a family agrees and then opts to end early, the smart form will be&#xD;
           coded:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o MHN Ended Early = Date ended will be entered. The reason ended early will also be&#xD;
           captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Families/patients may report that the index MH symptoms have resolved. These&#xD;
           patients/families will be offered a 'watchful waiting' approach. Subjects accepting&#xD;
           'watchful waiting' will be outreached by phone at least quarterly but not past 6-months&#xD;
           post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Family Agreed MHN = Agreed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Next Follow Up = +90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families who agree to participate will first be offered a formal assessment in order to&#xD;
      ascertain the primary mental health diagnosis and any co-occurring mental health disorders&#xD;
      (e.g., substance use). After completing the online parent/guardian self-assessment,&#xD;
      parents/guardians will meet for 30 minutes with a mental health clinician to review their&#xD;
      answers, discuss diagnoses, and refer the family back to the navigator for connection to care&#xD;
      or study-provided tele-video visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study clinicians will document clinically relevant information from their assessment in a&#xD;
      telephone encounter and route these to the child's KP primary care provider in Epic as well&#xD;
      as the site navigator. Study telephone encounters are not billable visits. Only clinically&#xD;
      relevant information is incorporated into telephone visit notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigators will document clinically relevant discussion (post assessment) in a telephone&#xD;
      encounter and route these to the child's KP primary care provider in Epic. Study telephone&#xD;
      encounters are not billable visits. Study-related (administrative) notes remain in the smart&#xD;
      form; only clinically relevant information is incorporated into telephone visit notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigators will outreach families in the program by phone at least monthly during the 6-month&#xD;
      study period. The navigator will inquire about the child's status and re-evaluate barriers to&#xD;
      access on follow up navigation calls. They will use motivational interviewing techniques&#xD;
      (e.g., reflective listening, asking open ended questions) with the child and/or parents (as&#xD;
      age appropriate) to encourage them to engage in psychosocial treatments, attempt to motivate&#xD;
      them to start treatment (as needed), and identify and help problem solve ways to minimize&#xD;
      barriers to starting therapy. When barriers exist, the navigator will offer assistance in&#xD;
      facilitating specialty treatment initiation and assess appropriateness of tele-video therapy&#xD;
      sessions until ongoing MH services can be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families/patients reporting that index symptoms have resolved will be offered a 'watchful&#xD;
      waiting' approach. Subjects accepting 'watchful waiting' will be outreached by phone at least&#xD;
      quarterly, but not beyond the end of the 6-month follow-up period.&#xD;
