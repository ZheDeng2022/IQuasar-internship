    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study aiming to explore the cardiotoxicity of&#xD;
      targeted therapy for HER-2 positive breast cancer patients who lives in high altitude area.&#xD;
      One hundred and thirty two HER-2 positive breast cancer patients who will receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or palliative targeted therapy will be enrolled. The cardiotoxicity of&#xD;
      targeted therapy will be observed and recorded during the treatment and one year after the&#xD;
      end of treatment. The subjects will be stratified by age, baseline cardiac risk factors, and&#xD;
      anthracyclines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HER-2 positive breast cancer patients who live at high altitudes greater than 2000 meters for&#xD;
      long periods of time and will receive trastuzumab-based targeted therapy will be enrolled.&#xD;
      The subjects included early and advanced patients. Treatment regimens includes chemotherapy&#xD;
      combined with trastuzumab, chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, trastuzumab&#xD;
      alone, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. Electrocardiogram, cardiac ultrasound, NT-proBNP, and&#xD;
      TNI will be tested every 3 months when the treatment begins. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      cardiotoxity. The second endpoints is pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy, objective remission rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in neoadjuvant and&#xD;
      palliative therapy.&#xD;
