      Comorbid Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) may be one factor that limits speech development&#xD;
      in some minimally verbal children with autism. CAS is a disorder affecting speech movement&#xD;
      planning. This study tests whether CAS-specific treatment, appropriately modified for&#xD;
      minimally verbal children with autism, improves their speech.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although one in four children with autism remain minimally verbal past age five, not all the&#xD;
      factors that limit spoken language in these minimally verbal children are known. One powerful&#xD;
      contributor may be a motor speech disorder, Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS). CAS is an&#xD;
      impairment in the ability to plan and sequence for speech, which makes speech inconsistent&#xD;
      and imprecise. This project proposes to investigate whether CAS makes the speech of minimally&#xD;
      verbal children with autism unintelligible, and then to test whether treating the CAS&#xD;
      improves children's speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, a cohort of 20 minimally verbal children with both autism and CAS is identified. The&#xD;
      prediction is that the more severe the CAS, the more inconsistent and imprecise a child's&#xD;
      speech, and therefore the lower their intelligibility will be. Then, a set of mono- and&#xD;
      bisyllabic words is selected that contain the disordered movements that each child shows and&#xD;
      use those in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will take the form of 15 one-hour sessions where speech practice is embedded in a&#xD;
      naturalistic, play-based milieu that is centered on each child's own developmental level. It&#xD;
      will involve principles of motor learning (intensive practice of a few words, sometimes all&#xD;
      in a row and sometimes mixed up). Different types of cues (touch cues, simultaneous&#xD;
      production, etc.) will also be employed to help children say their words correctly, fading&#xD;
      back these supports as the child's speech improves. Both of these techniques have been shown&#xD;
      to be effective for treating CAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our outcome measures will include both (1) &quot;by-ear&quot; assessments of intelligibility and (2)&#xD;
      acoustic and kinematic measurements of children's speech after 15 treatment sessions. The&#xD;
      findings will inform clinical practice for minimally verbal children with autism and may lead&#xD;
      to the development of novel interventions for this severely affected population.&#xD;
