    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to capture the utilization of nivolumab among participants with&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) since its approval, and to describe the&#xD;
      health related quality of life (HRQoL) among participants treated with nivolumab in a&#xD;
      real-world setting.&#xD;

      This is a phase 4 prospective chart review study with patient reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      administration. The study population consists of participants diagnosed with squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and are being treated with nivolumab. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled and observed from enrollment up to eight weeks. Demographic and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics will be collected at enrollment. PROs will be administered at&#xD;
      enrollment and again at a follow-up standard of care visit approximately eight weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
