  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled, 2-part study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ZX008 when used as adjunctive therapy for the treatment&#xD;
      of uncontrolled seizures in children and adults with cyclin-dependent kinase like-5 (CDKL5)&#xD;
      deficiency disorder (CDD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part multicenter trial. Part 1 is a 20-week randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-group study to examine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ZX008 as an adjunctive therapy (to existing concomitant treatment with antiepileptic&#xD;
      treatments [AETs]) in children and adults with a CDD diagnosis and uncontrolled seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is 20 weeks in duration and will consist of the following stages:&#xD;
      Baseline Period (ie, Baseline [BL]; 4 weeks including the Screening Visit and baseline&#xD;
      observation), Titration Period (ie, Titration; 2 weeks), Maintenance Period (ie, Maintenance;&#xD;
      12 weeks), and a 2-week Transition Period (ie, Transition; 2 weeks) to the open-label&#xD;
      starting dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a 54-week, open-label, flexible-dose, long-term extension for subjects who complete&#xD;
      Part 1. Part 2 includes an Open-Label Extension (OLE) Treatment Period (52 weeks) with a&#xD;
      Taper Period (ie, Taper; 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ZX008 in children and&#xD;
      adults with CDD will be based on Part 1 data in all randomized subjects.&#xD;
