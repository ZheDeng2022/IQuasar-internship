  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between January 2020 to August 2021, fifty percent of patients referred from Geisinger's&#xD;
      primary care sites to Neurology for headaches did not trial appropriate first line therapy&#xD;
      prior to referral, and there was limited access available at Geisinger's Neurology&#xD;
      department. This project was initiated to improve patient experience, management of headache,&#xD;
      and provider experience as it relates to headache management. Geisinger's Neurology&#xD;
      department, pharmacy department, and Community Medicine Service Line (CMSL) sites have&#xD;
      collaborated to develop a Headache CarePath (i.e., a best practice alert containing: an EPIC&#xD;
      headache assessment, Express Lane for prescriptions, and Ask-a-doc button for Neurology&#xD;
      consult) and piloted at 2 CMSL sites (Woodbine, Selinsgrove) to gain some initial feedback.&#xD;
      The feedback has been incorporated into best practice alert (BPA) language and criteria. The&#xD;
      project team now plans to implement this CarePath to half of CMSL sites first while the other&#xD;
      half of CMSL sites will continue to practice the standard of care as of today. The team will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of this CarePath on patient outcomes [change in Headache Impact Test-6&#xD;
      (HIT-6) scores, change in the frequency of headaches, and change in pain intensity],&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) visits, number of referrals to Neurology for headache, and&#xD;
      prescribing of headache medications by comparing the measures in clinics that had the&#xD;
      CarePath implemented to those that did not. Patient outcomes will be collected by Geisinger's&#xD;
      Survey Core, which will reach out telephonically to patients to ask about the status of their&#xD;
      headaches (HIT-6, frequency, intensity of headaches, M-TOQ-5). Other measures will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed using secondary data sources such as electronic health record (EHR)&#xD;
      data. The initial implementation is planned for 6-9 months. The findings from this evaluation&#xD;
      will help the CarePath team identify any remaining opportunities or guide the direction of&#xD;
      its future enhancements of the CarePath tools. The results of this evaluation will be shared&#xD;
      with the Geisinger leadership to demonstrate its value to the organization.&#xD;

    <description>During an in-clinic patient encounter with a primary care provider (PCP) in any one of the intervention CMSL sites, the BPA is fired when any type of headache or migraine is entered as a diagnosis or chief complaint. The purpose of the headache assessment questionnaire is to assist the PCP in characterizing patients' headache. The Express Lane will help guide PCP decision-making for prescribing medications, lab/image ordering, and referrals. The Ask-a-doc button will provide timely access to a virtual treatment and diagnosis consult with a neurologist.</description>
