      -  OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of structured,&#xD;
           multidisciplinary and personalized post-ICU care versus usual care on physical and&#xD;
           psychological functioning, and quality of life (QoL) of ICU survivors one and two years&#xD;
           post-ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RESEARCH QUESTION What is the clinical- and cost effectiveness of structured,&#xD;
           personalized post-ICU care versus usual care on physical and psychological functioning,&#xD;
           and QoL of ICU survivors?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HYPOTHESIS Structured, multidisciplinary, and personalized post-ICU care results in&#xD;
           improved QoL of ICU survivors and is more cost effective compared to usual care.&#xD;

        -  RESEARCH QUESTION What is the clinical- and cost effectiveness of structured,&#xD;
           personalized post-ICU care versus usual care on physical and psychological functioning,&#xD;
           and QoL of ICU survivors?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HYPOTHESIS Structured, multidisciplinary, and personalized post-ICU care results in&#xD;
           improved QoL of ICU survivors and is more cost effective compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STUDY POPULATION Adult patients at high risk of critical illness-associated morbidity&#xD;
           post-ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INTERVENTION Structured, personalized and multidisciplinary post-ICU care tailored to&#xD;
           patients' health problems initiated by ICU clinicians and coordinated by GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  USUAL CARE / COMPARISON No or unstructured post-ICU care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OUTCOMES Primary: QoL and mental functioning 1-year post-ICU. Secondary: physical and&#xD;
           cognitive functioning 1- and 2-year post-ICU, cost effectiveness and cost utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FOLLOW-UP TIME One and two years post-ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STUDY DESIGN Stepped wedge cluster RCT in 5 hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAMPLE SIZE &amp; DATA ANALYSIS 5 ICUs (11 patients/ICU/month, in total 770 intervention&#xD;
           patients, and 1480 (active and historical) controls gives power of 87% to detect effect&#xD;
           of 0.074 in EQ-5D (ICC 0.035; SD 0.26). Data will be analysed according to intention to&#xD;
           treat principles, also per-protocol analyses will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS / BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS Comparison of 'cost per QALY'&#xD;
           gained between patients in the intervention and control group. Decision analytical&#xD;
           modelling will be used to calculate the average savings per patient; extrapolated to&#xD;
           population level using a budget-holders perspective.&#xD;
