    <textblock>
      This study's investigators previously demonstrated the potential utility of non-invasive&#xD;
      carotid ultrasonography to calculate carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and stiffness (as&#xD;
      measured by the three parameters, carotid cross-sectional distensibility [cCSD], carotid&#xD;
      cross-sectional compliance [cCSC], and carotid incremental elastic modulus [cIEM]) in people&#xD;
      with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators also studied arterial gene expression in animal models of MPS, and identified&#xD;
      upregulation of a number of markers potentially tied to atherosclerosis and inflammation.&#xD;
      These include the atherosclerotic marker known as Clusterin (CLU), Cathepsin S, Elastin, and&#xD;
      the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1-α, interleukin 1-β, interleukin 2, and interleukin&#xD;
      6. Other studies have identified elevation in circulating tumor necrosis factor-α correlating&#xD;
      with pain and physical disability in certain mucopolysaccharidoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since these studies are cross sectional, and not longitudinal, this study aims to annually&#xD;
      measure these previously studied biomarkers (carotid measurements, circulating cytokines,&#xD;
      cathepsin S, elastin, and CLU) in a large cohort of MPS patients. This study is a 3-year,&#xD;
      prospective, anonymized, longitudinal assessment of cardiovascular structure, function, and&#xD;
      circulating biomarkers in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Annually assess cardiac and carotid structure and function utilizing ultrasonography, in&#xD;
           patients with mucopolysaccharidoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Annually measure circulating levels of clusterin, elastin, cathepsin S, lipids, and&#xD;
           cytokines in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target enrollment 30 subjects at CHOC Children's Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Investigators will identify eligible patients to participate in the study from&#xD;
           their current patient population and future referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Eligible patients will be provided with study information on the study during their&#xD;
           standard of care metabolic clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent will be obtained following the requirements set forth by 21 CFR 50.25.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients interested in the study will be provided the informed consent document. The&#xD;
           document will be reviewed in a private quiet room and ample time for questions will be&#xD;
           provided. The patient can keep a copy of the consent if they wish to discuss the study&#xD;
           with friends and family. Consent will only be obtained once the patient has had time to&#xD;
           ask questions and is aware that the study is completely voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Information regarding age, sex, MPS diagnosis (including genetic mutation and enzymatic&#xD;
           levels, if possible) will be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Height and weight will be obtained. If patient has had a recent (within 3 months)&#xD;
           evaluation at CHOC Children's with height and weight, those parameters may be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Medical records will be obtained specifically focusing upon&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the genetic and/or enzymatic testing used to confirm the MPS diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. the treatment status (treated or not) and duration of treatment (calculated by the&#xD;
                difference between date of first carotid imaging and date of first treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Carotid ultrasonography will be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study takes 10 - 15 minutes to complete&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subject will be asked to lay still and quietly during procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Results will be digitized and stored on CD&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Echocardiography will be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study takes 15 - 20 minutes to complete&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subject will be asked to lay still and quietly during procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Results will be digitized and stored on CD&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Venipuncture / phlebotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 10 mL of blood total will be drawn (5 mL in a blue top citrate tube, 5 mL in a&#xD;
                purple top EDTA tube). Measurements of cytokines, clusterin, lipidomics, cathepsin&#xD;
                S protease, and elastin (previously identified potential biomarker candidates) will&#xD;
                be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Blood will preferably be drawn via venipuncture, but if patient has a port-a-cath&#xD;
                already implanted and is having blood drawn via port-a-cath for clinically required&#xD;
                reasons, then study-related blood draw via port-a-cath can take place concurrently&#xD;
                with clinically required blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual studies Procedures 2), 4), 5), and 6) will be repeated on an annual basis for a total&#xD;
      of three years&#xD;

        Any patient with a diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis who provides informed consent is&#xD;
        eligible for this study. Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited metabolic disorders&#xD;
        involving abnormal degradation of glycosaminoglycans. There are 11 different genes which,&#xD;
        when altered, can give rise to a mucopolysaccharidosis. People with this diagnosis can&#xD;
        develop significant cardiovascular disease (left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular&#xD;
        dysfunction, aortic root dilatation, arterial wall thickening and stiffness).&#xD;
