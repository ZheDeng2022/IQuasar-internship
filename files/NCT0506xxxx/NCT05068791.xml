  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to preliminarily estimate the efficacy of&#xD;
      psilocybin-facilitated treatment for fibromyalgia. Investigators will assess the impact of&#xD;
      psilocybin-facilitated treatment on pain, fatigue, and other fibromyalgia symptoms, in&#xD;
      addition to the level of functioning and quality of life. Investigators will also evaluate&#xD;
      potential mediators of treatment (e.g., treatment expectations, pain characteristics,&#xD;
      personality, beliefs/cognitions, emotions). Investigators hypothesize psilocybin treatment&#xD;
      will significantly reduce symptom severity in fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to two groups: Psilocybin or Active Placebo. Those in the&#xD;
      Psilocybin condition will receive .36 mg/kg of psilocybin. Based on previous research, .36&#xD;
      mg/kg of psilocybin is expected to balance the intention to increase the probability of&#xD;
      having a full mystical-type experience against the odds of having a subjectively challenging&#xD;
      psychological experience. Those in the Active Placebo condition will receive 2.6 mg/kg of&#xD;
      dextromethorphan (DXM). DXM was selected as the placebo drug in the current study because its&#xD;
      subjective and behavioral effects at higher doses can resemble those of classical&#xD;
      hallucinogens. Participants will be blinded to what drug they are administered. Participants&#xD;
      will be unblinded at the end of the study. Participants will attend between 7 to 9 study&#xD;
      sessions to complete the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested individuals who call research staff will undergo an initial telephone prescreen by&#xD;
      a trained member of the research staff: the study aims, protocol, and any possible risks will&#xD;
      be described and a series of questions will be asked to determine interest and eligibility&#xD;
      for screening for the study. Initial eligibility may also be assessed via an online&#xD;
      questionnaire through Qualtrics. Qualified participants will be scheduled for an in-person&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-person screening sessions will be conducted by the PI or trained research staff.&#xD;
      Individuals will first undergo informed consent; the consent form will describe the necessary&#xD;
      eligibility confirmation that takes place before proceeding with the full study. A physical&#xD;
      examination, a detailed psychiatric interview, several self-report questionnaires, and a&#xD;
      detailed medical history will be completed at the screening session, which takes place at the&#xD;
      UAB Clinical Research Unit. Participants will also have their blood drawn for screening&#xD;
      tests. Study staff will provide participants with a hand-held tablet device and instructions&#xD;
      on how to complete the daily symptom questionnaire via the tablet. They will be asked to&#xD;
      begin reporting daily symptoms on their tablet from home that evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be contacted by study staff by phone to inform them of their&#xD;
      eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo at least 2 weekly preparation sessions of approximately 2 hours&#xD;
      each, with the possibility of 1-2 additional weekly preparatory sessions per the discretion&#xD;
      of the investigator. These sessions are to educate participants on the study protocol,&#xD;
      psilocybin administration, and study treatment rationale. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a double-blind manner to the Psilocybin or Active Placebo group following their&#xD;
      final preparation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after the final preparation session, participants will be instructed to eat a&#xD;
      low-fat breakfast prior to presenting for their drug administration session at 8:00 am,&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour before drug administration. A urine sample will be collected to verify&#xD;
      drug-free and non-pregnant status and participants will be encouraged to relax and reflect&#xD;
      before drug administration. The drug administration session will take place over the course&#xD;
      of 8 hours. The guide and secondary monitor will be present with and monitor participants&#xD;
      throughout this session (at least one individual will always be present with the participant,&#xD;
      even during brief intervals when the guide or monitor may be using the restroom).&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for physical symptoms of distress and encouraged to report any&#xD;
      symptoms experienced. Blood pressure will be assessed pre-administration via automatic blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor, and will also be assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360&#xD;
      minutes post-administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight hours after drug administration, when the major drug effects have subsided,&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires assessing their experience. Participants will then&#xD;
      be released into the care of a friend or family member oriented to be emotionally supportive&#xD;
      of the participant (as arranged during preparation sessions) and instructed not to drive an&#xD;
      automobile or engage in any other potentially dangerous activity for the remainder of the&#xD;
      day. Participants will be provided with the guide's contact information by phone should they&#xD;
      feel the need for support that evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An immediate post-session meeting will be held the day following the drug administration&#xD;
      session. Participants will meet with the guide for approximately 2 hours to discuss and&#xD;
      reflect on their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final study visit will take place approximately 6 weeks later; some questionnaires that&#xD;
      were administered at Visit 1 will be administered again at the final visit. At the conclusion&#xD;
      of the final study visit, participants will be debriefed.&#xD;
