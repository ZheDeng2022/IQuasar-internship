  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study in the United States to evaluate the impact of Cerianna PET/CT&#xD;
      results on the clinical management of patients with known or suspected metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer (MBC). By showing whether breast cancer lesions express estrogen receptor (ER), a&#xD;
      Cerianna PET/CT scan may guide the physician in choosing the best treatment options for&#xD;
      certain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive either 1st line standard-of-care hormonal therapy or 2nd line&#xD;
      standard-of-care hormonal therapy for a primary lesion characterized as ER-positive and human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative will be included in the study. Each&#xD;
      patient will undergo screening within 30 days before the Cerianna PET/CT scan to determine&#xD;
      whether the patient meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      After screening, a standardized questionnaire will be completed by the treating physician to&#xD;
      evaluate the planned treatment before the Cerianna PET/CT scan. The planned treatment will be&#xD;
      evaluated again by the same treating physician within 3 weeks after the Cerianna PET/CT scan&#xD;
      using a similar questionnaire. Patients will be followed for 12 months to evaluate the actual&#xD;
      treatment undertaken, their clinical status and the results of standard-of-care&#xD;
      investigations at 6 months and 12 months after the Cerianna PET/CT scan. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a few questionnaires related to their experience with Cerianna PET/CT.&#xD;
      Maximum duration of follow-up for each patient: 14 months. First patient first visit to last&#xD;
      patient last visit: Estimated 24 months&#xD;
