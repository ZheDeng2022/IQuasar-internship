  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the safety and efficacy of pooled buffy-coat derived&#xD;
      platelets which had been frozen with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), in the prevention of&#xD;
      bleeding for patients with hypoproliferaitve thrombocytopenia. These platelets are hereafter&#xD;
      referred to as cryopreserved platelets. Patients who have severely low platelet count due to&#xD;
      impaired bone marrow function from chemotherapy or certain haematological conditions may need&#xD;
      platelet transfusion to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Currently, platelets are stored in&#xD;
      liquid form, and must be used within five to seven days of collection. In this study, DMSO is&#xD;
      used to preserve platelets during freezing so that they can be stored for longer than five to&#xD;
      seven days. Investigators hope to learn if thawed cryopreserved platelets are functional and&#xD;
      safe for transfusion in humans.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelets are currently stored in liquid form for a maximum of five to seven days. To extend&#xD;
      the shelf-life of platelets, DMSO is added to freeze platelets for long-term storage. In&#xD;
      vitro studies have shown that such cryopreserved platelets can be kept for at least two years&#xD;
      at -80oC. This study is a clinical trial that aims to primarily assess the safety of&#xD;
      cryopreserved pooled buffy coat-derived platelets in patients with hypoproliferative&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and no platelet refractoriness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised into two arms either a liquid platelet (control) or frozen&#xD;
      platelet arm (treatment) and may receive four or more platelet transfusions per&#xD;
      thrombocytopenic cycle. Each subject may participate in the study for up to two&#xD;
      thrombocytopenic period, assuming a wash-out period of at least five days (during which the&#xD;
      subject receives no platelet transfusions) between the two thrombocytopenic periods. If&#xD;
      subjects participate in the study for more than one thrombocytopenic period, they will&#xD;
      automatically be enrolled in the opposing arm for their second thrombocytopenic period.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase 1b/2a single centre clinical trial. Eligible hypoproliferative thrombocytopenic adult patients enrolled in the study will be randomised into two arms. One arm is the &quot;treatment&quot; arm using cryopreserved platelets and the second is the &quot;control&quot; arm using liquid platelets. A recruitment period of two years is expected for 17 subjects in each arm. Subjects will automatically be crossed over to the other treatment arm once they have completed the first treatment arm and there is at least a 5-days interval without platelet transfusion. Subjects can be both inpatient and outpatient. During the thrombocytopenic period of 28 days, subjects may be required to have multiple platelet transfusions during this period.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events related to platelet transfusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Monitoring will be for 24 hours (serum test 18-30 hours) post-transfusion.</time_frame>
    <description>There would be a close visual observation of the patient throughout the transfusion for the earliest signs of a transfusion reaction. Because patients can experience transfusion reactions several hours after the transfusion is completed, inpatients should be observed for late reactions during the subsequent 24 hour. Outpatient patients and their carer would be counselled about the possibility of the late adverse reactions and given access to immediate clinical help if they develop any symptoms of a transfusion reaction within 24 hour post-transfusion. Patients receiving cryopreserved platelets will be monitored and assessed for the side-effects of DMSO within 24 hour. These side effects include: headache, nausea, sedation, dizziness, abdominal or chest &amp; abdominal discomfort during and after transfusion. It also includes assessment for renal impairment related to DMSO by performing serum renal panel 18 to 30 hours post-transfusion of study platelets.</description>
