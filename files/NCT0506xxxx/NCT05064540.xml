    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, multi-center study designed to evaluate the outcomes of commercially&#xD;
      available contemporary EVAR in a real-world population. Patients will be randomized into two&#xD;
      device cohorts and compared across the primary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed procedurally to discharge, at 1, 6, 12 months and annually through&#xD;
      to 5 years (total follow-up commitment).&#xD;
