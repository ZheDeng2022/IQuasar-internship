  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic partial meniscectomie (APM) offers little short-term to medium-term benefit&#xD;
      above sham surgery or non-surgical management for knee function in most patients with a&#xD;
      symptomatic degenerative meniscus tear. It is suggested that APM is associated with increased&#xD;
      risk of accelerated progression of knee osteoarthritis in middle-aged to older patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the 5 year follow-up of the ESCAPE trial we will investigate the longterm results of APM&#xD;
      and physical therapy in patients with a meniscal tear over 45 years old.&#xD;

    <description>The OARSI atlas is a semi-quantitative instrument with focus to assess the severity of joint space narrowing and osteophytes in knee OA. We considered radiographic knee OA if any of the follow three criteria were met: 1) Joint space narrowing of grade 2 or higher; 2) sum of osteophyte grades ≥2 or 3) grade 1 joint space narrowing in combination with a grade 1 osteophyte.</description>

    <description>In the surgery group, the orthopaedic surgeon performed an arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) within 4 weeks after allocation. The surgeon removed the damaged part of the meniscus, until a stable and solid meniscus remained. All patients received written post-operative instructions. Eight weeks after surgery, patients received a consult in the outpatient orthopaedic clinic. In agreement with the Dutch Orthopaedic Association Guidelines, patients were referred to physical therapy when signs of abnormal recovery were present.&#xD;

    <description>The physical therapy program consisted of a physical therapist-led incremental exercise program containing of coordination/balance, closed kinetic chain strengths and cardiovascular exercises (see Appendix 1). The program was designed for 8 weeks with a total of 16 treatment sessions, each with a duration of 30 minutes. All 16 sessions were reimbursed. If knee symptoms persisted following the physical therapy program (e.g., knee pain, limitations in daily activities or mechanical dysfunction ), the patient could attend additional physical therapy sessions (not reimbursed by the study) or have meniscal surgery, depending on a shared decision after consultation with their orthopaedic surgeon.</description>
