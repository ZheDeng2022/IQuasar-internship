  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a cost-effective treatment for end-stage knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. It has demonstrable benefits such as reducing pain and improving activity and&#xD;
      quality of life. Despite the decrease in pain after surgery, the expectations of patients&#xD;
      regarding their physical functions are not fully realized. Physical performance tests and&#xD;
      reporting tests are used to objectively evaluate physical function and reveal the patient's&#xD;
      condition. It is known that physical performance tests better reflect post-surgical changes.&#xD;
      In addition, it has been stated that there may be serious differences between the results of&#xD;
      the reports based tests and the actual functional capacities of the patients. The 2-minute&#xD;
      walk test and the 6-minute walk test are tests that are used in the evaluation of lower&#xD;
      extremity physical performance and have been shown to be valid and reliable in different&#xD;
      populations. However, a certain length of corridor is needed in order to carry out these&#xD;
      timed walking tests. As an alternative to these, another test used in the evaluation of&#xD;
      physical performance is the 2-minute step test. This test, which was developed in 1999, does&#xD;
      not require much equipment and space, so the test can be easily applied in any environment.&#xD;
      In this test, a height specific to each individual is determined (as high from the ground as&#xD;
      the distance between the Spina iliaca anterior superior and the midpoint of the patella), and&#xD;
      the participant is asked to raise and lower both knees, respectively, to this height for 2&#xD;
      minutes. These tests used in the evaluation of patients should be valid, reliable and&#xD;
      sensitive. In clinical studies, reliability is an important psychometric property. Because&#xD;
      stable data are necessary to provide accurate data on treatment effects or the amount of&#xD;
      change observed over time. Another important psychometric property is validity. Validity is&#xD;
      defined as the degree to which a concept is accurately measured in a quantitative study.&#xD;
      Reliability studies of the 2-minute step test in active and sedentary lean adults have been&#xD;
      conducted, but the psychometric evaluations necessary for its routine use in patients with&#xD;
      TDP have not been performed.&#xD;

      This study is a non-experimental, descriptive methodological study. Fifty-two patients who&#xD;
      applied to the outpatient clinic of Kütahya Health Sciences University, Evliya Çelebi&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital due to knee osteoarthritis, will included in the study.&#xD;
      Pre-study power analysis was performed and the power to detect clinically significant&#xD;
      difference was calculated as 90% (5% Type I error level). The smallest sample size to be&#xD;
      taken was determined by using the sample size creation section in the G-Power (version&#xD;
      3.0.10) program.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital for Special Surgery knee-rating scale was developed to be used as a standardized tool to measure outcomes in patients with osteoarthritis and knee arthroplasty. The scale can be used to evaluate the patient before surgery and to monitor knee function after surgery. Hospital for Special Surgery knee rating scale is widely used in the clinic by physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The pain levels of the patients will be determined using the Numerical Pain Scale (NPS). This scale is a score containing values between 0-10 on a 10 cm horizontal line. In scoring, 0 points indicates the absence of pain, while 10 points means unbearable pain. Patients are asked to mark the part that is equivalent to their own pain on the 10 cm line. Thus, the pain level of the patients is determined.</description>

    <measure>2-Minute Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The participant stands and counts for 2 minutes. The minimum height to raise the knee is determined for each participant by calculating the midpoint between the patella and the anterior superior iliac spine. They are instructed to complete as many steps as possible during the 2-minute period. A verbal command is given every 30 seconds to encourage performance: &quot;You're doing great, keep it up.&quot; If the claudication symptom becomes unbearable, the patient can stop during the test, but the time is not stopped. Patients who discontinue testing due to symptoms of claudication are encouraged to return to testing as soon as possible. An evaluator records the number of steps in the right leg.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-Minute Walking Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is asked to walk as far as possible along a 30-meter straight corridor in a 6-minute period. Running is not allowed. The evaluator gives the standard incentive &quot;you are doing well, keep going&quot; every minute during the test. The distance traveled in 6 minutes is recorded in meters.</description>
