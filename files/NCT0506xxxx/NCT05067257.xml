      This Phase 2 study assesses the safety and efficacy of a single injection of Resiniferatoxin&#xD;
      versus placebo for the treatment of intractable advanced cancer pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global multicenter, randomized Phase 2 study for subjects with advanced cancer&#xD;
      experiencing intractable pain to assess the safety and efficacy of a single epidural&#xD;
      injection of Resiniferatoxin versus vehicle control. Additional subjects who elect to not&#xD;
      enroll but are willing to be followed will comprise a Concurrent Control Group. Subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for twelve months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Targeted pain area of involvement that is at or below the lower thoracic or chest&#xD;
             level down to lower extremities, attributed to the cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If pain is present in other areas, able to differentiate pain in the target area is&#xD;
             the primary source of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intractable pain that has not responded to standard therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be opioid tolerant, defined as an average daily opioid consumption &gt; 30 mg oral&#xD;
             morphine equivalent dose during the screening and which has been stable for the month&#xD;
             prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Scale score ≥ 50 at Screening&#xD;

             to complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unless approachable via the caudal route, have the level of intended epidural&#xD;
             injection within site of prior lumbar spine surgical procedures that could disrupt the&#xD;
             epidural space or otherwise impair ability of the injection to reach nerves&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of a non-correctable coagulopathy or hemostasis problem including a low&#xD;
             platelet count, prothrombin time, abnormal PT or PTT, or on anticoagulant or&#xD;
