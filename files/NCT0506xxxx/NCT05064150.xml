  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With so many therapeutic options available (i.e.: biologic therapy, liver directed therapy,&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy), the purpose of this project is to partner with patients on&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness research (CER) to achieve the goal of alleviating undue toxicity,&#xD;
      and optimizing effectiveness and sequencing of therapy for NET patients. We will conduct a&#xD;
      study of all newly occurring GEP-NET and lung NET cases aged 18 years and older diagnosed&#xD;
      between 01/01/2019 through 12/31/2023 across 14 participating PCORnet sites, enrolling an&#xD;
      average of 215 patients per site over the 3 year study period (~3,000 patients total),&#xD;
      allowing up to 60 months of follow-up for medical record outcomes. Participants will complete&#xD;
      four online or paper surveys over 18 months; these surveys will focus on patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes, including questions on quality of life, treatment decisions, and experiences with&#xD;
      cancer care. Survey data will be linked to participant medical record data to achieve study&#xD;
      aims.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of neoplasms that occur most frequently in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and the lungs collectively referred to as&#xD;
      gastroenteropancreatic (GEP-NETs) and lung-NETs. There are currently fewer than 180,000&#xD;
      patients living with this condition in the United States, meeting the criteria for rare&#xD;
      disease status. NETs are typically slow growing, with vague signs and a myriad of symptoms&#xD;
      (carcinoid syndrome) leading to diagnostic delays. Thus, NET patients typically experience a&#xD;
      prolonged clinical course with active disease, and many have significant symptom burdens.&#xD;
      However, assessment of quality of life outside of therapy trials remains scarce and of poor&#xD;
      quality. What's more, over half of GEP-NETs are diagnosed with spread of their disease at&#xD;
      diagnosis and are not candidates for curative surgery. Fortunately, many of these tumors are&#xD;
      amenable to long-term medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SSAs)- which slow down&#xD;
      the production of hormones, especially serotonin, which helps to control the symptoms of&#xD;
      carcinoid syndrome. However, living with distant spread of the disease increases the&#xD;
      probability for the disease to progress. Following failure of first-line SSA therapy there&#xD;
      are no clear consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of other therapeutic options.&#xD;
      NET patients are left wondering not only 'what therapy would be best to try next?', but 'if I&#xD;
      were to take this option now, what treatment options will be closed off to me in the future?'&#xD;
      and clinicians are unsure as to how best to tailor treatment selection on the characteristics&#xD;
      of the patient and their tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no large nationally recruiting prospective (forward in time) observational&#xD;
      study of NET patients. Our large study will robustly generate real-world evidence on the&#xD;
      frequency and sequence of commonly used treatments for GEP and lung NET patients in relation&#xD;
      to Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and survival/progression, endpoints that matter most to&#xD;
      NET patients, their caregivers, and clinicians involved in their care. Given the lack of&#xD;
      consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of treatments, evidence generated in this&#xD;
      study will aid patient (and clinician) navigation and selection of the next most appropriate&#xD;
      therapy, accounting for the preferences and needs of the individual patient, whilst&#xD;
      respecting the underlying profile of their tumor. Moreover, the infrastructure this study&#xD;
      will generate (i.e.: electronic identification of NET patients, entry and completion of tumor&#xD;
      table data in PCORnet, and a unique NET patient health record portal), will foster future CER&#xD;
      studies in NETs and other rare diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the frequency of treatment regimens received by line of therapy, and examine&#xD;
           their association with symptom burden and changes in 6, 12 and 18 month health-related&#xD;
           quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes. The influence of patient preferences, beliefs,&#xD;
           attitudes, and experience of care on choice of these treatment regimens will also be&#xD;
           examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the association of patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics on the&#xD;
           selection of first-line and beyond treatment regimens and compare the effects of common&#xD;
           treatment sequences on frequency of subsequent treatments received and outcomes of&#xD;
           overall survival and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) regimens on&#xD;
           outcomes of renal toxicity, disease progression, and patient-reported symptoms and&#xD;
           HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To disseminate lessons learned and expand enrollment of the prospective cohort to other&#xD;
           interested PCORnet sites, patient advocate organizations, and to use the infrastructure&#xD;
           developed to aid in the study of other rare diseases.&#xD;

    <measure>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score across baseline, 6, 12, and 18 month time points.</time_frame>
    <description>Incorporates five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), a global health status / QoL scale, and a number of single items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. Responses to the QLQ-C30 will be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale using EORTC guidelines, a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, or a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire - Neuroendocrine Carcinoid Module (EORTC QLQ-GI.NET21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score across baseline, 6, 12, and 18 month time points.</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-GINET21 contains a total of 21 items: four single-item assessments relating to muscle and/or bone pain (MBP), body image (BI), information (INF) and sexual functioning (SX), together with 17 items organized into five proposed scales: endocrine symptoms (ED; three items), GI symptoms (GI; five items), treatment-related symptoms (TR; three items), social functioning (SF) of the new module (SF21; three items) and disease-related worries (DRW; three items). Responses to the QLQ-GINET21 will be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale using EORTC guidelines, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29 v2.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score across baseline, 6, 12, and 18 month time points.</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 defines seven HRQoL subdomains (physical functioning, participation in social roles, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference and sleep disturbance) that are based on four 5-point Likert style questions per domain (and one additional question on pain intensity). T- score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. Thus, a person who has a T- score of 60 lies one standard deviation higher than the average of the general population for the concept being measured. A high score always represents more of the concept being measured. Thus, for symptoms and other negatively- worded concepts like pain, fatigue and anxiety, a 60 is one standard deviation worse than average. For function scores and other positively- worded concepts like physical or social function, a 60 is one standard deviation better than average.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) psychological illness impact - negative (Short Form 4a)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score across baseline, 6, 12, and 18 month time points.</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS assessment of psychological impact negative will be administered to provide an additional dimension to the HRQoL results. Raw PROMIS scores will be normalized against a representative sample from the general population and scaled to 100, in which 50 represents the general population average and every 10-point difference reflects one standard deviation. T- score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. Thus, a person who has a T- score of 60 lies one standard deviation higher than the average of the general population for the concept being measured.</description>
