    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a communication skills-focused&#xD;
      psychoeducation program on the subjective well-being of primary caregivers of individuals&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, with the adoption of contemporary treatment models, the relatives of individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia have become caregivers. Some caregivers who are not competent enough to&#xD;
      communicate satisfactorily with a person diagnosed with schizophrenia may have problems in&#xD;
      patient-patient-relative interaction. Problems that occur frequently in expressing oneself,&#xD;
      giving appropriate reactions in interaction with the patient and creating a sense of trust&#xD;
      are seen as a major source of concern by caregivers. In the solution of this problem,&#xD;
      improving the communication skills of the caregiver and increasing the self-confidence and&#xD;
      motivation to communicate with the individual diagnosed with schizophrenia is an area that&#xD;
      should be addressed by mental health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using a communication skills focused psychoeducation program, it is aimed to increase the&#xD;
      level of subjective well-being of caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia by&#xD;
      establishing healthy and positive relationships, coping with the negative emotions and&#xD;
      difficulties they face, realizing their strengths, and leading a happy and meaningful life.&#xD;
      Within the scope of this aim, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of a communication skills&#xD;
      focused psychoeducation program on the subjective well-being of caregivers of individuals&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned as an experimental study with a randomized control group in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of psychoeducation focused on communication skills on the subjective&#xD;
      well-being of caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the research will be family members who apply to ZBEÜ Application and&#xD;
      Research Center Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic and care for individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia according to DSM-5 TR criteria. Statistical power analysis was applied for the&#xD;
      number of samples. While calculating the power values, the results were determined within the&#xD;
      scope of 95% confidence level. According to the power values obtained from the reference&#xD;
      study in parallel with the research to be carried out, if this study is studied with a total&#xD;
      of 60 observations, a test power of approximately 88.5% is reached. As a result, according to&#xD;
      the power analysis, it was determined that the research could be done with 60 observations.&#xD;
      The caregiver family members included in the study will be stratified according to the scores&#xD;
      they get from the care burden and communication skills scale and some individual&#xD;
      characteristics, and an equal number of individuals from each stratum will be selected, and&#xD;
      they will be included in two intervention groups and a control group by randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Criteria for Inclusion of Caregivers in the Research are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient receiving care should have been diagnosed with schizophrenia at least one&#xD;
           year ago according to the DSM-V TR diagnostic criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Living together with the caregiver for at least six months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Being directly (fully) responsible for the care of the patient being cared for,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Being 18 years or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Residing in the city center of Zonguldak,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To be at least primary school graduate,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No hearing and comprehension problems. The first measurements (Information Form, Zarit&#xD;
           Care Burden Scale, Subjective Well-Being Scale and Communication Skills Scale) will be&#xD;
           collected by making face-to-face preliminary interviews with the caregivers who meet the&#xD;
           research criteria and agree to participate in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the pre-test, intervention and control groups will be formed in line with homogeneity&#xD;
      in terms of scale scores and some individual characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the control group continues their routine follow-ups, psychoeducation focused on&#xD;
      communication skills will be applied to the first intervention group and general&#xD;
      psychoeducation program to the second intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the psychoeducation program is completed, final measurements will be collected for&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. Follow-up measurements will be made in the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups in the 1st and 3rd months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first intervention group will be given a communication skills-focused psychoeducation&#xD;
      program for eight weeks, one session per week, for a total of eight sessions. The number of&#xD;
      sessions was planned with reference to the study in which the effect of the psychoeducation&#xD;
      program on general health and communication skills in caregivers of individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia was investigated. The second intervention group will be given a general&#xD;
      psychoeducation program for four weeks, one session per week, in total. Session groups will&#xD;
      be formed from a single session of 60-90 minutes for each topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scales Subjective well-being scale: The scale is a five-point Likert type consisting of 46&#xD;
      items. The aim of the scale is to determine the subjective well-being levels of individuals&#xD;
      by determining the frequency and intensity of positive and negative emotions with their&#xD;
      cognitive evaluations of their lives. Subjective well-being scale consists of personal&#xD;
      judgments and positive and negative emotional expressions about living spaces. The lowest&#xD;
      score that can be obtained from the scale is 46, and the highest score is 230. A high score&#xD;
      indicates a high level of subjective well-being.&#xD;
