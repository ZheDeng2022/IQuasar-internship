  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study adopted a practical approach in intermittent cooling on forehead and neck during&#xD;
      an intra-squad baseball game. Exit velocity of batted balls was used as an indicator for&#xD;
      hitting performance and a baseball-specific reactive agility test to evaluate the cognitive&#xD;
      performance in defense.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study used a randomized cross-over design. Each participant completed a cooling and a&#xD;
      non-cooling trial in a random order, separated by a 20-day washout period. Each trial&#xD;
      contained a 7-inning intra-squad game in hot environment. Hitting, reactive agility, and&#xD;
      cognitive tests were administered before and after the game. Forehead skin and tympanic&#xD;
      temperature, perceived exertion, and thermal sensation were measured during the game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental procedure After body weight and rectal temperature were measured in a&#xD;
      temperature-controlled room, the participants consumed a standardized breakfast. The&#xD;
      breakfast included white bread 1.2 g/kg, jam 0.1 g/kg, butter 0.l g/kg, and soybean milk 5&#xD;
      ml/kg (6.2 kcal/kg, containing carbohydrate 1.0 g/kg, protein 0.24 g/kg, and fat 0.14 g/kg).&#xD;
      Go/NoGo and Stroop Color-Word tasks were administered after breakfast. After finishing the&#xD;
      cognitive tests, the participants moved to the field for self-selected warm up, followed by&#xD;
      hitting and reactive agility tests. After the intra-squad game, the participants repeated the&#xD;
      hitting, reactive agility, and cognitive tests. The participants can drink water ad libitum&#xD;
      during the experimental period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-squad game The 7-inning intra-squad games were played under the standard rules of&#xD;
      baseball in hot environmental conditions (temperature 31.1-33.4℃, humidity 63-67%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooling intervention The participants in the cooling trial put cold towels on their forehead&#xD;
      and neck for 3 min in the shaded dugout during their offensive half innings when they were&#xD;
      not scheduled to hit or on base. Each participant received the cooling intervention 3 to 4&#xD;
      times in each game. After each use, the towels were kept in a cooler that contained water&#xD;
      mixed with ice and salt to keep the temperature at approximately 0℃. The participants in the&#xD;
      control trial sat in the shaded dugout without any cooling intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of temperature Rectal temperature was measured before breakfast and after the&#xD;
      game with a digital thermometer fitted with disposable sheaths. Forehead skin and tympanic&#xD;
      temperature were measured with infrared thermometers during their offensive half innings in&#xD;
      the dugout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hitting test The participants used their own bat to hit balls thrown by a pitching machine&#xD;
      positioned 12 m from the home plate. The ball speed was approximately 120 km/h. The&#xD;
      participants were asked to make the best effort to hit the balls. Each test was consisted of&#xD;
      15 batted balls. Exit velocity was measured with a video system and swing power was measured&#xD;
      with a sensor attached to the knob of the bat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactive agility test The infielders played defense against ground balls at the short stop&#xD;
      position while the outfielders played defense against fly balls in center field. The&#xD;
      participants were asked to move toward the ball as soon as they determine the trajectory and&#xD;
      make the best effort to catch it. Each test was consisted of 15 batted balls. The reaction&#xD;
      time, the time from bat-ball contact to the participant's first definitive movement in the&#xD;
      intended direction, was calculated post-hoc using frame-by-frame analysis of the video&#xD;
      footage by an experienced coach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive tests The Go/NoGo and Stroop Color-Word tasks were administered on a laptop&#xD;
      computer in a quiet room. Each task contained 100 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived exertion and thermal sensation The participants reported their perceived exertion&#xD;
      and thermal sensation during their offensive half innings. Perceived exertion was estimated&#xD;
      with a 10-point Borg scale. Thermal sensation was estimated with a 7-point scale from -3&#xD;
      being the coolest to 3 being the hottest.&#xD;
