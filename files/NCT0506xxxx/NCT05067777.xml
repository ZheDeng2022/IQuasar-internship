    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of massage in decreasing prostate cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue. Massage therapy has well known health benefits. This trial aims to find out if&#xD;
      massage and touch therapies reduce fatigue due to cancer, and to learn if these therapies are&#xD;
      better than traditional medicine or psychology for cancer related fatigue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a preliminary study to evaluate whether a 6-week Swedish Massage Therapy (SMT)&#xD;
      intervention decreases cancer-related fatigue (CRF) significantly more than Light Touch (LT)&#xD;
      or Wait List Control (WLC) among prostate cancer (PCa) survivors who have received both&#xD;
      radiation and androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether the hypothesized decrease in cancer-related fatigue with SMT is&#xD;
      associated with modulation of specific immune system factors underlying chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether SMT improves self-reported fatigue, quality of life, depression, and&#xD;
      anxiety significantly more than LT or WLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To gather preliminary data about the sustained actions of 6 weeks of SMT versus LT on&#xD;
      CRF, at 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive SMT over 45 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive LT over 45 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm III: Patients receive no intervention for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 and 18 weeks.&#xD;
