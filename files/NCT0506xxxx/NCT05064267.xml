    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional pilot study will examine the blood clotting patterns in children with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease stages 3, 4, and 5. A total of 30 participants will be enrolled with&#xD;
      10 participants for each stage of chronic kidney disease. Blood specimens will be collected&#xD;
      from each participant during a routine clinic visit, and will then be processed to evaluate&#xD;
      blood clotting characteristics according to thrombelastography and more conventional clotting&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with 5% of all pediatric inpatient venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE) occurrences, but rates of occurrence are likely underreported in&#xD;
      current literature. VTE is associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality, and exponentially&#xD;
      higher rates of healthcare expenditure. Because VTE is a low-incidence but high-impact&#xD;
      complication of CKD, evaluating those at risk presents a unique challenge. The underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of thrombosis in CKD is poorly understood, but likely involves changes across&#xD;
      the hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems. Standard laboratory tests provide a poor&#xD;
      representation of in-vivo clot formation, particularly in the complex hemostatic environment&#xD;
      of CKD, as these tests undergo centrifugation and much of the cellular debris known to&#xD;
      contribute to clot formation is lost. Viscoelastic assays are a reemerging tool that provide&#xD;
      a qualitative measure of each hemostatic milestone, from clot formation through degradation,&#xD;
      in whole-blood; thereby preserving the cellular debris and additional factors that contribute&#xD;
      to clot formation in-vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of Thrombelastography vs conventional&#xD;
      clotting tests to predict onset of hypercoagulability and the relationship to the stage of&#xD;
      pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The investigators hypothesize that as kidney function&#xD;
      deteriorates, a more pronounced prothrombotic profile is expected to emerge according to TEG&#xD;
      and conventional clotting tests. This will be demonstrated by an overall increase in measured&#xD;
      values across the coagulation portion of the TEG and a decrease in the measured fibrinolysis.&#xD;
      According to conventional clotting tests, it is expected to find increased levels of Factor&#xD;
      VIII antigen, Fibrinogen, vWF, Protein C/S, and D-dimer. Depending upon an individual's&#xD;
      degree of proteinuria, levels of Antithrombin would be expected to decrease as it is lost in&#xD;
      the urine. This urinary loss of Antithrombin would also contribute to an overall&#xD;
      prothrombotic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional pilot study will enroll 30 participants between the ages of 6 months and&#xD;
      17 years who have been previously diagnosed with CKD stages 3, 4, or 5. Enrollment will occur&#xD;
      during a routine clinic visit wherein the participant was also previously scheduled to&#xD;
      receive venipuncture for ongoing monitoring of labs. Study specific lab values, in addition&#xD;
      to routine lab values of interest and pertinent past medical history, will be extracted from&#xD;
      the EMR.&#xD;
