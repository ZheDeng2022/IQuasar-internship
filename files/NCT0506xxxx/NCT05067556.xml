    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP) will be assessed by analyzing change in self-reported pain scores using The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System short form 3a v1.0 (PROMIS). This tool measures how much a person hurts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Use Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP) will be assessed by self-reported opioid use frequency weekly throughout the intervention period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP) will be assessed by analyzing pain interference using the PROMIS short form 8a. The PROMIS Pain Interference instrument measures the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of a person's life and may include the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Opioid Refill Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
