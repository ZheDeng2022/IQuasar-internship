  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TolaSure is a topical gel for the promotion of accelerated wound healing. This Phase I study&#xD;
      will assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of TolaSure when applied to&#xD;
      wounded skin areas of patients diagnosed with severe epidermolysis bullosa simplex (i.e.,&#xD;
      EBS-Dowling Meara). A total of 10, severe EBS patients, males and females ages 18 years and&#xD;
      older, will be enrolled. Patients will apply TolaSure and Vehicle Gel once-daily for a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a closed-label, randomized, double-blind, Phase I clinical study to assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the investigational product (IP), TolaSure Gel, 5% w/w, in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with severe epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS, previously known as EBS-Dowling&#xD;
      Meara). Each patient (5 to complete) will apply TolaSure Gel, 5% w/w and TolaSure Vehicle Gel&#xD;
      once-daily to defined Treatment Areas and Suction Blister Areas. End of Study (EOS) will&#xD;
      occur at the Principal Investigator's (PI's) discretion according to the resolution or lack&#xD;
      of improvement of the Treatment Areas. The maximum time a patient could be in the study is 10&#xD;
      weeks. The average time frame for each patient to complete the study is expected to be 6-8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint will be the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events&#xD;
      (TEAEs). Safety monitoring will include physical exams, vital sign measurements, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory testing (blood and urinalysis), and urine pregnancy testing (as appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints will (1) assess wound severity within the Treatment Areas using&#xD;
      an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scoring system, (2) examine under a microscope&#xD;
      keratinocyte morphology and the incidence of keratin aggregates in Treatment Area skin&#xD;
      biopsies, (3) determine the time required to induce a suction blister within the designated&#xD;
      Suction Blister Areas, and (4) evaluate patient self-assessment of overall impression, pain,&#xD;
      and itch within the Treatment Areas. The information obtained from these assessments will be&#xD;
      used to examine the efficacy of TolaSure treatment in improving EBS symptoms.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has a documented genetic mutation in either the keratin 14 (K14) or keratin 5&#xD;
             (K5) gene and that their EBS diagnosis and/or specific mutation are consistent with&#xD;
             severe EBS (previously EBS-DM). (If severe EBS is suspected but not genetically&#xD;
             confirmed, confirmatory testing will be performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient possesses the four required skin areas:&#xD;

                       area. Individually, a treatment area may be continuous or non-contiguous and&#xD;
                       must contain newly-formed blisters/erosions. Ideally, the two Treatment&#xD;
                       Areas on the patient should not be adjacent to each other and should be&#xD;
                       located bilaterally and roughly symmetrically on the trunk, abdomen, or&#xD;
                       upper or lower extremities.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient's laboratory values (blood and urine) are within the range of normal or&#xD;
             abnormal values are within normal levels for the disease and in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator the values are not clinically relevant for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical&#xD;
             condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of the EBS&#xD;

             containing antimicrobials, keratin, and/or collagen, lipido-colloid or polymeric&#xD;
             membrane dressings, and/or hydrogels).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions in order&#xD;
             to maintain compliance throughout the study period.&#xD;

                  might put the subject at undue risk by study participation or interferes with the&#xD;
                  study medication application or the study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An illness (e.g., neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, or&#xD;
                  metabolic disease), condition, or situation that in the opinion of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Factors present in the patient and/or his/her legal representative that could&#xD;
