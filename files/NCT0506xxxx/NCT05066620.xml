  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TCM is an essential context of the ICH management in Chinese culture. Given the potential&#xD;
      benefits of Chinese herbal medicine FYTF-919 in reducing haematoma and bleeding after acute&#xD;
      ICH from fundamental research and small clinical studies, more reliable evidence is required&#xD;
      to guide ICH treatment using TCM. This study aims to determine the effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      of TCM in a larger sample of patients with moderate-severe ICH and provide evidence for TCM&#xD;
      clinical guidelines on ICH management. The presumed mechanism of action is in promoting the&#xD;
      reabsorption of the haematoma and perihematomal oedema in ICH.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to be&#xD;
      conducted through hospital network of investigators in China. A total of 1504 patients with&#xD;
      ICH will be recruited from approximately 20-30 hospitals. Randomised is via a central&#xD;
      internet-based system according to block random grouping method stratified by site,&#xD;
      neurological severity NIHSS &lt;15 vs ≥15), and haematoma location (basal ganglia + lobe vs&#xD;
      thalamus + cerebellum + brain stem + ventricle) to ensure balance in key prognostic factors.&#xD;
      Endpoint assessment will be blinded to treatment allocation. The primary aim of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness and safety of a Chinese herbal medicine FYTF-919 as compared&#xD;
      to placebo on functional recovery according to Utility-weighted modified Rankin scale&#xD;
      (UW-mRS) at 90 days after acute ICH. Secondary aims include examining whether the Chinese&#xD;
      herbal medicine FYTF-919 leads to positive treatment effect on: 1) Utility-weighted mRS&#xD;
      scores at 180 days; 2)Ordinal analysis of 7 levels of mRS at 28 days, 90 days and 180 days;&#xD;
      3) Poor prognosis, defined as mRS 4-6 points at 28 days, 90 days and 180 days; 4) NIHSS score&#xD;
      at 7 days and 28 days; 5) Mortality rate at 28 days, 90 days and 180 days; 6) Discharge rate&#xD;
      at 28 days; 7) EQ-5D-5L at 28days, 90 days and 180 days; 8) BI at 28 days, 90 days and 180&#xD;
      days; 9) The cerebral edema volume at baseline, 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days or at discharge;&#xD;
      10) The hematoma volume at baseline, 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days or discharge; 11) The&#xD;
      incidence of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) patients; 12) Clinical pulmonary infection&#xD;
      score (CIPS) at the onset of SAP, 3 days, and 7 days, after the occurrence of SAP; 13) Chest&#xD;
      imaging (DR/CT), body temperature, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      procalcitonin (PCT) blood gas analysis, and sputum culture/airway aspirate culture at the&#xD;
      onset of SAP, 3 days, and 7 days after the occurrence of SAP; 14) Antibiotic usage among&#xD;
      patients with SAP.&#xD;
