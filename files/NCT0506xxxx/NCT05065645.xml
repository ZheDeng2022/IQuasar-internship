  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APN01 is a soluble recombinant form of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2)&#xD;
      that is currently under development as a therapy for corona-virus-disease 2019 (COVID-19). By&#xD;
      effectively mimicking ACE2 within the body, APN01 is designed to block the SARS-CoV-2 from&#xD;
      binding to the ACE2 receptor and infecting cells while at the same time downregulating the&#xD;
      renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS) to help prevent inflammation and organ injury -&#xD;
      critical components involved in the cytokine storm response. ACE2 is the key entry receptor&#xD;
      for the SARS-CoV-2. Competitive binding by exogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)&#xD;
      may block viral entry, thereby decreasing viral replication in ACE2 expressing organs and&#xD;
      protecting the lungs and distal organs from injury induced by SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APN01 has been developed as an IV agent to treat acute lung injury and pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, and moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Encouraged by the favorable safety&#xD;
      profile of IV APN01, we have developed the nebulized APN01 formulation to deliver the drug&#xD;
      directly to the respiratory tract, where the virus is mainly found, decreasing systemic&#xD;
      exposure and increasing local pulmonary concentration. APN01 intravenously and as inhalation&#xD;
      in preclinical studies has been well tolerated with no overall difference in clinical studies&#xD;
      from placebo in human trials to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate nebulized APN01 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity before stepping forward in proof-of-concept studies in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy males and females between 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the screening&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an Ethics Committee&#xD;
             approved informed consent prior to performing any of the screening visit procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is able to understand and is willing to comply with all study requirements,&#xD;
             and willing to follow the instructions of the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, should not be&#xD;
             breastfeeding, and must be willing to use highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             for at least 1 month before, while participating in this study and until 1 month after&#xD;
             the end of the treatment. The following terms of contraception apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
             4.1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
             the participant). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4.2. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking&#xD;
             study intervention. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status&#xD;
             of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4.3. Sterilization of male partner (at least 6 months prior to Screening) with&#xD;
             post-procedural semen specimen to verify a successful procedure (the report of the&#xD;
             male partner will not be collected since the partner is not study participant). For&#xD;
             female participants on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole&#xD;
             partner for that participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4.4. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system, or other forms of&#xD;
             non-hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4.5. Women who are postmenopausal are not required to use contraception. A&#xD;
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal&#xD;
             range (FSH &gt; 40 U/ml at Screening) must be used to confirm a postmenopausal state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male subject must agree to stay abstinent or must use together with his female&#xD;
             partner(s) use a form of highly effective contraceptive from the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent form (ICF) until up to 3 months after receiving the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Nonsmokers (and/or no use of other nicotine products during 1 year before screening&#xD;
             visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Healthy with no clinically significant findings, determined by medical evaluation&#xD;
             (medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical&#xD;
             laboratory evaluations) at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female subjects who are breastfeeding or female subjects with a positive pregnancy&#xD;
             test at the screening visit or admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Study participant has a history of an anaphylactic reaction to study drug or&#xD;
             components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has used an investigational drug within 30 days (or 5 half-lives whichever is&#xD;
             longer) prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is on any regular (more than 4 days a week) prescription or nonprescription&#xD;
             over the counter medication, topical medications, vitamins, dietary or herbal&#xD;
             (occasional use of acetaminophen, paracetamol or ibuprofen allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has positive urine test for drugs of abuse at the screening visit or&#xD;
             admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Regular consumption of alcohol within 6 months prior to Screening (&gt; 7 drinks/week for&#xD;
             females, &gt; 14 drinks/week for males where 1 drink = 5 ounces [150 ml] of wine or 12&#xD;
             ounces [360 ml] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 ml] of hard liquor), or use of illicit&#xD;
             substances (such as marijuana) within 3 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;

         14. Subject has acute, clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to admission,&#xD;
             or any other condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
