  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to test the feasibility of a new digital (mHealth) physical activity support&#xD;
      program, delivered through an innovative mHealth platform (Curatio) for individuals living&#xD;
      with spinal cord injury (SCI) who walk. The rationale for this project is to understand&#xD;
      whether a mHealth intervention for increasing the amount and quality of physical activity is&#xD;
      feasible for individuals with SCI who walk. The plan is to assess engagement, acceptability&#xD;
      and feasibility in addition to primary outcomes related to physical activity behaviour. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible and acceptable to deliver to&#xD;
      individuals with SCI who walk. The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention will&#xD;
      be engaging but recommendations will be made by participants following the study. Finally, it&#xD;
      is hypothesized that compared with individuals in the wait-list control group, individuals in&#xD;
      the intervention group will experience the following improvements related to exercise after&#xD;
      8-weeks: fulfillment of basic psychological needs, greater autonomous motivation, have&#xD;
      enhanced social support, better action control, improved facilitators for behaviour change,&#xD;
      more leisure-time physical activity, better quality participation, and enhanced employment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) application called Stronger Together. Stronger Together is an app that hosts&#xD;
      programs for individuals with chronic illnesses and disabilities. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators are developing and testing the Stronger Together program that aims to improve&#xD;
      the quantity and quality of physical activity among ambulators with SCI. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      study will also collect pilot data on the magnitude of the effects on physical activity&#xD;
      participation (quality and quantity) and psychosocial influences on physical activity.&#xD;
      Individuals living with SCI who walk and live in Canada or the United States will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study and will be assigned to either a wait-list control or intervention&#xD;
      group. The wait-list control group will be instructed to maintain current health habits and&#xD;
      not to engage in any new physical activity or health programs for the next 8-weeks. The&#xD;
      wait-list control group will be invited to access the intervention after 8-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be immediately directed to complete the consent forms/baseline&#xD;
      measures in Qualtrics. Once consent and baseline measures are completed, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into either the wait-list control or intervention condition. The investigators&#xD;
      will aim to recruit at least 8-10 participants with consent and baseline measures completed&#xD;
      before randomization into conditions in order for there to be enough participants in the&#xD;
      program at the same time for peer support. After the first 8-10 participants, individuals&#xD;
      will be randomized immediately after baseline testing so that participants randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group can join others in the app right away. Randomization will be done by the&#xD;
      investigators using a random numbers generator in blocks of 2 and 4 with even groups in each&#xD;
      condition (i.e., n=10 per condition). Waitlist-control participants will be directed to&#xD;
      continue normal daily activity. Intervention participants will be directed to the App store&#xD;
      to download the Stronger Together app to proceed with app registration. Participants will&#xD;
      then be connected with the community coach who is a 'real live person' who monitors in-app&#xD;
      activity. Other in-app features include peer discussion groups, behavioural support, and&#xD;
      educational modules to support strategies to increase the quantity and quality of physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8-week program features weekly blocks of content. Each week builds from the previous week&#xD;
      and targets specific components related to the three basic psychological needs (autonomy,&#xD;
      relatedness, competence). The overall cadence of each weekly block is maintained throughout.&#xD;
      For example, each week contains: 1) education modules 2) a worksheet or guided practice 3)&#xD;
      behavioural support from the community coach and 4) peer support from the discussion group.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will be encouraged to use the app as often as needed&#xD;
      (but at least once per week) and actively participate in the programming. The community coach&#xD;
      (SL) will prompt participants who have not engaged in the app in a week to remind&#xD;
      participants to complete weekly modules. In-app data, including user metrics will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed for descriptive patterns and assess correlations with the outcome&#xD;
      measures (e.g., is the amount of time spent in-app correlated with changes in behaviour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both the intervention and control groups will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      eight online questionnaires provided through the survey platform Qualtrics at three different&#xD;
      time points (baseline/onboarding, 4- and 8-weeks of using the Stronger Together program). A&#xD;
      link to these questionnaires which will be hosted on Qualtrics will be emailed to all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the final online survey (at 8-weeks), participants in the intervention group&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in an interview to further explore their experiences and to&#xD;
      increase understanding of factors that influence acceptability and satisfaction of the&#xD;
      Stronger Together program. The interview will be structured whereby the participant will go&#xD;
      through the application with the interviewer to discuss preferred components. This will&#xD;
      provide a greater understanding of user engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, feasibility metrics will be kept and recorded throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change in Basic Psychological Needs will be assessed at three time points: Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Basic Psychological Needs will be assessed using the The Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise Scale (Wilson et al., 2006). This 18-item scale assesses the satisfaction of the psychological needs for exercise using a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (false) to 6 (true) (Wilson et al., 2006). A mean can be calculated for each psychological need (6-items each for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) with a higher score representing greater satisfaction of that need.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Physical Activity Participation - Measure of Experiential Aspects of Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Quality of Physical Activity Participation will be assessed at three time points: Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of physical activity participation will be assessed using The Measure of Experiential Aspects of Participation (MeEAP).The scale is a questionnaire to assess the six experiential aspects of participation (i.e., belongingness, meaning, mastery, engagement, challenge, and autonomy) across life domains (Caron et al., 2019). The scale is completed separately for each life domain with 12-items. Participants will be asked to complete the scale for the exercise and sport domains only, for a total 24 items. Participants respond using a 7-point Likert type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).</description>
