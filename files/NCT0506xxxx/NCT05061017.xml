  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this trial is to assess clinical response to nivolumab and pixatimod,&#xD;
      and, nivolumab, pixatimod and cyclophosphamide in three separate patient cohorts. Cohort 1:&#xD;
      MSS mCRC in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide, Cohort 2: PD-1 relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      melanoma, and Cohort 3: PD-1 relapsed/refractory NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Nivolumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), malignant pleural mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of head/neck, urothelial carcinoma, MSI-H colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pixatimod is an investigational drug that activates the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway&#xD;
      and is being evaluated in studies involving melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and&#xD;
      microsatellite stable colorectal cancer. (ADD THIS). Cyclophosphamide is approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia, breast cancer, chronic granulocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, mycosis fungoides, neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian cancer, retinoblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose (immunomodulatory) cyclophosphamide is being studied in combination with various&#xD;
      types of immunotherapy including nivolumab and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase llA trial hypothesizes that the nivolumab/pixatimod combination in PD-1&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) cutaneous melanoma and NSCLC patients will be associated with&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects, and that the nivolumab/pixatimod/cyclophosphamide combination in MSS mCRC&#xD;
      patients will be associated with anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st stage, 13 patients will be enrolled in cohort 1 while 9 patients each will be&#xD;
      enrolled in cohorts 2 and 3. Should the pre-specified efficacy boundary met, further patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to one or more cohorts in 2nd stage. The total enrollment for 1st stage&#xD;
      across all 3 cohorts is 31 response-evaluable patients. The total enrollment for both stages&#xD;
      across all 3 cohorts is 61 response-evaluable patients.&#xD;

             conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of&#xD;
