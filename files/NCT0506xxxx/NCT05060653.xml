  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess pain response after combining stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SBRT) and pedicle screw fixation in a 48-hour window for the treatment of&#xD;
      painful unstable metastases of the thoracic and/or lumbar spine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale Sixty-five percent of cancer patients with terminal illness have bone metastases,&#xD;
      with debilitating pain often as the severe consequence. The spine is the most common location&#xD;
      for bone metastases. Standard treatment of unstable vertebral metastases consists of&#xD;
      stabilizing surgery, followed by external beam radiotherapy after two weeks. Although this&#xD;
      approach is effective in 60-70% of patients, it is has several downsides. Firstly, because of&#xD;
      the two weeks interval between surgery and external beam radiotherapy, necessary for&#xD;
      sufficient wound healing, it takes time before radiotherapy-induced pain relief is achieved.&#xD;
      Moreover, the surgical implants used cause scatter artifacts on planning computed tomography&#xD;
      images which prohibits high-resolution imaging and accurate targeting of the lesion. Multiple&#xD;
      hospital visits (ranging from 1 to 10) are needed for administration of external beam&#xD;
      irradiation, and in about 30-40% of patients no adequate pain response is achieved. An&#xD;
      alternative treatment strategy, which would lead to faster pain relief in a higher proportion&#xD;
      of patients with less hospital visits, would be highly desirable from the patient's&#xD;
      perspective. Secondly, this strategy delays the start of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The main outcome of this study is pain response 4 weeks after start of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Prospective cohort study nested within the PRESENT cohort being a phase 2b study&#xD;
      according to the IDEAL recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population All patients, male and female, with impending spinal instability requiring&#xD;
      surgical intervention and radiotherapy at the University Medical Center Utrecht&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The combined treatment of stereotactic body radiotherapy and pedicle screw&#xD;
      fixation in a 24 to 48-hour window for the treatment of painful unstable metastases of the&#xD;
      cervical, thoracic and/or lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints The main outcome of this study is pain response after 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness In the preceding BLEND First-in-man study, the investigators have observed no&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events after a median follow-up of 13 months demonstrating the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of this approach.&#xD;

    <description>In a first step, patients will undergo SBRT with active sparing of the surgical site. Patients will receive high dose, single to few fractions radiotherapy consisting of a boost to the metastases exclusively. The bony compartment containing the metastatic lesion will receive an elective dose in order to treat subclinical disease. Treatment planning is performed on the pre-treatment CT and MRI data in radiotherapy position that are mutually registered to yield information on all relevant structures for planning. Dose constraints are set for the organ at risks based on institution specific guidelines. All patients will be treated with on online position verification protocol based on institution specific guidelines. Hereafter, surgical intervention will be performed to the standard of care.</description>
