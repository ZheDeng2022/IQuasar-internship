  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific advances are constantly leading to better treatments. However, it is quite&#xD;
      challenging for healthcare systems, including VA, to ask very busy providers to change the&#xD;
      way they practice. The MIDAS QUERI program will help providers improve the way they treat VA&#xD;
      patients for three common conditions, using specific strategies to ensure the reliable&#xD;
      delivery of these treatments. The first project will focus on reducing polypharmacy using the&#xD;
      VIONE practice, developed in VA. The second project will focus on better use of drugs called&#xD;
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for patients with a history of severe blood clots or an&#xD;
      abnormal heart rhythm. The third project will focus on providing a highly effective therapy&#xD;
      for patients with insomnia, which does not require the use of medications. The investigators&#xD;
      will test three implementation approaches to improve medication use within these topics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Sustained integration of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is a challenge within&#xD;
      many healthcare systems, especially in settings that have already strived but failed to&#xD;
      achieve longer-term goals. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Maintaining Implementation through&#xD;
      Dynamic Adaptations (MIDAS) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) program was&#xD;
      funded as a series of trials to test three multi-component implementation strategies to&#xD;
      sustain optimal use of three EBPs: 1) a deprescribing tool intended to reduce risk of&#xD;
      polypharmacy; 2) inappropriate use of direct-acting anticoagulant medications (DOACs); and 3)&#xD;
      use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia as first-line treatment instead of&#xD;
      prescribing less effective or risky medications. The investigators describe design and&#xD;
      methods for the harmonized series of cluster-randomized control trials testing three&#xD;
      implementation approaches to sustainably decrease inappropriate use of the three EBPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods For each trial, the investigators will recruit 12 sites (36 total). All will have&#xD;
      access to a clinical dashboard that flags patients at higher risk due to potential&#xD;
      inappropriate use of medications. For each of the three EBPs, sites will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of three implementation approaches to improve use of the EBPs: 1) the Learn. Engage. Act.&#xD;
      Process. (LEAP) team-based quality improvement (QI) learning program; 2) individual-level&#xD;
      educational outreach; or 3) both approaches. Primary outcomes is operationalized across the&#xD;
      three trials as a dichotomous response (yes/no) indicating inappropriate use of the EBP among&#xD;
      at-risk patients at 48 months (12 months pre-intervention plus 36 months post-intervention).&#xD;
      This outcome will be computed using month-by-month administrative data. To compare outcomes&#xD;
      across arms, the investigators will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) with the&#xD;
      harmonized outcome as the dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Scientific advances in ways to deliver higher quality care are constantly&#xD;
      evolving. Especially in light of this, it is quite challenging for healthcare systems, to&#xD;
      sustainably change providers' clinical practices. MIDAS QUERI trials will focus on fostering&#xD;
      sustained use of EBPs that have already had targeted but incomplete implementation. The&#xD;
      implementation approaches are designed to engage frontline clinicians in a dynamic&#xD;
      optimization process that integrates use of actionable clinical dashboard data and&#xD;
      implementation of incremental changes, designed to be feasible within busy clinical settings.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will conduct a combined series of three trials to test two implementation strategies designed for sustained change. Each trial will be a two-arm, cluster-randomized trial and pooled together into a single cross-trial analysis. The two arms will both include use of clinical population health dashboards, a broadly-used strategy to increase uptake of EBPs in VHA. The investigators will target settings where use remains inconsistent. Unit of analysis is clinic. Clinics will be randomized to one of two implementation strategies described below. Implementation strategies will be tested for effectiveness of sustained use of practices to address documented quality gaps related to (1) polypharmacy, (2) use of direct oral anticoagulation medications (DOACs), and (3) cognitive behavioral therapy as first-line treatment for insomnia (CBTI).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Monthly facility percent of inappropriate medication use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 18-months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome unified across the three EBP topics will be monthly facility percent of inappropriate medication use for the 18-month period following baseline. Lower ratios indicate better outcome. Data will be collected monthly at patient level and summarized by collapsing to each facility-month for patients who are at risk of potentially inappropriate medication use. For polypharmacy, the facility-month outcome will be the proportion of patients who possessed three or more medications from the Beers' list without discontinuing any during the month out of patients older than 65, actively following with the clinic, and not in hospice/palliative care. For use of DOACs, the outcome will be the proportion of patients with flags out of those using DOACs. For CBTI, the outcome will be the proportion of patients with an active prescription for a sleep medication who have not had CBTI who actively followed by the clinic and not in hospice/palliative care.</description>

    <description>The National Resource Center for Academic Detailing (NaRCAD) describes AD as &quot;an innovative, one-on-one outreach education technique that helps clinicians provide evidence-based care to their patients. Using an accurate, up-to-date synthesis of the best clinical evidence in an engaging format, academic detailers ignite clinician behavior change, ultimately improving patient health. A successful AD visit is highly interactive, always a dialogue, and assesses a clinician's individual needs, beliefs, attitudes, issues, and concerns in order to promote better.[practice].&quot;</description>

    <description>Learn. Engage. Act. Process (LEAP) program is a structured 6-month core curriculum plus 6 monthly collaborative sessions. The LEAP quality improvement program engages frontline teams in sustained incremental improvements of EBPs over a six-month period, allowing space for busy clinicians to learn and immediately apply fundamental QI skills. LEAP encompasses: 1) a structured, accessible curriculum based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) Model for Improvement and Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles of change; 2) team-based, hands-on learning, and 3) coaching support and a QI network to enhance learning and accountability.</description>
