  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if treatment with Lacrimera速 eye drops (Croma-Pharma GbmH,&#xD;
      Leobendorf, Austria) during and/ or after cataract surgery has a positive effect on the&#xD;
      ocular surface compared to control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to surgery, pre-assessment measurements will be performed in the same fashion as for&#xD;
      non-study patients. Patients will be randomized to one of the 3 groups in a 1:1:1 fashion&#xD;
      using an online randomization tool (www.randomizer.org, list randomizer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is performed in topical anaesthesia. Right after topical anaesthesia, patients&#xD;
      allocated to Group 3 will receive 1 drop of Lacrimera速 in the study eye. Injection of&#xD;
      viscoelastic substance (OVD), capsulorhexis, phacoemulsification, and coaxial irrigation/&#xD;
      aspiration of cortical material are performed as standard procedure. After IOL implantation&#xD;
      the OVD will be removed and at the end of the surgery, stromal hydration will be performed to&#xD;
      the incision as a routine procedure to seal the wound. Right after the wound is sealed,&#xD;
      patients allocated to group 2 and group 3 will receive 1 drop of Lacrimera速 in the study eye.&#xD;
      Postoperative standard medication (Bromfenac gtt., twice a day for 4 weeks) will be&#xD;
      prescribed for all groups.&#xD;

    <description>A new preservative-free formulation of eye drops consists of a novel biopolymer, chitosan-N-acetylcysteine (C-NAC; Lacrimera速, Croma-Pharma GmbH, Leobendorf, Austria), which electrostatically binds to the mucine layer of the tear film forming a glycocalyx-like structure.</description>
