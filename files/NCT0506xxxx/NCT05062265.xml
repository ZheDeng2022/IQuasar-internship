  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the course of a year from the start of the research study, twenty subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized evenly into one of two groups after an informed consent is obtained: a traditional&#xD;
      tight rope fixation group or a tight rope fixation with an anterior inferior tibiofibular&#xD;
      ligament (AITFL) repair augmentation with an internal brace group. Subjects in both groups&#xD;
      will acquire a bilateral WBCT pre-operatively and 6 weeks post-operatively at Atlantic&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Specialists office. A within group statistical analyses will compare the volume&#xD;
      of the syndesmosis acquired by the WBCT at 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>FAOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport(Rec), and foot and ankle-related Quality of Life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questionnaire. Standardized answer options are given (% Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The result can be plotted as an outcome profile.</description>
