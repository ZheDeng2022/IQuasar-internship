      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of omeprazole and famotidine on the risk of&#xD;
      developing chronic renal transplant dysfunction. For the study, it is planned to qualify 36&#xD;
      stabilized adult patients from 1-24 months after kidney transplantation, who will receive&#xD;
      p.o. the standard, most commonly used triple immunosuppression regimen: tacrolimus,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone and depending on the group p.o.: omeprazole 40 mg (group I)&#xD;
      or famotidine 40 mg (group II). The material in the study will be blood, in which tacrolimus&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured at the following time points: 0, 2h, 6h, 12h after drug&#xD;
      administration, without taking omeprazole/famotidine and then the next day after taking the&#xD;
      protective drug in same time points, without 12h. Sequentially routinely in the so-called&#xD;
      point T0 before taking the drug (12 hours after the last dose) during follow-up visits at the&#xD;
      Transplant Outpatient Clinic. Tacrolimus concentrations will be determined using the&#xD;
      Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immuno Assay method. As standard, laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      performed during follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is planned to assess titer of donor-specific antibodies at the time of&#xD;
      qualification and then after 6, 12, 18 months, immunological profile (flow cytometry) at the&#xD;
      time of qualification and then after 6, 12, 18 months, and concentration in serum and urine&#xD;
      of a potential marker of progression and decrease in glomerular filtration - kidney injury&#xD;
      molecule-1 at the time of qualification and then after 9 and 18 months. The obtained results&#xD;
      will be correlated with the histopathological evaluation of the transplanted kidney in the&#xD;
      case of organ biopsy performed on clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative statistical analysis of drug concentration values will be carried out.&#xD;
      Additionally, genetic tests will be performed to assess the patient's metabolic variant for&#xD;
      CYP2C19. Due to the potential influence of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus,&#xD;
      which may influence the process of chronic rejection of the transplanted kidney and drug&#xD;
      toxicity, it seems important to study this hypothesis, as well as researching for therapeutic&#xD;
      substances neutral to the above process. The use of famotidine in place of omeprazole may&#xD;
      turn out more beneficial and safer for renal transplant patients. During follow-up visits at&#xD;
      the Transplant Clinic at the Department and Clinic of Nephrology, Transplantology and&#xD;
      Internal Diseases, changes in blood concentrations of tacrolimus are noticed. Related reasons&#xD;
      are being looked for. The above study will confirm or reject the relationship of changes in&#xD;
      tacrolimus levels with omeprazole. It is planned to present the results at a scientific&#xD;
      conference. The research results will be published in a scientific journal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Scientific aim of the project Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive calcineurin inhibitor&#xD;
           used to prevent rejection in allogeneic organ transplant recipients such as kidney,&#xD;
           liver, heart or lungs. It is metabolized in the liver with the participation of the&#xD;
           cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4 (CYP3A4), it is characterized by a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
           window, dose-dependent toxicity and high inter-individual and intra-individual&#xD;
           variability. Increased serum concentration of tacrolimus may be caused by substrates and&#xD;
           inhibitors of CYP3A4, revealing adverse effects of this drug, especially nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
           Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used as standard in kidney transplant patients to&#xD;
           prevent duodenal and gastric ulcer disease in connection with the use of&#xD;
           glucocorticoids. One of the PPIs is omeprazole, which is a substrate and inhibitor of&#xD;
           the enzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. The enzyme&#xD;
           CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the metabolism of omeprazole, however, upon saturation&#xD;
           or in the event of a mutation in the CYP2C19 gene (a poor metabolizer), CYP3A4 becomes&#xD;
           the major enzyme involved in the elimination of omeprazole and thus may interact with&#xD;
           tacrolimus. Therefore, it seems important to use drugs with a similar prophylactic&#xD;
           effect on the gastrointestinal tract, which, unlike omeprazole, are not substrates or&#xD;
           inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme, such as famotidine - an antagonist of H2 receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the potential influence of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus,&#xD;
           which may influence the process of chronic rejection of the transplanted kidney and drug&#xD;
           toxicity, it seems important to study this hypothesis, as well as researching for&#xD;
           therapeutic substances neutral to the above process. The use of famotidine in place of&#xD;
           omeprazole may turn out more beneficial and safer for renal transplant patients. The aim&#xD;
           of the study is to compare the effect of omeprazole and famotidine on the risk of&#xD;
           developing chronic renal transplant dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Project meaning No study has been found in the available scientific literature to assess&#xD;
           the effect of omeprazole administration on the development of chronic renal transplant&#xD;
           rejection. However, studies have been found to assess the effect of omeprazole on the&#xD;
           change in tacrolimus plasma levels. The search strategy consisted of controlled&#xD;
           vocabulary and keywords. The following databases were searched: Cochrane, Pubmed, Web of&#xD;
           Science, Scopus. The main search concept was to combine &quot;tacrolimus&quot;, &quot;omeprazole&quot; and&#xD;
           &quot;kidney&quot;. 74 studies were found, of which only 7 were related to the topic searched.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In one of the studies, the authors presented a case of a patient and observed a change&#xD;
           in the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood plasma after switching from ranitidine&#xD;
           to omeprazole. Since informed consent could not be obtained from this patient, authors&#xD;
           were unable to access the genetic information. It was not known if the patient had a&#xD;
           mutation in the gene encoding CYP2C19. Other authors observed an over fourfold increase&#xD;
           in the concentration of tacrolimus after the administration of omeprazole. Patient was&#xD;
           homozygous mutated (*2/*2) for CYP2C19, carrying an aberrant splicing site that reduces&#xD;
           significantly or inactivates the encoded protein's activity of CYP2C19, classified as&#xD;
           CYP2C19 poor metabolizer. The CYP2C19 gene, which includes nine exons and eight introns,&#xD;
           is located at the 10q24.1-10q24.3 locus of chromosome 10, where coding sequences is&#xD;
           1,473 bp and resulting in a protein of 490 amino acid residues. Approximately 25 genetic&#xD;
           variants in the exonic region of the CYP2C19 have been identified. CYP2C19 is involved&#xD;
           in metabolizing several important therapeutic drugs, including omeprazole. Common&#xD;
           variants of the CYP2C19 gene are associated with impaired drug metabolism. CYP2C19*2 and&#xD;
           CYP2C19*3 were identified in individuals who exhibited a reduced capability for&#xD;
           metabolizing the probe drugs, and variant CYP2C19*17 is associated with ultra-rapid&#xD;
           metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates. The principal detrimental allele, CYP2C19*2, results&#xD;
           from a guanine (G) to adenine (A) transition at position 681 in exon 5 (rs4244285),&#xD;
           producing an aberrant splice site and it represents the most frequent CYP2C19 defect in&#xD;
           all populations. CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 are the most common alleles, encoding enzymes&#xD;
           with decreased activity. CYP2C19*3 (636G&gt;A) is considered the most important allele, in&#xD;
           which a point mutation in exon 4 results in a premature stop codon, and therefore&#xD;
           nonfunctional protein. The prevalence of the CYP2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype is&#xD;
           2-5% among Caucasians and Africans, and ~15% in Asians, while CYP2C19*3 is considered to&#xD;
           be an Asian mutation. CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles have been proposed to explain &lt;50%, to&#xD;
           &gt;90%, of the PM phenotype. The enzyme CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the metabolism&#xD;
           of omeprazole, however, in the event of a mutation in the CYP2C19 gene (poor&#xD;
           metaboliser), CYP3A4 becomes the major enzyme involved in the elimination of omeprazole.&#xD;
           Tacrolimus is also metabolised by CYP3A4, so in the above situation there is a&#xD;
           competitive competition for the CYP3A4 enzyme, as a result, the metabolism of tacrolimus&#xD;
           may be insufficient, and this may result in an increase in plasma tacrolimus&#xD;
           concentrations, which may be a factor in the process of chronic renal rejection. In one&#xD;
           of the studies, the authors demonstrated during study of 75 patients that recipients&#xD;
           with CYP2C19*2/*2 genotype showed allograft delayed function (acute tubular necrosis in&#xD;
           3 patients) during treating with tacrolimus and omeprazole. It should be noted that&#xD;
           other authors in clinical-analytical study (n = 51) conclused that an omeprazole-&#xD;
           tacrolimus interaction is not clinically relevant. Despite possible competition or&#xD;
           interaction at the molecular level, clinical management was not significantly affected&#xD;
           in renal allograft recipients. However, the study lasted 6 months. The duration of the&#xD;
           study was too short to provide an answer regarding the effect of tacrolimus on chronic&#xD;
           renal rejection. In one of the works, the authors suggest in their study (n=27) that&#xD;
           omeprazole may increase the serum tacrolimus concentration if ingested 2 hr before&#xD;
           tacrolimus ingestion, likely through alkalization of the intestinal contents. Famotidine&#xD;
           does not interact with the cytochrome P450-linked drug metabolizing enzyme system,&#xD;
           therefore it is a good candidate for use in place of omeprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is known that there may be an interaction between omeprazole and tacrolimus. There&#xD;
           have been several cases of such an interaction in history. It is not known whether the&#xD;
           use of omeprazole has an impact on the chronic rejection of a transplanted kidney. The&#xD;
           scheduled study is a new issue. Conducting the above study will allow to assess whether&#xD;
           the use of omeprazole has an impact on the process of chronic rejection of the&#xD;
           transplanted kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the timing of kidney rejection, there are three phases: hyperacute, acute and&#xD;
           chronic phase. Hyperacute rejection occurs immediately after transplantation and is&#xD;
           associated with the presence in the blood of the recipient of antibodies that react with&#xD;
           antigens on the organ donor endothelial cells. They are mainly antibodies against HLA&#xD;
           antigens and against AB0 blood group antigens. Acute rejection occurs within a few days&#xD;
           to several months after transplantation. It can be cellular, humoral or mixed. Cellular&#xD;
           response mechanisms (cellular rejection) dominate the pathogenesis of acute rejection.&#xD;
           Chronic rejection occurs one year after transplantation. Due to the type of reaction, it&#xD;
           may be cellular, humoral or mixed with a predominance of cellular or antibody-dependent&#xD;
           mechanisms. To the current knowledge, donor-specific antibodies are mainly responsible&#xD;
           for late graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
           With the introduction of tissue typing tests, antibody-mediated hyperacute rejection of&#xD;
           the kidney is rarely observed. With the immunosuppression currently available, acute&#xD;
           T-cell mediated rejection has become a rare event. In contrast, chronic&#xD;
           antibody-mediated rejection is considered to be a major contributor to graft loss in the&#xD;
           late posttransplant phase. Today there is still noeffective strategy to treat this&#xD;
           indolent and slowly progressing form of antibody-mediated rejection. Therefore, the aim&#xD;
           of our study focuses on the chronic rejection of a transplanted kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the available scientific literature (Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane) no&#xD;
           study was found to assess the effect of omeprazole and famotidine in the development of&#xD;
           chronic renal transplant dysfunction. During follow-up visits at the Transplant Clinic&#xD;
           at the Department and Clinic of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Diseases,&#xD;
           changes in blood concentrations of tacrolimus are noticed. Related reasons are being&#xD;
           looked for. The above study will confirm or reject the relationship of changes in&#xD;
           tacrolimus levels with omeprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is anticipated that the co-administration of omeprazole and tacrolimus will be more&#xD;
           difficult to keep tacrolimus levels within the therapeutic range than in the combination&#xD;
           of famotidine with tacrolimus. As a result, drug interaction may be one of the risk&#xD;
           factors for the development of chronic renal transplant dysfunction, and the use of&#xD;
           famotidine instead of omeprazole may prove to be more beneficial and safer for renal&#xD;
           transplant patients. The study may change the current immunosuppression regimen that is&#xD;
           used around the world. It is planned to present the results at a scientific conference.&#xD;
           The research results will be published in a scientific journal. The research will be the&#xD;
           basis for publications, and these, as a series of publications, will form the basis of&#xD;
           the doctoral dissertation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alternative hypothesis In a situation where I did not achieve statistical significance&#xD;
           between the groups, I planned to test the genotype of patients who would show the&#xD;
           greatest deviations in the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood plasma in the group&#xD;
           receiving omeprazole. This will confirm the relationship of the mutations in the CYP2C19&#xD;
           gene with changes in tacrolimus concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Access to research equipment The Clinical Hospital of Heliodor Święcicki has laboratory&#xD;
           diagnostics and the method of tacrolimus determination used in the project. The kidney&#xD;
           injury molecule - 1 marker will also be tested at the hospital. The Chair and Department&#xD;
           of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Diseases collaborates with the immunology&#xD;
           laboratory (Chair of Clinical Immunology of Poznan University of Medical Sciences) where&#xD;
           the immune profile tests will be performed. Genetic tests will be performed by an&#xD;
           external company (outsourcing). The titre of donor specific antibodies will be performed&#xD;
           at the HLA Tissue Compatibility Laboratory with the Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics&#xD;
           (Regional Center for Blood Donation and Haemotherapy in Poznań).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research methodology For the study, it is planned to qualify stabilized adult patients&#xD;
           from 1-24 months after kidney transplantation. The group size was estimated at 36,&#xD;
           taking into account the size of the kidney transplant population (550,000), estimates&#xD;
           that the studied trait was found in 10% of the population, the confidence level was set&#xD;
           at 95%, and the maximum error at 10%. On the day of enrollment in the study, the&#xD;
           following data will be collected: age, sex, weight, height, BMI, living donor / dead&#xD;
           donor, cold ischemia time, delayed graft function (hemodialysis), acute rejection&#xD;
           process, comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension), CMV. Tacrolimus concentrations will be&#xD;
           determined using the Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immuno Assay method (CMIA) -&#xD;
           instrument Alininity i. As standard, laboratory tests (creatinine, eGFR, urinalysis,&#xD;
           urinalysis, hemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils, proteinuria, CRP) will be performed&#xD;
           during follow-up visits. In addition, it is planned to assess titer of donor-specific&#xD;
           antibodies (solid-phase assay as HLA antigen-coated bead method [Luminex] - instrument&#xD;
           Luminex) at the time of qualification and then after 6, 12, 18 months, immunological&#xD;
           profile (flow cytometry method - instrument Facscalibur) at the time of qualification&#xD;
           and then after 6, 12, 18 months, and concentration in serum and urine of a potential&#xD;
           marker of progression and decrease in glomerular filtration - kidney injury molecule-1&#xD;
           at the time of qualification and then after 9 and 18 months (colorimetric method -&#xD;
           instrument Colorimeter). The obtained results will be correlated with the&#xD;
           histopathological evaluation of the transplanted kidney in the case of organ biopsy&#xD;
           performed on clinical indications. In the final stage, a comparative statistical&#xD;
           analysis of drug concentration values and other statistical tests will be carried out.&#xD;
           The student's T-test will check if there is a normal distribution. The Fisher- Snedecor&#xD;
           test will assess whether the variances in populations are equal or different. Then the&#xD;
           Student T-test for independent groups or the Student T-test with Cochran-Cox correction&#xD;
           will be applied. Additionally, genetic tests will be performed to assess the patient's&#xD;
           metabolic variant for CYP2C19. For cost reasons, these studies will be performed only&#xD;
           for patients who will show significant changes in tacrolimus concentrations.&#xD;
