  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota and low grade inflammation&#xD;
      are important pathogenic determinants of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which has increased in&#xD;
      epidemic size over the last 20 years. Probiotics have been used in T2DM for the modification&#xD;
      of IM and anti-inflammatory effects. However, effect of probiotics on metabolic control in&#xD;
      T2DM are inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present study will be designed to determine the effects of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) on glycemic&#xD;
      control, lipid profile, inflammation parameters and expression of certain genes linked to&#xD;
      T2DM. This study will be conducted at the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, a tertiary care&#xD;
      diabetes outpatient clinic and should involve 34 T2DM subjects. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assign to receive either LGG probiotic drop or a placebo.In this placebo controlled trial,&#xD;
      effect of single strain probiotic vs. placebo on metabolic control and certain genes linked&#xD;
      to T2DM will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based data showed that intestinal microbiota (IM) plays a role in the development of&#xD;
      metabolic diseases. Recent studies have reported that dysbiosis of IM and low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation is effective in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which has&#xD;
      increased in epidemic size over the last 20 years. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and&#xD;
      Proteobacteria's ratios in obese and T2DM patients were found to be different than healthy&#xD;
      subjects. In these cases, there is an association between increasing the proportion of&#xD;
      gram-negative bacteria in the intestines and subclinical inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that are intended to have health benefits by regulating&#xD;
      mucosal and systemic immunity, when consumed as a nutritional supplement. There are studies&#xD;
      investigating the effects of probiotic use on insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, lipid&#xD;
      profile and inflammatory parameters in patients with T2DM. However, several probiotic strains&#xD;
      were used frequently in these studies, or probiotics and prebiotics were given as cocktails.&#xD;
      Their effects might be together or even synergistic. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (or&#xD;
      Lactobacillus GG: LGG) is a widely used probiotic microorganism. Studies have shown that LGG&#xD;
      prevents diarrhea and atopic dermatitis, provides antitumor activity, improves the immune&#xD;
      system, and lowers serum cholesterol levels. However, there is a limited data about the&#xD;
      effects of LGG on the glycemic control of diabetic animal models but human studies are&#xD;
      scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, present study is designed to determine the effects of LGG on glycemic control,&#xD;
      lipid profile, inflammation parameters, and expression of certain genes linked to T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assign to receive probiotic &quot;Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG (ATCC&#xD;
      53103)&quot; or placebo for 8-weeks administered as a drop formulation. Patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group receive 10 probiotic drops (1x1010 cfu LGG) once daily with breakfast.&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted via telephone every week for an assessment of adverse events and&#xD;
      probiotic/placebo compliance. Fasting blood samples will be taken at baseline and post&#xD;
      treatment to measure carbohydrate metabolism (glucose, insulin, fructosamine and HbA1c),&#xD;
      lipid profile (triglycerides; total, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol) and biomarkers of inflammation&#xD;
      (hs-CRP and IL-6). TLR2, TLR4, MUC2 and MUC3A genes expressions will be investigated on stool&#xD;
      samples at baseline and post treatment. Stool samples will be stored at -80°C until RNA&#xD;
      isolation.The gene expression levels will be determined by Quantitative Real Time PCR method&#xD;
      using the determined cDNA samples. Dietary intake will be evaluated by the 3-day food record.&#xD;
      During the 4th and 8th week of the study, a 3 day food consumption records will be taken.&#xD;
      Diabetics will be given detailed oral and written instructions regarding the completion of&#xD;
      food record, consisting of 2 midweek days and 1 weekend day. In order to determine the&#xD;
      amounts of consumed foods correctly, information will be given about measuring cups such as&#xD;
      water glass, tea glass, teaspoon, tablespoon, serving spoon, bowl. Dietary intake will be&#xD;
      assessed using a food composition database of BEBIS programme including specific Turkish&#xD;
      foods. All anthropometric measures will be conducted in a fasting state taken at baseline and&#xD;
      following an 8-week intervention by experienced examiner (dietitian). Body weight and body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis device (Tanita BC-420 MA).&#xD;
      Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist&#xD;
      circumference (measured midway between lowest rib and iliac crest) will be measured using a&#xD;
      non-stretchable measuring tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 21.0&#xD;
      package program and significance will defined as p&lt;0.05. Descriptive statistics will be given&#xD;
      as mean, standard deviation and median (minimum to maximum) for continuous measures.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be expressed as case numbers and percentage values. The&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk tests will used to determine whether the distribution of continuous measures are&#xD;
      normal. Student's t test and Mann-Whitney-U test will used for the two groups comparisons&#xD;
      according to whether the variables showed normal distribution. Comparisons of changes in&#xD;
      groups within themselves (before and after probiotic or placebo administration) will made&#xD;
      using the t-test if the variances is normal, and if the Wilcoxon test is not normal in the&#xD;
      cohort. The web-based RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis program will used to determine the&#xD;
      change of ΔCt values obtained from the Real Time-PCR gene expression study (before and after&#xD;
      probiotic and placebo administration). p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
