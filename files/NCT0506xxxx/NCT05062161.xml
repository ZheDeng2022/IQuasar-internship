  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact that sleep duration has on blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) levels during sleep. The investigator will examine the effect of an 8-week sleep&#xD;
      hygiene/extension intervention vs. control on sleep BP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Short sleep duration (SSD), defined as sleeping less than 7 hours per night, affects over 33%&#xD;
      of US adults and is associated with increased mortality. SSD is a modifiable risk factor for&#xD;
      obesity, type 2 diabetes, and HTN. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that SSD is&#xD;
      associated with higher sleep BP levels. SSD is also associated with non-dipping BP which is&#xD;
      primarily explained by higher sleep BP levels. However, many of the cross-sectional studies&#xD;
      have included adolescent participants or have not used reference standard measures of sleep&#xD;
      duration such as wrist actigraphy. Manipulating sleep duration experimentally through sleep&#xD;
      restriction or deprivation is associated with higher 24-hour and sleep BP levels. In&#xD;
      contrast, there is scarce data on the effect of sleep extension on sleep BP levels among&#xD;
      adults with SSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible community individuals with short sleep duration will be randomized to sleep&#xD;
      extension vs. control using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and&#xD;
      actigraphy in the naturalistic environment. Individuals will be assessed throughout the study&#xD;
      using questionnaires, activity monitoring via a Fitbit device (for 8 weeks), blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring using a 24-hour ABPM device, and heart rate variability monitoring for 24-hours.&#xD;
