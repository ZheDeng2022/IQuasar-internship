      This study intends to explore the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of AI based CDSS system and&#xD;
      promotion of clinical work by comparing CDSS before and after the online. The difference of&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy before and after AI-CDSS application will be compared by the before and&#xD;
      after design, and the role of AI-CDSS will be explored.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy Rate of Recommended Diagnosis by CDSS, up to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>When the subject was discharged from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the patient's discharge diagnosis as a standard, it is explored whether the diagnosis given by the CDSS is consistent with the discharge diagnosis in the patient's medical record.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' hospitalization time (days), up to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>When the subject was discharged from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The length of a patient's stay is the number of days he or she experiences from the time of admission to the time of discharge.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>consistency between admission diagnosis and discharge diagnosis up to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>When the subject was discharged from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>When the patient comes to the hospital, the clinician will write an inpatient record and give a preliminary diagnosis, which we call admission diagnosis.After the patient is hospitalized, all kinds of examinations will be improved. After all the examination results come out, the patient's diagnosis on admission may be modified. Because there are no auxiliary examination results on admission, the diagnosis on admission may not be completely correct.This modified diagnosis is called discharge diagnosis.This study compared the consistent rate of admission diagnosis and discharge diagnosis before and after CDSS on-line.</description>

    <measure>length of confirmed time, up to 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>When the subject was discharged from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>he length of confirmed time (days) was the duration between the preliminary admission diagnosis and the definite diagnosis.</description>
