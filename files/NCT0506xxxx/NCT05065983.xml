      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the induction of anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibody responses following a single&#xD;
           adjuvanted dose of PXVX0317 (40 µg CHIKV VLP, alum-adjuvanted) as measured 21 days (Day&#xD;
           22) after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the induction of anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibody responses following a single&#xD;
           adjuvanted dose of PXVX0317 as measured 7 days (Day 8), 14 days (Day 15), and 56 days&#xD;
           (Day 57) after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess safety of a single adjuvanted dose of PXVX0317 in healthy adults.&#xD;
