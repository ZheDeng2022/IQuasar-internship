  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide information on whether the drug MDMA, combined with&#xD;
      Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), is safe and helpful for people with Post Traumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's&#xD;
      daily life, and can result in diminished functioning, fractured relationships, inability to&#xD;
      maintain employment, substance abuse, depression, and suicide risk. People who suffer from&#xD;
      PTSD relive their traumatic experience(s) through nightmares and flashbacks, have difficulty&#xD;
      sleeping, and feel detached or estranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPT is a manualized treatment for PTSD, which has the participant make meaning of the&#xD;
      traumatic event and its impact on their life. CPT is one of the treatments with the best&#xD;
      evidence for the treatment of PTSD to date. Clients with PTSD discuss how they believe the&#xD;
      trauma has impacted them, and the therapist teaches the client skills to challenge areas&#xD;
      where they are &quot;stuck&quot; remembering the traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDMA is a drug commonly used recreationally that has been increasingly studied because of its&#xD;
      ability to reduce the impact of PTSD symptoms. The effects of MDMA are reduced fear, enhanced&#xD;
      communication, trust and introspection, and increased empathy and compassion. The effects of&#xD;
      MDMA create a state that enhances the positive effects of therapy by increasing the ability&#xD;
      to tolerate negative emotions and allowing clients to stay engaged in therapy without being&#xD;
      overwhelmed by the intense emotions surrounding the memories of traumatic events. It is&#xD;
      believed that MDMA may help promote the effects of CPT. Given the properties of MDMA,&#xD;
      specifically in inducing the ability to stay with emotion and challenging cognitions, these&#xD;
      effects are especially relevant to the mechanisms of CPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study exploring CPT integrated with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment&#xD;
      of PTSD. This study will enroll 10 participants diagnosed with PTSD, who will undergo a&#xD;
      2-month course of psychotherapy that includes CPT integrated with MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Participants will go through CPT sessions, and two doses of MDMA will be used&#xD;
      as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Since this is the first time that CPT is being combined with&#xD;
      individual MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, the researchers are interested in gathering&#xD;
      preliminary information about the blending of these two therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5. It contains symptom subscales, a total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <description>PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a self-report questionnaire in which respondents indicate the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms, derived from the DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Participants indicate how much distress they have experienced due to symptoms on a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely). The total PCL-5 score (a sum of all 20 items) provides an index of overall PTSD symptom severity with higher scores indicating higher severity.</description>
