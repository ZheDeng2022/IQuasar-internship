    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of anterior&#xD;
      cervical spine surgery using the NuVasive anterior cervical plate (ACP) System as measured by&#xD;
      reported complications, radiographic outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the NuVasive ACP System in patients who undergo anterior cervical spine&#xD;
      surgery. Consecutive patients at a given site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked&#xD;
      to consent to participate in the study. These patients will present with pathologic&#xD;
      conditions in the cervical spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will be screened&#xD;
      prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo anterior&#xD;
      cervical spine surgery using the NuVasive ACP System based on the surgeon's standard of care.&#xD;
      At least 75 subjects will be enrolled and will be followed for 24 months after the surgery.&#xD;

        The Enrolled Population will include all subjects who meet the criteria for enrollment,&#xD;
        specifically, those subjects who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed the informed consent, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent the surgical procedure, as defined in this protocol. Subjects not meeting&#xD;
             any of these criteria will not be considered enrolled in the study, and therefore not&#xD;
             included in any study population or analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Evaluable Populations will include all subjects who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Were included in the Enrolled Populations,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed the study, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had no major protocol deviations. If there are no major protocol deviations and all&#xD;
             subjects complete the study, then an Evaluable Population will not be used.&#xD;
