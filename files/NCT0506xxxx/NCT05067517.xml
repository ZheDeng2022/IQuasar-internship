  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess efficacy (as measured by annual rate of decline in FVC) and safety. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that nintedanib will be safe and effective therapy for patients with progressive fibrosing&#xD;
      CMD-ILD over a period of 52 weeks. Test Article - Nintedanib 150 mg administered PO twice&#xD;
      daily or matching placebo. A total of 160 patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either oral nintedanib 150 mg (n=80) or matching placebo&#xD;
      (n=80) twice daily. A randomization scheme will be used that balances the group for potential&#xD;
      confounders (proportion with PMF or small opacity-only PF-CMD_ILD and proportion of ever- or&#xD;
      never-smokers). The dose of the study drug may be reduced to 100 mg twice daily or&#xD;
      interrupted temporarily to manage adverse events (AEs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with progressive fibrosing&#xD;
      CMD-ILD over 52 weeks. The study will be led by and based at the West Virginia University&#xD;
      School of Medicine and the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute&#xD;
      (WVCTSI) and will recruit participants regionally, including from its associated&#xD;
      Practice-Based Network of 24 healthcare systems and 94 individual clinics. Recruitment will&#xD;
      also be sought in collaboration with Dr. Cohen from federally-funded Black Lung Clinics&#xD;
      across the region and from partner CTSAs at the University of Kentucky and University of&#xD;
      Virginia. It is planned to randomize a total of 160 patients in a 1:1 ratio to either oral&#xD;
      nintedanib 150 mg (n=80) or matching placebo (n=80) twice daily. The dose of the study drug&#xD;
      may be reduced to 100 mg twice daily with subsequent increase back to full dose or&#xD;
      interrupted temporarily to manage adverse events (AEs). For each patient, the study will&#xD;
      consist of two parts: part A and part B. The duration of part A, a randomized prospective&#xD;
      controlled double-blinded trial, will be 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the week 52 visit, patients will continue to have study visits every&#xD;
      16 weeks (Part B) until the last patient completes 52 weeks. In part B, patients will remain&#xD;
      on blinded therapy with continued data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part A, patients will attend screening study visits (-4 to -2 weeks) and then at 0, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks. In addition, telehealth visits will be conducted at visits 2, 18,&#xD;
      30, 44, and 51 weeks via phone by the study coordinator. Part B visits will take place at 16&#xD;
      week intervals until study completion (last patient completes 52 weeks). To reduce the amount&#xD;
      of missing data, patients who discontinue the trial drug (for any reason) prior to completing&#xD;
      the 52-week treatment period will be asked to attend all visits and undergo all examinations&#xD;
      as originally planned. In addition, for patients who prematurely discontinue trial medication&#xD;
      and are unable to complete the scheduled visits, every attempt will be made to collect&#xD;
      information on vital status at week 52 and at the time of data cut-off for the primary data&#xD;
      analysis and at the conclusion of part B. It is estimated that patient recruitment will take&#xD;
      up to 24 mos.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Living with Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF) questionnaire is a 44 item questionnaire with two modules Symptoms (23 items) and Impacts (21 items) where the symptoms module yields three domain scores dyspnea, cough and fatigue as well as a total symptoms score (impacts module yields a single impacts score). L-PF Symptoms cough domain score (cough score) ranges from 0-100, the higher the score the greater the impairment. If missing items were ≥50 % within a score, then the corresponding score was set to missing. Absolute change from baseline in cough score at week 52 is based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measures, with fixed effects for baseline cough score, HRCT fibrotic pattern, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline cough score-by-visit interaction and random effect for participant, visit as repeated measure. The Adjusted mean is based on all analyzed participants in the model.</description>
