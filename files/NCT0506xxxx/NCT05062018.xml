  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DO-HEALTH trial will be extended into the cohort including the collection on life style&#xD;
      factors such as diet, quality of life and physical activity, as well as health-related data&#xD;
      on co-morbid conditions as well as a standardized assessment of multiple organ functions,&#xD;
      physical, cognitive and mental function using surveys and standardized health assessments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DO-HEALTH cohort will be a continuation of the trial without intervention and will&#xD;
      elucidate longterm determinants of healthy, active and independent aging in European&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults. The main emphasize of the cohort will be to determine the&#xD;
      risk factors, to quantify the incidence and to describe the trajectories of incident frailty,&#xD;
      impaired mobility, loss of independence and age related morbidity (e.g. heart arrhythmia,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, falls, fractures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the cohort will continue to investigate the primary endpoints of the original&#xD;
      trial like the risk and incidence of injurious falls (bone); functional decline (muscle);&#xD;
      high blood pressure (cardiovascular); cognitive decline (brain); and the rate of any&#xD;
      infection (immunity). Moreover, the cohort will include and extend key secondary and&#xD;
      exploratory endpoints of the original trial such as incidence and prevalence of anemia,&#xD;
      sarcopenia, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer.&#xD;
