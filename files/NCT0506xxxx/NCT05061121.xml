      The aim of investigator's study is to combine and compare the two scientifically approved&#xD;
      therapies for the CNSNP to investigate the short term and mid-term changes of the combination&#xD;
      of these two manual techniques concerning pain, function, range of motion ROM and postural&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain NP is a recognized medical and socioeconomic problem, which is responsible for high&#xD;
      treatment costs, sick leave, and individual suffering, in addition to being one of the main&#xD;
      reasons for people to seek health care services .NP is widely spread in healthcare centers&#xD;
      with a prevalence estimation of 288.7 million, in North Africa and the Middle East ranged&#xD;
      between 3917.7 to 5022.4 per 100 000 populations in 2017. NP with symptoms duration exceeding&#xD;
      12 weeks is considered chronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who have chronic non-specific neck pain CNSNP have less quality of life, and more&#xD;
      pain interference in their life. More over studies showed that patients with CNSNP subjects&#xD;
      have poorer postural control than healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alteration of the proprioception of the neck muscles and joints that play a master role in&#xD;
      the cervical joint position and motor control of the head could be the primary cause of CNSNP&#xD;
      . Studies have evaluated the effect of different manual techniques in cases of CNSNP checking&#xD;
      mainly usefulness and effectiveness of these interventions on this clinical condition.&#xD;
      However, there is less evidence in literature investigating the short and mid-term changes of&#xD;
      these techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual therapy, is a physical treatment primarily used by physical therapists, occupational&#xD;
      therapists, manipulative therapy to treat musculoskeletal pain and disability; it is most&#xD;
      commonly includes kneading , manipulation of the muscles and mobilization of joints .Many&#xD;
      Studies investigating the effectiveness of manual therapies on CNSNP ,proving reduction of&#xD;
      spinal excitability and pain sensitivity, enhancement of function and range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brian Mulligan techniques are widely used for joint dysfunction by growing number of&#xD;
      therapists and are an important addition to the field of Manual Therapy. Literature reveals&#xD;
      many and diverse treatment approaches for chronic neck pain. Sustained natural apophyseal&#xD;
      glides SNAGs are pain free spinal manual therapy treatment techniques involving concurrent&#xD;
      accessory joint gliding and active physiological movement, with overpressure at end range,&#xD;
      which are utilized for painful movement restrictions of the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mulligan's SNAGs is one of the most statistically proved in many studies that manual therapy&#xD;
      technique affects proprioception, function, range of motion, pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, Myofascial release which is a form of soft tissue therapy that is intended&#xD;
      to reduce pain and increase mobility in patients that are suffering from chronic pain&#xD;
      conditions. Myofascial release has shown effectiveness in reducing mechanical neck pain and&#xD;
      in improving functional abilities by freeing restrictions of movement that originate in the&#xD;
      soft tissues of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, as the focus of most previous studies has been to examine compare mulligan's&#xD;
      SNAGs and Myofascial release separately, studies on their combination effects have been&#xD;
      largely ignored. Both two techniques have shown efficacy, but since SNAGS and Myofascial&#xD;
      release are different mechanisms of action, the time of their effects and their progression&#xD;
      could be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of investigators' study is to combine and compare the two scientifically approved&#xD;
      therapies for the CNSNP to investigate the short term and mid-term changes of the combination&#xD;
      of these two manual techniques concerning pain, function, range of motion ROM and postural&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;

    <description>visual analogue scale ,The pain VAS is a continuous scale formed of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, 100 mm in length, ended with 2 verbal pain descriptor on either end one for each symptom extreme; &quot;no pain&quot; at the most left side of the line (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 /100-mm scale) on the rightest end</description>

    <description>Neck Disability Index (NDI) This index consists of ten sections, including seven sections related to activities of daily living, two sections related to pain, and one section related to concentration. The score for each section is from 0 to 5, with 0 representing the highest level of function and 5 representing the lowest level of function. Total NDI-TH scores are shown as a percentage. A high score corresponds to a higher degree of disability. The internal consistency of the NDI-TH is high.</description>

    <description>Cervical range of motion device (CROM) The CROM device is a reliable outcome tool for measuring upper cervical rotation. The clinical implications of these findings suggest that therapists can utilize the CROM device to more completely examine all planes of upper and full cervical mobility. It may also assist in identifying upper cervical ROM limitations associated with underlying cervical pathology or motion dysfunction</description>
