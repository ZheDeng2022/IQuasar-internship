      Squash was originated in England in the early 19th, when a group of schoolchildren noticed&#xD;
      that punctured balls could be &quot;squashed&quot; against walls in a wider range of shots and it&#xD;
      requires more effort from the player. This variation gained popularity, and the first squash&#xD;
      courts were made in 1864; and the sport of squash was formally formed. Squash is a racquet&#xD;
      sport in which two players compete with a hollow rubber ball on a court surrounded on four&#xD;
      sides by walls. The players alternate hitting the ball using racquets. The ball can bounce&#xD;
      once on the ground and as many times as the court walls allow. Squash players' main approach&#xD;
      is to compel their opponents to go around the entire playing field. If this tactics is&#xD;
      successful, the challenger travels a greater distance and puts a higher load on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of pilates exercises on service&#xD;
      speed and agility in squash players.&#xD;

    <description>Bushnell Speed Radar will be used. It uses digital technology to provide instantaneous speed measurement to +/_ .one mile per hour (MPH)/+/_.two kilometer per hour (KPH) accuracy.The Bushnell Speed Radar is a simple, point and shoot radar gun for all kinds of sports enthusiasts. The Bushnell Speed Radar measures the speed of a baseball at 10-110 MPH(16-177 KPH) from 90 feet (27 meter) away from the ball, and the speed of a racecar from 10-200 MPH (16-322 KPH) at 1,500 feet (457 meter) away. There will be two assessments, at baseline before the start of exercise program and at the end of six weeks intervention.</description>

    <measure>Badcamp Agility Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Badcamp Agility test was performed with players standing at the middle of the badminton court. Six targets were placed at six ends of the court. The players were give warning signal and the examiner started marking the corners which players have to follow. The players have to touch all 6 markers as marked by the examiner in an undecided manner. Each participant performed the test 3 times, and the shortest time was considered for analysis. At least 1 minute of rest was given between trials. There will be two assessments, at baseline before the start of exercise program and at the end of six weeks intervention.</description>
