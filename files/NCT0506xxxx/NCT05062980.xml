  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized study is to determine the safety and efficacy of GPX-001 a.k.a&#xD;
      REQORSA ( a TUSC2, tumor suppressor gene, encapsulated by non-viral lipid nanoparticles) in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 phases, a Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1) and an Expansion&#xD;
      Phase (Phase 2). In Phase 1, patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts treated with&#xD;
      successively higher doses of GXP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, patients will be randomized to receive GXP-001 with pembrolizumab or docetaxel&#xD;
      +/- ramucirumab (active comparator).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ONC-004 is a multi-center, open-label 2-arm study of GPX-001 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab versus docetaxel +/- ramucirumab (active comparator) in previously treated&#xD;
      NSCLC with any PD-L1 TPS and NOT considered refractory to pembrolizumab, as defined by having&#xD;
      achieved at least a 3-month clinical benefit to previous pembrolizumab-containing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of study for each patient will be dependent upon the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and efficacy of the combination regimen of GPX-001 and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will involve a 3+3 dose escalation schema of GPX-001 up to&#xD;
      0.12 mg/kg in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg) administered once via&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion during each 21-day treatment cycle. Three GPX-001 doses will be&#xD;
      tested (0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 mg/kg administered on Day 1 of a 21-day treatment cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 portion of the study is a randomized, open-label 2-arm study of GPX-001 in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab versus docetaxel ± ramucirumab. In Phase 2, 126 patients will&#xD;
      be randomized 2:1 to the combination versus active comparator treatment arms, respectively.&#xD;
      The 84 patients randomized to the combination arm will receive GPX-001, at the RP2D&#xD;
      identified in Phase 1, in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab either during each 21-day&#xD;
      cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
      The 42 patients randomized to the active comparator arm will receive docetaxel at the&#xD;
      FDA-approved dose of 75 mg/m2 every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity as determined by the investigator. Investigators are permitted to administer&#xD;
      docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab at their discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed radiologically for tumor response until disease progression&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1 criteria approximately every 6-8 weeks.&#xD;
