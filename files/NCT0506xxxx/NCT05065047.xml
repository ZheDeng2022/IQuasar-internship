      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if belantamab mafodotin (Blenrep) can&#xD;
      help to prevent multiple myeloma (MM) from coming back after patients have had an autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplant (AutoSCT). The safety of this drug after transplant will also be studied&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability of belantamab maintenance therapy after auto-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the complete remission rate (CRR) as defined by the International Myeloma&#xD;
           Working Group (IMWG) criteria (Appendix A.) within 9 months post salvage autotransplant&#xD;
           with single agent belantamab mafodotin maintenance therapy starting approximately 3&#xD;
           months post salvage auto-transplant in patients with relapsed myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (from the data of&#xD;
           initiation of maintenance therapy assessed up to 2 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To discover the impact of belantamab mafodotin on graft function and immune&#xD;
           reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess minimal residual disease status (FDA approved ClonoSeq NGS assay - MRD&#xD;
           measured down to 1 in 1 million cells, &lt;106 ) after at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
           after initiation of maintenance therapy&#xD;

                  screening evaluation Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
                  post-tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Male participants: contraceptive use should be consistent with institutional&#xD;
             guidelines regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical&#xD;

             the intervention period and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment to&#xD;
             allow for clearance of any altered sperm: Refrain from donating sperm&#xD;
&#xD;
             PLUS either:&#xD;
&#xD;

             failure rate of &lt;1% per year as to when having sexual intercourse with a woman of&#xD;
             childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Any serious unstable pre-existing medical condition or psychiatric disorder that can&#xD;
             interfere with safety or with obtaining informed consent or compliance with study&#xD;
