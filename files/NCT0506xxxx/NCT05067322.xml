      Children with ADHD play a videogame to test symptom control&#xD;

      Minecraft is an online video game containing a &quot;virtual land where users can create their own&#xD;
      worlds and experiences, using building blocks, resources discovered on the site and their own&#xD;
      creativity&quot; that requires its users to apply problem solving, planning, and organizational&#xD;
      skills for creative building and exploration.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is being studied as an adjunctive treatment in combination with stimulant medications in&#xD;
      children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to improve executive function&#xD;
      and ADHD symptoms, as well as to allow for the use of lower doses of stimulant drugs.&#xD;
      Although there is little research on the effect of Minecraft in humans, there is considerable&#xD;
      research on the effects of other video games. Like pharmaceuticals, the effect seen seems to&#xD;
      be often related to the amount and style of video games to which humans are exposed.&#xD;
      First-person shooter games with violence have been associated with anxiety and fear&#xD;
      (Strasburger et al. 2010). The negative outcomes of video play include obesity,&#xD;
      aggressiveness, antisocial behavior, and addiction (Strasburger et al 2010).2 Video and&#xD;
      computer games come in many different genres, some violent, some nonviolent, some with lots&#xD;
      of action, some without any action, etc. Chess and checkers were among the earliest computer&#xD;
      games and they still remain popular. Cognitive training interventions administered in a game&#xD;
      format have been studied in children with ADHD. Taken together, the results of studies show&#xD;
      that these cognitive training interventions are generally effective in improving the specific&#xD;
      executive functions they target, as well as parent-reported ADHD symptoms. The majority of&#xD;
      the interventions studied have targeted training of working memory, although some&#xD;
      interventions have also targeted attention, response inhibition, and cognitive flexibility in&#xD;
      the training. A recent meta-analysis found that interventions targeting multiple executive&#xD;
      function domains had a stronger effect on parent-reported ADHD symptoms than studies&#xD;
      targeting working memory alone (which showed minimal benefits), but it is possible that the&#xD;
      greater benefits seen were due to a more intensive intervention schedule.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improvements in cognitive assessments and parent-rated ADHD symptoms have been shown to&#xD;
      persist for up to 6 months after completion of training.4 However, it should be noted that&#xD;
      the improvements in cognitive function could be due to practice effects arising from&#xD;
      repetition of the cognitive tasks, rather than a true alteration in cognitive function.5 In&#xD;
      contrast to the effects on &quot;near-transfer&quot; functions and parent-rated ADHD symptoms, evidence&#xD;
      of &quot;far-transfer&quot; effects to untrained functions and non-clinical environments has been&#xD;
      limited, and improvements in teacher-rated ADHD symptoms have not been observed. The latter&#xD;
      observation is particularly important as teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms can be a more&#xD;
      objective measure of efficacy than parent ratings, and the most significant limitations for a&#xD;
      majority of the studies have been effective blinding procedures and an appropriate control&#xD;
      condition. These results are further limited by overrepresentation of males subjects in study&#xD;
      populations, the exclusion of patients with comorbidities in most of the studies, and small&#xD;
      sample sizes (for review, see Rutledge, et al. (2012), Chacko, et al. (2013) , and Rivero, et&#xD;
      al. (2015)).&#xD;
