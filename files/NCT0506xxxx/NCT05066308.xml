  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will study whether cannabidiol (CBD), the primary centrally and peripherally active&#xD;
      non-intoxicating compound in the cannabis plant, exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects in&#xD;
      patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) with or without mild-to-moderate depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm mechanistic trial to assess the effects of&#xD;
      CBD and placebo in patients with cLBP with and without mild-to-moderate depression, using&#xD;
      integrated positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scans. The use&#xD;
      of integrated PET/MRI will allow us to simultaneously evaluate neuroinflammation (using&#xD;
      [11C]PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for TSPO) and striatal function (using the&#xD;
      Monetary Incentive Delay task, a validated fMRI task that probes behavioral and neural&#xD;
      responses to rewards and losses).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>We will test for the presence of a significant treatment effect in the brain [11C]PBR28 signal in the thalamus, in order to test whether patients in the CBD arm will demonstrate significantly larger treatment-related reductions in pain-related neuroinflammation, compared to patients in the placebo arm.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>We will test for the presence of a significant treatment effect in the brain [11C]PBR28 in limbic regions (pgACC, aMCC) , in order to test whether patients in the CBD arm will demonstrate significantly larger treatment-related reductions in depression-related neuroinflammation, compared to patients in the placebo arm.

    <description>The recommended starting dosage is 2.5mg/kg taken twice daily (5mg/kg/day). We will follow the titration schedule recommended in the EPIDIOLEX label with 5 mg/kg/d in week 1, 10 mg/kg/d in week 2, 15 mg/kg/d in week 3, and 20 mg/kg/d in week 4 with the second PET scan conducted after one week at the maximum labeled dose. Any participant not tolerating a given dose can either go back down to the next lowest dose or delay uptitration at any week in the protocol. We will instruct patients to take Epidiolex with a meal rather than in a fasted state. Participants will be treated for 4 weeks in total.</description>

    <description>Epidiolex, an agent within the anti-epileptic drug class, will be used. Epidiolex, Greenwich Biosciences Inc.'s CBD formulation, is a 100 mg/mL purified oral solution, dissolved in the excipients sesame oil and anhydrous ethanol with added sweetener (sucralose) and strawberry flavoring. The drug is formulated from extracts prepared from Cannabis sativa L. plants that have a defined chemical profile and contain consistent levels of CBD as the principal phytocannabinoid. Extracts from these plants are processed to yield pure (&gt;95%) CBD that typically contains less than 0.5% (w/w) THC. Cannabidiol is the active ingredient in Epidiolex; inactive ingredients include dehydrated alcohol, sesame seed oil, strawberry flavor, and sucralose. Of note, CBD has no psychoactive properties.</description>
