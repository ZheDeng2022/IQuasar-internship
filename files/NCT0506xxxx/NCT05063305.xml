  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this graduate student research study is to evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      multi-strain probiotic and investigate if sex differences influence the role of probiotics on&#xD;
      stress and immunity biomarkers.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Participants will read and sign informed consent forms, HIPPA form, and SAHP Covid-19&#xD;
           screening form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will perform a baseline oral saliva swab to test for the stress biomarker&#xD;
           cortisol and immune markers, including Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor&#xD;
           (TNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Swabs will be individually packaged. After opening the package, participants will&#xD;
                place the swab under their tongue for 1-2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After swabbing is complete, the swab will be placed into the collection tube and&#xD;
                capped immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Completed swabs will be placed and held in a sub negative 70° Fahrenheit freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (10-15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As this study is double blinded, participants will be separated by gender (male and&#xD;
           female) and will select a 90-day supply of placebo or probiotic sample at random. For&#xD;
           each gender group there will be 50 samples to select from, comprised of a mix of 25&#xD;
           placebo and 25 probiotic bottles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be instructed to take 1 capsule per day for the following 90 days. If&#xD;
           a participant misses a day, they should resume taking 1 capsule per day the next day.&#xD;
           The capsule should not be crushed or chewed. The capsule may be taken with or without&#xD;
           food per participant preference. The participant should consistently take the probiotic&#xD;
           at a similar time each day (example: always take it in the morning or evening) Visit #2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the same Quality-of-Life Questionnaire from visit #1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will perform a post-study oral saliva swab in the same manner as visit #1&#xD;
