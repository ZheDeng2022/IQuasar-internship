  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, a breast cancer screening is organized since 2004 for women aged 50-74. On the&#xD;
      other hand, even though the seroprevalence of hepatitis C in the general French population is&#xD;
      less than 1%, it is estimated that more than 75,000 people live with the virus without&#xD;
      knowing it. To answer the WHO objective of eliminating hepatitis C by 2030 and in France by&#xD;
      2025, we need to organize targeted screening. Women aged more than 50 years old, by their&#xD;
      possible antecedents in life, are an exposed population. We propose to pair the already&#xD;
      organized breast cancer screening with a hepatitis-screening test by rapid diagnostic&#xD;
      orientation test (TROD) and evaluate the adherence of women in this paired screening. For&#xD;
      women with positive TROD, a specialized care will be organized.&#xD;

      Context :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organized breast cancer screening has been introduced in France since 2004. It concerns women&#xD;
      aged 50 to 74 years old with average risk (no symptoms and no risk factors). This systematic&#xD;
      screening reaches approximately 70% of the includable women. At the same time, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 10 to 15% of women aged 50 to 74 undergo screening as part of an individual&#xD;
      detection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seroprevalence of hepatitis C in the general French population is less than 1%, but it is&#xD;
      estimated that around 75,000 people living with the virus are unaware of their&#xD;
      seropositivity. Among them, the risk of a late diagnosis is the risk of cirrhosis or&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Screening for hepatitis C is also justified now that the new&#xD;
      treatments is universally accessible with a remarkable efficacy (&gt;95%). These pan-genotypic&#xD;
      treatments are of short duration and have very few adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO has set a goal of eliminating hepatitis by 2030 and France has gone a step further&#xD;
      and proposed an elimination date of 2025. These objectives are not achievable without&#xD;
      improved screening, the cornerstone of access to treatment. The objective is therefore to&#xD;
      propose targeted screening in certain sub-population to organize micro elimination phenomena.&#xD;
      Women over 50 years of age constitute a sub population at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the adherence rate of women aged 50 to 74 years to&#xD;
      hepatitis C screening by TROD paired with systematic breast cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are, among women aged 50-74 presenting for breast&#xD;
      cancer screening in the city of Montpellier, to estimate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prevalence of viral hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The retrospective care cascade of hepatitis C in women screened positive for chronic&#xD;
           hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to hepatitis C care among positive for chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Prospective screening procedure evaluation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The number of women who agreed to undergo the HCV test among those who were offered the&#xD;
      test will be calculated = adherence to the proposed screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of hepatitis C positive TRODs compared to the number of TRODs performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of HCV RNA positives among the number of hepatitis C positive TRODs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective chronic viral hepatitis C care cascade for participants with a positive&#xD;
           TROD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to care and prospective cascade of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analyses will be descriptive. The main characteristics of the participants will be&#xD;
      described by the mean/standard deviation or median/interquartile range when the variable is&#xD;
      quantitative and by a proportion with confidence interval when the variable is qualitative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The judgment criteria will be described by percentages with their 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
      The fibrosis score will be presented in classes.&#xD;
