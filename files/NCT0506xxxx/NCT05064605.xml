    <textblock>
      At present, pulmonary diffusion and target antifungal concentrations for APC in patients with&#xD;
      sarcoidosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are unknown.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Knowledge of these elements is however an essential prerequisite for optimizing the dosages&#xD;
      in these contexts. The main objective of the study is to quantify the diffusion of&#xD;
      antifungals in the lower respiratory tract in patients treated for pulmonary aspergillosis in&#xD;
      the context of underlying chronic respiratory disease. Determining this level of diffusion&#xD;
      will make it possible to deduce the plasma concentrations to be achieved in patients and to&#xD;
      identify the molecules with the best diffusion profile. The concentration of antifungals in&#xD;
      the lungs will be measured from 3 types of samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sputum obtained by expectoration. These samples will make it possible to quantify the&#xD;
           diffusion at the level of the upper and lower respiratory tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchial aspirations. These samples will make it possible to quantify the diffusion at&#xD;
           the level of the deep respiratory tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which will quantify the diffusion at the level of the deep&#xD;
           respiratory tree and the ELF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken simultaneously so as to determine the percentage of diffusion&#xD;
      from the plasma to the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these samples will be taken as part of the standard care of patients, the lung samples&#xD;
      having the main use of mycological monitoring, the blood samples having the main use of&#xD;
      pharmacological and serological monitoring. Lung samples will also be taken routinely for&#xD;
      pharmacological monitoring, in order to measure antifungal concentrations at the site of&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycological monitoring will consist of measuring the fungal load in the broncho-respiratory&#xD;
      secretions as well as carrying out an antifongigram in the event of isolation of Aspergillus&#xD;
      spp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible association between plasma and pulmonary concentrations of antifungals on the&#xD;
      one hand, and mycological and clinical markers of treatment efficacy on the other hand, will&#xD;
      also be investigated. The mycological markers of efficacy will be the results of mycological&#xD;
      monitoring (culture of broncho-respiratory secretions and aspergillus serology). The clinical&#xD;
      markers will be the pulmonary imaging results obtained as part of the management of these&#xD;
      patients. The identification of such combinations should allow target concentrations of&#xD;
      antifungals to be defined and, where appropriate, antifungal dosage recommendations specific&#xD;
      to the treatment of PCA in patients with chronic respiratory disease to be defined.&#xD;
