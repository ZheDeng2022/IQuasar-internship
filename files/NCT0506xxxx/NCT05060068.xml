  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female patients with an American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical status I-II, scheduled&#xD;
      for elective breast cancer surgery will be included in the study. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three groups: the placebo group, the low-dose S-ketamine group, and the&#xD;
      high-dose S-ketamine group. The primary outcome is the consumption of sufentanil during the&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be scheduled to a propofol-remifentanil general anesthesia and receive&#xD;
      non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug before incision. Bolus sufentanil will be administered&#xD;
      according to the blood pressure, heart rate and bispectral index perioperatively. Patients&#xD;
      unable to understand the study procedure or unable to give informed consent, with concurrent&#xD;
      analgesic or sedative medication, with history of chronic pain, psychiatric disorders, or&#xD;
      alcohol or drug abuse, with an allergy to the study medication, who are pregnant or breast&#xD;
      feeding, with a BMI &gt;30 and &lt;18 kg/m2, with severe cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal&#xD;
      dysfunction, with intracranial hypertension will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: the placebo group, the low-dose&#xD;
      S-ketamine group, and the high-dose S-ketamine group. The study medication will be&#xD;
      administered in a bolus injected over 30 s after induction, followed by continuous infusion,&#xD;
      which started after the initial bolus. The placebo group will receive a bolus of 0.9% saline,&#xD;
      followed by continuous infusion of 0.9% saline. The low-dose ketamine group will be&#xD;
      administered a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg S-ketamine in saline, followed by 2μg/kg/min S-ketamine in&#xD;
      saline, whereas the high-dose ketamine group will be administered a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      S-ketamine in saline, followed by continuous infusion of 4μg/kg/min S-ketamine in saline. The&#xD;
      syringes and infusions will be identical for all of the groups and will run at the same rate&#xD;
      in all subjects to enable blinding of the investigators. Study medication will be terminated&#xD;
      30 min prior to the end of the surgery. After surgery and in the postanesthesia care unit,&#xD;
      patients will be asked about their pain level on a numeric rating scale (NRS), and about the&#xD;
      presence of intraoperative awareness, nausea, vomiting, and hallucinations. Rescue analgesia&#xD;
      of sufentanil will be provided when NRS ≥ 4 or patients require. Pain level will also be&#xD;
      assessed at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hour postoperatively as well as 3 and 6 month after the&#xD;
      surgery. Depression scale will be evaluated before the surgery and in the 7th postoperative&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
