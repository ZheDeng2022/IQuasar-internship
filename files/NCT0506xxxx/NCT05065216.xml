  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DM199 in&#xD;
      treating acute ischemic stroke patients presenting with AIS and for whom tPA and a&#xD;
      catheter-based procedure, MT, are not medically appropriate or available due to constraints&#xD;
      of clot location, comorbidity risks, and/or time from onset of stroke (LVO is excluded from&#xD;
      this study). The double-blinded study will be randomized, placebo controlled at up to 75&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 seamless adaptive,&#xD;
      multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DM199. Patients&#xD;
      presenting with acute ischemic stroke will be randomized in 1:1 to placebo or DM199&#xD;
      administered by a single intravenous (IV) dose followed by a subcutaneous (SC) dose within 12&#xD;
      hours and then 2 times a week till Day 22. The duration of each individual's participation in&#xD;
      the study will be 90 days from the time of consent to completion of all study activities.&#xD;
      Figure 1 depicts the overall study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be conducted at the end of Phase 2 of the study after approximately&#xD;
      144 patients complete their Day 90 assessments. Additional patients will continue to be&#xD;
      enrolled while the database and interim statistical analysis are prepared for review. A Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the interim data for efficacy and safety to&#xD;
      determine if the trial will proceed into Phase 3. The adaptive feature of the study includes&#xD;
      a formal interim assessment of efficacy and the possibility for increasing the sample size.&#xD;
      The study is initially planned to enroll an additional 220 patients in Phase 3 (N=364 total).&#xD;
      If sample size re-estimation is deemed appropriate from the interim analysis, a maximum of&#xD;
      584 patients may be enrolled in Phase 3 (N=728 total). This adaptive design is&#xD;
      (inferentially) seamless because it continues from Phase 2 to Phase 3 without pausing&#xD;
      enrollment and because all (N=364 to 728 total) patients in the study will be included in the&#xD;
      final statistical analysis.&#xD;

             considered for inclusion at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female patients of childbearing potential must use medically acceptable contraceptive&#xD;
             measures to prevent pregnancy. All women of childbearing potential (defined as&#xD;
             sexually mature women who have had menses within the preceding 24 months and have not&#xD;
             undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, etc.) must have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test performed at screening. Women of childbearing potential must agree not to attempt&#xD;
             to become pregnant or undergo in vitro fertilization. If participating in sexual&#xD;
             activity that could lead to pregnancy, women must use 2 reliable methods of&#xD;
             contraception simultaneously while receiving protocol-specified medication and during&#xD;
             the study follow-up period. Male heterosexual patients participating in sexual&#xD;
             activity must agree to use 2 reliable methods of contraception simultaneously while&#xD;
             receiving protocol-specified medication and during the study follow-up period if their&#xD;
             partner is of childbearing potential. A combination of 2 of the following methods must&#xD;
             be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms (male or female)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intra uterine device&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stable hormonal-based contraception Women who are not of reproductive potential&#xD;
                  (who have been postmenopausal for more than 24 consecutive months or have&#xD;
                  undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) are not required to use&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male patients will refrain from sperm donation. NOTE: A negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be documented during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient is participating in any other drug study ≤1 week or 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational product, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient does not have sufficient venous access for infusion of study treatment or&#xD;
             blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient is unable or unwilling to comply with protocol requirements, including&#xD;
             assessments, tests, and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient has any other medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator will&#xD;
             make participation medically unsafe or interfere with the study results&#xD;
