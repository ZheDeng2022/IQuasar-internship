      The purpose of study is to provide an objective data for evaluating the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Chinese medicine (CM) formula combined with inhaled corticosteroid in the treatment of&#xD;
      asthmatic children. Investigators will recruit eighty-six mild to moderate asthmatic children&#xD;
      aged 4-11 years old with regular ICS usage and they will be randomized into two groups in&#xD;
      this double-blind trial. Forty-three subjects will receive CM (CM group;&#xD;
      Ma-Hsing-Kan-Shih-Tang in combination with Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang) and the other forty-three&#xD;
      subjects will receive placebo (placebo group; 10% CM) for 12 weeks. Investigators will&#xD;
      compare these two groups by questionnaires of Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT), the&#xD;
      Integrated Therapeutics Group Child Asthma Short Form (ITG-CASF), Pediatric Asthma&#xD;
      Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ), the pulmonary function test and blood&#xD;
      test including Complete Blood Count with Differential Count (CBC/DC), total IgE, Eosinophil&#xD;
      Cationic Protein (ECP) and IL-4/IL-5/IL-13. Adverse events, renal and liver function test&#xD;
      will be evaluated to investigate the safety of CM formula as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treating pediatric asthma has been in accordance with GINA guidelines by stepwise approach to&#xD;
      adjust treatment for individual patient needs. However, most of the asthma controller&#xD;
      medication nowadays is inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Parents with steroid phobia may raise&#xD;
      concern and fears about the potential systemic effects, leading to poor adherence to&#xD;
      medication and worse control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine (CM) formula combined&#xD;
      with inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of mild to moderate persistent asthma in&#xD;
      children. Investigators focus on the following specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of the CM formula (Ma-Hsing-Kan-Shih-Tang in combination with Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang)&#xD;
      compared with placebo; Aim 2. To evaluate the effects of CM formula on quality of life in&#xD;
      these patients with pediatric asthma; Aim 3. To investigate the safety of CM formula in these&#xD;
      patients with pediatric asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty-six mild to moderate asthmatic children aged 4-11 years old with regular ICS usage&#xD;
      will be randomized into two groups in this double-blind trial. Forty-three subjects will&#xD;
      receive CM (CM group; Ma-Hsing-Kan-Shih-Tang in combination with Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang) and the&#xD;
      other forty-three subjects will receive placebo (placebo group; 10% CM) for 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      evaluation including pulmonary function test, IOS, FeNO, blood test, questionnaire and asthma&#xD;
      diary card of both two groups will be conducted during the study period. The safety of CM&#xD;
      formula use will be investigated by recording the adverse events and renal and liver function&#xD;
      test as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide an objective data for evaluating the efficacy and safety o of Chinese&#xD;
      medicine (CM) formula combined with inhaled corticosteroid in the treatment of asthmatic&#xD;
      children. Through the combination of Chinese and western medicine, we expect to enhance the&#xD;
      efficacy of asthma treatment, reduce acute exacerbation and tapper the dose of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids, leading to better quality of life.&#xD;
