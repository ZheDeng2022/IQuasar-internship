      This phase 2 study ain to evaluate the efficacy of Isatuximab plus Pomalidomide and&#xD;
      Dexamethasone (IPd), in patients with AL amyloidosis not in VGPR or better after any previous&#xD;
      therapy. It will enrolled 46 patients (34 in France and 12 in Australia) through 15 sites (11&#xD;
      in France and 4 in Australia).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic AL amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by the deposition of misfolded monoclonal&#xD;
      immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) in various tissues and organs. It is usually&#xD;
      associated with a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia with a low tumor burden. Treatment of AL&#xD;
      amyloidosis relies mainly on chemotherapy aimed at suppressing the underlying plasma cell&#xD;
      clone secreting monoclonal FLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organ responses and the survival are greatly influenced by the degree of hematological&#xD;
      response evaluated by the decrease in serum FLC that has been the principal endpoint in&#xD;
      recent trials in AL amyloidosis. The goal of treatment is to reach at least a very good&#xD;
      partial response (VGPR) defined as a difference between the involved FLC and the normal one&#xD;
      below 40 mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 5 years, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as daratumumab and Isatuximab (anti CD38&#xD;
      mAb) has emerged as a breakthrough targeted therapies for patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD38, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that functions both as a signal-transducing&#xD;
      receptor and a multifunctional ectoenzyme. The expression of CD38 is increased in MM and AL&#xD;
      amyloidosis plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab (DARA) is an IgG 1k human mAb that received initial approval as monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with heavily pretreated RRMM and who were refractory to proteasome inhibitors (PIs)&#xD;
      and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD®). DARA has since been approved in combination with&#xD;
      Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone1,2 and Bortezomib/Dexamethasone3,4 for the treatment of frontline&#xD;
      and relapsed/refractory (RR) MM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IFM and other groups previously demonstrated that DARA in monotherapy is safe and effective&#xD;
      in relapsed AL amyloidosis patients5. Our prospective phase II study showed that about 70 to&#xD;
      80% of patients have a response but only around 50% reached a VGPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DARA activity could be increased with IMiD® as treating plasma cells with IMiD®, such as&#xD;
      pomalidomide or lenalidomide, has been shown to increase the expression of CD38 levels on the&#xD;
      surface of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In AL amyloidosis, the Italian and the British groups demonstrated that pomalidomide is very&#xD;
      effective and better tolerated than lenalidomide especially in patients with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency6,7. The dose of pomalidomide (4 mg) was like the dose used in MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining an anti CD38 mAb to pomalidomide could therefore be an attractive regimen for&#xD;
      relapsed AL amyloidosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isatuximab (ISA) is another IgG1 κ mAb that binds selectively to a unique epitope on the&#xD;
      human CD38 receptor and has anti plasma cells activity via multiple mechanisms of action. In&#xD;
      a previous phase 1b study, around 65% of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma achieved an overall response with a combination of Isatuximab with Pomalidomide and&#xD;
      low-dose Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of Isatuximab to Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone was used in a large phase III study&#xD;
      in RRMM8. Safety profile was also favorable, and these results granted an approval of the&#xD;
      combination of ISA plus Pomalidomide (4 mg) and Dexamethasone in these patients.&#xD;
