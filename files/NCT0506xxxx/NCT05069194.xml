  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk factors and causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease（COPD）are not clear, so&#xD;
      the prevalence of COPD is high and the prevention effect is not good. Because the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of COPD is not completely elucidated, the diagnosis and classification of COPD&#xD;
      are inaccurate which resulting in poor efficacy of treatment. Therefore, it is of great&#xD;
      scientific and clinical significance to find out the risk factors and causes of COPD, to&#xD;
      clarify its pathogenesis, to put forward the prevention and early intervention measures of&#xD;
      COPD, to warn the occurrence of COPD, to predict the deterioration of the disease, to reduce&#xD;
      the occurrence of COPD and to slow down the progress of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project establishes a cohort of COPD people，high-risk group and the healthy group. The&#xD;
      project studys the risk factors, etiology and pathogenesis of COPD. The project studys the&#xD;
      interaction between genetic factors and environmental factors on COPD and its effect on&#xD;
      pathogenesis, progression and outcome of COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The project establishes the data base and specimen bank for COPD.Then clinical bioinformatics&#xD;
      technology is uesd to analyze the clinical information and epidemiological information. In&#xD;
      the same time, Omics methods are used to study COPD-related genes and biomarkers . Finally, a&#xD;
      multi-factor risk factor model for the occurrence and development of COPD is established by&#xD;
      combining clinical information, epidemiological information and biomics results.&#xD;
