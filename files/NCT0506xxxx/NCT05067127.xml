      This is a Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of twice-weekly subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      doses of pegcetacoplan compared to placebo in patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) or&#xD;
      immune-complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) on the basis of a reduction&#xD;

                  pathology laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. In adolescents not providing a baseline renal biopsy, at least one of the&#xD;
                  following:&#xD;

          -  Presence of an active urine sediment during screening, as evidenced by hematuria with&#xD;
             at least 5 red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field (HPF) and/or red blood cell&#xD;
             casts on local or central microscopic analysis of urine.&#xD;
