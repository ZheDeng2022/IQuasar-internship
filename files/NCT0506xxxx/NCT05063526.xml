  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To evaluate real-time ultrasound in the evaluation of diaphragmatic thickening,&#xD;
      thickening fraction and or excursion to predict extubation outcomes. The investigators aimed&#xD;
      to compare these parameters with other traditional weaning measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diaphragm is an important respiratory muscle and dysfunction is very common in patients&#xD;
      receiving mechanical ventilation. Diaphragm fatigue occurs even in patients who successfully&#xD;
      pass the Spontaneous Breathing Test (SBT). Interrupting ventilation too early can lead to&#xD;
      increased cardiovascular and respiratory pressure (CO2).retention and hypoxemia with up to&#xD;
      25% of patients requiring reinstitution of ventilator support. Unnecessary delays in&#xD;
      liberation from mechanical ventilation also can be deleterious. Complications such as&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-induced diaphragm atrophy can be seen with&#xD;
      short periods of mechanical ventilation thereby prolonging mechanical ventilation. As SBT&#xD;
      monitoring is insensitive to detect early signs of load-capacity imbalance. The evaluation of&#xD;
      the diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) may be also helpful to assess diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function and its contribution to respiratory workload. Ultrasound can be used to detect the&#xD;
      deflection of the diaphragm, which helps to identify patients with diaphragm dysfunction&#xD;
