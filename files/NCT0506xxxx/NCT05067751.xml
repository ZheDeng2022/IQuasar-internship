  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research supports that bimodal stimulation includes improvements in auditory performance and&#xD;
      daily living over using a cochlear implant (CI) or hearing aid (HA) alone. Although bimodal&#xD;
      users continue to achieve high levels of satisfaction, speech perception in noise continues&#xD;
      to be highly problematic. The aim of this field study is to identify which directionality&#xD;
      schemes in a bimodal solution are preferred by users using an ecological momentary assessment&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this research trial is to evaluate asymmetrical directionality in&#xD;
      bimodal users for hearing speech in noise in the sound field and in daily life using an EMA&#xD;
      tool. The aim is to collect information regarding hearing for speech in background noise as&#xD;
      well as end-user insights, testimonials, and communication content.&#xD;

    <measure>Hearing loss assessed by the SSQ 12 hearing related questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Speech Spatial and Qualities of hearing questionnaire is designed to measure of range of hearing disabilities across several domains. Specific attention is given to hearing speech in a host of competing contexts, and to the directional, distance and movement components of spatial hearing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing loss assessed by the AZ Bio sentence test in the presence of noise</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AZ Bio sentence in noise test comprised of 15 lists of 20 sentences each and is a measure of speech perception ability by individuals that mimics real life conditions with the presence of background noise.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing loss will be assessed by using ecological momentary assessments to get a repeated sampling of their behaviors and experiences in real time.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Ecological momentary assessment will act as a digital diary, in real time, to understand subject's real life behaviors in their momentary environments.</description>
