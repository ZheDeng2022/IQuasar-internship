    <textblock>
      The is a phase 2 multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center study assessing the&#xD;
      clinical benefit of SAR444245 combined with other anticancer therapies for the treatment of&#xD;
      participants aged 18 years and older with HNSCC. This study is structured as a master&#xD;
      protocol for the investigation of SAR444245 with other anticancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 1-Cohort A1 aims to establish proof-of-concept that SAR444245 combined with the&#xD;
      anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab, will result in a significant increase in the observed number&#xD;
      of objective responses in trial participants with HNSCC who are treatment-naïve for recurrent&#xD;
      and/or metastatic (R/M) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 2 - Cohort A2 aims to establish proof-of-concept that SAR444245 combined with both&#xD;
      the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab and cetuximab will result in a significant increase in&#xD;
      the observed number of objective responses in trial participants with HNSCC who are&#xD;
      treatment-naïve for recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 4-Cohort B1 aims to establish proof-of-concept that SAR444245 combined with the&#xD;
      anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab, will result in a significant increase in the observed number&#xD;
      of objective responses in trial participants with HNSCC who have received treatment with&#xD;
      PD1/PD-L1 and platinum-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 5-Cohort B2 aims to establish proof-of-concept that SAR444245 combined with&#xD;
      cetuximab will result in a significant increase in the observed number of objective responses&#xD;
      in trial participants with HNSCC previously treated with platinum-based regimen &amp;&#xD;
      cetuximab-naïve after failure of no more than 2 regimens for recurrent and/or metastatic&#xD;
      (R/M) disease.&#xD;
