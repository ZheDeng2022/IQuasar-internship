  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Tools for the Management of Childhood Illness (TIMCI) project is to&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality in sick children attending primary care facilities, while&#xD;
      supporting the rational and efficient use of diagnostics and medicines by healthcare&#xD;
      providers. The evaluation component of the project seeks to generate evidence on the health&#xD;
      impact, operational priorities, cost and modelled cost-effectiveness of introducing pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, embedded into a Clinical Decision Support Algorithm (CDSA), at primary care level&#xD;
      in LMICs, for children 0 - 59 months of age, to facilitate national and international&#xD;
      decision-making on scale-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the longitudinal observational studies conducted in Kenya, Myanmar and Senegal, the&#xD;
      health impact will be assessed through a quasi-experimental study design. It will compare the&#xD;
      clinical care of children in a three-month pre-intervention period (Q1) with four sequential&#xD;
      three-month periods (Q2-Q5). Additionally, mixed-method studies will be conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      the key components of quality of care and to learn more about the implementation processes&#xD;
      and mechanisms. Included will be a service provision assessment (SPA) which has been modified&#xD;
      for the TIMCI study. Further a facility-based process mapping and time-flow study, as well as&#xD;
      qualitative studies with caregivers, healthcare provediers and key stakeholders will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in primary care level facilities in Kenya (Kakamega, Kitui and&#xD;
      Uasin Gishu county), Myanmar (Ayeyarwady and Southern Shan) and Senegal (Thi√®s). In Kenya,&#xD;
      facilities of Level 2 (dispensaries) and Level 3 (health-centres/sub-county hospitals are&#xD;
      included; in Myanmar sub-centers and rural health centers and in Senegal health posts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions that will be introduced and assessed are pulse oximetry, incorporated into&#xD;
      Clinical Decision Support Algorithms. The criteria for pulse oximetry are a.) all children&#xD;
      under 2 months of age, b.) Children 2-59 months of age presenting with cough/difficulty&#xD;
      breathing, and c.) Children 2-59 months of age with IMCI signs of moderate/severe disease&#xD;
      (yellow or red classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the longitudinal observational study is calculated separately for each&#xD;
      country, based on comparison between Q1 and Q5, however the same sample size will also be&#xD;
      collected in each of the intervening quarters (Q2, Q3 and Q4) where logistically feasible,&#xD;
      for the purposes of secondary analysis over time. The sample size was calculated to detect a&#xD;
      difference in referral from primary care from 3% to at least 4.5%, with 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the calculated sample size, we would expect to record a minimum detectable reduction of&#xD;
      18% in Kenya and Senegal and of 16% in Myanmar for the antibiotic prescription primary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service provision assessments and process mapping will be conducted in 8 - 10 longitudinal&#xD;
      study facilities per country, stratified by rural / urban location and facility type, at 5&#xD;
      time points (once per quarter in each facility). At each facility at each time point, 10 - 30&#xD;
      children per facility will be included, resulting in an estimated sample size of 800 - 1000&#xD;
      clinical observations, time-flow observations and exit interviews per country over the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of children admitted to hospital within 24 hours of the Day 0 primary care consultation and as a result of a referral</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This is used as a proxy for 'appropriate referral' of children, as those with severe disease should generally be admitted to hospital. The denominator for this outcome is also all children enrolled in the study, rather than only referred children. This is because the proportion of referred children that are admitted may be high in routine care, in the context of an inappropriately low referral rate. The aim of the intervention is therefore to increase the overall referral rate of children with severe disease. Hospital admission is chosen as the proxy of severe disease rather than using primary care classification of severe disease, as there are inadequacies in the classification of severe disease in routine practice</description>
