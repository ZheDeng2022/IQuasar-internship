  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a digital health coaching program&#xD;
      for, and to describe quality of life of, individuals in the 6 months following chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Up to 50 English-speaking individuals aged 18 and&#xD;
      older who are to receive treatment with a CAR T cell therapy will be enrolled, all at The&#xD;
      University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Participants must have internet access via&#xD;
      smart phone, tablet, a computer, or another device with the capacity to receive calls, texts,&#xD;
      or e-mails, as well as the electronic study assessments and will be excluded if they are&#xD;
      unable to provide informed consent or have a prognosis of 6 months or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented participants will be enrolled in a 6-month digital health coaching program&#xD;
      delivered via weekly calls from a Health Advisor coupled with the digital delivery of&#xD;
      content. The program focuses on identification and escalation of treatment-related toxicity,&#xD;
      communication with providers, and physical and psychosocial health following treatment.&#xD;
      Health related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-L), health self-efficacy will be assessed by the Cancer&#xD;
      Behavior Inventory-Brief (CBI-B), physical and mental health outcomes will be measured by the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System&#xD;
      (PROMIS) Global Health 10. Patient experience in managing CAR T specific care will be&#xD;
      assessed with a 5-item questionnaire developed specifically for use in this study, focused on&#xD;
      participants' confidence in understanding, identifying and managing symptoms, and&#xD;
      communicating with providers. Study outcomes will contribute to knowledge about if and how a&#xD;
      digital health intervention may be used to support individuals post-CAR T cell therapy.&#xD;
