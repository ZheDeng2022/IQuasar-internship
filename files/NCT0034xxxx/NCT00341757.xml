      Family history of cancer is an important possible indicator of inherited cancer&#xD;
      susceptibility, which has helped identify individuals and families at high risk of inherited&#xD;
      cancers in research studies and clinical practice. While there are also various potential&#xD;
      uses of family history of cancer data in cancer surveillance, the completeness and accuracy&#xD;
      of family history of cancer data collected from the general population is unclear. In an&#xD;
      effort to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a national surveillance study to determine&#xD;
      the prevalence of family history of cancer in the U.S. population, the Risk Factor Monitoring&#xD;
      and Methods Branch will undertake a pilot study, entitled the Family Health Study, that&#xD;
      examines issues of data quality. In this study, a family history of cancer questionnaire&#xD;
      (FHCQ) will be developed for surveillance purposes and administered to a random digit dial&#xD;
      (RDD) sample of households in the state of Connecticut. Positive and negative reports of&#xD;
      common cancers in the respondent's families will be validated against records of the&#xD;
      Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR) and other data sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to: 1) assess the agreement between respondent reports of specific cancers&#xD;
      in first and second degree relatives and medical record-based reports, as measured by percent&#xD;
      concordance; 2) quantify the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the FHCQ by&#xD;
      cancer site; 3) evaluate the possible predictors of reporting accuracy, including cancer&#xD;
      site, year of diagnosis, kinship relation of the relative to the respondent and the frequency&#xD;
      and quality of their contact, overall family cohesiveness, respondent's own history of&#xD;
      cancer, and demographic factors; 4) describe the completeness and reliability of family&#xD;
      structure data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of selected relatives' cancer status will be done through data linkage to the&#xD;
      Connecticut Tumor Registry, other selected cancer registries, the National Death Index,&#xD;
      Medicare claims data bases, state death certificate registries, or by obtaining consent to&#xD;
      review available medical records from physicians and health care facilities. Self-reports of&#xD;
      respondents' cancer status will also be validated since this may be a predictor of ability to&#xD;
      accurately report family history. A pre-established tracing algorithm will be used to triage&#xD;
      cancer reports into the medical records systems where true cancer status is most likely to be&#xD;

      by a nosology team following a double-blinded protocol. A certainty level will be assigned to&#xD;
      each cancer outcome based on the type of confirming medical record, with evidence of&#xD;
      microscopic confirmation of malignancy considered the most certain. Statistical analyses to&#xD;
      determine FHCQ1 sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, will be performed, accounting&#xD;
      for level of certainty. Predictors of cancer reporting accuracy will be examined using&#xD;
      multivariate regression.&#xD;
