  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ACZONE in&#xD;
      subjects treated with the HER1/EGFR inhibitor Tarceva (erlotinib) who develop a rash on the&#xD;
      face&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, parallel design study in subjects treated with&#xD;
      Tarceva for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who subsequently develop a rash suspected to&#xD;
      be related to Tarceva. Only subjects who are not glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)&#xD;
      deficient, and who have locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and have failed at least 1 prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen indicated for Tarceva treatment will be included. Subjects will be&#xD;
      screened and consented for the study within 3 days of initiating Tarceva therapy and will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact the Investigator immediately when signs or symptoms of rash appear on&#xD;
      the face. Subjects will be enrolled into the study only if a rash develops on the face and it&#xD;
      has been confirmed and evaluated against eligibility criteria for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, subjects will be randomly assigned to apply either ACZONE or placebo to the&#xD;
      rash-affected areas of the face. Subjects will apply ACZONE / placebo treatment for 8 weeks,&#xD;
      even if symptoms of the rash resolve completely. Specific efficacy assessments will include&#xD;
      lesion counts, plaque area, erythema assessment, and pruritus assessment. Rash&#xD;
      characteristics will be monitored using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria Adverse Event (CTCAE) version 3.0 terms and severity descriptions and percentage of&#xD;
      facial surface area (FSA) affected. Investigators will evaluate the subject's overall&#xD;
      response to treatment according to a standardized multiple choice question. Throughout the&#xD;
      study, photographs of the face will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be followed for 10 weeks (8 weeks of therapy + 2 weeks of follow-up) by&#xD;
      monitoring adverse events, concomitant medications, and chemistry and hematology parameters.&#xD;
      Plasma dapsone and N-acetyl dapsone concentrations will be measured to determine systemic&#xD;
      exposure to the study treatment. Steady state plasma concentrations of erlotinib will also be&#xD;
      measured before and after initiating the study treatment to determine any potential effects&#xD;
      of ACZONE on pharmacokinetics of Tarceva.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for the study, subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be male or female ≥18 years of age (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have been prescribed Tarceva as a single agent to treat locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             NSCLC, after failing at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Present with acute signs and symptoms of rash on the face that meet the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Are suspected to be related to Tarceva,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Include at least 3 inflammatory lesions, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Are less than CTCAE Grade 3 in severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 and a life&#xD;
             expectancy of at least 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Sign an approved informed consent form for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be willing to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A skin examination reveals the presence of another skin disease and/or condition&#xD;
             (excessive facial hair, excessive scarring, sunburn, or other disfigurement) located&#xD;
             on the face that, in the study physician's opinion, would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             the rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A diagnosis of G6PD deficiency, defined as having a G6PD value below the lower limit&#xD;
             of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A diagnosis of anemia, defined as hemoglobin &lt;9.5 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Undergoing any current therapy for NSCLC other than Tarceva.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior treatment with Iressa, Erbitux, or any experimental HER1/EGFR inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment with topical antibiotics, topical steroids, and other topical treatments on&#xD;
             the face within 14 days of Day 0 (start of ACZONE/placebo study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Treatment with any systemic antibiotics within 7 days of Day 0 (start of&#xD;
             ACZONE/placebo study treatment).&#xD;

             and methotrexate. Short-term treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             (NSAIDs) before the study for non-rash related conditions is acceptable, provided that&#xD;
             exposure is limited to ≤7 days per course. Chronic low-dose aspirin use is also&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Active participation in an experimental therapy study or received experimental therapy&#xD;
             within 30 days of Day 0 (start of ACZONE/placebo study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A history of hypersensitivity to dapsone, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, parabens, or&#xD;
             any component of ACZONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A poor medical risk because of other systemic diseases or active uncontrolled&#xD;
             infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women who: are lactating; have a positive pregnancy test at Day 0, or; if sexually&#xD;
             active and menstruating, are not practicing an adequate method of birth control.&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of birth control include intrauterine device (IUD); oral, dermal&#xD;
             (&quot;patch&quot;), implanted or injected contraceptives; tubal ligation or hysterectomy&#xD;
             (medical documentation required); and/or barrier methods with spermicide. A surgically&#xD;
             sterile partner is not considered an adequate method of birth control.&#xD;
