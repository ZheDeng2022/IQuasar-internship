      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 4 different doses&#xD;
      of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted mock-up pandemic influenza vaccine. Subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled sequentially into 3 study cohorts with 4 escalating doses of H5N1 hemagglutininin&#xD;
      antigen (3.75 µg adjuvanted, 7.5 µg adjuvanted/non-adjuvanted, 15 µg&#xD;
      adjuvanted/non-adjuvanted, 30 µg adjuvanted). Starting with the lowest dose level, subjects&#xD;
      will receive 2 vaccinations (21 days apart) at the dose to which they were assigned. Subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored for safety and for antibody response to the vaccine. A data safety&#xD;
      monitoring board will review and evaluate all the safety data obtained for a dose level&#xD;
      before allowing administration of the next (higher) dose.&#xD;
