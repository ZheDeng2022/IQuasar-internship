        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has typical or atypical chest pain suspected of CAD and is referred for an&#xD;
             elective coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be scheduled to undergo a CATH procedure between 48 hours and 3 weeks&#xD;
             post CCTA procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must not undergo any cardiac interventional treatment between the 2&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have sinus rhythm with stable heart rate of ≤65 beats per minute&#xD;
             (bpm) or if heart rate was &gt;65 bpm, the subject must agree to the use of&#xD;
             beta-blocker(s) prior to the CT scan procedure to achieve stable heart rate of ≤65&#xD;
             bpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had an established diagnosis of CAD by a) previous CATH, b) prior&#xD;
             myocardial infarction confirmed by ECG, or c) prior revascularization (balloon&#xD;
             angioplasty, stent placement, or CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had a known allergy to iodinated contrast agent, including but not limited&#xD;
             to hives, anaphylactoid or cardiovascular reactions, laryngeal edema and bronchospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had impaired renal function with a serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL&#xD;
             (150 μmol/L) or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had atrial fibrillation/flutter or any irregular heart rhythm considered&#xD;
             by the investigator to interfere with temporal acquisition of cardiac CT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had a resting heart rate of &gt;100 bpm and/or a resting systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure of &lt;100mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had an artificial heart valve(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has had prior pacemaker or internal defibrillator lead implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's resting heart rate was &gt;65 bpm and beta-blocker therapy was&#xD;
             contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had a contraindication to verapamil when beta-blocker therapy could not be&#xD;
             administered. The subject had a contraindication to nitroglycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had evidence of ongoing or active clinical instability.&#xD;
