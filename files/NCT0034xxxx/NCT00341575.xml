      This study, conducted by NHGRI and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, will&#xD;
      develop statistical approaches for modeling family social structure and apply these models to&#xD;
      explore the role of family social structure in participation in genetic testing and&#xD;
      counseling, disclosure of test results and adjustment to risk status. With recent genetic&#xD;
      advances and the ability to test for hereditary illnesses, methods that provide an&#xD;
      understanding of the family social structure and how that structure affects the dissemination&#xD;
      of genetic risk information are increasingly important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data for this study were collected by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center as part of a study&#xD;
      on family communication and family functioning with regard to genetic testing for hereditary&#xD;
      nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Relatives of people with HNPCC are more likely than the&#xD;
      general population to get colon cancer and other types of cancer if they have inherited the&#xD;
      gene alteration (mutation) that predisposes to the disease. This alteration can be passed on&#xD;
      from a parent to some or all of his or her children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center study, telephone interviews were conducted with 80 adult&#xD;
      members of 16 extended families with a known gene alteration predisposing for HNPCC. These&#xD;
      participants included people who had been diagnosed with an HNPCC syndrome cancer, their&#xD;
      unaffected family members who were at risk of carrying a gene mutation for HNPCC, and their&#xD;
      spouses. Participants were interviewed about their feelings, moods, coping style, and&#xD;
      relationships with their spouse, relatives, and friends, about their willingness to have&#xD;
      genetic testing, and about their feelings and beliefs about colon cancer, cancer screening&#xD;
      and genetic testing and counseling. Some participants were asked about their family&#xD;
      communication style and how the family coped with the idea of genetic testing and with the&#xD;
      results, if testing was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained from the current study may help facilitate family participation,&#xD;
      communication and psychological adjustment regarding risk information about genetic diseases.&#xD;

      The current research has two objectives: (1) development of statistical methods for modeling&#xD;
      family systems, and (2) characterization of the psychosocial and relational aspects of&#xD;
      families with a known mutation for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). This work&#xD;
      focuses on the family, and the family's social structure, as the unit of study. Data were&#xD;
      collected between 8/1999 and 6/2002 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center&#xD;
      (UTMDACC) as part of a qualitative study of family communication and family functioning with&#xD;
      regard to HNPCC genetic testing. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 80&#xD;
      adult members of 16 extended families with a known HNPCC-predisposing mutation. Family&#xD;
      members included those who had been diagnosed with a HNPCC syndrome cancer, unaffected&#xD;
      individuals who are at risk of carrying a mutation, and their spouses. The semistructured&#xD;
      interview guide was designed to define family network members and to measure the social&#xD;
      relations within each respondent's familial network. Social network data were collected&#xD;
      describing the support, communicative, and affective relationships between respondents' and&#xD;
      members of their family. Both positive (e.g. closeness) and negative (e.g. conflict)&#xD;
      relationships were measured. Communication relations specific to disclosure of mutation&#xD;
      status, cancer risk, participation in genetic testing and counseling efforts and surveillance&#xD;
      practices were obtained. In addition to relational measurements, demographic, health-related&#xD;
      (e.g. previous cancer diagnoses, adherence to surveillance regimens), psychosocial (e.g.&#xD;
      distress, coping) and behavioral (e.g. participation in genetic testing) measures were&#xD;
      obtained. The measurement methodology involved the use of interdependent ego-centered&#xD;
      networks. The respondents, or egos, defined those persons (alters) who they perceived to be&#xD;
      members of their family. Each respondent was then interviewed to obtain relational&#xD;
      measurements (e.g. social support, communication) for each of their alters. Respondents who&#xD;
      were members of the same family may name each other as family members and also may have&#xD;
      alters in common. This interdependency based on overlapping family membership needs to be&#xD;
      accounted for in the statistical approaches used to analyze the data. The primary goal of the&#xD;
      current project is to develop and refine statistical models for interdependent ego-centered&#xD;
      networks. The developed models will then be used to investigate the role of the familial&#xD;
      social structure in communications about genetic testing and counseling, disclosure of&#xD;
      mutation status, participation in genetic testing and counseling efforts, and adjustment to&#xD;
      risk status.&#xD;
