      The goal for COPD patients in pulmonary rehabilitation programs is to improve the quality of&#xD;
      life. COPD is known to be worse at night as are other respiratory problems such as CHF.&#xD;
      Saturation is known to get worse nocturnally as well. Furthermore, these COPD rehabilitation&#xD;
      patients tend to be older and increasing age is associated with an increase in the incidence&#xD;
      of sleep disorders. We suspect that there is an increase in the incidence of sleep disorders&#xD;
      in COPD patients. We plan to further study these patients using questionnaires. A preliminary&#xD;
      study was done, but the results were not comparable to national statistics. We plan to repeat&#xD;
      the study, only changing the questions to a format comparable to data from the National Sleep&#xD;
      Foundation.&#xD;

      Hackensack University Medical Center Institutional Review Board&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL: To study the prevalence of insomnia in geriatric COPD patients who are enrolled in&#xD;
      a pulmonary rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal for geriatric patients with COPD and enrolled in pulmonary rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      is to improve the quality of life. COPD is known to be worse at night as are other&#xD;
      respiratory problems such as CHF. Saturation is known to get worse nocturnally as well.&#xD;
      Furthermore, these COPD rehabilitation patients tend to be older, and increasing age is&#xD;
      associated with an increase in the incidence of sleep disorders. We suspect that there is an&#xD;
      increase in the incidence of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep in COPD patients. A&#xD;
      preliminary study was done by the chest medicine specialist in our group, but the results&#xD;
      were not comparable to national statistics and were inconclusive. We plan to further evaluate&#xD;
      the geriatric COPD patients in pulmonary rehabilitation with initial screening questionnaire&#xD;
      and diagnostic screening questionnaires (MMSE, Beck's Anxiety Inventory, Beck's Depression&#xD;
      Inventory, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence and prevalence of insomnia (difficulty initiating sleep&#xD;
           (DIS), and/or difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS) in the geriatric population with COPD&#xD;
           in a rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how many of these patients suffer from anxiety and/or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of insomnia (DIS and/or DMS), along with anxiety/depression is more prevalent&#xD;
      in geriatric patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. BACKGROUND MATERIAL According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), over a&#xD;
      six-month period, 20 million Americans complained of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD patients tend to have decreased total sleep time (32% reported total sleep time less&#xD;
      than 6 hours). According to previous studies conducted, the following was reported:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15% reported to have insomnia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  28% reported poor quality sleep due to anxiety and/or depression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12% reported &gt; 3 awakenings due to unknown origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS OF PILOT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot study, a preliminary general (initial) questionnaire was used and will continue&#xD;
      to be used as a tool for general screening purposes. And diagnostic questionnaires will be&#xD;
      used, which are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck's Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck's Depression Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MMSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. DRUG INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      No drugs are used in this study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. INCLUSIONARY CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geriatric patients with COPD enrolled in the rehabilitation program with FEV1&lt;60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. EXCLUSIONARY CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geriatric patients without a clear diagnosis of COPD. Geriatric patients whose FEV1&gt;60%.&#xD;
      Geriatric patients who are unable to answer the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geriatric patients in the HUMC pulmonary rehabilitation program who consent to answer the&#xD;
      questionnaire and with an FEV1&lt;60% will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Charts will be reviewed to see which patients meet the criteria of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: If the patient is eligible for diagnostic screening, then an informed&#xD;
      consent will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation: Geriatric patients will be asked the questions in the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: If insomnia is found, patient will be referred for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal and Termination: The patient is unable to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. DISCOMFORT AND RISKS&#xD;
&#xD;
      No direct risks to the patient. Failure to follow-up in the clinic if indicated could be&#xD;
      problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition and treatment of sleep problems in this group of patients will add to our&#xD;
      understanding of problems in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING RESPONSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      No response anticipated from the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be kept confidential. Data will only be used by the investigators. Data can&#xD;
      be reviewed by the IRB at any time. HIPPA forms will be used for the patient's permission.&#xD;
