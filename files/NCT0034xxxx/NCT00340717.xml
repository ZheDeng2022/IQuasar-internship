      This study will determine whether certain gene alterations can serve as markers for early&#xD;
      detection of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is often diagnosed by detecting high levels of&#xD;
      a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. Other conditions can also&#xD;
      cause elevated PSA levels, however, so that additional tests are needed to distinguish&#xD;
      between benign and cancerous prostate conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 40 and 75 years of age who are referred to Howard University Hospital in&#xD;
      Washington, D.C., or Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington, for ultrasound and&#xD;
      needle biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures at the time of the biopsy visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood collection: Patients have 10 milliliters (2 teaspoons) of blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate massage: Patients have a rectal examination and prostate massage. For the&#xD;
           latter procedure, the physician lightly massages the prostate gland for about 15&#xD;
           seconds. After the massage, the patient provides a urine specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy: A small sample of tumor tissue is removed surgically for examination under the&#xD;
           microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose initial biopsy does not show cancer cells, but who are advised to have a&#xD;
      repeat biopsy in the future will give a blood, urine, and biopsy specimen at the time of the&#xD;
      next biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and undergo surgery to remove the tumor will&#xD;
      have a small sample of tumor tissue set aside for this study to look for substances that may&#xD;
      help predict prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the U.S., screening by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widespread and considered to be&#xD;
      an effective early detection screen for prostate cancer although there are some problems&#xD;
      associated with its use. Only about 30-40% of men with elevated PSA are diagnosed with cancer&#xD;
      on initial biopsy. The other 60-70% are diagnosed with either benign prostatic hyperplasia or&#xD;
      low-or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (LGPIN or HGPIN). Due to their&#xD;
      persistent elevated PSA levels, men undergo repeat biopsies where many are subsequently&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer (the false negative rate for biopsies with pathological diagnoses of&#xD;
      benign or LGPIN has been reported to be 13-19% and for HGPIN from 50-70%). We propose to&#xD;
      conduct a pilot study to evaluate whether (i) the addition of molecular markers (e.g.,&#xD;
      tumor-specific gene methylation of GSTPI, CD44, Annexin II, and Caveolin 1) detectable in&#xD;
      serum and/or urine sediments after prostatic massage can improve the prediction of prostate&#xD;
      cancer and (ii) addition of tumor-specific gene methylation detectable in core-needle biopsy&#xD;
      specimens can improve the sensitivity of core-needle biopsy in the diagnosis of prostate&#xD;
      cancer among patients screened at two Urology clinics located at Howard University,&#xD;
      Washington, DC and Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA. Preliminary studies have shown&#xD;
      detection of hypermethylated genes in urine sediments after prostatic massage in men with&#xD;
      elevated PSA (greater than 4ng/ml) improved the specificity of PSA from 73% to 98%. Further,&#xD;
      DNA hypermethylation of tumor-specific genes was also identified in serum. In our laboratory,&#xD;
      we have developed assays for evaluating DNA hypermethylation of several genes shown to be&#xD;
      important in prostate carcinogenesis. These assays are highly sensitive (able to detect down&#xD;
      to about 20 tumor cells with methylated DNA) and specific (can distinguish methylated from&#xD;
      normal DNA from in a ratio of 1 tumor cell in 10,000 normal cells), and could serve to add&#xD;
      value to current prostate cancer screening modalities.&#xD;
