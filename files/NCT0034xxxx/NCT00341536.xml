    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the potential for health, diet and lifestyle research in Delhi,&#xD;
      Kerala, and Kolkota, India. It will: 1) evaluate the adequacy of the existing infrastructure&#xD;
      for a large-scale epidemiologic investigation and follow-up; 2) obtain a characterization of&#xD;
      the Indian diet; 3) determine study end-points; 4) evaluate the feasibility of collecting and&#xD;
      analyzing biologic samples within India; and 5) evaluate the ability of centers to recruit&#xD;
      subjects and collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indian men and women between 35 and 70 years of age who have resided in the study area&#xD;
      (Delhi, Kerala, or Kolkota) for at least 1 year may be eligible for this study. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Diet and Lifestyle (2 visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires on medical history and treatment practices, including questions on&#xD;
           reproductive history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief medical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body measurements, including height, weight, forearm circumference, thighs, hips,&#xD;
           stomach, skin thickness of the back and triceps (back of the arms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for research, including studies of gene changes that affect the way the body&#xD;
           uses nutrients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of toenail clippings for research tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview about: 1) dietary habits and understanding of the relationship of diet to&#xD;
           health; 2) lifestyle, work, and family health; and 3) moving history (how often subject&#xD;
           has moved in the past 5 years, addresses of past homes, and plans for future moves)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Understanding Diet (6 visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview at each visit about food and drink consumed the day before the interview&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 blood draws&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity monitor. The subject wears a small device placed on the belt or waist&#xD;
           of the pants for a specified time to measure the amount of movement performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: Medical Follow-up Patterns (1 visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Answer questions about medical history, treatment practices, and dietary habits&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer research in developing countries has not received adequate attention in spite of&#xD;
      having great potential to improve our understanding of genes and environmental exposures such&#xD;
      as diet in the etiology of cancer. Specifically, an Indian dietary cohort would substantially&#xD;
      expand the intake range and variety of different foods and lifestyles that have not been&#xD;
      adequately explored, e.g., spices, type of oils, lentils, vegetarianism (tied to religion&#xD;
      rather than healthy life-style ), and types of physical activities. Indians also have&#xD;
      distinct cancer incidence patterns. Establishing a cohort will allow us to study multiple&#xD;
      cancer outcomes as well as other disease end-points (e.g., cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      diabetes), and it will avoid potential bias resulting from differential recall of past diet&#xD;
      by subjects, a critical concern in case-control studies that assess nutritional intake. As&#xD;
      measurement of various biological markers will be an integral component of this study, it&#xD;
      will be important to collect biological specimens prior to illness and treatment. This is&#xD;
      particularly important in India as cases may present with late stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because a study of this magnitude and complexity has not been carried out in India, I have&#xD;
      proposed a pilot study to determine the feasibility of conducting a large cohort study in&#xD;
      India. The pilot study consists of three parts: 1) evaluation of logistical issues; 2)&#xD;
      characterization of the diet; and 3) evaluation of issues related to follow-up and end-point&#xD;
      ascertainment. In Part A of this pilot study there will be 4,000 subjects. This part of the&#xD;
      study will be evaluated for logistical issues, including questionnaire administration,&#xD;
      collection, storage, and analysis. Response rates for questionnaires, collection of&#xD;
      biospecimens and the centers ability to carry out the proposed research will be evaluated as&#xD;
      well. Part B of the pilot study consists of a characterization of Indian diet to determine&#xD;
      within- and between-person variability in intake in a subset of 1,400 subjects; an evaluation&#xD;
      to determine whether Indians can estimate food quantities accurately; assess the degree of&#xD;
      measurement error in selected nutrients; and ascertain whether using multiple forms of intake&#xD;
      instruments in combination with biomarkers may categorize intake with less error. In Part C&#xD;
      of the pilot study, issues related to follow-up and end-point ascertainment in 1200 subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated. In addition, an evaluation of the likelihood of cancers and other chronic&#xD;
      diseases remaining completely undiagnosed owning to lack of access to health care; assess&#xD;
      movement pattern and traceability of Indian populations; as well as an evaluation of the&#xD;
      cancer registry coverage and determine whether supplementary activities are required.&#xD;

&#xD;
        We will exclude persons with any physical ailments preventing them from study&#xD;
        participation, and with recent chronic or other serious diseases or conditions that have&#xD;
        made them alter their diet. This is likely to include cancer as well as cardiovascular&#xD;
        disease or diabetes and also some infectious conditions.&#xD;
