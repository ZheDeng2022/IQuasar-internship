  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine DNA from cancer patients previously treated with Gleevec to look for&#xD;
      a variation (mutation) of the ABCG2 gene that may render the drug less effective in certain&#xD;
      patients. Gleevec is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors.&#xD;
      Although most patients respond to treatment, many with advanced disease develop resistance to&#xD;
      the drug. It is thought that in some patients this resistance results from the action of a&#xD;
      protein that causes Gleevec to be pumped out of the cells, reducing its usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in clinical trials of Gleevec at the National Cancer Institute and at other&#xD;
      participating institutions are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA from patients' blood samples are analyzed for the ABCG2 gene and correlated with clinical&#xD;
      data, such as the patient's age, race, disease state, weight, height, and body surface area.&#xD;
      It will also look at the drug dose, how often the drug is given, the duration of treatment,&#xD;
      side effects and other medications taken.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ABCG2, also known as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), is an ATP-binding cassette&#xD;
      (ABC) transporter that has been shown to confer resistance to several drugs, including&#xD;
      mitoxantrone and topotecan. Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) has recently been identified as a&#xD;
      substrate for ABCG2. The expression of ABCG2 in the human jejunum has been shown to be higher&#xD;
      than expression MDR1, which encodes for P-glycoprotein. Therefore, it is plausible that the&#xD;
      oral bioavailability of Gleevec could be dependent on the extent of transport. A single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism (C421A) has been identified in ABCG2 and has been shown in vitro to&#xD;
      result in functional inactivation of this transporter protein. In this study, the&#xD;
      relationship between the genotypes of ABCG2 and the pharmacokinetics or side effects will be&#xD;
      retrospectively explored in patients with cancer who had been previously enrolled on clinical&#xD;
      trials of Gleevec.&#xD;
