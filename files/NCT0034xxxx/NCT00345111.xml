  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the research on the Restore Intra Ocular Lens Implant (IOL) is to determine&#xD;
      the clinical visual outcomes following bilateral implantation of the IOL compared to a&#xD;
      control IOL and to demonstrate what percentage of the subjects obtain spectacle freedom.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Acusof Restor IOL has recently been FDA approved. This research will be an indicator by&#xD;
      comparison to a conventional implant lens used for catract surgery. The standard of care for&#xD;
      cataract surgery is to implant an IOL to allow the patient distant vision only. As a result,&#xD;
      the patient is forced to wear reading glasses or magnifying glasses for near work. With the&#xD;
      Restore IOL implant, the patient will have the ability to be corrected for not only distance&#xD;
      vision but for near and intermediate visual needs. With FDA approval, the statistical&#xD;
      indications demonstate 80% of patients tested in clinical trials did not have the need for&#xD;
      use of glasses after cataract surgery. This research will further confirm and quantify the&#xD;
      data already submitted by comparing the control group with the Restore Group in this Phase IV&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group of subjects will be patients who have already had cataract surgery in both&#xD;
      eyes approximately 6 months prior to entering the study. These individuals will be tested&#xD;
      only for the 6 month evaluation in both eyes, including the following tests (manifest&#xD;
      refraction, which determines the best vision correction possible, the near, intermediate and&#xD;
      distant visual acuity will be assessed at the respective ranges of distance. contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity will be determined by choosing the circles that have lines in them opposed to the&#xD;
      ones that don't (further assessing visual acuity), stereopsis which indicates whether both&#xD;
      eyes are functioning together, pupilometry which measures the pupil diameter, the life style&#xD;
      questionaire and the life style vision evaluation form as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Restore IOl group of subjects' post operative visual acuity data will be compared to the&#xD;
      control subjects' post operative visual data results at the distance, near, and intermediate&#xD;
      ranges, as well as all the other testing required at the sixxth month time frame listed&#xD;
      above. The testing will require approximately 2 hours for the 6 month visit for both control&#xD;
      and Restore groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Restore group of subjects will have 4 other visits. The pre operative visit will take&#xD;
      avout 2 hours and include the following tests: Manifest refraction, near, inermediate, and&#xD;
      distance visual acuity testing, life style questionnaire, and obtaining informed consent. The&#xD;
      1 week and 1 month post-operative visit will include manifest refraction, near, intermediate,&#xD;
      and distance visual acuity assessment.&#xD;
