      The purpose of this study is to collect plasma by apheresis from patients who have recovered&#xD;
      from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This plasma will be processed into a&#xD;
      SARS-antibody enriched intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) product. This product will then be&#xD;
      available for use in a clinical trial if a SARS epidemic recurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible participants are people between 18 and 56 years of age who have&#xD;
      recovered from SARS. Potential participants will undergo three sequential screenings to&#xD;
      determine their eligibility for this study. Eligible participants will then be scheduled for&#xD;
      plasmapheresis. After apheresis, additional testing will be performed on a sample of the&#xD;
      source plasma. Once the sample has been tested and cleared, the source plasma will be shipped&#xD;
      to the United States to the storage facility and finally to the site of manufacturing of the&#xD;
      IVIG product. Participants may donate plasma again after 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, participation may help&#xD;
      develop a treatment that could be useful to other people who become infected with SARS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beginning in February 2003, there was an outbreak with a novel coronavirus causing an&#xD;
      atypical pneumonia, subsequently referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).&#xD;
      This syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate and has no proven treatment. There is,&#xD;
      however, some evidence that treatment with convalescent plasma was beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to collect plasma by apheresis from patients that&#xD;
      recovered from SARS, and process this plasma into a high titer anti-SARS intravenous immune&#xD;
      globulin (IVIG). This will be a collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Cangene Corporation has been&#xD;
      contracted to manufacture the collected plasma in the United States (U.S.) into an IVIG&#xD;
      product, which can then be used for pre-clinical efficacy studies under an IND in a clinical&#xD;
      trial if SARS recurs. It is intended that the treatment trial would be conducted in Hong Kong&#xD;
      and/or the U.S., as well as any other place the disease recurs.&#xD;
