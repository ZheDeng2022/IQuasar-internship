  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what kinds of breast tumors will respond to lapatinib.&#xD;
      Lapatinib is an experimental medicine which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically-confirmed by either core or fine needle biopsy primary&#xD;
             invasive carcinoma of the breast;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AJCC T2-T3 disease (&gt;2.0 cm without chest wall or skin invasion) by at least one&#xD;
             imaging modality (either mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI) - entry criteria is based on&#xD;
             radiologic staging and not final pathologic staging;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky ≥ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any lymph node status, hormone receptor status, and level of erbB2 expression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation therapy to the affected breast&#xD;
             for current or previous malignancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &gt;50% or within the institutional range of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function defined as: Leukocyte count&#xD;
             &gt;3000/uL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, and&#xD;
             hemoglobin ≥ 8 gm/dl; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN, or 24-hour creatinine&#xD;
             clearance ≥ 75 cc/min; Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN; SGOT ≤ 2.5 times ULN; alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase ≤ 2.5 ULN times ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of lapatinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she must inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AJCC T1, T4, or stage 4 disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have undergone incisional or excisional biopsy of their tumor;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute contraindication to MRI imaging (cardiac pacemaker or any non-removable&#xD;
             metallic foreign object in the body);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On chronic therapy with any known inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because lapatinib is a&#xD;
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
