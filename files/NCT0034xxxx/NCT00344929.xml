      Hypothesis A &quot;multifaceted&quot; intervention program aimed at increasing the responsiveness of&#xD;
      care givers, the adequacy of care provided, and the efficacy of organisation of care, in&#xD;
      presence of abnormal blood loss in the immediate post partum has more impact on the incidence&#xD;
      of severe PPH and on the costs of care than the current methods of dissemination of clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Intervention group. The intervention includes three components: (1) outreach&#xD;
      visits with local presentation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for management&#xD;
      of PPH, and discussion of their applicability in the context of local organisation; (2)&#xD;
      during these educational visits, reminders - check list, &quot;PPH emergency case&quot; containing&#xD;
      appropriate materials - to be used in case of PPH, will be proposed; (3) finally, cases of&#xD;
      severe PPH will be reviewed during peer review sessions organized in each participating unit,&#xD;
      to help identifying weaknesses in care provided, and needs for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group. The proposed guidelines for management of PPH will be disseminated through the&#xD;
      participating perinatal networks; then each unit will be free to implement them at its own&#xD;
      convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation procedure The trial follows a cluster randomised trial design. Randomisation of&#xD;
      maternity units will be stratified by region, status (public versus private) and size (annual&#xD;
      number of deliveries). The stratified design will guarantee the comparability of the two arms&#xD;
      of the trial at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The primary outcome is the incidence of severe PPH (number of severe PPH to&#xD;
      number of deliveries). A severe PPH is defined as a PPH that was associated with one or more&#xD;
      of the following: peripartum haemoglobin drop greater than 4g/dl, blood transfusion, arterial&#xD;
      embolisation, surgical procedures such as hysterectomy or arterial ligation, transfer of the&#xD;
      mother to intensive care unit, maternal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include the cost of care and the cost/efficacy ratio, and the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse effects of uterotonic drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Post partum haemorrhage (PPH) is estimated to occur in 5 to 10% of deliveries. In&#xD;
      France this represents about 39 000 to 78 000 cases yearly, among which, 10 to 20% are life&#xD;
      threatening events for the mothers. Moreover, PPH remains the leading cause of maternal&#xD;
      mortality in France, contributing to a greater proportion of maternal deaths than in other&#xD;
      comparable European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Committee on Maternal Mortality, more than 80% of deaths due to PPH&#xD;
      are &quot; avoidable &quot; deaths, involving unrecognised diagnosis, delay in providing care and&#xD;
      underestimation of the severity of blood spoliation. These factors suggest weaknesses in the&#xD;
      capacity for providing adequate care in presence of PPH, and they seem to be related to the&#xD;
      organisation of care inside the maternity units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, although some specific clinical interventions have proved efficient in&#xD;
      decreasing postpartum blood loss, thus resulting in recent national and international&#xD;
      recommendations for management of PPH, integration of these guidelines into clinical practice&#xD;
      still is to be achieved (preliminary unpublished results from a survey conducted in maternity&#xD;
      units in France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available literature related to various health issues shows that the use of enhanced methods&#xD;
      for dissemination of clinical practice guidelines can improve the translation of these&#xD;
      guidelines into practice. Therefore, an intervention combining several enhanced dissemination&#xD;
      methods may help improving the actual management of PPH cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the proposed intervention will be evaluated through a randomised trial. The&#xD;
      target of the intervention is, in a given maternity unit, the entire group of health&#xD;
      professionals involved in delivery care. Therefore, the unit of randomisation will be the&#xD;
      maternity unit.&#xD;

      Secondary outcomes include the cost of care and the cost/efficacy ratio, and the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse effects of uterotonic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients required Estimation of the intracluster correlation coefficient: Since no&#xD;
      estimation of this parameter was available in the literature, we based our estimation on&#xD;
      results of an unpublished survey providing data on declared incidence of severe PPH in&#xD;
      maternity units. Based on these results, the intracluster correlation coefficient is&#xD;
      estimated to be 0.006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an incidence of 1% for the primary outcome, and in order to detect a decrease to&#xD;
      0.6% (40% relative decrease), with 80% power, and 5% risk, and taking into account the&#xD;
      average number of deliveries per unit and the estimated intracluster correlation, the&#xD;
      required sample size is 58 945 deliveries by group and 117890 in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 participating perinatal networks include 133 maternity units, performing 133 000&#xD;
      deliveries annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria For maternity units All maternity units belonging to one of the six&#xD;
      perinatal networks of the study are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women All women delivering at a gestational age greater than 22 weeks, in one of the&#xD;
      participating maternity unit during the study period, will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial process Recruitment All maternity units pertaining to one of the 6 perinatal networks&#xD;
      will be invited to participate. The trial protocol will be presented to obstetricians,&#xD;
      anaesthetists and midwives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent A written consent will be obtained from the head of the obstetrics department and&#xD;
      from the administrative director of each unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention In each participating perinatal network, a team pairing an obstetrician and a&#xD;
      midwife will be in charge of the intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start date: March 2005 Expected complete date: December 2007&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Baseline data: The comparability of the two arms of the trial will be&#xD;
      evaluated through data collected at the maternity unit level, including characteristics and&#xD;
      resources of the unit, and characteristics of the women delivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention data: Evaluation of the impact of the intervention on clinical practice&#xD;
      related to PPH management will be based on individual data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What ? Detailed information on components of care provided during labour, delivery and&#xD;
      immediate post partum, related to prevention and management of PPH, collected in individual&#xD;
      cases of PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When collected ? Data collection will begin 3 months after the outreach visits, and will&#xD;
      include all incident cases of PPH during one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How and by who ? Cases of PPH will be identified prospectively, according to the following&#xD;
      definition:1) for a vaginal delivery, PPH is defined as an abnormal bleeding diagnosed within&#xD;
      the 24 hours postpartum, which requires uterine revision or manual delivery of placenta, and&#xD;
      /or resulting from vaginal or cervical tears, including haemorrhagic episiotomy; for a C&#xD;
      section delivery, PPH is defined as an abnormal bleeding diagnosed by the team in charge; or&#xD;
      2) a peripartum haemoglobin drop greater than 2gr/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPH cases will be identified by the care providers and notified to the trial research&#xD;
      assistant who will collect individual information from obstetrical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data Evaluation of the impact of the intervention on the incidence of severe PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What ? Incident cases of severe PPH (see definition above) will be identified as a subgroup&#xD;
      of incident cases of PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When collected ? Data collection will begin 3 months after the outreach visits, and will&#xD;
      include all incident cases of severe PPH during one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How and by who ? See above.&#xD;
