  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, exposure-registration and follow-up study of women and&#xD;
      their offspring exposed to Keppra® (levetiracetam) and Keppra XR® at the time of conception&#xD;
      (i.e., any time from the first day of the last menstrual period) and/or during pregnancy. The&#xD;
      UCB AED Pregnancy Registry is designed to monitor pregnancies exposed to Keppra® and Keppra&#xD;
      XR® in order to determine if there is a potential increase in the risk of major birth defects&#xD;
      compared to rates from women in the general US population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the UCB AED Pregnancy Registry are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively collect data concerning 1) exposure to Keppra® and Keppra XR® during&#xD;
           pregnancy, 2) potential confounding factors, 3) outcome of pregnancy, and 4) long-term&#xD;
           pediatric outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To review reported cases of possible birth defects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the risk of birth defects occurring in live-born offspring of women exposed&#xD;
           to Keppra® and Keppra XR® during pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted in the United States (US). Enrollment in the Registry is&#xD;
      voluntary. The UCB AED Pregnancy Registry is sponsored by UCB, Inc. and is managed by INC&#xD;
      Research. The scientific conduct and analysis of the Registry is overseen by an Expert Panel&#xD;
      consisting of external specialists in teratology/genetics, epidemiology, maternal and fetal&#xD;
      medicine, and neurology (external member details available upon request).&#xD;
