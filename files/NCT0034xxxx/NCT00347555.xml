  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is an illness caused by a parasite (an animal or plant that lives in or on a host)&#xD;
      that enters the human body through the bite of an infected mosquito. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to find out about the safety of an experimental malaria vaccine and whether the&#xD;
      vaccine causes humans to produce antibodies (proteins made by the body's immune system to&#xD;
      help control or prevent infection). Four strengths of the vaccine will be tested. The lowest&#xD;
      strength of the vaccine will be tested before the next higher strength is tested. Each dosage&#xD;
      (shot) of vaccine will be given to 18 people in 4 dosage groups on Day 0, at 1 month and at 6&#xD;
      months. Two people in each dosage group will receive injections of a placebo (contains no&#xD;
      medication). Participants will include 80 healthy adults between 18 and 40 years of age.&#xD;
      Multiple blood draws will occur over the duration of the study. Participants will be involved&#xD;
      in study related procedures for approximately 13 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dosage-escalation study of the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of EBA-175 RII-NG malaria vaccine administered intramuscularly. The&#xD;
      vaccine is a recombinant Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 kDa&#xD;
      Region II-nonglycosylated (EBA-175 RII-NG) adsorbed to aluminum phosphate adjuvant. The study&#xD;
      is being conducted at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. Eighty healthy subjects,&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 and 40 years, males and females, will be recruited from Houston,&#xD;
      Texas, and will participate in the study for approximately 13 months. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive 3 doses of the vaccine or saline placebo by the intramuscular route in&#xD;
      a 9:1 ratio at 0, 1 and 6 months. The safety and immunogenicity of ascending dosages of the&#xD;
      vaccine will be assessed. Eighteen subjects will receive vaccine at each of the following&#xD;
      dosage levels: 5, 20, 80 and 160 micrograms. Two subjects will receive placebo for each&#xD;
      dosage level. Dosage escalation will proceed only after review of the 2-week safety data of&#xD;
      the 2 initial doses of the prior dosage level. The primary study objective is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and reactogenicity (tolerability) of ascending dosages of EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine among&#xD;
      healthy subjects given in 3 intramuscular doses at 0, 1 and 6 months. The secondary study&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine by measuring&#xD;
      anti-EBA-175 RII-NG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), anti-parasite&#xD;
      antibodies by indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT), inhibition of binding of EBA-175&#xD;
      RII-NG to red blood cells (RBCs), and inhibition of Pf growth in vitro.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willingness to comply with protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent before any protocol procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability for follow up for 12 months after the first immunization dose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Regular use of medications other than vitamins and contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent (within the last 4 weeks) treatment with parenteral, inhaled, or&#xD;

             jeopardize the safety or rights of a subject participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy, including hematologic and skin cancers, or known&#xD;
             immunodeficiency syndrome.&#xD;
