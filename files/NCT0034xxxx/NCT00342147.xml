  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare tumor among Caucasians which occurs with high incidence&#xD;
      among individuals of Chinese descent. The disease is believed to have a multifactorial&#xD;
      etiology with genetic, viral, and other environmental factors being involved. Little is&#xD;
      known, however, about the genetic component of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently completed subject recruitment for a case-control study of NPC in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Using information obtained from the NPC cases recruited into this NCI-sponsored case-control&#xD;
      study as well as from a parallel cross-sectional study conducted by our Taiwanese&#xD;
      collaborators, we have been able to identify 120-150 families with multiple family members&#xD;
      affected with NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study described herein is to determine the role of inherited genetic&#xD;
      factors in the etiology of NPC and to examine the effect of these genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      factors on risk associated with environmental exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will initially be contacted via the proband who previously participated in our&#xD;
      case-control and cross-sectional studies. Subsequently, informative family members will be&#xD;
      asked to visit the study clinic to participate in the study. A family history questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to the proband from each of the families selected for study. In&#xD;
      addition, a risk factor questionnaire will be administered to all participating family&#xD;
      members, and 30-40 ml of blood and an oral sample will be obtained from each study&#xD;
      participant. Additional study components include medical record review to verify the&#xD;
      diagnosis of NPC, retrieval of tumor tissue blocks as a source of DNA for study, and clinical&#xD;
      exams on a sample of unaffected individuals to exclude the possibility of prevalent,&#xD;
      undetected disease among family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral and laryngeal cancer families will also be recruited in a manner similar to that&#xD;
      described for NPC families, in an attempt to elucidate genetic factors linked to the&#xD;
      development of these two cancers....&#xD;
