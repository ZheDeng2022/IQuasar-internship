  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extreme magnesium deficiency is known to have an impact on the synthesis, secretion and/or&#xD;
      action of calcium regulating hormones. Many older adults are at risk for less severe&#xD;
      magnesium deficiency, since the majority of adults receive less than the Recommended Daily&#xD;
      Allowance of magnesium. We hypothesize that magnesium supplementation will have a beneficial&#xD;
      effect on calcium regulating hormones and markers of bone turnover.&#xD;

      This is a 12 month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of magnesium&#xD;
      supplementation. Our hypothesis was that magnesium supplementation would decrease bone&#xD;
      turnover markers and alter calcium-regulating hormones: parathyroid hormone and 1, 25&#xD;
      dihydroxyvitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female adults over 55 without with a T-score at the hip above -2 are randomized to&#xD;
      magnesium 250 mg BID or identical placebo BID. At baseline, all participants had a bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) by DXA scan at the hip and spine, blood biomarkers of bone resorption&#xD;
      and formation, and calcium regulating hormones. Participants were followed for 12 months,&#xD;
      with repeat measurement of calcium regulating hormones and bone turnover markers.&#xD;
