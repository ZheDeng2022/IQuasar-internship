  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) affects older Americans and can lead to irreversible&#xD;
      blindness. Although the cause if ARMD is unclear, it appears to be a condition that is&#xD;
      affected by both genetic and environmental influences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine an Amish community to investigate genetic factors in&#xD;
      the development of ARMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be 1,000 members, ages 50 and older, of the Old Order Amish community&#xD;
      in Lancaster and Franklin counties in Pennsylvania. Each will undergo a 30-minute dilated eye&#xD;
      exam during which an ophthalmologist or optometrist will take digital images of the macula&#xD;
      and optic disc. Depending on the results of their eye exam, participants may be asked to give&#xD;
      a blood sample as well. They will also complete a brief questionnaire about personal exposure&#xD;
      related to occupation, sunlight and smoking.&#xD;

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment in the United&#xD;
      States. Available evidence suggests that AMD is a complex disorder with a significant genetic&#xD;
      component as well as potential environmental influences. In this study we propose to examine&#xD;
      3,000 members, ages 50 and older, of the Old Order Amish community in the Lancaster and&#xD;
      Franklin counties area in Pennsylvania. We plan to detail the epidemiology of AMD in this&#xD;
      population isolate in attempt to elucidate genetic factors which may confer susceptibility&#xD;
      and predispose some Amish individuals and their families to develop AMD. All study&#xD;
      participants agreeing to enroll and providing informed consent will undergo a complete,&#xD;
      dilated eye examination during which digital stereo images of the macula and optic disc&#xD;
      regions will be acquired. Study participants will also be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire inquiring about personal exposures related to occupation, sunlight, and&#xD;
      smoking. AMD will be determined by an independent reading of the digital fundus photographs&#xD;
      by the University of Wisconsin Fundus Photography Reading Center according to the AREDS AMD&#xD;
      classification scheme. We will employ standard statistical genetics methods of parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric linkage analysis, association analysis, and transmission disequilibrium tests,&#xD;
      with allowances for environmental (i.e. non-genetic) factors to determine if we can identify&#xD;
      any candidate regions or candidate genes that predispose Amish individuals to an increased&#xD;
      risk of AMD. Ultimately, we hope to follow up any regions that show suggestive evidence of&#xD;
      linkage on the genome-wide scan with fine mapping in those regions, leading to eventual&#xD;
      cloning and sequencing of a gene or genes.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Amish individuals, ages 50 and older, who either respond in the affirmative to the&#xD;
        letter of invitation or are self-referred to the Amish clinic for participation in the AMD&#xD;
        study, will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who decline participation, who are unwilling to sign the Consent Form, and who&#xD;
        are not recognized by the Amish as being Amish will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
