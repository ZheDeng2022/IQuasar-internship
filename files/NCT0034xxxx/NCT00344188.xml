  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the natural history of Leishmanial infections and their treatments.&#xD;
      It will provide an opportunity for NIAID staff to learn more about leishmaniasis and perhaps&#xD;
      to improve diagnostic tests for these infections. Patients between 2 and 80 years of age with&#xD;
      known or suspected leishmaniasis are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have routine blood tests and a biopsy to confirm leishmanial infection. The&#xD;
      biopsy procedure will be determined by the type of infection local cutaneous leishmaniasis&#xD;
      (LCL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) or visceral leishmaniasis (VL). CL will be confirmed&#xD;
      with a punch biopsy, in which a cookie-cutter type razor is used to remove a small circular&#xD;
      piece of skin tissue. MCL will be confirmed using a thin flexible tube inserted into the&#xD;
      nose. This tube is used to examine the nose and upper airway and to remove a tissue sample,&#xD;
      if an affected area is seen. VL will be confirmed with either a bone marrow or liver biopsy&#xD;
      or a splenic aspirate. For these procedures, a small tissue sample is withdrawn through a&#xD;
      needle placed in the hipbone, liver or spleen, respectively. Some patients may also have a&#xD;
      skin test for leishmaniasis similar to tuberculin skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and length of hospital stay are determined by the type of infection. CL may be&#xD;
      treated with Pentostam, amphotericin, amphotericin B, itraconazole or ketoconazole; ML with&#xD;
      amphotericin B, or encapsulated amphotericin; and VL with Pentostam or encapsulated&#xD;
      amphotericin. Pentostam is infused daily for 18 to 28 doses, most as an outpatient. Blood is&#xD;
      drawn 3 times a week for safety tests and an electrocardiogram is done 2 to 3 times a week to&#xD;
      monitor heart rhythm. Amphotericin B is infused every day or every other day for about 30&#xD;
      doses, all on an inpatient basis. Patients undergo hydration (infusion of a large amount of&#xD;
      fluid) just before and immediately after each infusion to protect the kidneys. Blood is drawn&#xD;
      every other day and urine samples are collected occasionally for routine urinalysis.&#xD;
      Encapsulated amphotericin is infused every other day, on an outpatient basis. Blood is&#xD;
      generally drawn every other day to every 2 days and urinalyses are done periodically.&#xD;
      Itraconazole and ketoconazole are taken orally for at least 1 to 3 months, with blood drawn&#xD;
      every 2 to 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be asked to have photographs taken before, during and after treatment to&#xD;
      document progress. They may also be asked to provide extra blood samples for research&#xD;
      purposes, either through a vein in the arm or through apheresis, a method for collecting&#xD;
      large numbers of cells. For apheresis, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm&#xD;
      vein and circulated through a machine that separates it into its components. The desired&#xD;
      cells are then removed, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the&#xD;
      same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis will have a follow-up clinic visit 2 weeks to 3 months&#xD;
      after treatment is completed. If there are no complications, their participation will end at&#xD;
      that time. Patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis will be&#xD;
      followed every 3 to 6 months indefinitely for routine evaluations and re-treatment if the&#xD;
      infection recurs.&#xD;

      Patients admitted on this protocol will have, or be suspected of having, a Leishmania&#xD;
      infection. The major objectives of the protocol are to diagnose and classify the Leishmania&#xD;
      infection and to provide species-based therapy to study the natural history of the treated&#xD;
      infection. As part of the standard evaluation of these patients, infecting parasite isolates&#xD;
      will be obtained when possible and the host response before and after therapy will be&#xD;
      assessed to address broader questions related to diagnosis, disease pathogenesis and response&#xD;
      to therapy. Careful observations of the patients' clinical and immunologic responses to&#xD;
      therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up of these changes. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      the patients will receive optimal clinical care for their infections and that the specimens&#xD;
      collected from them will prove to be valuable reagents for the laboratory studies of the host&#xD;
      responses unique to leishmanial infections.&#xD;
