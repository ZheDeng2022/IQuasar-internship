    <textblock>
      We will test whether robot driven, goal directed, trajectory corrected exercise enhances&#xD;
      motor outcome in the upper limb of stroke patients better than matched motor activity on an&#xD;
      upper body ergometer (monark).&#xD;

      Upper extremity (UE) weakness post-stroke occurs in 70-80% of patients. By 3 months this&#xD;
      complaint persists in 40% of patients, and by 6 months this complaint persists in a similar&#xD;
      percentage of patients (1). Greater improvement in motor functional recovery was achieved in&#xD;
      patients with intact sensation. Shoulder pain persisted in 20% of patients (2). Most of the&#xD;
      arm recovery occurs in the initial 3 months post-stroke (2,3,4). The Copenhagen stroke study&#xD;
      found 79% of patients with mild UE paresis achieving functional motor recovery compared to&#xD;
      18% of patients with severe UE paresis (4). Katrak P et al. found early shoulder shrug and&#xD;
      synergistic hand movements to be useful bedside predictors of functional motor recovery of&#xD;
      the UE (5). The initial grade of paresis (measured on admission in the hospital) is the most&#xD;
      important predictor of motor recovery after stroke, with initial paralysis implying the worst&#xD;
      prognosis for subsequent motor recovery (6). Perceptual inattention does impact upon UE&#xD;
      action and functional recovery (7). The UE weakness and functional motor recovery lags behind&#xD;
      lower extremity (LE) weakness and functional motor recovery because of the complexity of&#xD;
      motor skills needed for daily living tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the persistence of upper extremity weakness, different rehabilitation techniques such&#xD;
      as Constraint Induced (CI) (8,9,10) and robotic (11,12,13) therapies were developed to help&#xD;
      with meaningful functional motor recovery in the paretic arm (unilateral arm training). Both&#xD;
      of these forced-use interventions focus on the paretic arm only. The main drawback of the CI&#xD;
      therapy is that subjects need to have some degree of voluntary movement both at the wrist and&#xD;
      the digits. Bilateral arm training with rhythmic clueing (BATRAC) has been used in chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients and has been found to improve functional motor performance in the paretic UE&#xD;
      (14). The authors in a recent paper showed BATRAC inducing reorganization in contraleisonal&#xD;
      motor networks based on functional MRI (15). Facilitation of paretic arm movement by the&#xD;
      non-paretic arm (bimanual movement) is thought to be superior to individual paretic arm&#xD;
      movement, which indicates both arms to be a coordinated brain unit (16). Richards L et al.,&#xD;
      in their review article (17) and Vander Lee J et al., in their meta-analysis of randomized&#xD;
      stroke trials (18) on therapeutic interventions to improve UE function, found extensive&#xD;
      practice to be the most important factor irrespective of the type of intervention instituted.&#xD;
      Early repetitive sensorimotor stimulation of the arm results in long-lasting functional motor&#xD;
      recovery (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether bilateral arm training with upper body&#xD;
      ergometer is as or more effective in upper extremity functional recovery than unilateral arm&#xD;
      training with robot in patients with a recent ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.&#xD;
