  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) developed a&#xD;
      Community-Directed Treatment (COMDT) approach, which has been adopted in the control of&#xD;
      onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. WHO has recommended the use of COMDT approach in the&#xD;
      control of schistosomiasis and STH infections. The COMDT approach has been compared with the&#xD;
      school based programmes in certain African countries,but not with the health-facility based&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be implemented in Mazabuka district of Zambia where COMDT approach will be&#xD;
      implemented in the catchment area of Rural Health Centres (RHC) as a supplement to the&#xD;
      health-facility-based approach. After each round of treatmenttreatment coverage and factors&#xD;
      responsible for the treatment coverage will be measured in both areas. The health impact of&#xD;
      the health facility based approach with and without the COMDT approach will be compared. The&#xD;
      effect of the COMDT as a control approach of STH infections will be monitored on infections&#xD;
      in the community of children aged 12 to 59 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are of public health importance and widespread in&#xD;
      large part of the world, particularly in the poorest sections of the populations residing in&#xD;
      the least developed countries. The infections can be controlled by several measures, but&#xD;
      currently delivering anthelminthic drugs through schools and health centres is believed to be&#xD;
      the most effective as it takes advantage of existing infrastructure. In Zambia, anthelminthic&#xD;
      drugs are delivered to children aged 12 to 59 months twice a year through health facilities&#xD;
      during the child health promotion week. However, it has been observed that treatment coverage&#xD;
      is low in certain areas. Therefore, there is a need to identify the factors associated with&#xD;
      the treatment coverage patterns, and to provide evidence of an effective intervention&#xD;
      approach that could increase the proportion of children receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) developed a&#xD;
      Community-Directed Treatment (COMDT) approach, which has been adopted in the control of&#xD;
      onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. WHO has recommended the use of COMDT approach in the&#xD;
      control of schistosomiasis and STH infections. The COMDT approach has been compared with the&#xD;
      school based programmes in certain African countries, but has never been used in Zambia and&#xD;
      never been compared with the health-facility based approach in the control of these&#xD;
      infections in children below school age. It is against this background that this project is&#xD;
      being proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be implemented in Mazabuka district of Zambia. Two Rural Health Centres&#xD;
      (RHCs) will be selected in the district and mapped for treatment coverage of the&#xD;
      health-facility based approach. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted with community members to explore the reasons for existing treatment coverage of&#xD;
      the health facility approach. The COMDT approach will then be implemented in the catchment&#xD;
      area of one of the RHCs as a supplement to the health-facility-based approach. After each&#xD;
      round of treatment, coverage and factors influencing coverage will be measured in both areas.&#xD;
      The health impact of the health facility based approach with and without the COMDT approach&#xD;
      will be compared. Parameters for health impact will be child growth, prevalence and intensity&#xD;
      of STH infections and number of illness episodes requiring treatment. The effect of the COMDT&#xD;
      as a control approach of STH infections will be monitored on infections in the community of&#xD;
      children aged 12 to 59 months, and the appropriateness of the approach will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control grading system. The whole project is&#xD;
      expected to take 3 years.&#xD;
