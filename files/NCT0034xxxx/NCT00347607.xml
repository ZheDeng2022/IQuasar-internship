      After single, yearly, mass treatment of communities with azithromycin for active trachoma,&#xD;
      what is the added effectiveness for reduction of trachoma and ocular C. trachomatis infection&#xD;
      at one, two, and three years, relative to the added costs, of community-based surveillance&#xD;
      and treatment of cases of severe trachoma (TI) semi-annually or every 4 months?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An important component of a trachoma control program is the effective use of antibiotics,&#xD;
      particularly azithromycin, to reduce the pool of chlamydial ocular infection in the&#xD;
      communities. A reduction in the pool of infection will reduce the likelihood of transmission&#xD;
      and, coupled with effective hygiene and environmental changes, theoretically lead to&#xD;
      reduction in disease to the point where active trachoma is no longer a public health problem.&#xD;
      Our previous experience with the use of azithromycin for community treatment has shown that&#xD;
      even with high rates of coverage, hyperendemic communities will start to experience&#xD;
      re-emergent trachoma following treatment by one year. Therefore, it is urgent to determine if&#xD;
      there is another treatment strategy for these villages to keep the pool of infection low, and&#xD;
      eventually eliminated.A combination approach consisting of mass treatment at yearly intervals&#xD;
      and surveillance with a targeted treatment approach in the interim period may be effective in&#xD;
      maintaining the low rate of re-emergent disease.We propose to test the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      three alternative strategies for the frequency of provision of azithromycin, in the context&#xD;
      of the Tanzanian National Trachoma Control Program. The strategies have been developed to&#xD;
      build on the epidemiological knowledge of trachoma in this area, to be locally appropriate in&#xD;
      terms of feasibility and personnel, and to be consistent with the goal of enhancing community&#xD;
      control of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of nine villages in the Kongwa district of Tanzania will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      three groups (a total of three villages per group). The nine villages, with active trachoma&#xD;
      rates in pre-school children of 50% or greater, would be slated for enrollment in the&#xD;
      National Program, but not currently receiving treatment. Surveys for active trachoma status&#xD;
      would be carried out in 300 randomly selected, children ages 1-7 years (pre-school)in each&#xD;
      village at baseline, at 6 months post mass treatment, and at one, two, and three years post&#xD;
      baseline. The following treatment strategies will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control villages: Usual practice: The three villages randomized to this arm would receive&#xD;
      mass treatment of the community once a year as part of the Tanzania National Trachoma Control&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 1. Usual practice plus community surveillance for TI cases and treatment at 6&#xD;
      months: The three villages randomized to this arm would receive mass treatment, similar to&#xD;
      the usual practice arm, but in addition, would have a cadre of community volunteers, trained&#xD;
      to recognize TI. They will screen their neighborhoods, examining all pre-school children and&#xD;
      mothers, and arrange with the health worker for another round of treatment for TI cases and&#xD;
      their families at 6 months, and 18 months post baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 2: Usual practice plus community surveillance for TI cases and treatment every 4&#xD;
      months: The three villages randomized to this arm would have an approach identical to&#xD;
      intervention 1, but with surveillance and treatment of TI cases at 4 and 8 months instead of&#xD;
      at 6 months.For the second year, they would have surveillance and treatment at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost data on the community surveillance and treatment program will be collected throughout&#xD;
      the first year. Analyses will focus on the additional benefit on reduction in prevalence of&#xD;
      trachoma, and ocular C. trachomatis infection, at one, two, and three years of the two&#xD;
      alternative strategies, relative to yearly mass treatment alone, and the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of the three strategies.&#xD;
