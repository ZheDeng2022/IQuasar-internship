      This study will explore the influence of social and environmental factors, such as stress,&#xD;
      nutrition, health status, etc., on women's reproductive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Married Mayan women 16-42 years of age who live in the rural highlands of Guatemala and who&#xD;
      have given birth to at least one child are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are interviewed about their demographic, social, family, personal, health,&#xD;
      reproductive and economic situations. They have saliva and urine samples collected three&#xD;
      times a week for up to 1 year. Their nutritional and health status is assessed monthly.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Objectives: To explore the influence that social and environmental factors have&#xD;
      on women's reproductive function. The general hypothesis is that deterioration in the quality&#xD;
      of women's reproductive environment (e.g. psychosocial stress, nutritional status, health&#xD;
      status, etc.) would have deleterious effects on fecundability and early pregnancy&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Data were collected from Mayan women in Guatemala. The reduced ethnic and&#xD;
      socio-economic heterogeneity of this traditional population, as compared to that of an&#xD;
      industrialized society, increased the robustness of the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: The goal was to evaluate fecundability and early pregnancy,&#xD;
      thus, only women who met all six of the following criteria were recruited: (1) cohabitating&#xD;
      with husband, (2), parity greater than or equal to 1 (to reduce the number of infertile&#xD;
      participants), (3) being between 16-42 years of age (women aged greater than or equal to 16&#xD;
      are considered adults in this Mayan community. In fact, the first two pre-requisite to&#xD;
      participate were that women were married and had given birth to at least one child), (4) not&#xD;
      pregnant at the onset of the study (5) not using any form of contraception, and (6) last&#xD;
      birth greater than six months prior to the onset of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Subject Protection: Participants' recruitment was voluntary. Consent was obtained&#xD;
      orally because most participants were illiterate, Privacy and confidentiality were assured,&#xD;
      and participants were informed that they could discontinue their participation at any time&#xD;
      with no cost or consequences to them. No deception, or covert observation, or interviewing of&#xD;
      children were involved. I.D. numbers (not names) were used in recording the data. Names of&#xD;
      participants are kept separately from data. All names and data files are kept in password&#xD;
      protected NIEHS-computer or CDs stored under lock and key. Only ID numbers are used in&#xD;
      analyses. Names are stored in case future research is needed. We have no current plants for&#xD;
      research that involves re-contacting participants. Such research would entail a separate IRB&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and outcome parameters: Saliva and first-morning urine specimens plus interview data&#xD;
      were collected every other day, for a total of three times each week for up to one year.&#xD;
      Participants' stress is measured via interview instruments as well as salivary and urinary&#xD;
      free cortisol levels. Fecundability and early pregnancy are monitored through the&#xD;
      determination of progesterone and estrone conjugates, luteinizing and follicle stimulating&#xD;
      hormones, and chorionic gonadotropin. Nutritional and health assessments were achieved&#xD;
      through standard medical and anthropometric procedures. Lactation, frequency and timing of&#xD;
      intercourse, socio-economic status, and participant's life and reproductive history were all&#xD;
      assessed via interview instruments. The data collection phase of this project is finished.&#xD;
      Specimen and data analyses will continue including further assessment of stress,&#xD;
      fecundability, and early pregnancy. Specimen analyses will be conducted by our collaborator&#xD;
      Dr. Barry G. England at the University of Michigan under a separated University of Michigan&#xD;
      IRB approval.&#xD;
