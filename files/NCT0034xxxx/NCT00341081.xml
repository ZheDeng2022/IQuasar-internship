  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in Baltimore,&#xD;
      Maryland, will determine how accurately injection drug users report their needle-sharing&#xD;
      behavior. Needle-sharing is a major cause of blood-borne diseases, including HIV and&#xD;
      hepatitis. Therefore, a better understanding of this behavior is critical for devising&#xD;
      strategies to reduce disease spread in this way. Research on needle-sharing behavior has&#xD;
      relied heavily on users' self-reports. This study will compare these self-reports with&#xD;
      results of DNA tests that show whether a needle has been used by one or more individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection drug users 18 years of age or older participating in the Baltimore Needle Exchange&#xD;
      Program (BNEP) have been recruited for this study. Syringes distributed to users through the&#xD;
      BNEP are collected after use and tested to differentiate between single versus multiple&#xD;
      users. The findings are compared with the participants' responses about whether or not they&#xD;
      shared their needles and syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants visit the clinic every 6 months for an interview, including questions about&#xD;
      their mental and physical health, drug use, sexual activity and knowledge about HIV (the&#xD;
      virus that causes AIDS) and AIDS. After the interview, a small amount of blood is drawn for&#xD;
      testing for HIV, hepatitis, syphilis and other infectious diseases. Some of the blood is&#xD;
      stored for future testing. Participants return to the clinic 4 weeks after the interview and&#xD;
      blood drawing to get their test results. At this time, they are offered referral for drug&#xD;
      treatment, free condoms, advice about drug use and safer sex and an opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions about their health. Participation in the study may continue for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Needle sharing is a major cause of blood-borne diseases making understanding needle sharing&#xD;
      behavior imperative to devising strategies to reduce the disease burden. A DNA-based method,&#xD;
      using highly informative genetic markers of short tandem repeats (STRs) is being proposed as&#xD;
      a gold standard measure to identify single-use and multi-use syringes. Self-reports of needle&#xD;
      sharing, which have been the main source of sharing information for research, will be&#xD;
      compared to the genotypic results to validate the responses on such risk behavior. Genotypic&#xD;
      information from four autosomal STRs will be used to differentiate DNA from a single versus&#xD;
      multiple individuals in syringe exudates obtained from injection drug users (IDUs) from the&#xD;
      Baltimore needle exchange program (BNEP) studied by ALIVE II. Detecting three or more&#xD;
      distinct alleles at an autosomal STR in the syringe exudates provides evidence that the&#xD;
      syringe has been shared by at least two individuals. Matching probabilities will be used to&#xD;
      match the genotypic profile of the individual(s) checking in and returning the syringe to&#xD;
      allele(s) observed in the syringe exudates, and a mixture discrimination probability will be&#xD;
      used to measure the likelihood of single vs. multi genome in the syringe samples. Behavioral&#xD;
      surveillance to document the rapid spread of infectious disease from needle sharing among&#xD;
      high-risk sub-population such as IDUs are critical for global public health along with the&#xD;
      development and implementation of timely interventions.&#xD;
