    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to compare the visual and refractive outcomes of deep&#xD;
      lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK) with penetrating keratoplasty as treatment for&#xD;
      certain cases of corneal edema due to endothelial decompensation. Additionally, data will be&#xD;
      collected to compare corneal shape, corneal thickness, endothelial cell density, keratocyte&#xD;
      density, corneal sensitivity, light scatter, and subjective visual function between the two&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized prospective study. We will enroll patients using the following&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, based upon the surgeon?s initial complete ophthalmic&#xD;
      examination, which includes refraction, keratometry, slit lamp examination, intraocular&#xD;
      pressure and corneal thickness measurement, and dilated fundus examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Both males and females are eligible 2) Patient age 21 years or older 3) Corneal edema due&#xD;
      to endothelial dysfunction 4) Aphakia, pseudophakia, or cataract requiring extraction 5)&#xD;
      Visual acuity as measured in standardized fashion (ETDRS chart and appropriate illumination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study eye; best spectacle-corrected entrance acuity 20/40 or worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contralateral eye; best spectacle-corrected entrance acuity equal to or better than the&#xD;
           study eye and 20/200 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1) Central stromal corneal scars 2) Presence of a filtering bleb 3) History of Herpes&#xD;
           simplex or Herpes zoster keratitis 4) Uncontrolled glaucoma 5) Pregnancy. Serum&#xD;
           pregnancy testing will be performed within 7 days prior to surgery for women of&#xD;
           child-bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the 2-year period, January 2001 to January 2003, 67 PK?s were performed at Mayo&#xD;
           Clinic for endothelial dysfunction (e.g., Fuch?s dystrophy or pseudophakic corneal&#xD;
           edema) in patients who met the entry criteria for this protocol. During the 2-year&#xD;
           enrollment period of this study, we anticipate that up to 50 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
           Appropriate counseling will be done, including a discussion of the potential benefits&#xD;
           and risks of the procedures. IRB-approved consent forms will be signed. Enrolled&#xD;
           patients will return on a different day (often the day before surgery or the morning of&#xD;
           surgery to be performed in the afternoon) for the preoperative Keratogram. Randomization&#xD;
           and assignment of the patient to DLEK or PK will occur after the preoperative Keratogram&#xD;
           and after the surgeon has accepted a donor cornea from the eye bank for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Keratogram&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Keratogram consists of a series of tests administered both pre- and post-operatively&#xD;
           by trained research personnel who are masked to the patients? particular randomizations.&#xD;
           Keratograms will be performed preoperatively and at 1 month (3-6 weeks), 3 months (2-4&#xD;
           months), 6 months (5-7 months), and 1, 2, and 3 years (&amp;#61617;3 months)&#xD;
           postoperatively. The following measurement procedures, to be conducted only on the&#xD;
           operated eye, are included in each Keratogram. The equipment to be used is included in&#xD;
           parentheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Contrast sensitivity with best refraction (Ginsburg contrast sensitivity tester) 2.&#xD;
           Straylight meter measurement (Van den Berg straylight meter) 3. Corneal topography map&#xD;
           (TMS-2) 4. Corneal profile (Orbscan) 5. Noncontact endothelial photography (Konan Robo)&#xD;
           6. Scatterometry (Mayo scatterometer) 7. Corneal esthesiometry (Belmonte esthesiometer)&#xD;
           8. Confocal microscopy (Tandem Scanning or Confoscan 3 confocal microscope) 9. Quality&#xD;
           of visual function questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). This will not be done at the 1week, one&#xD;
           month, or 3 month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligibility of Fellow Eyes Fellow eyes in bilateral cases will be eligible to enter the&#xD;
           study 4 months or more after the first procedure if these eyes now meet the eligibility&#xD;
           criteria (i.e., if the fellow eye now has worse vision than the operated study eye).&#xD;
           These eyes will be randomized separately and follow the same protocol, with the&#xD;
           exception that the patient may override the randomization if he or she prefers to have&#xD;
           one or the other of the 2 procedures. For data analysis, fellow eyes will be considered&#xD;
           a separate group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Occurrences For DLEK, adverse occurrences at the time of surgery (such as&#xD;
           premature entry into the anterior chamber during recipient lamellar dissection) will&#xD;
           require conversion to a standard PK and the patient will be exited from the study.&#xD;
           Adverse postoperative occurrences in either surgical group (such as a dislocated disc,&#xD;
           uncontrolled rejection, primary graft failure, infection or other adverse events) will&#xD;
           be managed by the surgeon according to standard practices. These patients will remain in&#xD;
           the study and will have identical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SURGICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. DLEK&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anesthesia options will include monitored, attended, local anesthesia or general&#xD;
           orotracheal anesthesia, depending on the particular patient?s desire and comorbid&#xD;
           conditions. For local anesthesia a standard retrobulbar and facial nerve block as done&#xD;
           for standard PK will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preparation of recipient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In the preoperative area, pilocarpine 1%, one drop to operated eye is instilled&#xD;
                every five minutes for 3 doses in order to constrict the pupil.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. After anesthesia is attained and the eye is prepared and draped, the lid speculum&#xD;
                and operating microscope with video recording of each case is brought into&#xD;
                position.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Rectus bridle sutures for positioning of the globe are placed as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A limbal peritomy is performed and the conjunctiva is recessed from the 9:30 to&#xD;
                2:30 o'clock superior limbus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. A limbal incision of the sclera, 1.0 mm peripheral to the limbus and parallel to&#xD;
                the limbus, is made with a guarded diamond knife set to 0.35 mm depth. The length&#xD;
                of the incision is 9.0 mm or 4.5mm, measured with calipers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Deep lamellar dissection of the cornea utilizing a crescent blade is performed&#xD;
                followed by a stromal dissector spatula.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Paracentesis and Healon injection to maintain the anterior chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Placement of intra-lamellar trephine with trephination of the recipient posterior&#xD;
                stromal disc. If a 4.5mm incision was made, then the trephine is used to make an&#xD;
                indentation on the corneal surface and the posterior lamellar disc is cut with&#xD;
                scissors.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Entry into anterior chamber with a diamond blade at 12 o'clock in the trephination.&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. Excision of recipient posterior stromal disc and endothelium with corneal scissors&#xD;
                and removal of disc from the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
            11. Caliper measurement of the diameter of the excised tissue is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
            12. Wound closure and standard phacoemulsification and IOL implantation through a&#xD;
                separate incision in patients requiring cataract removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
            13. Healon is evacuated completely from the anterior chamber with an I/A unit. (eg:&#xD;
                Simcoe Needle).&#xD;
&#xD;
            14. The cornea is covered with a moistened gauze disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preparation of donor tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Donor corneo-scleral tissue is removed from the storage media, endothelium is&#xD;
                coated with healon, and the tissue is secured in the Moria artificial anterior&#xD;
                chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A deep lamellar dissection pocket is formed in the donor with a crescent blade&#xD;
                followed by a stromal dissector spatula.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The donor tissue is placed (endothelial side up) onto the trephination block and&#xD;
                the same size trephine (same size as recipient disc tissue diameter) is used to&#xD;
                trephine the donor disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The donor disc is separated from the corneo-scleral donor tissue and placed&#xD;
                endothelial side down or folded in half (if a 4.5mm incision was made) onto a&#xD;
                healon coated transfer spatula.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Transfer of donor to recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
           1) Air is injected into the anterior chamber. 2) The donor tissue disc is placed into&#xD;
           the anterior chamber through the lamellar incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4) The spatula is removed from the eye by sliding out from under the Healon coating.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5) The disc position is finely manipulated with a needle or hook as needed, taking care&#xD;
           to minimize endothelial touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5) The limbal wound is sutured with interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. 6) The anterior&#xD;
           chamber air bubble is replaced 50% with balanced salt solution. 7) A Seidel test is&#xD;
           performed. If positive, additional limbal sutures are placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8) The conjunctiva is closed with cautery or sutures. 9) Subconjunctival dexamethasone,&#xD;
           2 mg or Solu-Medrol, 30 mg and cefazolin, 25 mg or gentamicin, 20 mg, are injected in&#xD;
           the inferior fornix. The eye is bandaged with a gauze patch and a Fox shield.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10) The patient is instructed to spend the next two postoperative hours in a supine&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11) Routine postoperative orders for corneal transplantation are given upon discharge&#xD;
           from the hospital that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PK The surgical method for patients randomized to penetrating keratoplasty will be&#xD;
                the standard procedure currently practiced by the participating surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
           POSTOPERATIVE CARE The patient will be seen the day after the surgery. Postoperative&#xD;
           medications will include topical antibiotic of the surgeon?s choice, twice daily for one&#xD;
           to two weeks and prednisolone acetate 1%, four times daily. The steroid drop will be&#xD;
           tapered by one drop daily each month. Alterations to the steroid taper and other medical&#xD;
           treatment will be made based upon individual patient conditions and response. Patient&#xD;
           activity restrictions and eye protection measures will follow the usual PK&#xD;
           recommendations by the individual surgeon. All patients will be seen at the following&#xD;
           intervals: preoperatively and at 1 week (5-14 days), 1 month (3-6 weeks), 3 months (4-6&#xD;
           months), 6 months (5-7 months), and 1, 2, and 3 years (&amp;#61617;3 months)&#xD;
           postoperatively. Keratograms will be performed at each visit, except one day and one&#xD;
           week postoperatively. Confocal microscopy will be done as part of each keratogram and&#xD;
           also at the one week postoperative visit. Additional clinic visits may be requested by&#xD;
           the surgeon as needed for proper medical management. Corneal suture removal in&#xD;
           penetrating grafts or limbal suture removal in DLEK will be dictated by patient healing&#xD;
           and at the surgeon?s discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data collection will be performed with the&#xD;
           instruments and schedule delineated above in the Methods section. The following outcome&#xD;
           measures will be calculated from the data. These will be compared between the 2 groups&#xD;
           (DLEK and PK) at each postoperative time by using t-tests or rank sum tests with&#xD;
           Bonferroni corrections.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Visual acuity with best refractive correction&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Refractive astigmatism&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Keratometric astigmatism&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Topographic astigmatism (&quot;Simulated Keratometry&quot; function of the TMS-1 mapping)&#xD;
                Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Corneal backscattered light&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Ocular forward-scattered light&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Contrast sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Posterior corneal curvature&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Corneal sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Corneal subbasal nerve density&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Keratocyte density&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Endothelial cell density&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Quality of visual function (NEI-VFQ) Statistical Power We have recently published&#xD;
                variance data on keratometric astigmatism and endothelial cell density after PK.&#xD;
                The keratometric astigmatism17 after removal of all sutures was 4.6 &amp;#61617; 2.7 D&#xD;
                (mean&amp;#61617;SD) and the endothelial cell density18 2 months postoperatively was&#xD;
                2606 &amp;#61617; 446 cells/mm2. To detect (&amp;#61537;=0.05) a difference of 2.5 D in&#xD;
                keratometric astigmatism with 80% certainty (&amp;#61538;=0.2) would require 20&#xD;
                subjects in each group, and to detect a difference of 400 cells/mm2 in endothelial&#xD;
                cell density would require 20 subjects in each group. We expect to have 25 patients&#xD;
                in each group, giving the study adequate power.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For an additional use of the data, primary outcome data on the patients randomized to&#xD;
           DLEK from our center will be pooled with data from other participating centers in the&#xD;
           Endothelial Keratoplasty Group organized by Mark Terry, M.D., Portland, OR, who will&#xD;
           coordinate data collection and statistical analysis. Pooled data will be used to&#xD;
           calculate mean postoperative visual acuity, refractive outcomes and frequency of&#xD;
           favorable outcome. These data will be compared with published data on PK.&#xD;
