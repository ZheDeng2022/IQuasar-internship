    <textblock>
      This study will determine the highest dose of an experimental vaccine called AMA1-C1 that can&#xD;
      safely be given to adults exposed to malaria. Malaria affects about 300 million to 500&#xD;
      million people worldwide each year, causing from 2 million to 3 million deaths, mostly among&#xD;
      children under 5 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. It is the leading cause of death and&#xD;
      illness among the general population of Mali in West Africa. Increasing drug resistance to&#xD;
      the malaria parasite, as well as widespread resistance of mosquitoes (the insects that&#xD;
      transmit the parasite) to pesticides are reducing the ability to control malaria through&#xD;
      these strategies. A vaccine that could reduce illness and death from malaria would be a&#xD;
      valuable new resource in the fight against this disease. AMA1-C1 is an experimental vaccine&#xD;
      developed by the NIAID. Early tests of AMA1-C1 in 30 healthy people in the United States&#xD;
      found no serious harmful side effects of the vaccine. This study will look at the effect of&#xD;
      AMA1-C1 in people in Mali who have been exposed to malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents of Don gu bougou, Mali, who are between 18 and 45 years of age and are in general&#xD;
      good health may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history&#xD;
      and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and urine pregnancy test for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive three injections (shots) of either the&#xD;
      experimental malaria vaccine or a hepatitis B vaccine that is approved and used in Mali. All&#xD;
      shots are given in an upper arm muscle. After the first shot, the second is given 1 month&#xD;
      later, and the third is given 12 months after the first. Subjects receiving AMA1-C1 will get&#xD;
      one of three different doses - low, medium, or high - to find the dose that is safest and&#xD;
      gives the best antibody response to the vaccine. After each shot, participants remain in the&#xD;
      clinic for 30 minutes for observation. They return to the clinic 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days&#xD;
      after each shot for a physical examination and to check for side effects. Blood samples are&#xD;
      drawn before each shot and at selected return clinic visits to check for side effects and to&#xD;
      measure the effect of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the rainy seasons after the second and third vaccinations, subjects come to the clinic&#xD;
      once a month for an examination and a blood test. During the dry season, subjects come to the&#xD;
      clinic 3 months before the last shot is given for an examination and blood test. Additional&#xD;
      blood tests may be done on participants who develop malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If found to be safe in adults, further studies with this vaccine will be done in children&#xD;
      exposed to malaria, as it is children who bear the brunt of this disease.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Phase 1 clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      the Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel, in healthy malaria-exposed&#xD;
      adult volunteers. Between 2-3 million deaths occur each year as a result of malaria. Most of&#xD;
      these deaths are a result of P. falciparum malaria, in children under five years of age, in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa. A safe and effective vaccine that would reduce both morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality secondary to P. falciparum would be a valuable resource in the fight against this&#xD;
      disease. The apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a surface protein expressed during the&#xD;
      asexual blood stage of P. falciparum that is thought to play a role in parasite invasion of&#xD;
      erythrocytes. Clinical symptoms of malaria in humans are due to the asexual blood stage.&#xD;
      Therefore, this vaccine was designed to protect an individual from illness due to the asexual&#xD;
      stage of P. falciparum infection by inhibiting parasite invasion of erythrocytes. The&#xD;
      AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel vaccine preparations to be studied contain an equal mixture of AMA1 from&#xD;
      two different clones of Plasmodium falciparum (FVO and 3D7), both produced separately as&#xD;
      recombinant proteins expressed by Pichia pastoris (AMA1 FVO and AMA1 3D7). This vaccine has&#xD;
      been tested in one clinical trial of 30 malaria-unexposed human adults in the United States&#xD;
      and no clinically significant risks have been identified. The study will be conducted in Don&#xD;
      gu bougou, Mali, and will be a blinded, randomized and controlled trial that will evaluate&#xD;
      three dose levels of AMA1-C1 (5 micro g, 20 micro g, 80 micro g). Fifty-four healthy male and&#xD;
      non-pregnant female volunteers ages 18 to 45 will be enrolled. Eighteen volunteers will be&#xD;
      assigned to each of the three dose groups. Within each group, twelve volunteers will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either a 5 micro g, 20 micro g, or 80 micro g dose of&#xD;
      AMA1-Cl/Alhydrogel and 6 will be randomized to receive the tetanus toxoid vaccine.&#xD;
      Immunizations will be administered by intramuscular injection on months 0, 1, and 12. The&#xD;
      groups will be staggered such that adequate safety evaluation can be performed prior to dose&#xD;
      escalation. The duration of the study is 18 months per volunteer. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this trial is to determine the frequency and severity of vaccine-related adverse events for&#xD;
      each dose. The secondary objective is to determine the dose that generates the highest serum&#xD;
      antibody levels to AMA1 antigen at Day 42.&#xD;
