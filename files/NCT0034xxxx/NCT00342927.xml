      The Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) is a multicenter study designed&#xD;
      to identify genetic determinants of diabetic kidney disease. FIND will be conducted in eleven&#xD;
      centers and in many ethnic groups throughout the United States. Two different strategies will&#xD;
      be used to localize genes predisposing to kidney disease: a family-based genetic linkage&#xD;
      study and a case-control study that utilizes admixture linkage disequilibrium. The center&#xD;
      based at the Phoenix office of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney&#xD;
      Diseases (NIDDK-Phoenix) will conduct family-based linkage studies among American Indian&#xD;
      populations in the southwestern United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (index cases) with diabetes and kidney disease will initially be recruited, and&#xD;
      their parents and siblings will also be invited to participate. Genetic material from these&#xD;
      participants will be used to genotype markers throughout the genome. Linkage analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted to identify particular chromosomal regions containing genes that influence&#xD;
      susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease. Linkage analyses will also be used to identify&#xD;
      genes influencing traits related to diabetic kidney disease, such as serum creatinine,&#xD;
      urinary protein excretion, plasma glucose levels, blood pressure and blood lipid levels.&#xD;
      Regions that show evidence for linkage will then be examined in more detail, with both&#xD;
      genetic linkage and association studies, to attempt to identify the specific genes that&#xD;
      influence diabetic kidney disease, or related traits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of genes that influence susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease will&#xD;
      lead to a better understanding of how kidney disease develops. In the long run, this may lead&#xD;
      to improved treatment and prevention of diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;

      The Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) is a multicenter study designed&#xD;
      to identify genetic determinants of diabetic kidney disease. FIND is conducted in eleven&#xD;
      centers and in many ethnic groups throughout the United States. Two different strategies are&#xD;
      used to localize genes predisposing to kidney disease: a family-based genetic&#xD;
      linkage/association study and a case-control study that uses admixture linkage&#xD;
      disequilibrium. The center based at the Phoenix office of the National Institute of Diabetes&#xD;
      and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK-Phoenix) conducts family-based linkage/association&#xD;
      studies among American Indian populations in the southwestern United States, and in the&#xD;
      indigenous Micronesian populations of the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the&#xD;
      Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (index cases) with diabetes and kidney disease are recruited, and their parents&#xD;
      and siblings are also invited to participate. Members of target populations who are not&#xD;
      related to index cases are also included and offered screening for diabetes and kidney&#xD;
      disease; this will facilitate association studies. Genetic material from these participants&#xD;
      is used to genotype markers throughout the genome. Linkage and association analyses are&#xD;
      conducted to identify particular chromosomal regions containing genes that influence&#xD;
      susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease. Linkage and association analyses are also used to&#xD;
      identify genes influencing traits related to diabetic kidney disease, such as serum&#xD;
      creatinine, urinary protein excretion, plasma glucose levels, blood pressure and blood lipid&#xD;
      levels. Genome-wide and candidate gene association studies are also conducted. Regions that&#xD;
      show evidence for linkage or association are then examined in more detail, with both genetic&#xD;
      linkage and association studies, to attempt to identify the specific genes that influence&#xD;
      diabetic kidney disease, or related traits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of genes that influence susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease will&#xD;
