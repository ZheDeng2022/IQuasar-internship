  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nuclear power plant accident at Chornobyl released large quantities of Iodine-131 and&#xD;
      other radioisotopes of iodine in the atmosphere, contaminating thousands of square kilometers&#xD;
      and exposing millions of people. For this study, a well-defined subset of Ukrainian children&#xD;
      aged 0-18 years or in utero at the time of the accident are being identified and examined by&#xD;
      well-trained specialists for thyroid disease every two years for at least three cycles. The&#xD;
      study is a collaborative effort of research in Ukraine and the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will include approximately 13,000 persons who were children in 1986, all or most&#xD;
      of whom have had their thyroids measured for radioactivity during the weeks immediately&#xD;
      following the accident (or whose mothers had measurements taken while the child was in&#xD;
      utero). Under a rigid research protocol these subjects will receive diagnostic thyroid&#xD;
      examinations, including palpation, ultrasound scanning, thyroid hormone and other laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and, if indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Interview information regarding&#xD;
      residential, health, diet and lifestyle history will also be collected. All subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality. Thyroid cancers will be confirmed by&#xD;
      expert pathology examination of tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the analysis of thyroid radiation measurements made in May-June, 1986, efforts&#xD;
      will be made to reconstruct each person's exposure and to estimate the radiation dose to the&#xD;
      thyroid. This will involve the reconstruction of deposition patterns and environmental&#xD;
      pathways of the radioiodines, and of the location, dietary characteristics, and lifestyle of&#xD;
      each person throughout the exposure period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to carry out valid and credible assessments of the early and late&#xD;
      morphologic and functional changes in the thyroid glands of persons exposed to radiation from&#xD;
      radioactive materials released as a consequence of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant&#xD;
      accident. The emphasis is on dose- and time-specific changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of the study other possible risk factors will be examined including dietary&#xD;
      iodine intake during and after 1986, and the ingestion of potassium iodide for thyroid&#xD;
      protection shortly after the accident.&#xD;

      The nuclear power plant accident at Chornobyl released large quantities of Iodine-131 and&#xD;
      other radioisotopes of iodine into the atmosphere, contaminating thousands of square&#xD;
      kilometers and exposing millions of people. For this study, a well-defined subset of&#xD;
      Ukrainian children aged less than 18 years or in utero at the time of the accident were&#xD;
      identified and have been followed up. The main cohort was screened for thyroid disease every&#xD;
      two years for 4 cycles from 1998 through 2007, with another cycle resumed in 2011(fifth&#xD;
      cycle), which is now underway. The in utero cohort was screened between 2003-2006 and has&#xD;
      also been screened since 2011. The study is a collaborative effort of researchers in Ukraine&#xD;
      and the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cohort includes approximately 13,000 persons who were children in 1986, all or most&#xD;
      of whom had their thyroids measured for radioactivity during the weeks immediately following&#xD;
      the accident. Under a rigid research protocol, these subjects receive diagnostic thyroid&#xD;
      examinations, including palpation, ultrasound scanning, thyroid hormone and other laboratory&#xD;
      tests (only in the first four cycles). If indicated, they are referred for a fine-needle&#xD;
      aspiration biopsy. Interview information regarding residential, health, diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      history has also been collected. All subjects are followed for thyroid cancer morbidity.&#xD;
      Thyroid cancers are confirmed by expert pathology examination of tissue obtained during&#xD;
      surgery. The in utero cohort includes a total of 2,582 individuals. In addition starting in&#xD;
      2003, ~ 7,000 parents of members of the main cohort who were under age 10 y at the time of&#xD;
      the accident were interviewed in order to increase the accuracy of recall. These individuals&#xD;
      were listed as new subjects. Altogether, 23,143 individuals have been accrued in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the analysis of thyroid radiation measurements made in May-June, 1986,&#xD;
      radiation dose to the thyroid was estimated drawing on such data as the reconstruction of&#xD;
      deposition patterns and environmental pathways of the radioiodines, and of the location,&#xD;
      dietary characteristics, and lifestyle of each person throughout the exposure period. For in&#xD;
      utero subjects, fetal dose has been estimated based on the mother s thyroid dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the early and late morphologic and functional changes in&#xD;
      the thyroid glands of persons exposed at young ages to radiation from radioactive materials&#xD;
      released as a consequence of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, with emphasis on&#xD;
      dose-and time-specific changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several amendments to the protocol: transition in 2008 to cancer case&#xD;
      ascertainment using a passive form of follow-up based on linkage to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Registry of Ukraine (NCRU) which still continues during thefifth cycle of screening; a&#xD;
      sub-study involving an additional follow-up examination of those cohort members who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with benign nodular thyroid pathology during one of the earlier four active&#xD;
      screening cycles; and genetic studies (gene expression and germline SNP studies) of thyroid&#xD;
      cancer in this Ukrainian cohort exposed to radioiodines from Chernobyl fallout as children or&#xD;
      adolescents; and most recently, a pilot study of genomic characterization of thyroid cancers&#xD;
      (2013).&#xD;
