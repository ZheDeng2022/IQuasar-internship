  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This collaborative investigation between NIEHS, Duke University, and the University of North&#xD;
      Carolina (UNC) will study red blood cells of babies born to HIV-infected women receiving&#xD;
      anti-retroviral treatment. Studies have shown that newborn mice whose mothers were given&#xD;
      anti-HIV medications during pregnancy had abnormal red blood cells circulating in their blood&#xD;
      stream, indicating genetic damage to the cells caused by the anti-HIV medications. It is not&#xD;
      known if similar red blood cell abnormalities develop in human infants whose mothers received&#xD;
      anti-HIV medication during their pregnancy. This study will examine red blood cells from&#xD;
      infants exposed to anti-HIV medications and from non-exposed infants to look for differences&#xD;
      between them involving this specific genetic damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy pregnant women and HIV-infected pregnant women who received antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      during their last trimester of pregnancy and during labor may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Babies of HIV-infected women are also included in the study. Candidates will be recruited&#xD;
      from medical centers at Duke University and the UNC. HIV-infected mothers must plan to have&#xD;
      their baby followed by either the UNC or the Duke Pediatric Infectious Disease clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women in the study will have 1 milliliter (less than 1/2 teaspoon) of blood collected for&#xD;
      this study during delivery at the same time that other blood samples are obtained for their&#xD;
      medical care. In addition, 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of umbilical cord blood will also be collected&#xD;
      for this study at the time of delivery after the cord is no longer attached to the baby. This&#xD;
      concludes participation of non-HIV infected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies born to HIV-infected mothers will have 1 ml of blood drawn between 0 to 3 days of&#xD;
      life, between 4 to 6 weeks of life, and between 4 to 6 months of life. These bloodsamples&#xD;
      will be collected at the same time as other routine scheduled blood draws.&#xD;

      This is an observational study of pregnant women and their newborns. The population will&#xD;
      include 10 HIV infected women on any antiretroviral regimen and their newborn infants and 10&#xD;
      healthy women on no antiretroviral regimen and their newborn infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes can be detected more&#xD;
      frequently in cord blood of infants exposed to zidovudine in utero and intrapartum compared&#xD;
      to cord blood from infants not exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes can be detected in pregnant women on any&#xD;
           antiretrovial agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes change in frequency in infants exposed to&#xD;
           antiretrovial agents over the first 6 weeks of life, during the time the infant is&#xD;
           exposed to Zidovudine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the change in micronucleated erythrocytes in the infants after cessation or&#xD;
           Zidovudine (6 months).&#xD;
