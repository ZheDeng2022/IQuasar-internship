  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide information regarding the optimal dose and duration of nicotine&#xD;
      replacement using the nicotine patch for a smoking cessation study of pregnant&#xD;
      African-American women. Previous studies have shown that pregnancy, race and ethnicity can&#xD;
      affect the way people metabolize nicotine. The information from this study may help&#xD;
      scientists develop ways to help pregnant African-American women quit smoking and not start&#xD;
      smoking again after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      African-American women 18-30years of age who are in the second trimester of a healthy&#xD;
      pregnancy, who are carrying only one baby and who smoke 10 or more cigarettes a day may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination&#xD;
      and urine test. They receive counseling to help them quit smoking. Those who cannot quit&#xD;
      smoking within 7 to 10 days after receiving counseling may be invited to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to a private room in the Pediatric Clinical Research Center at&#xD;
      Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., for 48 hours, during which time they&#xD;
      are not permitted to smoke. After a &quot;wash out&quot; period, a nicotine patch will be applied&#xD;
      according to these doses and schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  21 mg patch for 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  21 mg patch for 16 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  14 mg patch for 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  14 mg patch for 16 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous (IV) line is placed in the subject's arm and 12 blood samples are drawn&#xD;
      through the line at intervals during the 48 hours. Twleve urine and saliva samples are also&#xD;
      collected. Blood, urine, and saliva samples are analyzed for nicotine and cotinine (a product&#xD;
      of nicotine metabolism) levels, and DNA will be collected studied for genes that are&#xD;
      associated with nicotine and cotinine metabolism. Participants are interviewed about their&#xD;
      urges to smoke, quality of sleep, etc.&#xD;

      This is a two-part protocol. This protocol is for Part A, the specific aims of which are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the optimal dose (21 mg or 14 mg) and duration (24 hours or 16 hours) of&#xD;
           nicotine replacement using the nicotine transdermal delivery device for African-American&#xD;
           pregnant women who smoke, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the implications of the nicotine replacement studies for treatment with the&#xD;
           nicotine replacement patch of African-American women who smoke during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Collect DNA for exploratory analyses regarding genetic causes of differences in metabolism&#xD;
      of nicotine and cotinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latina/Hispanic women will not be included in this study because a) few smoke, and b) few are&#xD;
      seen in the clinical sites from which participants will be recruited.&#xD;
