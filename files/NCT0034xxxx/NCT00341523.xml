  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a common malignancy with a very poor prognosis. The principal reason for&#xD;
      its poor prognosis is that most tumors are asymptomatic and go undetected until they have&#xD;
      spread beyond the esophageal wall and are unresectable. Significant reduction in esophageal&#xD;
      cancer mortality will require successful strategies to diagnose and treat more cases at&#xD;
      earlier, more curable stages of disease. A successful early detection program will require an&#xD;
      accurate, patient-acceptable screening test, confirmatory tests that can localize precursor&#xD;
      and early invasive lesions, and one or more curative therapies that are acceptable to&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients. This project includes five studies designed to evaluate techniques&#xD;
      that may be useful in such an early detection program:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Cytology Sampling Study will estimate and compare the sensitivity of several&#xD;
           cytologic samplers for identifying biopsy-proven dysplasia and cancer of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Mucosal Staining Study will evaluate whether mucosal straining can improve&#xD;
           endoscopic localization of esophageal dysplasia and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Endoscopic Staging Study will evaluate how accurately endoscopic techniques can&#xD;
           stage dysplasia and early invasive cancer of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Endoscopic Therapy Pilot Study will evaluate the feasibility, safety, acceptability&#xD;
           and preliminary efficacy of endoscopic therapies for removing or ablating focal&#xD;
           high-grade dysplasias and early invasive cancers of the esphagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Chemoregression Study will evaluate the ability of oral chemopreventive agents to&#xD;
           reduce progression or cause regression of low-grade squamous dysplasia of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be carried out in Linxian, China, a county with extraordinary rates of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer and a correspondingly high prevalence of the asymptomatic precursor and&#xD;
      early invasive lesions that are needed for these studies. The project will be a collaborative&#xD;
      effort of investigators from NCI, the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences, and several U.S. universities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major cause of death in the central&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asian esophageal cancer belt and human papillomavirus (HPV) has been proposed as a potential&#xD;
      cause. While several HPV-associated cancers have been identified (e.g., cervical, tonsillar),&#xD;
      the role of HPV in esophageal carcinogenesis remains unclear. Estimates of the prevalence of&#xD;
      HPV in ESCC in Henan province, which lies in the central Asian esophageal cancer belt and of&#xD;
      which Linxian is a part, have varied from 0-78%. Contamination of specimens may contribute to&#xD;
      this variation, as may differences in HPV detection techniques. With the imminent&#xD;
      availability of an effective HPV vaccine, it is critical to determine if HPV is or is not&#xD;
      involved in ESCC in Linxian given the potential for cancer prevention through use of the&#xD;
&#xD;
      vaccine if HPV is involved. OBJECTIVES: The overall objective is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      HPV is involved in the pathogenesis of ESCC in Linxian, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will 1) determine the prevalence of HPV DNA in ESCC tumors and 2) evaluate the activity of&#xD;
      HPV in HPV DNA-positive cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted among adult patients with ESCC presenting for esophagectomy at&#xD;
      Yaocun Commune Hospital in Linxian, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This case series study will collect demographic and clinical data from medical&#xD;
      records and will use rigorous sterile procedures to obtain biologic specimens (blood, tumor,&#xD;
      nontumor) from patients with ESCC. The presence of HPV DNA in tumor specimens will be&#xD;
      evaluated using PCR with L1, E6, and E7-based primers. The activity of HPV in HPV&#xD;
      DNA-positive cases will be assessed by immunohistochemistry for p16 (ink4a) over-expression,&#xD;
      RT-PCR for E6/E7 mRNA expression, and amplification of papillomavirus oncogene transcripts&#xD;
      (APOT) for HPV integration in tumor specimens. Nontumor specimens will also be examined for&#xD;
      the presence of HPV DNA, and serum will be tested for HPV 16 and HPV 18 E6/E7 seropositivity&#xD;
      as a marker of HPV-associated cancer.&#xD;
