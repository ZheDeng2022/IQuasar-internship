  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Environmental Genome Project (EGP) has completely or partially resequenced the protein&#xD;
      coding and regulatory regions of 53 environmentally sensitive genes from 72 anonymous&#xD;
      individuals of varying ethnic backgrounds to date. Some of the same genes have been&#xD;
      resequenced in an additional set of 20 samples, and, in a subset of these, the introns and&#xD;
      promoter regions have been sequenced as well. Within this population, 523 allelic variants&#xD;
      (genetic polymorphisms), mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been found to&#xD;
      date. If the polymorphism alters the behavior or expression of the encoded protein, it might&#xD;
      be of clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Office of Clinical Research is planning to establish a large resource bank of frozen DNA&#xD;
      samples (20,000) and make it available to NIEHS intramural investigators involved in the EGP&#xD;
      to screen for the presence of these SNPs and other mutations by standard genotyping methods.&#xD;
      To investigate the feasibility of such a large collection of samples, we plan to first&#xD;
      conduct a pilot study to estimate the accrual rate and uncover potential problems that may be&#xD;
      encountered in the larger effort. This IRB proposal is for the pilot study in which we will&#xD;
      collect whole blood samples (EDTA-anticoagulated) from 481 patients at UNC Medical Center.&#xD;
      Once the pilot study is complete, we will decide whether to proceed with the larger, 20,000&#xD;
      sample collection and if so, develop and submit for review a new IRB protocol for its&#xD;
      implementation taking date from the pilot study into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both the pilot study and larger, 20,000 sample collection, only blood left over from&#xD;
      patients already having their blood drawn for hematology (complete blood count or CBC) assays&#xD;
      as part of their routine clinical management will be used, thus eliminating the need to&#xD;
      collect extra blood. Once the samples have been obtained from the clinical hematology&#xD;
      laboratory and processed, they will be identifiable only with a unique identification number&#xD;
      and sent to an NIEHS contractor (BioServe Biotechnlolgies, Laurel, MD) for DNA isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recruitment, interviewers will explain the study to potential participants, obtain&#xD;
      their signatures on the informed consent documents, and answer any questions they have&#xD;
      concerning this study. At this time, potential participants will be informed that, depending&#xD;
      on the results of the genetic analyses of their blood samples, they may be recontacted at a&#xD;
      later date and asked to participate in follow-up genotype/phenotype studies. These follow-up&#xD;
      studies will be separate from this protocol and the subjects of future IRB proposals. The&#xD;
      ultimate objective of these sample collections, combined with the follow-up&#xD;
      genotype/phenotype studies, is to identify groups of individuals with genetic polymorphisms&#xD;
      in environmentally sensitive genes, and to correlate their genotype with their clinical&#xD;
      phenotype, a process known as &quot;ascertainment by genotype.&quot;&#xD;
