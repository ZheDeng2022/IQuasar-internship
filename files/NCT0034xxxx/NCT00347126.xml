      Prostaglandin analogs are a leading class of glaucoma drugs with a proven safety and efficacy&#xD;
      for controlling IOP. They include latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost and unoprostone.&#xD;
      Recently, the Singapore National Eye Center (SNEC) awarded a tender for prostaglandin&#xD;
      analogues to Alcon, the manufacturer of travoprost. Since then, all subsidized patients&#xD;
      previously treated with latanoprost were systematically switched to travoprost and this&#xD;
      process will continue for the rest of this year. In this study, we propose to prospectively&#xD;
      study the efficacy and safety of switching from latanoprost to travoprost in a large series&#xD;
      of glaucoma patients at SNEC. A total of 372 consecutive patients being switched from&#xD;
      latanoprost to travoprost will be followed up for 12 weeks following the switch. In addition&#xD;
      to intraocular pressure, the safety and tolerability (with particular emphasis on hyperemia)&#xD;
      of travoprost will be examined.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of switching a large group of patients on treatment with&#xD;
           latanoprost to travoprost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the efficacy and safety of travoprost compared to latanoprost after the&#xD;
           switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure (IOP) is currently the only proven modifiable risk factor in the&#xD;
      management of glaucoma.1 Either medical or surgical management can achieve the control of&#xD;
      IOP. Prostaglandin analogs are the newer class of drugs among the various topical ocular&#xD;
      hypotensive medications, with a proven safety and efficacy for controlling IOP.2 Their&#xD;
      potency and once a day dosing and lower incidence of systemic side effects have made them&#xD;
      popular for use as monotherapeutic and first-line agents. They include latanoprost,&#xD;
      bimatoprost, travoprost and unoprostone. All of them have a similar molecular structure and&#xD;
      they work by increasing the aqueous drainage via trabecular meshwork and the uveoscleral&#xD;
      pathway.3 It has been shown that the efficacy of latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost in&#xD;
      reducing IOP in ocular hypertension and primary open angle glaucoma is comparable.4&#xD;
      Conjunctival hyperemia is one of the most common ocular side effects. There has been a&#xD;
      reported higher incidence of hyperemia with bimatoprost and travoprost as compared to&#xD;
      latanoprost.4 However, this hyperemia is usually benign and usually abates as the drug is&#xD;
      used long term. The incidence of discontinuation of therapy due to hyperemia is very low and&#xD;
      not different among the various prostaglandins.5 Among the prostaglandin analogues,&#xD;
      latanoprost has been the market leader in Singapore for the past few years. However, the&#xD;
      Singapore National Eye Center (SNEC) pharmacy recently accepted tenders from various drug&#xD;
      companies for prostaglandin analogs. Alcon, the manufacturer of travoprost was awarded the&#xD;
      tender. Since then, all subsidized patients previously treated with latanoprost were&#xD;
      systematically switched to travoprost and this process will continue for the rest of this&#xD;
      year. The switch is a systematic switch and is not based on intolerance or poor response to&#xD;
      latanoprost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been a single report regarding the feasibility and efficacy of a mass&#xD;
      switch from latanoprost to bimatoprost.5 The study reported a high switch rate and good IOP&#xD;
      control with minimal switch back. However, similar data on switching from latanoprost to&#xD;
      travoprost is lacking. In this study, we propose to prospectively study the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of switching from latanoprost to travoprost in a large series of glaucoma patients at&#xD;
      SNEC. A total of 372 consecutive patients being switched from latanoprost to travoprost will&#xD;
      be followed up for 12 weeks following the switch. In addition to IOP, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      (with particular emphasis on hyperemia) of travoprost will be examined.&#xD;
