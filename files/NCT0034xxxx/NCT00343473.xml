  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the optical coherence tomography (OCT), to image&#xD;
      diseases of the eye. OCT may be useful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of&#xD;
      diseases involving the eye, such as Fuch's Dystrophy (type of eye disease) and retinal damage&#xD;
      (eye diseases in the back of the eye) due to diabetes.&#xD;

      contact lens and surgical procedures, such as LASIK (type of ophthalmic surgical procedure).&#xD;
      The OCT is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. The ultra high OCT is a&#xD;
      non-significant risk device (it does not present a possible serious risk to your health, your&#xD;
      safety, or your welfare) that has not been approved by the FDA. This study will also be&#xD;
      conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts-New England Medical Center&#xD;

        Subjects will range form 18 years to 90 years. Gender can be male or female. Will include&#xD;
        100 normals and 100 diseased patients that include diabetic retinopathy, macular&#xD;
        degeneration, and glaucoma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: Female Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be included (no&#xD;
        risks to fetus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normals: Normal appearing cornea, no history of corneal trauma, surgery or disease, no&#xD;
        historical or current contact lens wear. Thirty subjects from 6 different age groups (&gt; 18&#xD;
        yrs; 20-30 yrs; 30-40 yrs; 40-50 yrs; 50-60 yrs; &gt; 60 yrs) will be recruited to determine&#xD;
        the normal variations in anterior eye structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        LASIK patients: to participate as a LASIK patient, the subject is previously normal but may&#xD;
        have worn contact lenses, and is scheduled to undergo LASIK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contact lens wearers: to participate as a contact lens wearer the patient otherwise&#xD;
        fulfills all criteria specified for normalcy, with the exception of contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fuchs' dystrophy patients: Fuchs' Dystrophy is characterized by guttata and clinically&#xD;
        significant corneal edema, with a corneal thickness of &gt;700 microns, and/or reduced visual&#xD;
        acuity in the morning which improves over the course of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diabetic patients: for diabetic patients are specified in the posterior segment imaging&#xD;
        section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Subjects will be excluded from the study if their media are opaque, or&#xD;
        if they are unwilling or unable to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If participants choose they may also participate in other imaging research protocols. No&#xD;
        risk is associated if entering multiple imaging protocols, while being a participant in&#xD;
        this research study.&#xD;
