  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of counseling plus use of a nicotine patch with&#xD;
      counseling alone for helping pregnant women quit smoking. Smoking during pregnancy is the&#xD;
      most preventable cause of fetal and newborn health problems such as low birth weight, fetal&#xD;
      growth retardation, sudden infant death syndrome, spontaneous abortion, decreased lung&#xD;
      function and premature delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      African-American and Hispanic women 18 years of age or older, smoke cigarettes, and live in&#xD;
      the District of Columbia metropolitan area may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      recruited from the George Washington University and Providence Hospital prenatal health&#xD;
      clinics. They are screened with a review of their medical records and a survey that includes&#xD;
      questions about their age, residency, race and ethnicity, educational level and employment&#xD;
      status, number of weeks pregnant, and exposure to cigarette smoke and other types of tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants answer questions about their smoking behavior, then receive a 10-minute&#xD;
      counseling session and watch a videotape about quitting smoking. Women who are not able to&#xD;
      quit smoking in 1 week are then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group&#xD;
      continues to receive counseling sessions during the remainder of their pregnancy; the second&#xD;
      group receives nicotine patches as well as the counseling sessions. In addition, all&#xD;
      participants watch a video about smoking and receive a guide to help them quit. Women who&#xD;
      receive the patches must stop smoking completely. If they cannot stop immediately, their&#xD;
      participation in the study ends. The behavioral counseling sessions for all the women are a&#xD;
      series of conversations between the women and a trained counselor to help the woman through&#xD;
      the process of quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed during the study with six clinic visits and three telephone calls.&#xD;
      During the first visit, the women answer a series of questions about their smoking habits and&#xD;
      health concerns. A portion of the urine sample they provide during their routine prenatal&#xD;
      visit is used by this study to assess their cotinine (a breakdown product of nicotine)&#xD;
      levels. Saliva and breath samples to test for cotinine and carbon monoxide levels are&#xD;
      collected at each visit. Saliva is collected by brushing the inside of the cheek with a&#xD;
      cotton swab, and breath samples are collected by having the woman blow into a tube connected&#xD;
      to a machine. Participants are evaluated four times during the study with questions about&#xD;
      their smoking behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the women's permission, their medical records, health, and treatments during pregnancy&#xD;
      are reviewed. At the end of the pregnancy, the infant's weight and health are also reviewed.&#xD;

      The overall focus of the proposed concept submitted by the George Washington University&#xD;
      Medical Center investigators is &quot;The Efficacy of NRT to Reduce the Risk of Nicotine Exposure&#xD;
      in Pregnant Minority Smokers.&quot; Prenatal smoke exposure to the fetus and environmental tobacco&#xD;
      smoke exposure of infants and children causes significant harm in both the short- and&#xD;
      long-term. Smoking during pregnancy is the foremost preventable cause of perinatal morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. There is strong evidence that these exposures are associated with low birth&#xD;
      weight (LBW) and infant mortality, respiratory illness, ear infections, tonsillectomy and&#xD;
      adenoidectomy, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), developmental delay, and&#xD;
      increased health care utilization and hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      George Washington University Medical Center investigators are submitting two concept papers&#xD;
      that aim to test the efficacy of innovative intervention methods tailored to reduce fetal and&#xD;
      infant exposure to nicotine secondary to maternal smoking and environmental tobacco exposure.&#xD;
