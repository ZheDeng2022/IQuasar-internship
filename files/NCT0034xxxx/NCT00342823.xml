  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially fatal disease caused in South America by the&#xD;
      protozoan Leishmania chagasi. In neighborhoods with high exposure rates, the outcome of human&#xD;
      infection with L. chagasi ranges from asymptomatic to a disseminated wasting disease called&#xD;
      visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Several studies document familial clustering of VL in&#xD;
      populations at risk. Segregation analyses favor a genetic over an environmental model for&#xD;
      susceptibility to L. chagasi infection. A peri-urban outbreak of VL near the Universidade&#xD;
      Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) in Natal, northeast Brazil, has allowed us to identify&#xD;
      endemic neighborhoods with ongoing transmission of L. chagasi infection. Natal is ideal for&#xD;
      this study because endemic neighborhoods are easily accessible, people are motivated to&#xD;
      cooperate with measures to control VL, and other forms of leishmaniasis are not transmitted&#xD;
      in the region. Dr. Jeronimo of the UFRN, and Dr. Mary Wilson at University of Iowa have&#xD;
      collected clinical data and DNA from 400 VL families living in these endemic neighborhoods.&#xD;
      We have created an unprecedented cohort through which we can identify four distinct&#xD;
      phenotypic responses after L. chagasi exposure. We documented familial clustering of L.&#xD;
      chagasi infection, and results of both correlation and segregation analyses are consistent&#xD;
      with the hypothesis that genetic factors predispose, in part, to the diverse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes after infection. Polymorphism in the TNF locus is associated with developing&#xD;
      symptomatic as opposed to asymptomatic disease after infection. We recently completed a&#xD;
      genome-wide scan of the quantitative immune response (DTH) and identified potential linkage&#xD;
      regions on chromosomes 2, 13, 15 and 19. We have also identified a small linkage peak on&#xD;
      chromosome 9 for VL. In our ongoing study, we will next perform fine mapping of these regions&#xD;
      using dense SNPs to identify genes that may determine susceptibility to L. chagasi infection.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will also analyze candidate genes for association/linkage with&#xD;
      susceptibility to or protection from L. chagasi disease. We recently identified an&#xD;
      association on chromosome 5 with the DTH immune response among two linkage disequilibrium&#xD;
      blocks spanning multiple immune related genes.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We used three approaches to identify families in endemic neighborhoods, yielding three&#xD;
        populations of families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Population I: A neighborhood to the northeast of the city was identified through a family&#xD;
        with two cases of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Population 2: Individuals with suspected VL are admitted to one of three public hospitals&#xD;
        in Natal. Families were interviewed and examined if they wished to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Population 3: The neighboring families living closest to population 2 families were&#xD;
        identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with ongoing illnesses other than VL were excluded from analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any medical conditions found or suspected based upon history, exam or blood tests were&#xD;
        either treated by the investigators or referred to the appropriate medical facility in&#xD;
        Natal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women and children less than 1 year were not given any skin test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No exclusions based on ethnicity were done.&#xD;
