  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study the prevalence of thyroid nodules and cancer in relation to radiation&#xD;
      dose, in a defined cohort of Kazakhstan residents exposed as children to radioactive fallout&#xD;
      from atomic bomb tests at the neighboring Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS). The population near&#xD;
      the STS is believed to have received radiation doses from fallout that were much higher than&#xD;
      that experienced by any population of comparable size in the US. The study population is a&#xD;
      defined cohort of 20,000 residents, half of whom, in 1960, resided in heavily-exposed&#xD;
      villages; the other half lived in lightly-exposed villages. The population is rural, with a&#xD;
      diet that was and is heavily dependent upon fresh milk from household or local cows and&#xD;
      therefore likely to have led to ingestion of radioactive iodine from fallout. The study is&#xD;
      two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part involves a cytogenetic assay for radiation biodosimetry purposes of peripheral&#xD;
      lymphocytes obtained from blood samples donated by 40 cohort members with individuals&#xD;
      radiation dose estimates. Blood samples will be collected from 25 putative high-dose and 15&#xD;
      low-dose cohort members and processed or cytogenetic assay using fluorescent in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (FISH) for stable chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes. This&#xD;
      biodosimetric validation assay, will be carried out by Nailya Chaizhunusova, chief of&#xD;
      cytogenetics at the Scientific research Institute for Radiation Medicine and Ecology, in&#xD;
      collaboration with Dr. Tracy Yang at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. It&#xD;
      should be possible to detect gamma radiation doses as low as 150 mGy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part will involve thyroid screening by ultrasound in selected villages. The&#xD;
      population to be screened will comprise 100-1500 members of the study cohort exposed as young&#xD;
      children to high fallout levels, and equal numbers of comparable ages exposed to little or no&#xD;
      fallout. Fine needle aspiration biopsy will be performed, under separate informed consent, if&#xD;
      the palpation and ultrasound results suggest presence of a tumor. Presence and malignancy of&#xD;
      tumor will be determined by cytopathology. Subjects with evidence of thyroid disease will be&#xD;
      referred to thyroid specialists at the Semipalatinsk State Medical Academy. Finger stick&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained to assess thyroid function using RIA methods with coated tube&#xD;
      technology for T4 and TSH. The most sensitive statistical comparisons are expected to be&#xD;
      dose-response analyses with respect to prevalence of thyroid nodules, which are common and&#xD;
      known to be associated with radiation dose. Comparisons in terms of thyroid cancer, and&#xD;
      benign and malignant neoplasms combined, are likely to be less sensitive but of acceptable&#xD;
      power if risks associated with chronic radiation in this population are similar to those&#xD;
      associated with acute exposure to X-ray or gamma radiation in other populations.&#xD;

      We propose to study the prevalence of thyroid nodules and cancer in relation to radiation&#xD;

      therefore likely to have led to ingestion of radioactive iodine from fallout. The study is&#xD;
      two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part involves a cytogenetic assay for radiation biodosimetry purposes of peripheral&#xD;
      lymphocytes obtained from blood samples donated by 40 cohort members with individuals&#xD;
      radiation dose estimates, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) assays of about 110&#xD;
      stored tooth samples. The two techniques are complementary. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      from 25 putative high-dose and 15 low-dose cohort members and processed or cytogenetic assay&#xD;
      using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for stable chromosome aberrations in&#xD;
      peripheral lymphocytes. This biodosimetric validation assay, will be carried out by Nailya&#xD;
      Chaizhunusova, chief of cytogenetics at the Scientific research Institute for Radiation&#xD;
      Medicine and Ecology, in collaboration with Dr. Tracy Yang at the NASA Johnson Space Center&#xD;
      in Houston, Texas. It should be possible to detect gamma radiation doses as low as 150 mGy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EPR investigation will take advantage of a repository of teeth extracted by local&#xD;
      dentists during medical and dental programs in 1966-67 and 1999, stored, and catalogued by&#xD;
      our collaborators in Kazakhstan (not in connection with this study). Tooth samples are&#xD;
      identified by village of exposure, but not individually within villages. However, the&#xD;
      identities of the donors, and therefore their ages and exposure histories, are known to our&#xD;
      collaborators in Kazakhstan; therefore it will be possible to compare the EPR results with&#xD;
      gamma dose estimates calculated on the basis of exposure history. It is intended that the EPR&#xD;
      assays will be carried out at the National Institute of Standards and Technology under a&#xD;
      purchase order agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part will involve thyroid screening by ultrasound in selected villages. The&#xD;
      population to be screened will comprise 1000-1500 members of the study cohort exposed as&#xD;
      young children to high fallout levels, and equal numbers of comparable ages exposed to little&#xD;
      or no fallout. Fine needle aspiration biopsy will be performed, under separate informed&#xD;
      consent, if the palpation and ultrasound results suggest presence of a tumor. Presence and&#xD;
      malignancy of tumor will be determined by cytopathology. Subjects with evidence of thyroid&#xD;
      disease will be referred to thyroid specialists at the Semipalatinsk State Medical Academy.&#xD;
      Finger stick blood samples will be obtained to assess thyroid function using RIA methods with&#xD;
      coated tube technology for T4 and TSH. The most sensitive statistical comparisons are&#xD;
      expected to be dose-response analyses with respect to prevalence of thyroid nodules, which&#xD;
      are common and known to be associated with radiation dose. Comparisons in terms of thyroid&#xD;
      cancer, and benign and malignant neoplasms combined, are likely to be less sensitive but of&#xD;
      acceptable power if risks associated with chronic radiation in this population are similar to&#xD;
      those associated with acute exposure to X-ray or gamma radiation in other populations.&#xD;
