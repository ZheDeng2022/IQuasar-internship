    <textblock>
      Postpartum infections are among the leading causes of maternal mortality world-wide,&#xD;
      particularly in under-resourced countries. Available data suggests that HIV infected women&#xD;
      are at greater risk of postpartum complications than uninfected women. In South Africa,&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS and related infections are now cumulatively the leading causes of maternal deaths&#xD;
      (though indirectly), with puerperal sepsis among the 5 most common causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prospective longitudinal cohort of HIV infected (n = 675) and uninfected (n = 648)&#xD;
      women. These were women in whom vaginal delivery was anticipated, and were recruited at &gt; 36&#xD;
      weeks of gestation during the antenatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis - HIV infected women are at increased risk of postpartum infectious morbidity and&#xD;
      this morbidity can be reduced by use of prophylactic intrapartum antibiotics.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 582 000 women die world-wide&#xD;
      each year due to pregnancy related conditions that could be prevented. Most of these deaths&#xD;
      occur in developing countries1. Some of the underlying causes of increased maternal morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality are HIV-related. In South Africa the antenatal HIV seroprevalence surveys&#xD;
      report an infection rate of 32%, the highest among the Sub-Saharan countries2. According to&#xD;
      the Saving Mothers Report (NCCEMD) pregnancy-related sepsis was the fourth commonest cause of&#xD;
      maternal mortality, while AIDS was the second leading cause3. Of the 67 women who died of&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS in 1998, 41 died from puerperal sepsis of which 54% had a vaginal delivery and 46%&#xD;
      had a caesarean section. It is not clear from the report to what extent HIV infection had&#xD;
      contributed to the severity of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical impression is that women with HIV infection have a higher incidence of post&#xD;
      delivery morbidity than HIV-negative women. Proposed contributory factors include, low CD4&#xD;
      count and associated impaired immunological function, other obstetric complications and&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The puerperal sepsis rate is about 2-6 % in most studies. It is however much higher in women&#xD;
      with bacterial vaginosis (14%)2 and those who deliver out of health institutions (18%)3.&#xD;
      Women with HIV infection are more likely to harbour BV and other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections. For this and other reasons it is generally accepted that HIV-positive women are&#xD;
      at increased risk of puerperal infectious morbidity and mortality independent of the mode of&#xD;
      delivery and antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Di Lieto et al4 reported a 33.8 % incidence of infectious morbidity following emergency&#xD;
      caesarean delivery. The incidence of infectious morbidity has been reported to be higher in&#xD;
      HIV positive women compared to HIV negative women (Semprini et al. 1995)5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of prophylactic antibiotics in obstetric complications has been previously&#xD;
      investigated especially in women with preterm labour, prelabour rupture of membranes, cardiac&#xD;
      disease and women delivered by caesarean section. There is good evidence that prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics significantly reduce postpartum morbidity. In these studies prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics were largely administered intra-operatively. The question that remains is whether&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics need to be given to only women identified as at risk or to all women&#xD;
      with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of biochemical (laboratory)/immune markers will be of value in the timing&#xD;
      of clinical interventions. The markers that can be used to predict sepsis will be to&#xD;
      determine the level of apoptosis in neutrophils, neutrophil function, C-Reactive protein&#xD;
      levels, ESR and the levels of the following cytokines viz. TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10.&#xD;
      Less clear is the role that apoptosis and it's dysregulation may play in pathological immune&#xD;
      states like sepsis, autoimmune disease, or immunosuppressed states. The potential role of&#xD;
      apoptosis and the pathogenesis of sepsis have resulted in some unanswered questions- (1)&#xD;
      whether impairment of apoptosis as a method of down-regulating pro-inflammatory cells&#xD;
      causally results in inappropriate persistence of inflammation under septic conditions and (2)&#xD;
      whether increased apoptosis of immune effector cells results in immunosuppression and&#xD;
      increased susceptibility to overwhelming infection? Neutrophils are the first immune cells to&#xD;
      migrate to sites of inflammation and major functions include phagocytosis of&#xD;
      bacteria,apoptosis of neutrophils may be one of the mechanisms of limiting tissue injury at&#xD;
      sites of inflammation and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils inhibits the release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes. Lower absolute neutrophil counts are associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of hospitalization for serious infection among HIV infected patients.&#xD;
      Because neutrophils are functionally impaired, we hypothesize that sepsis observed in HIV&#xD;
      infection might be a result of accelerated apoptosis. This study will therefore try to define&#xD;
      the mechanisms, direct or indirect, by which HIV infection may dysregulate apoptosis and&#xD;
      cytokine production in the pathogenesis of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary puerperal sepsis remains a major cause of maternal mortality in South Africa. The&#xD;
      clinical experience in Durban, is that postpartum infections are on the increase particularly&#xD;
      in view of the high prevalence of HIV. Clear guidelines are needed for the role of&#xD;
      antibiotics among women at risk for postdelivery morbidity associated with infections.&#xD;
      Current recommendations by the NCCEMD of SA indicate that all women with AIDS and women&#xD;
      having caesarean sections be treated prophylactically with antibiotics. However, guidelines&#xD;
      regarding timing of antibitiotic prophylaxis remain unclear6. This study therefore sets out&#xD;
      to establish reliable data on the incidence of postdelivery morbidity including puerperal&#xD;
      sepsis, associated risk factors, laboratory markers and an effective antibiotic regimen to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of postdelivery morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To evaluate the role of intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics in HIV infected women in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of postdelivery morbidity as assessed by clinical and immunological&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Antibiotics administered during labour can reduce postdelivery morbidity in HIV&#xD;
      infected women STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary: To reduce the incidence of post-delivery infections&#xD;
      by use of prophylactic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To investigate immunological parameters as markers of post-delivery infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify risk factors for post-delivery infections. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints for this study will be the incidence of post-delivery infectious morbidity&#xD;
      diagnosed between delivery and 6 weeks post-delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective double blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics for delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION The study will be conducted at King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban and Umtata&#xD;
      Hospital, Transkei over a 2 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have been counselled and tested for HIV during the antenatal period, and who have&#xD;
      agreed to know their results, will be enrolled during the antenatal period. Informed written&#xD;
      consent for participation in the study will be obtained from all voluntary participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological studies will be conducted in a subsample (25%) of patients in each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with known HIV status as documented by routine rapid HIV tests, following pre-test&#xD;
           voluntary counselling and testing (VCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who gave informed study consent. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women on antibiotic therapy less than 2 weeks prior to study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women planned for elective caesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obstetric complications such as preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, cardiac disease,&#xD;
           antepartum haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will occur on admission to the labour ward. The following tests will be&#xD;
      performed prior to randomisation i.e at enrolment: full blood count(FBC), CD4 count and&#xD;
      ano-genital swabs for microbiology. The women will be randomly assigned to one of the three&#xD;
      groups, depending on HIV status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: HIV-POSITIVE given antibiotics (Cefoxitin 2g IVI stat dose) Group 2: HIV-POSITIVE&#xD;
      given placebo Group 3: HIV-NEGATIVE (no placebo or cefoxitin = control group) Rationale for&#xD;
      placebo and choice of antibiotic: The current standard practice is not to give prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics for delivery to women without risk factors irrespective of HIV status. This&#xD;
      justifies a placebo-controlled design. In this unit the current standard practice is to&#xD;
      administer intravenous cefoxitin (2g stat dose) to women for whom prophylactic antibiotic is&#xD;
      indicated. We therefore intend to use cefoxitin for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Considering a 15% puerperal sepsis rate among HIV positive women following&#xD;
      vaginal and emergency caesarean section delivery a sample size of 343 will be required in&#xD;
      each group (placebo and study group) to observe a 33% reduction in the sepsis rate. This&#xD;
      would detect a significant difference at 5 % level (p &lt; 0.05) with the power of 90%.&#xD;
      Therefore the appropriate sample sizes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 ( HIV-positive, antibiotic): 343 Group 2 (HIV-positive, placebo): 343 Group 3&#xD;
      (HIV-negative, 686 )&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATION PLAN Study procedure at each visit Visit 1 (baseline and enrolment) will take&#xD;
      place at the antenatal clinic at the respective sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will occur after the mother has received post-test counselling. At the baseline the&#xD;
      mother will be informed of the study, both verbally and in writing, she will then sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, maternal medical history and HIV related symptoms and signs will be&#xD;
      documented and HIV disease staging will be carried out, pap smears and CD 4 counts will be&#xD;
      done at enrolment. A physical and obstetrical examination will be done and the mothers will&#xD;
      be randomised into one of 3 groups depending on their HIV status and the antibiotic regimen&#xD;
      to be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (labour/delivery) A diagnosis of labour will be made clinically. Women with HIV and&#xD;
      confirmed to be in labour will be randomised into either the antibiotic or placebo group. A&#xD;
      single dose of mefoxin or a similarly looking placebo will be administered. All women with&#xD;
      HIV infection will be given a single dose of nevirapine ( and their newborns will receive&#xD;
      0.6ml of nevirapine 24-72 hours post-birth). During labour artificial rupture of membranes&#xD;
      will be delayed; and invasive monitoring, use of instruments for delivery and episiotomy will&#xD;
      be avoided where possible. Women will also be advised on the benefits and risks of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding and formula feeding and they will be further informed on their choice of an&#xD;
      appropriate feeding method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be taken for the following: apoptosis of neutrophils, neutrophil function, FBC,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein. Serum samples will also be stored for the determination of cytokines&#xD;
      levels. A cervical vaginal swab will also be done, for microbilogical evaluation. Urine will&#xD;
      be analysed by means of dipstix, and microscopy and culture will be reserved for symptomatic&#xD;
      patients on significant findings on dipstix. CD4 counts will be done by a private&#xD;
      pathologist. The reason for this is that the mothers will be enrolled during the day and&#xD;
      night and will thus need a 24-hour service for the CD4 counts and the FBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (24-48 hours post delivery) An infection symptom review and physical examination will&#xD;
      be done. In addition blood samples will be take for the evaluation of apoptosis, neutrophil&#xD;
      function test, FBC and C-reactive protein. Serum will be stored for cytokines assays. A wound&#xD;
      swab will be done where indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 This will take place 1-week post delivery. A physical and obstetrical examination&#xD;
      will be carried . A wound swab will also be done. An infant evaluation including laboratory&#xD;
      parameters will also be carried out during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 This will take place 2 weeks post-delivery. A physical and examination and an&#xD;
      infection symptoms review will be carried out at this visit. A wound swab will also be done,&#xD;
      where indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 This will take place 6 weeks post-delivery. A physical and infection symptom review&#xD;
      will be done. Blood samples will be taken for CD4 counts and FBC. When necessary, a pap smear&#xD;
      and wound swab will also be done at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to protocol Mothers will be encouraged to make every attempt to complete the&#xD;
      protocol as specified, and will be reimbursed for transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts and Withdrawals Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time or&#xD;
      may be withdrawn if they fail to comply with the study requirements or investigators&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure will be puerperal sepsis defined as a&#xD;
      temperature of 38C on two separate occasions due to genital tract infection and&#xD;
      endometritis. Secondary measures will include other clinical infections, neonatal sepsis,&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay and surgery for puerperal sepsis. Clinical infections include&#xD;
      urinary tract infections, pneumonia and wound sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING A standard data form will be completed for each subject. Study&#xD;
      participants will not be identified by any name on any of the study documents. Subjects will&#xD;
      be identified by a Study Identification Number. The data will be entered into a computerised&#xD;
      database EPI info version 6 software program. The same shall be used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study co-ordinator will be responsible for the accuracy of the database and to determine&#xD;
      that all regulatory requirements surrounding the trial are met. A data safety and monitoring&#xD;
      team will meet quarterly to assess the safety and accuracy of the data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval This protocol and the informed consent and any subsequent modifications will&#xD;
      be reviewed by the Ethics Committee of the University of Natal. Written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from the participants. The informed consent form will describe the study, the&#xD;
      procedures to be followed and the risks and benefits of the participation. A copy of the&#xD;
      informed consent form will be given to the subjects.&#xD;
