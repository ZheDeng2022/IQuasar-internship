  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of all Americans will die from cardiovascular disease caused by the build up of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque within coronary arteries. Most deaths in these patients arise from the&#xD;
      development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina,&#xD;
      or sudden death. ACS is characterized by coronary plaque erosion or rupture, which is&#xD;
      triggered by endothelial changes, including inflammation, and thrombosis. Diabetes, with&#xD;
      insulin resistance as a major component, has been shown to engender adverse metabolic events&#xD;
      within the endothelial cell [1], including impaired endothelial function, augmented&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, increased inflammation and thrombosis. Activation of the transcription&#xD;
      factors nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) induces inflammatory gene&#xD;
      expression, with liberation of leukocyte-attracting chemokines, increased production of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, and augmented expression of cellular adhesion molecules. These&#xD;
      metabolic processes may therefore play a significant role in the development of ACS.The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that rosiglitazone and metformin, or the combination of both may provide&#xD;
      positive anti-atherogenic effect, even among patients without diabetes. This pilot study&#xD;
      proposes to evaluate the effect of placebo vs. combined rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandamet®)&#xD;
      on surrogate blood markers of atherosclerosis activity among non-diabetic and pre-diabetic&#xD;
      patients with known stable coronary syndromes. This will provide further evidence justifying&#xD;
      a large definitive outcomes-based clinical trial.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial comparing combined&#xD;
      rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandametä) to placebo in subjects with normal or intermediate&#xD;
      fasting glucose (IFG) and stable coronary artery disease.Subjects meeting entry criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or combined rosiglitazone/metformin&#xD;
      (Avandametä) 4/1000 mg. Laboratory specimens including high sensitivity C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (hs-CRP), glucose, HgbA1C, complete lipid profile, will be obtained after a 10 hour fast as&#xD;
      specified by study visits. Subjects will return for repeat study visits at 2, 4, 6 and 8&#xD;
      months for repeat laboratory evaluations, including safety labs consisting of serum&#xD;
      creatinine, liver enzymes, and a CBC. Additionally, subjects will have IL-6 and TNF-a&#xD;
      measured for research purposes at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits. All subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for a minimum of 8 months. This pilot study proposes to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      placebo, or combined rosiglitazone/metformin onsurrogate blood markers of atherosclerosis&#xD;
      activity among non-diabetic and pre-diabetic patients with known stable coronary syndromes.&#xD;
