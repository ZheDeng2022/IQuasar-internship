  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chemopreventive efficacy of Se was tested in a 10-year human intervention trial; total&#xD;
      and lung cancer mortality, total cancer incidence, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer&#xD;
      incidence decreased. This study is designed to compare, via stable isotope tracer studies the&#xD;
      kinetics of inorganic and organic Se before and following two years of oral supplementation&#xD;
      with L-selenomethionine, to measure forms of Se in the plasma (extracellular Se-dependent&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidase [GSHPx], selenoprotein-P [SeP], albumin-bound Se [AlbSe] and&#xD;
      nonprotein-bound low molecular weight [LMWSe] fractions), and to determine the effects of&#xD;
      supplementation on the ecology of the hindgut microflora. The forms of Se were chosen to&#xD;
      resemble the metabolism of the principal forms of Se in mixed American diets. Sodium&#xD;
      selenite, an inorganic form, is metabolized by reduction to selenide which is then either&#xD;
      used in the co-translational synthesis of SeCys in specific Se-containing proteins (e.g.,&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidases, diodinases, selenoproteins P and W), or is converted to methylated&#xD;
      excretion products; in this sense it resembles the food form selenocysteine (SeCys) which is&#xD;
      metabolized to the selenide level. Selenomethionine (SeMet), an organic form, is a major form&#xD;
      of Se in many foods, particularly those of plan origin. In addition to being metabolized to&#xD;
      selenide, SeMet also enters the metabolic protein pool by competing with the&#xD;
      sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine. A study is proposed to assess the impact of&#xD;
      selenium (Se) supplementation on its metabolism in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study will be conducted to test recruitment strategies and sample collection,&#xD;
      preparation and analysis and to assess the detectability of two stable isotopes given&#xD;
      together. Four subjects will receive two 300 ug oral doses consisting of 150 ug of the stable&#xD;
      isotope 76Se as selenite and 150 ug of the stable isotope 74Se as selenomethionine on study&#xD;
      days one and twelve. Subjects will be followed for six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first pharmacokinetics tracer study (PK1), twenty-eight subjects will receive the same&#xD;
      two labeled stable isotope doses, and will be followed for 4 months. In addition, two&#xD;
      subjects who have been self-supplementing with 200 ug of Se as selenized yeast for two years&#xD;
      will take part in PK1 to assess the sensitivity over time of the tracer assay in supplemented&#xD;
      subjects. PK1 will be followed by a 2-yr supplementation period, in which all 28 subjects&#xD;
      will receive daily doses of 200 ug of L0SeMet; subjects = metabolism is expected to approach&#xD;
      a new steady state reflective of long-term supplementation. A second 4-month pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      tracer study (PK2) will then be conducted while subjects remain on Se-supplementation with an&#xD;
      extension of six monthly blood samples. Extensive sampling of plasma, urine, and feces during&#xD;
      PK1 and PK2 will permit both the refinement of existing baseline models for selenite and&#xD;
      selenomethionine metabolism in humans and the investigation of changes in metabolism arising&#xD;
      from Se-supplementation. The study is designed to detect a difference of 0.75 standard&#xD;
      deviation units in pre-versus post-supplementation rate parameters, assuming a two-sided test&#xD;
      with an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-absorbed portion of Se may favor portions of the normal colonic bacterial microflora&#xD;
      that produce certain short-chain fatty acids that colon cells use for energy. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, fecal specimens will be analyzed for short-chain fatty acids over the course of&#xD;
      Se-supplementation. In addition, the sampling of buccal cell-Se and of toenail-Se on a&#xD;
      quarterly basis over the course of the study and assay of thyroid hormone levels during the&#xD;
      first year of the study will permit the investigation of possible changes in levels resulting&#xD;
      from supplementation.&#xD;
