  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying preterm birth is very limited,&#xD;
      making prevention of preterm birth difficult. The incidence of preterm birth worldwide varies&#xD;
      between 6%-11% in singleton pregnancies, and 64-93% of preterm deliveries occur after the&#xD;
      spontaneous onset of labor (preterm labor). The risk factors associated with preterm birth&#xD;
      include demographic variables such as ethnic group, past obstetric history, and complications&#xD;
      of the current pregnancy such as infection and fetal congenital anomalies. The current study&#xD;
      aims to investigate the basic mechanisms of preterm labor by systematically cataloging the&#xD;
      changes in expression levels of all expressed genes whose sequences are available. The goals&#xD;
      will be accomplished by using microarray technology followed by subsequent confirmative or&#xD;
      complementary analyses.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consecutive patients admitted with the following diagnoses from four different ethnic&#xD;
        groups (Hispanic, African American, Asian, and Caucasian):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Preterm labor with intact membranes and with&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. acute inflammation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. chronic villitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. vascular pathology;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. no identifiable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Preterm delivery without labor because of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. pre-eclampsia;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. abruptio placentae;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. fetal anomalies;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Other complications (e.g. automobile accidents) that necessitate immediate&#xD;
                  delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. PROM leading to preterm delivery and with&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. acute inflammation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. chronic villitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. vascular pathology;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. no identifiable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Term delivery without labor and no identifiable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Term delivery in spontaneous labor and no identifiable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Term delivery with chorioamnionitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Term delivery with failed labor leading to ceasarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Refusal of written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

             significant hemorrhage, etc.)&#xD;
