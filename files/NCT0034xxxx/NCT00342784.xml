      This study will identify genes that predispose men to prostate cancer and affect the rate and&#xD;
      type of disease spread, the aggressiveness of the disease, and the long-term outcome. Several&#xD;
      studies show there is a genetic component to prostate cancer susceptibility, and that a&#xD;
      first-degree relative with prostate cancer increases a man's risk 2- to 3-fold compared to&#xD;
      those without a family history. The risk is significantly higher if the relative was&#xD;
      diagnosed at younger than 65 years of age, or if three or more first-degree relatives are&#xD;
      affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will try to locate prostate cancer genes in DNA samples using two methods: linkage&#xD;
      analysis and association studies. Traditionally, the search for a disease gene begins with&#xD;
      linkage analysis, in which the aim is to find the rough location of the gene relative to&#xD;
      another DNA sequence, called a &quot;genetic marker,&quot; whose position is already known. In genetic&#xD;
      association studies, genes from a large number of patients are compared with healthy controls&#xD;
      who are matched by age, race, and geographic region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA samples for this study come from patients in the two following studies at the Fred&#xD;
      Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family study: Participants are families with prostate cancer who have: 1) three or more&#xD;
      first-degree relatives with prostate cancer; 2) three generations with prostrate cancer&#xD;
      either through the maternal or paternal side of the family; or 3) two first-degree relatives&#xD;
      with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 65 or who were African American.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population-based study: Participants are patients with prostate cancer and matched healthy&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of prostate cancer genes important in susceptibility to the disease and&#xD;
      its aggressiveness may permit earlier detection and development of more directed and&#xD;
      effective treatments based on underlying genetics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The notion that there are prostate cancer susceptibility genes has since been suggested by&#xD;
      case-control, cohort and twin studies. The effect is strongest among first-degree relatives,&#xD;
      where the relative risk estimates range from 1.7 to 3.7. Families reporting younger ages at&#xD;
      diagnosis and multiple relatives with prostate cancer were demonstrated even higher relative&#xD;
      risks. For example, compared to men with no family history, men with three or more&#xD;
      first-degree relatives with prostate cancer have almost an 11-fold increased risk. Although&#xD;
      the majority of studies focused on Caucasians, similar elevations in risk associated with a&#xD;
      family history of disease have been reported for Asian and African Americans. While the&#xD;
      majority of the data seems to point towards autosomal dominant genes, evidence for an&#xD;
      X-linked or recessive inheritance has also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last decade, others and we have been devoted to the search for hereditary prostate&#xD;
      cancer (HPC) loci either by linkage or by association with candidate genes. A generally&#xD;
      agreed upon definition of HPC families now exists. These are families in which there is&#xD;
      either: 1) prostate cancer in three or more first-degree relatives; 2) prostate cancer in&#xD;
      three successive generations; or 3) a cluster of two relatives diagnosed at less than or&#xD;
      equal to 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Armed with these criteria, others and we have collected large data sets of likely hereditary&#xD;
      families and undertaken genome wide scans. However, locus heterogeneity issues have made the&#xD;
      task difficult. There are clearly many genes that contribute to prostate cancer&#xD;
      susceptibility, and many are likely to be weakly penetrant. We have stratified the data&#xD;
      derived from our genome scan by a number of likely factors such as age at diagnosis, number&#xD;
      of affected men, founder effects aggressiveness of disease, and presence of other cancers in&#xD;
      the family to develop more homogeneous datasets. We propose to continue those sorts of&#xD;
      studies, as well as focus on cloning genes in regions we and others have identified to date.&#xD;
      To test hypotheses that certain variants are associated with prostate cancer susceptibility&#xD;
      or progression of disease, will also conduct association studies in a population-based, case&#xD;
      control study of middle aged men with prostate cancer. This will allow us to test the&#xD;
      putative association of candidate genes and SNPs in prostate cancer susceptibility,&#xD;
      aggressivity, and long-term outcomes.&#xD;
