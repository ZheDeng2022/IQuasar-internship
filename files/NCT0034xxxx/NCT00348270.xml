      This study is a comparison of the quality of vision provided by AMO Tecnis Z9000 three-piece&#xD;
      silicone posterior chamber intraocular lens and Alcon Laboratories MA60 three-piece acrylic&#xD;
      posterior chamber intraocular lens.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Today, intraocular lenses (IOLs) are routinely implanted after cataract extraction. Cataract&#xD;
      surgical techniques are constantly developing due to innovations in surgical implantation and&#xD;
      IOL manufacturing processes. Although material development and surgical implantation have&#xD;
      advanced extensively during the past several years, there has been little attention paid to&#xD;
      the improvement of the optical quality of IOLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been documented that the vision of an IOL patient is no better than that of a person&#xD;
      with healthy eyes of a similar age, i.e., when a 65-year-old patient with cataracts has them&#xD;
      removed and implanted with an IOL, the resulting visual outcome is no better than the visual&#xD;
      quality of a 65-year-old without cataracts. The fact that the visual quality of the IOL&#xD;
      patients is no better than that of their same-age counterparts is surprising because an IOL&#xD;
      is optically superior to the natural crystalline lens. This fact may be explained by&#xD;
      aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aberrations cause incoming light that would otherwise be focused to a point to be blurred,&#xD;
      which in turn causes a reduction in visual quality. This reduction in quality is more severe&#xD;
      under low luminance conditions because ocular aberrations increase when the pupil size gets&#xD;
      larger. The Z9000 is an IOL that is designed to counteract the spherical aberration of the&#xD;
      cornea and thus improve the resulting visual quality of IOL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different materials and lens designs result in different visual quality. The handling of the&#xD;
      lens, proper centration in the eye, the postoperative course, and the optical image may vary&#xD;
      depending on the design of the lens. Two lenses will be compared: AMO Tecnis Z9000&#xD;
      three-piece silicone lens and Alcon Laboratories MA60 three-piece acrylic lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, evaluator-masked study in bilateral cataract surgery patients.&#xD;
      Each patient will be assigned to a AMO Tecnis Z9000 lens in one eye and an Alcon Laboratories&#xD;
      MA60 lens in the other eye. All first surgeries will be on the right eye. A randomization&#xD;
      list will be used to decide lens allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 patients (men and women) from the Singapore National Eye Centre will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. All patients will undergo wavefront analysis 90-120 days&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two lens models look different, even in the eye, after implantation. It is not possible&#xD;
      to mask the individual investigator at the time of surgery or personnel responsible for&#xD;
      conducting the clinical ocular examinations (e.g., evaluation of complications, posterior&#xD;
      capsule, IOP, pupil size) and optic evaluations (e.g., evaluation of the IOL).&#xD;
