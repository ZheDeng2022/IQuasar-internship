  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is manifested as a heterogeneous mixture of clinical and&#xD;
      bichemical characteristics that complicate study of its etiology. It is currently unclear to&#xD;
      what extent PCOS-associated traits (hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease) are the&#xD;
      result of environmental factors or genetic predisposition. We propose to conduct a twin study&#xD;
      to investigate the possibility that environmental factors are important in the development of&#xD;
      the PCOS phenotype. Twin studies are considered to be the gold standard for determining the&#xD;
      extent of heritability of a trait. The proposal described here is only for Step 1 of a&#xD;
      larger, multi-step study. The major goal of step 1 is to identify a large cohort of twin&#xD;
      pairs, in which at least one member of each pair is likely to have PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for this study will come from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (MATR). Many (3283)&#xD;
      potential participants have already been identified based on their answers to a preliminary&#xD;
      MATR screening questionnaire. Out of the approximately 7145 twin women of reproductive age&#xD;
      who completed these MATR screening questionnaires, 1803 women reported irregular periods, 954&#xD;
      reported ovarian cysts, and 526 reported both irregular periods and ovarian cysts. Many of&#xD;
      the women in this last group are likely to have PCOS. They represent 7.4% of the total&#xD;
      sample, matching current estimates of PCOS prevalence (4-7%) in reproductive age women. We&#xD;
      will also add new twin pairs who meet the criteria (irregular periods and evidence of PCOS or&#xD;
      cystic ovaries) as they are recruited into the MATR and take the preliminary surveys.&#xD;
      According to MATR statistics, about 33% of twin pairs are monozygotic (MZ, identical).&#xD;
      Therefore, approximately 174 of the 526 women likely to have PCOS are members of a MZ pair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 of the proposed study consists of a telephone survey of the 3282 women with irregular&#xD;
      periods and/or ovarian cysts. The survey will be conducted by the MATR. The instrument to be&#xD;
      used contains a series of simple and direct questions and will take about 10 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. The questions were designed to identify PCOS and their content deals with the&#xD;
      frequency of menstrual periods (six or fewer per year being a major diagnostic criterion), a&#xD;
      previous diagnosis of PCOS, obesity, excess facial hair and other evidence of&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism. The women will also be asked if t...&#xD;

      basis of this survey, women will be identified who are likely to have PCOS and have a living&#xD;
      female twin.&#xD;
