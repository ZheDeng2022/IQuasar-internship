  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct an interdisciplinary case-control/sib-pair study of lung cancer designed to&#xD;
      explore the genetic determinants both of lung cancer and of smoking. The study includes&#xD;
      biospecimen collection as well as exposure information with power to address main genetic&#xD;
      effects and gene-environment interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an integrated proposal designed to address two major issues: the genetic determinants&#xD;
      of lung cancer in smokers and the genetic determinants of smoking. Other important issues&#xD;
      will be addressed in the study with a marginal additional cost to the main design. The study&#xD;
      achieves excellent power for studying the main effects of genetic factors that are relatively&#xD;
      common and good power for formal tests of interactive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a case-control design, with questionnaire, medical record abstraction, and blood&#xD;
      collection, we will investigate: main effects of genes on lung cancer risk; gene-environment&#xD;
      and gene-gene effects in lung cancer etiology; gene effects on smoking persistence; gene&#xD;
      effects on ever-never smoking; gene-psychological interactions in smoking behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will collect viable lymphocytes from all study subjects and tumor,&#xD;
      metaplastic and normal tissue samples from 100 surgical cases. With these data and tissues,&#xD;
      we will be able to study: genetic instabilities in lung cancer tissue in relation to specific&#xD;
      exposures, genotype, persistence of smoking, and clinical presentation of lung cancer;&#xD;
      histologic characteristics of lung cancer in relation to genotype, gene expression, somatic&#xD;
      mutations, and smoking; functional assays in viable lmphocytes in relation to genotype, gene&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we will identify lung cancer-affected siblings of cases, and the unaffected siblings&#xD;
      in the same sibships. This sample will permit us to: replicate associations found in the&#xD;
      case-control sample with an alternative analytical method based on transmission statistics;&#xD;
      address some population stratification issues.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an interdisciplinary multicenter case-control study of lung cancer situated in Milan&#xD;
      Italy, designed to explore the genetic determinants both of lung cancer and of smoking. We&#xD;
      enrolled newly diagnosed lung cancer cases within a defined area around Milan Italy, and&#xD;
      population-based controls from the same area. The study includes biospecimen collection as&#xD;
      well as epidemiological and clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an integrated proposal designed to address two major issues: the genetic determinants&#xD;
      of lung cancer and the genetic determinants of smoking. Other important issues arc addressed&#xD;
      in the study with a marginal additional cost to the main design. The study achieves excellent&#xD;
      power for studying the main effects of genetic factors that are relatively common and good&#xD;
      power for formal tests of interactive eftects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a case-control design, with questionnaire, medical record abstraction, and blood&#xD;
      collection. we can investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  main effects of genes on lung cancer risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gene-environment and gene-gene effects in lung cancer etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gene effects on smoking persistence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  genes effects on ever-never smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we have collected viable lymphocytes from all study subjects and tumor,&#xD;
      metaplastic and normal tissue samples from at least 400 surgical cases. With these data and&#xD;
      tissues, we can study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  genetic instabilities in lung cancer tissue in relation to specific exposures, genotype,&#xD;
           persistence of smoking, and clinical presentation of lung cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  histologic characteristics of lung cancer in relation to genotype, gene expression,&#xD;
           methylation. somatic mutations, and smoking;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional assays in viable lymphocytes in relation to genotype, gene expression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover. we are collecting clinical reports of treatments, quality of life, recurrence,&#xD;
      toxicities, and survival from all cases that consented. With this material we will be able to&#xD;
      link the genetic profiles of the cases with data on therapy efficacy, toxicity and survival,&#xD;
      to contribute to the improvement of treatment for lung cancer.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - CASE GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The case group will consist of 2,000 newly incident lung cancer cases, male and female, 35&#xD;
        to 79 years old, with verified lung cancer, collected before or after surgery and prior to&#xD;
        chemotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
