  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza (flu) viruses change continuously, therefore also the parts of viruses used in&#xD;
      influenza vaccines can vary from year to year. In Europe, manufacturers/marketing holders of&#xD;
      these vaccines are required to be involved in ongoing clinical trials and to present the&#xD;
      results to the competent authorities each year. The current study is a phase IIIa clinical&#xD;
      trial with a commercially available virosomal vaccine (Invivac速) supplied in pre filled&#xD;
      syringes. It is part of the ongoing clinical trial program for Invivac速 and will be done to&#xD;
      assess the immunogenicity and safety and tolerability of next season's trivalent influenza&#xD;
      virosomal vaccine in two groups of healthy subjects: subjects aged &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 60 years and&#xD;
      subjects &gt;= 61 years of age (elderly).&#xD;
