      The 'Open Window' Study is a prospective longitudinal study using a 4 group randomised&#xD;
      control trial design to evaluate the psychological effect of 'Open Window' on the&#xD;
      consequences of long term isolation on patients undergoing stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      treatment of haematological malignancies. This study uses a randomised control trial design,&#xD;
      which is widely used in healthcare settings to test the effects of interventions and testing&#xD;
      cause and effect relationships between variables. A mixed methods approach for data&#xD;
      collection and data analysis is being used. This will facilitate measurement of patients'&#xD;
      psychological response to 'Open Window' using questionnaires and exploration of subjective&#xD;
      feelings in relation to personal experiences of having a stem cell transplant through semi&#xD;
      structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Open Window' has no effect on patients' levels of anxiety, depression, or distress when&#xD;
      undergoing a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 199 patients in the study, 96 were randomized to the intervention group and 103 to the&#xD;
      control group. Participants in the intervention group had significantly reduced levels of&#xD;
      anxiety on the day before transplant (P = 0.001), at day 7 (P = 0.041), and day 60 (P =&#xD;
      0.035). There was a significant reduction in depression before transplant (P= 0.022).&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group reported better experiences (P &lt; 0.005).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      'Open Window' is a unique and novel intervention for patients being treated for&#xD;
      haematological malignancies in the 'National Stem Cell Transplant Unit', St. James' Hospital,&#xD;
      Dublin, Ireland. Treatment programmes include allogeneic and autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation for leukaemia and related disorders. This unit comprises 21 single&#xD;
      air-conditioned rooms in which patients are treated and cared for. The unit is located on the&#xD;
      ground floor of a large hospital and the view out of most of the windows is limited to the&#xD;
      light railway system at best and the air conditioning unit at worst. Windows in the rooms are&#xD;
      quite large although light and sunlight is limited in some by an adjacent building. The rooms&#xD;
      vary in size and shape and all are en suite and contain a bed, locker, easy chair and&#xD;
      TV/video mounted high on the wall, usually to the left, in front of the patient. All rooms&#xD;
      are painted in magnolia with a blue door to the en suite and exit. In order to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of infection, flowers and pictures hanging on the walls are prohibited and personal&#xD;
      items such as photos are limited. Blinds are used on the windows and bed covers are blue,&#xD;
      pink or green. The overall effect is minimalist and clinical due to the presence of medical&#xD;
      equipment. Visiting is limited and children under 14 years of age are not allowed to visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a new unit, The National Transplant Unit was not purpose built and the focus of the&#xD;
      design was in providing a protective environment for as many patients as possible within a&#xD;
      limited space and with very specific requirements. While it is arguable that the introduction&#xD;
      of colour to the walls and the inclusion of patterned curtains or bedspreads might enhance&#xD;
      the environment from a design perspective, in the absence of such an initiative, this&#xD;
      atmosphere provides an ideal opportunity to assess the effect of art on the experience of a&#xD;
      very specific group of patients in a controlled atmosphere. Redshaw (2004) suggests that&#xD;
      design alone does not provide spaces that are attractive, imaginative and engaging but that&#xD;
      it is the inclusion of art that does this. Her study on the impact of the provision of art in&#xD;
      a children's hospital is reported as providing a distraction for children and parents,&#xD;
      providing enjoyment and comfort, facilitating self-expression and building self-esteem and&#xD;
      confidence. This function of art in healthcare fulfills its role in providing a healing&#xD;
      environment and is the primary reason why it was considered an appropriate intervention for&#xD;
      the specific population of patients included in the 'Open Window' project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People have a basic need for contact with each other. Isolation from people, or separation&#xD;
      from familiar places, can cause feelings of despair, anger and hopelessness (Denton 1986;&#xD;
      Jenner 1990; Gammon 1998). Views of nature or people through a window reduce the negative&#xD;
      effects of isolation and can impact positively on psychological well-being (Kennedy &amp;&#xD;
      Hamilton 1997, Ulrich 1983). Due to the location, design and d√©cor of the rooms, the patients&#xD;
      in 'The National Stem Cell Transplant Unit' at St. James's have very little stimulation other&#xD;
      than TV, radio and reading. It is arguable that a patient-centred hospital environmental&#xD;
      design may be sufficient to make their experience more comfortable and aesthetically&#xD;
      pleasing; however, it is the inclusion of art in the environment that may provide a more&#xD;
      positive and enduring distraction for patients and have a positive influence on a patient's&#xD;
      sense of 'self' and well-being and overall psychological adjustment to having a life&#xD;
      threatening illness. This is important in providing holistic care for patients and may&#xD;
      influence their immediate and long-term recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Open Window' is an entirely art based intervention comprising a multimedia system that uses&#xD;
      a combination of video projectors, audio speakers and bespoke software to make images appear&#xD;
      as a 'virtual window' on the wall of the patients' room. Artists use mobile phone cameras and&#xD;
      camcorders to record the images that are sent to the unit over the internet and via mobile&#xD;
      phone networks. Original music composed for the project may also accompany the images as they&#xD;
      appear. The curator and artist in residence on the project can discuss with the patient and&#xD;
      family, the possibility of obtaining familiar and/or family images if they wish. Patients can&#xD;
      turn the system on, off and change the images by pressing the appropriate button on the&#xD;
      remote control. They can also choose to include or exclude certain images if they wish. The&#xD;
      volume of the music that accompanies some of the video channels can be controlled using the&#xD;
      remote control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artists are commissioned to create work for the 'Open Window' project and are aware of the&#xD;
      nature of the viewer and the context in which the art will be shown. The art in 'Open Window'&#xD;
      encourages the viewer to think about and engage in what they see from their own personal&#xD;
      frame of reference. The artist and theorist, Duchamp (1957, 3) described this process as the&#xD;
      viewer &quot;bringing the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting&#xD;
      its inner qualification&quot;. These principles give patients who wish to use 'Open Window' the&#xD;
      opportunity to become part of the creative process regardless of their past experience or&#xD;
      knowledge of art. Patients may benefit because 'Open Window' becomes whatever they want it to&#xD;
      be and helps them deal with their physical, psychological and social needs in a unique and&#xD;
      individualized way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Open Window' Intervention has three aims. The first is to help patients deal with being&#xD;
      in a restricted protective environment for 4-6 weeks. The second is to give patients a sense&#xD;
      of connection with the outside world and the third is to provide a medium through which&#xD;
      patients may reflect on having a life threatening illness, which may have immediate, and&#xD;
      long-term effects on their psychological adjustment to recovering from and possibly surviving&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and ninty nine patients took part in the study, 96 were randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group and 103 to the control group. The intervention group had significantly&#xD;
      reduced levels of anxiety on the day before transplant (P = 0.001), at day 7 (P = 0.041), and&#xD;
      day 60 (P = 0.035). Participants in the intervention group reported better experiences (P &lt;&#xD;
      0.005). Qualitative data showed that those in the intervention group reported that 'Open&#xD;
      Window' was a great distraction from their illness and isolation and provided a connection&#xD;
      with outside 'normal' life.&#xD;
