  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bleeding profile of norgestimate/ethinyl&#xD;
      estradiol, an oral contraceptive tablet, given in an extended regimen&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study evaluating the bleeding profile of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol&#xD;
      tablets administered as an extended regimen (84 consecutive days of active tablets followed&#xD;
      by seven days medication free) following a traditional regimen of two 28-day cycles (21 days&#xD;
      of active tablets, followed by seven days of placebo tablets) of norgestimate/ethinyl&#xD;
      estradiol tablets. All patients will receive norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol tablets in a&#xD;
      traditional regimen for two 28-day cycles. Following the Traditional Treatment Phase, all&#xD;
      patients will receive norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol tablets in an Extended Regimen Treatment&#xD;
      Phase, consisting of 84 days of treatment with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol tablets. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations include physical examinations, adverse event reporting and vital signs. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that a triphasic extended regimen would not result in breakthrough&#xD;
      bleeding and spotting when the progestin dose drops. Traditional Regimen: two 28 day cycles&#xD;
      of norgestimate 180 mcg daily for 1 week, 215 mcg daily for 1 week, 250 mcg daily for 1 week,&#xD;
      placebo daily for 1 week. Extended Regimen: four uninterrupted cycles of norgestimate 180 mcg&#xD;
      daily for 1 week, 215 mcg daily for 1 week, 250 mcg daily for 1 week, 1 week medication-free.&#xD;
      In both Treatment Regimens patients receive ethinyl estradiol 25 mcg in each active tablet.&#xD;
      The study is 147 days, Traditional days 1-56 and Extended days 57-147&#xD;
