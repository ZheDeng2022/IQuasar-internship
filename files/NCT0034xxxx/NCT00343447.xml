      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Vaccines may help the body build&#xD;
      an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving cyclophosphamide and rituximab&#xD;
      together with vaccine therapy may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying cyclophosphamide and rituximab followed&#xD;
      by two different schedules of vaccine therapy to compare how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy and toxicity of cyclophosphamide and rituximab in patients with&#xD;
           previously untreated, high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy and toxicity of early vs delayed administration&#xD;
           of vaccine therapy comprising KGEL and autologous tumor cells after cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           rituximab in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the magnitude of the T-cell response to early vs delayed administration of this&#xD;
           vaccine after rituximab and cyclophosphamide and correlate these responses with the&#xD;
           extent of immune reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized phase II study for patients with asymptomatic or minimally&#xD;
      symptomatic, untreated CLL with poor-risk features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo peripheral blood collection for vaccine production. Patients then receive&#xD;
      rituximab IV over at least 4 hours on days 1 and 2 in course 1 and on day 1 only in&#xD;
      subsequent courses and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment with rituximab and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression. Patients undergo evaluation 4 weeks after completion of rituximab and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. Patients achieving partial or complete response are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      vaccine treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (early administration): Beginning 2 weeks after evaluation, patients receive&#xD;
           vaccine therapy comprising an autologous tumor admixed with an allogeneic vaccine (KGEL)&#xD;
           that produces sargramostim (GM-CSF) and autologous tumor cells intradermally. Treatment&#xD;
           repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (late administration): Beginning 20 weeks after evaluation, patients receive&#xD;
           vaccine therapy comprising KGEL and autologous tumor cells intradermally. Treatment&#xD;
           repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 6 months until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
