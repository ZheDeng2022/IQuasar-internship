      This study, conducted by the Beijing University First Hospital of China and the National&#xD;
      Cancer (NCI), will try to identify genes associated with either susceptibility or resistance&#xD;
      to chronic infection by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Some people recover from HBV infection;&#xD;
      others become chronically infected and may go on to develop severe liver disease such as&#xD;
      cirrhosis or liver cancer. About 350 million people worldwide have chronic HBV infection. Of&#xD;
      120 million infected Chinese, 90 percent of children infected at less than 5 years of age and&#xD;
      10 percent of infected adults develop persistent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBV-infected and non-infected healthy persons of Han ethnicity born before 1963 may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Offspring of infected candidates (born in any year) may also be&#xD;
      enrolled. Infected adults must have at least one infected parent or sibling. Persons who&#xD;
      resided in Fusui County of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region or in the Qidong district of&#xD;
      Jiangsu Province for at least 6 months before 1986 may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (except offspring of the study subjects) will fill out a health&#xD;
      questionnaire (providing information about eating, drinking, and smoking habits and a&#xD;
      personal and family health history) and will donate no more than 20 milliliters of blood. The&#xD;
      blood will be tested for antibodies, antigens, and other substances that may indicate&#xD;
      infection with hepatitis viruses. Some of the blood will be sent to the NCI for DNA analysis&#xD;
      to identify genetic factors that may influence clearance of the hepatitis virus after&#xD;
      infection or progression to liver diseases associated with HBV infection. Infected patients&#xD;
      who have had a liver biopsy in the past will be asked permission to examine tissue from the&#xD;
      biopsy and to review laboratory results of any tests done for diagnostic and treatment&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study is completed, specimens sent to the NCI will have identifiers linking the&#xD;
      material to the donor removed. The anonymous samples may then be used for other genetic&#xD;
      studies. Specimens remaining in China will continue to have identifiers linked to them and&#xD;
      may be used for future studies designed to identify who is at greatest risk of developing&#xD;
      serious liver diseases. Participants who do not want their blood used for future studies may&#xD;
      request that the samples be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because children inherit one-half of their DNA from each parent, DNA samples from HBV&#xD;
      infected study participants may provide additional information about the parent s DNA&#xD;
      structure. Offspring who participate in this study will provide a DNA sample. The sample is&#xD;
      obtained by swishing a mouthwash in the mouth for 30 seconds and then spitting the mouth wash&#xD;
      into a cup. The DNA is then isolated from the mouth cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Persistent hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is a significant public health problem because&#xD;
      of the occurence of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma (HCC) [1-3].&#xD;
      Roughly one-third of the world population has been infected with HBV and there are about 350&#xD;
      million (5-6%) persistent carriers. HBV causes 80% of all liver cancer and is the second most&#xD;
      important carcinogen, after smoking tobacco. There is an approximate 90% risk of becoming a&#xD;
      persistent carrier following perinatal infection in infants born to e antigen positive&#xD;
      carrier mothers and 30% risk in pre-school children. Only 5-10% of adults become persistent&#xD;
      carriers following infection. Like HIV, HBV is transmitted by contaminated blood through&#xD;
      transfusion or intravenous drug use and by high-risk sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigation is to study how different outcomes of hepatitis B exposure&#xD;
      and infection are affected by host genetic factors in the Chinese population, where more than&#xD;
      120 million individuals are infected with HBV. Of people persistently infected with HBV,&#xD;
      10-30% will develop liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These highly&#xD;
      variable outcomes in both clearance rates and disease outcomes in persistently infected&#xD;
      individuals cannot be fully explained by differences in viral or environmental factors. Thus,&#xD;
      differences in host genetic factors may affect hepatitis B natural history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected from volunteers in China. Healthy donors unexposed to HBV or HCV,&#xD;
      individuals who have cleared HBV, and asymptomatic carriers of HBV will be identified by the&#xD;
      Peking University hospitals and blood bank. HBV infected individuals with chronic hepatitis,&#xD;
      cirrhosis or HCC will be identified by the Peking University hospital hepatitis clinics.&#xD;
      Targeted individuals will be asked to participate by letter or a telephone interview by&#xD;
      trained hospital staff. A database of clinical and family information will be created from a&#xD;
      questionnaire completed by hospital staff. A database of clinical and family information will&#xD;
      be created from a questionnaire completed by hospital staff interviewers. Blood will be&#xD;
      separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cryopreserved in&#xD;
      China. Serum will be tested in China for hepatitis viral markers, HBV genotypes, and HBV&#xD;
      viral load. Two vials of PBMC will be transferred to the LGD, NCI-USA, for mRNA expression&#xD;
      assays and host genetic analysis. Lymphoblastoid cell lines will be established by the&#xD;
      LGD-NCI as a source of renewable DNA. RNA will be extracted from PBMCs for determination of&#xD;
      mRNA expression by the microarray method. Results of mRNA expression assays and literature&#xD;
      searches will be used to identify candidate genes. DNA extracted from cell lines will be&#xD;
      genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and DNA markers,&#xD;
      including HLA, cytokines, chomokines, and their receptors, and putative HBV cell entry&#xD;
      targets by DNA genotyping methods. SNPs in candidate genes will be identified using public&#xD;
      and private SNP databases and SNP discovery methods. SNPs will be genotyped study&#xD;
      participants and analyzed to detect associations between polymorphisms and phenotypes&#xD;
      obtained from clinical and laboratory testing. If a genetic marker associated with the&#xD;
      development of a disease phenotype is found, there are potential applications in diagnostics&#xD;
      and therapy. The identification of allelic polymorphisms in genes involved in the pathway&#xD;
      from chronic viral infection to LC and ultimately HCC would provide insight into the&#xD;
      carcinogenic process.&#xD;
