      This study will describe the experience of patients with visible physical abnormalities in&#xD;
      the genetics clinic when they are involved in teaching others about their condition.&#xD;
      Information from this study may be used to enhance educational experiences in genetics&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with a visible physical anomaly who have been seen by a&#xD;
      genetics professional in the past 5 years may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a tape-recorded telephone interview, patients are asked about the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their experiences when visiting the genetics clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The circumstances under which they have been approached to participate in teaching&#xD;
           others&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their perspective on specific teaching behaviors used in genetic consultations, and how&#xD;
           this perspective is affected by their perception of their own visible difference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The benefits and downsides of being involved in teaching others&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The circumstances under which they feel comfortable being approached by genetics&#xD;
           providers to help teach others about their condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The conditions or circumstances that make some individual teaching experiences better or&#xD;
           worse than others&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is common for genetics patients to facilitate teaching of others during the course of&#xD;
      their genetics exam. Patient response to serving as a teaching case has been studied only on&#xD;
      a limited extent. This study proposes to qualitatively explore the ways in which taking on a&#xD;
      teaching role in a genetics clinic is experienced by patients with visible differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative telephone interviews with approximately 30 genetics patients with visible&#xD;
      differences will be conducted. The interviews will be semi-structured and an interview guide&#xD;
      will be loosely followed. Interviews will be recorded and transcripts of the interviews will&#xD;
      be coded for analysis. A typology of common themes will be compiled and reported. Information&#xD;
      collected through these interviews will improve understanding of the phenomenon of patients&#xD;
      in educator roles, relate experiences to patient expectations and will fill a gap in the&#xD;
      published literature. It is additionally hoped that results of this study may inform the&#xD;
      development of new recommendations to enhance educational experiences in genetics clinics.&#xD;
