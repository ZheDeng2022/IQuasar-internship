      This study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Bamako in&#xD;
      Mali, Africa, will examine factors that may protect against progression of malaria from mild&#xD;
      to severe disease. Infection with the malaria parasite causes disease ranging in severity&#xD;
      from mild or no symptoms to severe. A better understanding of what factors protect against&#xD;
      disease progression may help scientists develop improved methods of disease prevention and&#xD;
      treatment. The objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify differences in protective factors for severe malaria in Malinke children&#xD;
           residing in two Mali villages, Kela and Kangaba. Genetic variations in hemoglobin&#xD;
           proteins called HbS and HbC appear to confer protection against severe disease in some&#xD;
           children but not others. HbC appears to protect young Malinke children living in Kela,&#xD;
           but not in nearby Kangaba, while HbS protects children in Kangaba but not in Kela. In&#xD;
           addition, deficiency of an enzyme produced by red blood cells called G6PD protects&#xD;
           males, but not females, from severe malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate how fetal hemoglobin (HbF) may protect against malaria in infants and&#xD;
           determine how HbS, HbC, G6PD deficiency, and beta-thalassemia trait affect the rate of&#xD;
           HbF decline during the first 2 years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children under 11 years of age who seek medical care at Kangaba or Kela health centers for&#xD;
      symptoms of malaria may be eligible for this study. Each will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination and blood test. In addition, healthy infants born to women&#xD;
      referred to field site clinics may be enrolled for the newborn study. Participants undergo&#xD;
      the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with mild malaria are treated with artesunate and amodiaquine. Those with severe&#xD;
      malaria are treated with quinine. Blood is collected by finger prick every day for 4 days to&#xD;
      evaluate the response to treatment and for genetic testing. Some blood is stored for future&#xD;
      research related to malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborns have a heel or finger prick at 1, 3 and 6 months to collect a small blood sample for&#xD;
      genetic testing. In addition, at the time of birth, a small amount of blood is collected from&#xD;
      one of the blood vessels of the placenta. Some infants may be followed up to 2 years, with&#xD;
      additional drops of blood taken at 12, 18 and 24 months. Some of the blood is stored for&#xD;
      future research related to malaria.&#xD;

      Our previous case-control study (protocol #01-I-N020) established that hemoglobin (Hb) C&#xD;
      protects against severe malaria in the Dogon ethnic group of Mali, West Africa. We believe&#xD;
      that abnormal display of major parasite virulence antigens (PfEMP-1) on the surface of HbC&#xD;
      erythrocytes accounts for this protection. Whether this mechanism mediates protection by&#xD;
      other mutant erythrocytes remains to be investigated. The principal objective of the current&#xD;
      protocol has been to investigate whether HbC also protects against severe malaria in the&#xD;
      Malinke of Kela, which historically gave rise to the Dogon. Our preliminary data from&#xD;
      protocol #02-I-N285 suggest that HbC but not HbS (sickle trait) protects the young Malinke&#xD;
      children of Kela, with the opposite being true for the Malinke children of Kangaba, a nearby&#xD;
      village. To confirm these novel preliminary findings and to investigate candidate mechanisms&#xD;
      of protection, our ongoing case-control study requires an additional 150 severe malaria&#xD;
      patients who are less than 5 years old, of Malinke ethnicity, reside in either Kangaba or&#xD;
      Kela villages, and have normal G6PD activity. Children less than 11 years old and diagnosed&#xD;
      with either severe (case) or uncomplicated (control) malaria will be tested for&#xD;
      hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency. Severe and uncomplicated malaria patients will be&#xD;
      treated with parenteral quinine or oral artemisinin combination therapies, respectively,&#xD;
      which are standard of care in Mali. Principal outcome measures will include a comparison of&#xD;
      the frequency of HbC, HbS, and G6PD deficiency between cases and controls; with odds ratios&#xD;
      and 95% confidence intervals determining the degree and statistical significance of severe&#xD;
      malaria protection.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. All malaria patients enrolled in the case-control study will be less than 11&#xD;
                  years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
