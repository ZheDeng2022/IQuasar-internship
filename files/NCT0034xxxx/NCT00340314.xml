    <textblock>
      Background: Circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) has been safely and effectively&#xD;
      performed for treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF); however, its safety and&#xD;
      efficacy, as compared with those of antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT), have never been&#xD;
      formally assessed in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Purpose of this study was to evaluate CPVA versus ADT in patients with PAF in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT) is currently considered as first-line therapy in patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).1 However antiarrhythmic drugs are frequently&#xD;
      ineffective and can have serious potential adverse effects, thus often offsetting any&#xD;
      advantage offered by the maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR).2,3 Data from our and other&#xD;
      laboratories suggest that pulmonary vein ablation techniques may be a curative alternative&#xD;
      for AF, obviating the need for ADT and/or anticoagulation in many patients.4-8 However, only&#xD;
      preliminary and frequently non-randomized data exists for an evidence-based evaluation of&#xD;
      catheter ablation as compared to conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapyADT.4,8 Thus, we&#xD;
      conducted a controlled randomized trial (the Ablation for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation&#xD;
      [APAF] trial) to determine the long-term efficacy of circumferential pulmonary vein ablation&#xD;
      (CPVA) in patients with paroxysmal AF as compared with ADT with flecainide, sotalol or&#xD;
      amiodarone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: One hundred ninety-eight patients (age, 56±10 years) with PAF (duration, 6±5 years,&#xD;
      mean AF episodes 3.4/month), were randomized to CPVA or to ADT with flecainide, sotalol or&#xD;
      amiodarone. Ablation was randomly performed with the use of a standard or an irrigated tip&#xD;
      catheter and with CARTO or NavX non fluoroscopic 3D systems guidance. Cardiac rhythm was&#xD;
      assessed with daily transtelephonic transmissions over a 12 and 48 months follow-up.&#xD;
      Crossovers to CPVA were allowed after 3 months of ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: By Kaplan-Meier analysis, 86% of patients in the CPVA group and 22% in the ADT group&#xD;
      were free from recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias ([AT] P&lt;0.001); a repeat ablation was&#xD;
      performed in 9% of patients in the CPVA group for recurrent AF (6%) or atrial tachycardia&#xD;
      (3%). At 1 year, 93% and 35% of the CPVA and ADT groups were AT-free while at 4 years only&#xD;
      72.7% patients assigned to RFA and 12.1% assigned to AADs reached the endpoint(p&lt;0.001).Lower&#xD;
      left ejection fraction, arterial hypertension and age independently predicted AF recurrences&#xD;
      in the ADT group. CPVA was associated with a significant decrease in left atrial diameter&#xD;
      (15±10%, P&lt;0.01) and with fewer number of cardiovascular hospitalizations (p&lt;0.01). Ablation&#xD;
      with an irrigated tip catheter was more effective (P=0.03) with either the CARTO or NavX&#xD;
      system (P=0.08). One transient ischemic attack and one pericardial effusion occurred in the&#xD;
      CPVA group; side effects of ADT were reported in 23 patients.During the 4-year follow-up, 87&#xD;
      initially AADs patients required cross over to RFA with a steeper rate at 1 year (42&#xD;
      patients) and 19 of them progressed to persistent AF before switching. Considering repeat&#xD;
      ablation and crossover, the overall success rate was 90% in RFA group and 80% in AAD group&#xD;
      (p=0.0023, by log-rank test). New left AT developed in 9 patients requiring mapping and&#xD;
      ablation in 7 patients. Quality of life was higher in the RFA group than in AAD group for all&#xD;
      subscale scores (p&lt;0.001) Conclusions: Compared to ADT, CPVA can safely and effectively cure&#xD;
      PAF in many patients at one-year follow-up and this benefit is extended to 4 years.&#xD;
