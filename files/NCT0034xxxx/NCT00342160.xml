      This study will look at viral and immunologic factors involved in protecting against sexually&#xD;
      transmitted HIV infection in couples in which one partner is infected and the other is not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 50 couples who reside in Rakai, Uganda, and who have been together&#xD;
      for at least 2 years. In some couples, both partners will be HIV-infected, in some couples&#xD;
      only one partner will have HIV, and in some couples neither partner will have HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures at each of four study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV counseling and testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, including questions about personal behaviors such as sexual practices&#xD;
           and use of condoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal swab for women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine and vaginal fluid samples are tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      diseases, such as syphilis. Blood and vaginal samples are also tested for HIV viral levels&#xD;
      and immune response in HIV-infected individuals and for evidence of exposure to HIV in&#xD;
      non-infected participants. Some blood is also tested for genetic markers to investigate&#xD;
      whether certain proteins are related to resistance to HIV infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Understanding the factors that contribute to the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) infection is of great importance for the development of preventive and therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies. Evidence suggests that a number of host immunologic and virologic factors play&#xD;
      critical roles in protection against sexually transmitted HIV infection in HIV-discordant&#xD;
      partners. Among these, the antiviral role of CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals has&#xD;
      been extensively studied. At least two types of CD8+ T cell-mediated antiviral activities&#xD;
      have been described in HIV infection. The first is a suppressive activity against HIV&#xD;
      involving lysis of infected cells in an antigen-specific, HLA-restricted fashion, while the&#xD;
      second mechanism inhibits viral replication via either cell- or soluble mediated factors in&#xD;
      the absence of cell killing. It has been demonstrated that cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL)&#xD;
      are present in both cervical and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a&#xD;
      subpopulation of highly-HIV-exposed but persistently seronegative individuals. However,&#xD;
      studies addressing the effect of non-cytotoxic soluble factor-mediated antiviral activity by&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells in preventing seroconversion in HIV-discordant couples have been lacking. This&#xD;
      study proposes to examine the role of CD8+ T cell-derived CC-chemokine activities and the&#xD;
      copy numbers of one of the chemokine genes, CCL3L1, along with other host anti-HIV and&#xD;
      virologic factors in resistance to HIV infection in persistently seronegative HIV-discordant&#xD;
      partners of HIV infected individuals.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Documentation of HIV infection in both partners, a current history of continued sexual&#xD;
             activity within the partnership, and demonstration that they have been in a&#xD;
             partnership for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ T cell count greater than 250/microliters blood in both partners and not&#xD;
             currently on HAART.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must agree to continued couple counseling regarding HIV results&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2 (HIV-discordant partners, n = 20 couples):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of HIV infection in one partner and seronegative status in the other&#xD;
             partner, a current history of continued sexual activity within the partnership, and&#xD;
             demonstration that they have been in a partnership for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ T cell count greater than 250/microliters blood in both partners and not&#xD;
             currently on HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma viremia greater than 5,000 copies of HIV RNA/ml plasma in each infected&#xD;
             partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Group 3 (HIV-uninfected partners, n = 10 couples):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of HIV-seronegative status in both partners, a current history of&#xD;
             continued sexual activity within the partnership, and demonstration that they have&#xD;
             been in a partnership for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ T cell count greater than 250/microliters blood in both partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
