      One form of breast cancer, known as inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), is characterized by&#xD;
      diffuse erythema (redness) and edema (peau d'orange) of the breast. This type of cancer is&#xD;
      aggressive and poorly understood. It is rare in the United States (about 4 percent of cases),&#xD;
      but more common in Egypt and Tunisia (up to 23 percent of cases). Conducting a case-control&#xD;
      study of IBC is complicated by several factors, including the lack of standardized criteria&#xD;
      for IBC. In addition, collecting pre-chemotherapy tissue and blood samples from IBC patients&#xD;
      is difficult because treatment begins immediately after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the National Cancer Institute will collaborate with two major cancer&#xD;
      centers and two hospitals (in Egypt and Tunisia) to determine the feasibility of a&#xD;
      case-control study of IBC. The study will assess the number and characteristics of IBC cases,&#xD;
      the feasibility of identifying cases at diagnosis, and the availability of control subjects;&#xD;
      will collect frozen pre-treatment tumor tissue from five IBC cases to determine whether RNA&#xD;
      isolation is possible; will obtain digital photographs of the breasts of IBC cases; and will&#xD;
      demonstrate collaboration between the institutions and personnel involved in the study. The&#xD;
      study will last for approximately one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating hospitals will identify IBC cases. Consenting patients will undergo a breast&#xD;
      examination in which the examining surgeon will complete an Initial Examination Form (IEF).&#xD;
      Digital photographs of the breasts (but not face) will be taken and linked to the study ID&#xD;
      number. Tissue examination results will be entered into the IEF. For five selected cases,&#xD;
      additional pre-treatment tumor tissue will be collected and frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will assess the availability of controls for a case-control study by&#xD;
      investigating the number and type of admissions to the Ear, Nose, and Throat and&#xD;
      Ophthalmology Departments at participating hospitals during 2000-2003, using computerized&#xD;
      records.&#xD;

      Breast cancer characterized by diffuse erythema and edema, or peau d'orange, of the breast&#xD;
      (inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)) is rare, particularly aggressive, and poorly understood.&#xD;
      The extent of redness and edema or peau d'orange, of the breast required for a diagnosis of&#xD;
      IBC has not been standardized. According to the most recent American Joint Committee on&#xD;
      Cancer (AJCC) definition of inflammatory breast cancer, the signs of redness and edema or&#xD;
      peau d'orange, should cover the majority of the breast, and should have arisen quickly.&#xD;
      Breast cancers with redness and edema or peau d'orange, account for approximately 4 percent&#xD;
      of breast cancers in the United States, but up to 23 percent of breast cancers in Egypt and&#xD;
      Tunisia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study will determine the feasibility of conducting a case-control study of&#xD;
      inflammatory breast cancer in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute-Cairo, Egypt,&#xD;
      and the Institut Salah Azaiz, Tunis, Tunisia, the major cancer centers in Egypt and Tunisia,&#xD;
      and Cairo University Hospital and Charles Nicolle Hospital, affiliated general hospitals from&#xD;
      which controls will be selected. Currently, neither case study hospital collects data on the&#xD;
      number of inflammatory breast cancer cases meeting the AJCC definition which will be used for&#xD;
      the proposed case-control study. In addition, the geographic distribution of IBC cases at the&#xD;
      two study hospitals (knowledge of which is necessary for the selection of appropriate&#xD;
      controls) is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the pilot study are to assess the feasibility of the following critical&#xD;
      components of the case-control study: 1) identifying a sufficient number of IBC cases at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis in the two study hospitals; 2) selecting appropriate hospital-based control&#xD;
      subjects; 3) collecting frozen pre-treatment tumor tissue; 4) obtaining digital photographs&#xD;
      of the breasts of IBC cases; and 5) communicating and working collaboratively with the study&#xD;
      hospitals and personnel in Egypt and Tunisia. To accomplish these objectives, IBC cases&#xD;
      meeting the AJCC definition as well as cases meeting other definitions of IBC will be&#xD;
      identified over a one-year period at each of the two study hospitals. Computerized records at&#xD;
      the control hospital for the years 2000-2003 will be used to enumerate the number of female&#xD;
      patients with non-chronic diseases (and their age and geographic distribution) in the&#xD;
      Departments of Ophthalmology and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT). Pre-treatment frozen tumor&#xD;
      tissue and digital photographs of the breast will be collected from five IBC cases at each&#xD;
      study site.&#xD;
