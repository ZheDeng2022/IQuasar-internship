      This study will try to identify the gene or genes responsible for myopia (nearsightedness)&#xD;
      and to examine the relationship between myopia and near work. Myopia is the most common eye&#xD;
      disorder in the world, affecting one in four Americans. Several studies indicate that myopia&#xD;
      is inherited. The condition tends to cluster in families, so that studying families with this&#xD;
      condition may facilitate finding the exact cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caucasian Americans and African Americans with myopia who are in general good health may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. People with a family history of myopia through several generations&#xD;
      along one parent s side only, and in which more than one sibling has myopia are preferred.&#xD;
      People who have severe diseases that involve myopia, such as Stickler s or Marfan syndromes,&#xD;
      retinitis pigmentosa or diabetic retinopathy may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, including refraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for genetic studies and possibly establishment of cell lines (collection of&#xD;
           cells grown in the laboratory from an original tissue specimen) for future research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myopia Family Study Questionnaire and personal medical information questionnaire to&#xD;
           provide information about other medical conditions that may influence the development of&#xD;
           myopia; the vision status of their spouse and children, parents and siblings, and spouse&#xD;
           s parents and siblings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk Factor Questionnaire (for Jewish Orthodox community only) to assess the amount of&#xD;
           near work activity done in childhood&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia or nearsightedness, a condition that results in the inability to see distant objects&#xD;
      clearly, affects one in four Americans and is the most common eye disorder in the world with&#xD;
      an enormous public health and economic impact. Depending on epidemiologic definition, 3-19%&#xD;
      of acquired blindness has been ascribed to myopia. Evidence exists that myopia is a complex&#xD;
      disorder with a significant genetic component as well as potential environmental influences.&#xD;
      Implicating genetic factors, Sorsby et al. found that the trait correlation for monozygotic&#xD;
      twins was nearly twice that for dizygotic twins and zero for control pairs. A study, by Chen&#xD;
      et al., of Chinese twin pairs found a higher concordance rate of myopia (92.2%) for&#xD;
      monozygotic twins with concordant close-work habits, or differences of less than one hour per&#xD;
      day spent studying or reading, as compared to monozygotic twins with discordant close-work&#xD;
      habits (79.3%). The two studies suggest additive interaction between zygosity and close-work&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is a tendency of myopia to cluster in families, studying families with myopia&#xD;
      opens the possibility to identify any gene(s) responsible for the pathogenesis of myopia.&#xD;
      These genes could provide molecular tools for investigation of inherited myopia and may also&#xD;
      provide a starting point for elucidating mechanisms for the influence of near work on the&#xD;
      progression of myopia. The goal of this proposal is to identify regions of the human genome&#xD;
      that contain the genes responsible for non-syndromic myopia utilizing pedigrees identified by&#xD;
      the Myopia Family Study and genotypes generated by Dr. Dwight Stambolian's laboratory at the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania as well as by the Center for Inherited Disease Research. Pedigree&#xD;
      collection is ongoing in several geographic regions including Lakewood, NJ, for the&#xD;
      collection of Orthodox Jewish families, Lancaster County, PA for the collection of Amish&#xD;
      families, and Philadelphia, for recruitment of families of African American or Chinese&#xD;
      American background. Pedigrees of Caucasian descent have also been collected in Philadelphia.&#xD;
      All data collection is under the direction of Dr. Stambolian and funded by his grant from the&#xD;
      NEI; no NHGRI funds are being used for data collection, and NHGRI investigators do not have&#xD;
      any contact with study subjects. Because this disorder is complex and has a high likelihood&#xD;
      of being caused by multiple loci, multiple parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis&#xD;
      will be employed. Heterogeneity will be taken into account during these analyses, as will&#xD;
      environmental covariates, such as the effect of near work, when possible.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject population will be adult individuals and their children, in good health with&#xD;
        the exception of myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be chosen based upon vision history of their extended family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preferred subjects will be those who have a family in which myopia passes through several&#xD;
        generations along one parent s side only, in which more than one sibling is affected with&#xD;
        myopia, but in which no more than one parent is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific eligibility requirements for the index case include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cycloplegic refraction of 1.00 spherical equivalent (as long as there was 1.00D or&#xD;
             higher in each meridian if astigmatism is present) or worse in both eyes in those&#xD;
             under age 50 to be considered myopic;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Manifest refraction of 1.00 spherical equivalent (as long as there was 1.00D or higher&#xD;
             in each meridian if astigmatism is present) or worse in both eyes in those over age 50&#xD;
             to be considered myopic;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No history of systemic or ocular disease which might predispose to myopia including&#xD;
             premature birth;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The index case should have a familial history of myopia in either their parents or&#xD;
             children or other close relatives (suggesting a genetic influence);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the event that the parents of the index case have myopia, it is preferred that only&#xD;
             one parent be affected with myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some of these bilineal families may be collected if necessary to achieve the desired sample&#xD;
        size, but unilateral families are preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded from the University of Pennsylvania study are those who have severe diseases that&#xD;
        involve myopia, such as Stickler s or Marfan syndromes, ocular disease such as Retinitis&#xD;
        Pigmentosa, and those with diseases that may secondarily cause myopia such as diabetes or&#xD;
        retinopathy of prematurity. Records of eye examinations obtained prior to the onset of&#xD;
        systemic or ocular disease will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who complete the Risk Factor Questionnaire and who state that they were born&#xD;
        more than a month prematurely will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who are myopic in one eye and unaffected in the other (ulnilateral myopes) will&#xD;
        not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be excluded, and families for whom all&#xD;
        necessary members do not sign the Consent Form will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No fetuses, pregnant women, prisoners or other institutionalized individuals will be&#xD;
        enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Generally, myopia itself is not associated with mental impairment, although careful&#xD;
        consideration will be given to determining the cognitive understanding of any such&#xD;
        potentially impaired person appropriate for enrollment in order to assure that protection&#xD;
        of human rights is optimized.&#xD;
