  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis is a syndrome manifested by adverse alterations in vaginal microbial&#xD;
      flora. It is present in 10 to 25% of women in the general population, and is the most common&#xD;
      vaginal infection. It has been associated with a number of adverse sequelae in reproductive&#xD;
      health including acquisition of HIV, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical dysplasia, and&#xD;
      complications of gynecological procedures. During pregnancy it has been associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of preterm birth an postpartum maternal infection. However, the vaginal&#xD;
      microbial flora remains poorly understood. Information on variation in microbial flora and&#xD;
      its association with BV from a longitudinal study is unavailable. This prospective&#xD;
      observational study aims to advance our knowledge of the natural history and abnormal&#xD;
      alteration in vaginal microbial flora, and to identify risk factors that are associated with&#xD;
      these changes. A total of 5500 healthy, non-pregnant women of reproductive age will be&#xD;
      enrolled and followed up in Birmingham, Alabama, for one year (baseline visit plus once every&#xD;
      three months afterwards, totaling 5 visits). Detailed information on sociodemographic status,&#xD;
      medical history, hygiene practice, sexual behavior and psychosocial stress will be collected&#xD;
      through in-person interviews. Routine gynecological and dental examinations will be carried&#xD;
      out during the study visits. Samples of vaginal secretion and blood will be collected.&#xD;
      Laboratory tests to quantify vaginal microbial flora and to identify infection of bacterial&#xD;
      vaginosis as well as common sexually transmitted diseases will be conducted. This project is&#xD;
      expected to complete in 5 years.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females, age 15-44.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since bacterial vaginosis is primarily a condition of reproductive-age women, this&#xD;
             study will be restricted to women regarded by demographers as reproductive age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant women whose last menstrual period is later than expected will undergo a&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test. Women who become pregnant while on study will complete their&#xD;
             next regularly scheduled study visit, following which their participation will&#xD;
             terminate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Immunocompromised status&#xD;
&#xD;
             Receiving or expected to receive in the next 12 months cytotoxic or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Receiving or expected to receive in the next 12 months one or more 30-day courses of&#xD;
             corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Congenital or acquired immune deficiency; known HIV positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Primary or secondary affective disorder, psychosis, emotional or intellectual&#xD;
             limitations that preclude informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-fluency in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Post-menopausal (natural or surgical).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Status post hysterectomy or expected to undergo hysterectomy in the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Status post pelvic radiotherapy, or expected to undergo pelvic radiotherapy in the&#xD;
             next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Receiving or expected to receive chronic (daily for at least 30 days) antibiotics in&#xD;
             the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Planning to move out of the area in the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participating or expected to participate during the next 12 months in a clinical trial&#xD;
             in which antibiotics or topical microbicides will be administered in a blinded manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women who unexpectedly develop one of these conditions during their participation will&#xD;
             continue to be followed, unless a specific contraindication arises.&#xD;
