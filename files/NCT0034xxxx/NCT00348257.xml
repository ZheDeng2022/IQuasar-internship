    <textblock>
      Removal of unwanted hair is one of the most commonly sought cosmetic solutions. Traditional&#xD;
      methods, such as shaving, depilatories, tweezing and waxing result in only temporary hair&#xD;
      removal, and thus require extensive maintenance. Long term hair removal via electrolysis is&#xD;
      generally unsatisfactory due to its time consuming, painful nature and the associated risk of&#xD;
      scarring or pigmentary changes. Moreover, the efficacy of electrolysis is user dependent and&#xD;
      is estimated to be reduction of only 15-50% of the unwanted hair3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more modern approach to long term hair removal involves laser and Intense Pulsed Light&#xD;
      (IPL) treatment modalities. These technologies are based on the scientific principle of&#xD;
      selective photothermolysis. During the treatment, the light energy is absorbed by the hair's&#xD;
      pigment (melanin) and transmitted through the hair shaft to the follicle. Conversion of this&#xD;
      energy into heat causes a rise in the hair temperature, leading to destruction of the&#xD;
      follicle and disruption of the hair growth mechanism, while leaving the skin undamaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both laser and light devices have been proven successful in inducing permanent hair removal,&#xD;
      as well as delayed hair growth, while causing minimal discomfort and complications. The light&#xD;
      devices are based on the IPL technology, which differs from laser light in various physical&#xD;
      aspects. The main difference is that while lasers emit light at a distinct wavelength, IPL&#xD;
      delivers a wide range of wavelengths (400 1400 nm), thus allowing greater flexibility in&#xD;
      aspects of body area, hair color and skin type LEORTEC LTD. has developed an innovative&#xD;
      device that integrates the two treatment modalities: Laser and Intense Pulse Light (IPL) and&#xD;
      in addition MLS - Multi Light Source- a combination of the two modalities. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using Leortec 300 device for hair&#xD;
      removal treatment.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  To evaluate the safety of using LEORTEC-300 System for hair removal treatment,&#xD;
                     in different skin/hair colors and anatomical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  To assess the effectiveness of using the LEORTEC-300 system for hair removal&#xD;
                     treatment in different skin/hair colors and anatomical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patient Satisfaction Immediately after the treatment patients will be asked to&#xD;
                     rate pain level which they felt during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Physician's Satisfaction Physician's satisfaction from the technique,&#xD;
                     equipment and hair removal will be assessed by physician's questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-sites, prospective, controlled study to further test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the LEORTEC-300 system in hair removal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Source and Number Subjects for the study will be recruited from patients within the&#xD;
      community who have sought treatment for hair removal from the investigative physicians and&#xD;
      meet all of the eligibility criteria listed below. There will be a total of 30 patients.&#xD;
