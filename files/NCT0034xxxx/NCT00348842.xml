  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NDV is a virus tht is harmful in chicken, but harmless in man. There are 2 major sub-strains&#xD;
      of NDV, one oncolytic and one non-oncolytic. Oncolytic NDV (MTH-68H) preferentially homes and&#xD;
      replicates in cancer cells and therefore, administration of NDV intravenously or&#xD;
      preferentially intra-tumor, either by direct injection or by injection into an afferent&#xD;
      artery results in direct lysis of tumor cells. NDV activates apoptotic mechanism in cancer&#xD;
      cells and thus, results in natural cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both oncolytic and non-oncolytic NDV were used clinically in hundreds of patients with&#xD;
      different types of cancer worldwide. NDV were proved harmless in man. Clinical studies were&#xD;
      done for more than a decade and the efficacy of NDV was documented on pre-clinical animals&#xD;
      models as well as in man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a large number of patients with metastatic cancer and chemotherapy resistant&#xD;
      hematological malignances, no cure can be provided by conventional anti-cancer modalities,&#xD;
      new treatment options are urgently indicated. The goal of the study is to use NDV, in order&#xD;
      to provide such treatment for patients in need.&#xD;
