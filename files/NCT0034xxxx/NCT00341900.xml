  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ionizing radiation efficiently induces chromosomal aberrations (CA) and several studies of CA&#xD;
      have now been conducted among small groups of flight crews. However, most of the studies only&#xD;
      evaluated the unstable aberrations that reflect recent exposures, but not long-term&#xD;
      cumulative cosmic radiation exposure. Chromosome painting by fluorescence in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (FISH) is a widely used and established cytogenetic method for detecting stable&#xD;
      aberrations such as translocations. Thus, FISH can be used for estimating chromosomal damage&#xD;
      from cumulative radiation exposure. No large studies of flight crews utilizing FISH have been&#xD;
      conducted to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a study to measure CA using FISH in a group of pilots estimated to have high comic&#xD;
      radiation exposure based on flight histories, i.e., those with long duration flying&#xD;
      international routes, and a comparison group of university faculty with minimal flying&#xD;
      history. These measurements will be used to determine if pilots have elevated frequencies of&#xD;
      CA (specifically stable translocations) as compared with the university faculty. In addition,&#xD;
      the frequencies of CA will be examined in relation to the cumulative cosmic radiation dose to&#xD;
      determine if there is a dose-response relationship. Individual cumulative doses will be&#xD;
      calculated from pilot flight histories using a computer program developed by the FAA which&#xD;
      estimates cosmic radiation does by accounting for changes in altitude and latitude, and the&#xD;
      11-year solar cycle at the time of the flight. We will collect information on age, lifestyle&#xD;
      factors, diet, health history, family cancer history, and medical radiation exposures from&#xD;
      personal interview and self-administered dietary questionaire. These factors may affect the&#xD;
      CA frequency and so we plan to adjust for them in the statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilots will be identified based on the Allied Pilots Association roster and faculty from a&#xD;
      commercial company that maintains a database of university faculty, including those in the&#xD;
      Chicago area. Potential participants will be notified of the study by mail and&#xD;
      recruited/screened for eligibility over the telephone. We will compensate participants $100&#xD;
      for their time. A field station will be set up at a medical or health clinic convenient to&#xD;
      the participants, where interviews Will be conducted and a peripheral blood sample collected.&#xD;
      Participants will be notified of the overall study results and may request their personal CA&#xD;
      results at the end of the study. Participants may also choose to have additional blood drawn,&#xD;
      however this blood sample will be anonymized so that it cannot be linked back to the&#xD;
      participant. Genotypic variants in DNA repair (and possibly other) genes will be evaluated&#xD;
      for an effect on CA frequency.&#xD;
