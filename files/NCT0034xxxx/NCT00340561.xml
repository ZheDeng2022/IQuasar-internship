    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the driving performance of new teenage drivers and determine to what&#xD;
      extent independent driving experience improves driving performance of young drivers. Motor&#xD;
      vehicle crash rates are highest among new teen drivers, especially during the first 6 months&#xD;
      and 1,000 miles of independent licensed driving. Crash rates decline with experience, and&#xD;
      this study will assess the effect of driving experience on performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly licensed teenagers ranging from 16 years, 3 months to 17 years of age and experienced&#xD;
      drivers 30 to 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be able to&#xD;
      legally drive in the commonwealth of Virginia and have at least 20/40 correctable vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete a questionnaire about their health and driving experience. They are&#xD;
      then tested on a driving test track. Teens are tested within 3 weeks of obtaining their&#xD;
      driver's license and before they have more than 100 miles of independent driving experience.&#xD;
      They are tested a second time 6 to 12 months later and after they have more than 1,000 miles&#xD;
      of driving experience. A group of experienced adult drivers are also tested to provide a&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The driving test is conducted on a smart road - a controlled, 2.2-mile two-lane research&#xD;
      track at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. It is designed for safety, with&#xD;
      restricted access, nothing for a vehicle to hit, carefully placed guardrails, and other&#xD;
      safety features. The research vehicle is equipped with airbags, anti-lock brakes, and other&#xD;
      safety equipment. It also has sensors and tiny video cameras to assess the behavior of the&#xD;
      vehicle and the driver; this equipment does not interfere with the operation of the vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimenter accompanies the driver and instructs him or her to perform routine driving&#xD;
      skills, such as stopping, changing lanes and maintaining speed, as well as to other tasks&#xD;
      such as inserting a CD into an entertainment console, having a conversation, and answering a&#xD;
      cellular telephone call. The driver has an opportunity to practice the tasks before being&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The driver's speed is limited to 35 mph or less during the experiment and the driver is&#xD;
      required to wear seat belts and follow safe driving procedures. The experimenter is in the&#xD;
      front passenger seat can stop the vehicle using a separate brake pedal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle crash rates are highest among novice teen drivers, especially during the first&#xD;
      six months and 1000 miles of independent licensed driving. Crash rates decline with driving&#xD;
      experience, however, no research has demonstrated learning effects on performance due to&#xD;
      independent driving experience and the extent and variability in driving performance among&#xD;
      novice young drivers has not been established. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of driving experience on driving performance. We propose to use standard measures of&#xD;
      driving performance under controlled experimental conditions on a driving test-track and&#xD;
      vehicle designed for this purpose. Specifically, we propose to test the driving performance&#xD;
      of a sample of teens within a few weeks after licensure while they are still relatively&#xD;
      inexperienced drivers and again after greater than 6 months and 1000 miles of driving&#xD;
      experience test their driving performance. A sample of experience adult drivers would be&#xD;
      tested in similar fashion to provide an additional comparison group.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recruitment of teen participants will occur by arrangement with local driving schools in&#xD;
        Montgomery County, VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants aged 16 or 17 who have held their driver's license for one month or&#xD;
        less may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants may be recruited during their training, and will only be eligible after they&#xD;
        have met all requirements for licensure, and after both parental consent and teen assent&#xD;
        are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the teen wishes to participate, they must have their parent or legal guardian speak to&#xD;
        the VTTI experimenter over the telephone for screening and then accompany the teen at an&#xD;
        appointment so that the study can be explained and consent and assent provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Experienced adult drivers will be recruited via one-page recruitment fliers describing the&#xD;
        study posted in the Blacksburg, VA area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        After an appointment is made, a telephone screening will occur using the Telephone Driver&#xD;
        Screening and Demographic Questionnaire to assess age, sex, medical and driving history.&#xD;
