        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are included in the study if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing to provide written informed consent to participate in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is 18 through 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing&#xD;
             potential, using a medically accepted method of birth control (ie, barrier method with&#xD;
             spermicide, steroidal contraceptive [oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected&#xD;
             contraceptives must be used in conjunction with a barrier method], or intrauterine&#xD;
             device [IUD]) and agree to continued use of this method for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has chronic pain of at least 3 months' duration associated with any of the&#xD;
             following conditions: diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia,&#xD;
             traumatic injury, complex regional pain syndrome, back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia&#xD;
             (documented diagnosis), chronic pancreatitis, or osteoarthritis. Other chronic painful&#xD;
             conditions may be evaluated for entry upon discussion with, and written approval from,&#xD;
             the Cephalon Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is currently using 1 of the following: at least 60 mg of oral&#xD;
             morphine/day, or at least 25 mcg of transdermal fentanyl/hour, or at least 30 mg of&#xD;
             oxycodone/day, or at least 8 mg of hydromorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of&#xD;
             another opioid/day as a stable dose of ATC therapy for at least the previous 30 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient reports an average pain intensity score, over the prior 24 hours, of 6 or&#xD;
             less (0=no pain through 10=worst pain) for his/her chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient experiences, on average, 1 to 4 BTP episodes (defined as temporary flares&#xD;
             of severe or excruciating pain) per day while taking ATC opioid therapy, and on&#xD;
             average, the duration of each BTP episode is less than 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient currently uses opioid therapy for alleviation of BTP episodes, occurring&#xD;
             at the location of the chronic pain, and achieves at least partial relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to effectively self-administer the study drug and complete the&#xD;
             electronic diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of the following&#xD;
        criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has uncontrolled or rapidly escalating pain as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator (ie, the ATC therapy may be expected to change between the first and last&#xD;
             treatments with study drug), or has pain uncontrolled by therapy that could adversely&#xD;
             impact the safety of the patient or that could be compromised by treatment with study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has known or suspected hypersensitivities, allergies, or other&#xD;
             contraindications to any ingredient in the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a recent history (within 5 years) or current evidence of alcohol or&#xD;
             other substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has cardiopulmonary disease that would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, significantly increase the risk of treatment with potent synthetic&#xD;
             opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has medical or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would compromise collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is expected to have surgery during the study and it is anticipated that&#xD;
             the surgery will alleviate the patient's pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had therapy before study drug treatment that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could alter pain or response to pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has participated in a previous study with OraVescent fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has participated in a study involving an investigational drug in the&#xD;
             previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within 14 days before&#xD;
             the first treatment with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has any other medical condition or is receiving concomitant&#xD;
             medication/therapy (eg, regional nerve block) that would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, compromise the patient's safety or compliance with the study protocol,&#xD;
             or compromise collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is involved in active litigation in regard to the chronic pain currently&#xD;
             being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) for a medication not prescribed by&#xD;
             the physician currently treating the chronic pain.&#xD;
