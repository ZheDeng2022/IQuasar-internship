      This study is a survey (Health Behaviors in School-age Children) sponsored by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization to gather information about nutrition, dieting practices, physical&#xD;
      activity, injuries, violence, relationships with family and friends, perceptions of school as&#xD;
      a supportive environment, alcohol and tobacco use and drug use among adolescents, and about&#xD;
      the communities in which students live. The U.S. sponsors of the survey are the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health and the Health Resources and Services Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the international HBSC study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence of early adolescent health behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify psychosocial factors associated with adolescent behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide an opportunity for analyses of cross-national comparisons&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide an opportunity for analyses of trends in the U.S. and cross-nationally&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, the survey includes additional questions designed to provide&#xD;
      information about areas of specific national interest, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the association of school, family, peers, and other environmental factors on&#xD;
           health behavior and health status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence and identify factors associated with diet and physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence and identify factors associated with bullying and risk&#xD;
           behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the third U.S. administration of the HBSC survey, previously administered in&#xD;
      1997-1998 and 2001-2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      U.S. participants in the survey include about 15,000 students from 350 schools selected to&#xD;
      take part across the country. In each school, one or two classes (about 25 students) in each&#xD;
      grade 6 through 10 are picked randomly to participate. In one class period, the students&#xD;
      complete the written survey, which has 80 multiple choice questions. Students do not put&#xD;
      their name on the survey. When they finish the survey, the place it in an envelope and seal&#xD;
      it shut. The envelopes are then put in a box. Reports will not include the names of&#xD;
      participating counties, cities, school districts, schools, or students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected from U.S. school children is compared with similar information&#xD;
      collected from school children in 36 other countries. The survey is used to help set national&#xD;
      priorities for school and youth programs, as well as to monitor the progress of these&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;

      The Health Behaviors in School-age Children (HBSC) survey is the only international survey of&#xD;
      its type and the only national survey of adolescent health behavior in the U.S. The U.S. HBSC&#xD;
      complements the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the Monitoring the Future surveys of&#xD;
      older adolescents. The aims of the survey are to assess the prevalence of health behaviors&#xD;
      and identify factors associated with them in a national probability sample of 6th -10th grade&#xD;
      students, allowing for trend analyses and cross-national comparisons among the 37 countries&#xD;
      involved in the quadrennial international HBSC surveys. This would be the third U.S.&#xD;
      administration of the HBSC survey, previously administered in 1997-1998 and 2001-2002.&#xD;
