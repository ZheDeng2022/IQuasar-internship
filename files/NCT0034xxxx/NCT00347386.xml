  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections are the important cause of high mortality in young infants in developing&#xD;
      countries. Zinc is a crucial micronutrient as it influences various immune mechanisms and&#xD;
      modulates host resistance to several pathogens. It has shown benefits as an adjunct therapy&#xD;
      in infections like diarrhea and pneumonia in older children Given the predisposition of young&#xD;
      infants in developing countries to zinc deficiency and infections, addition of zinc to&#xD;
      standard treatment of serious bacterial infections may lead to significant improvements in&#xD;
      the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several hypotheses will be examined in this clinical trial. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      measure, in a double blind randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of giving 2 RDA&#xD;
      (Required Daily Allowance 10 mg) of zinc orally in addition to routine antibiotics, for&#xD;
      treatment of possible serious bacterial infection in infants &gt;= 7 days and up to 4 months of&#xD;
      age in reducing the proportion of treatment failures and time to discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
      This will evaluate the clinical consequences of the possible immunomodulation by zinc&#xD;
      supplementation. This is critical to demonstrate because nearly 80% of infant mortality&#xD;
      occurs in first months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young infants with possible serious bacterial infections fulfilling the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study and stratified into 4 groups on basis of weight for age 'z'&#xD;
      scores &lt; -2 z and &gt;=- 2 z and whether he/she has diarrhea or not. Within each stratum the&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive zinc or placebo. Treatment failures will be defined by&#xD;
      the need for a change of initial antibiotic therapy. The minimum duration of monitoring will&#xD;
      be till clinical recovery (using predetermined criteria). Serum copper, serum ferritin and&#xD;
      serum transferrin receptors will be determined at enrollment, 72 hours after enrollment and&#xD;
      at discharge from the hospital. Concentrations of CRP and procalcitonin will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline, 72 hours after enrolment and at clinical recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of efficacy of addition of zinc to standard therapy may provide a simple and&#xD;
      low-cost strategy to improve survival in serious infections in young infants. This is likely&#xD;
      to have a significant impact on infant morbidity and mortality. It will be good example of&#xD;
      using a simple immunomodulator beneficially in improving child health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infant mortality rate continues to be high in most developing countries despite advances in&#xD;
      child health care. Infections are the most important cause of deaths in infants. There is&#xD;
      increasing recognition that nutritional deficiencies including micronutrients are important&#xD;
      determinants of infection and their outcomes. Zinc is a crucial micronutrient as it&#xD;
      influences various immune mechanisms and modulates host resistance to several pathogens.&#xD;
      Supplementation with zinc has been documented to provide protection against common childhood&#xD;
      infections. It has also shown benefits as an adjunct therapy in infections like diarrhea and&#xD;
      pneumonia in older children. Given the predisposition of young infants in developing&#xD;
      countries to zinc deficiency and infections, addition of zinc to standard treatment of&#xD;
      serious bacterial infections may lead to significant improvements in the outcomes. This is&#xD;
      critical to demonstrate because nearly 80% of infant mortality occurs in first 2 months of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infant mortality rates in India continue to be in excess of 60 per 1000 live births.&#xD;
      Neonatal mortality contributes to over 64% of the infant deaths particularly in those who are&#xD;
      born low birth weight. Most of the other deaths occur in the second and third months. Serious&#xD;
      systemic infections like sepsis and pneumonia constitute 30-40% of the causes of mortality.&#xD;
      Any health programme that aims at reducing infant mortality rate needs to address mortality&#xD;
      in the first two months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost 90% of all low birth weight (LBW) babies are born in developing countries,&#xD;
      particularly in the Indian subcontinent. Nearly 70% of these are small for gestational age&#xD;
      unlike in the developed world where the bulk of low birth weight babies are preterms. Zinc&#xD;
      deficiency during fetal development is documented to cause intra-uterine growth retardation&#xD;
      and also impaired postnatal immune functions making these babies more susceptible to severe&#xD;
      infections. Studies have shown good correlation between cord blood zinc, maternal zinc&#xD;
      concentration and birth weights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The zinc content of the breast milk decreases rapidly after birth. In addition, the&#xD;
      requirements are likely to be high as young infants in developing countries live in high&#xD;
      microbial load environment and are exposed to recurrent infections. Further, malnourished&#xD;
      infants need more zinc for catch up growth. All these predispose them to develop zinc&#xD;
      deficiency and infections. In a population based study by our group last year, nearly 40% of&#xD;
      young infants had low plasma zinc despite being breast-fed, probably a reflection of&#xD;
      inadequate tissue stores (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc influences many aspects of the immune system starting with its effects on the barrier&#xD;
      and various components of innate and acquired immunity. There is sufficient data from animal&#xD;
      and human studies of increased host susceptibility to infections with zinc deficiency. A&#xD;
      vicious cycle of infection and zinc deficiency exists. Infection reduces the plasma zinc&#xD;
      concentration, which reflects the severity of the infection and inflammation. This may be&#xD;
      observed early during the illness. Organs such as the skin, thymus, bones and the epithelium&#xD;
      also become depleted during this process. Severe bacterial illnesses also lead to zinc&#xD;
      redistribution. It is plausible that this redistribution increases the infection severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited data on therapeutic effect of zinc supplementation on severe infections in&#xD;
      young infants less than 4 months of age. A short inexpensive course of zinc for patients with&#xD;
      serious bacterial infections can become a simple but potent intervention to reduce young&#xD;
      infant mortality and morbidity. While the effects of zinc deficiency and of supplementation&#xD;
      are reasonably well documented eventually the benefits on clinical outcome alone can result&#xD;
      in its application.&#xD;
