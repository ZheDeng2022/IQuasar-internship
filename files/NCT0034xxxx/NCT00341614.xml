  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetics (non-insulin-dependent) are more than five times as likely to suffer an&#xD;
      initial myocardial infarction (MI; heart attack) compared to nondiabetics.Female diabetics in&#xD;
      particular, have a higher mortality rate for coronary artery disease (CAD) than male&#xD;
      diabetics.C-reactive protein measurement in the clinical setting enhances the detection of&#xD;
      individuals who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by providing additional&#xD;
      predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the effects of a supervised exercise and diet intervention on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk in postmenopausal diabetic women. We will recruit 35&#xD;
      postmenopausal, sedentary type 2 diabetics who will undergo a 3 month exercise and dietary&#xD;
      intervention. They will exercise 3 times a week for 30 min in a supervised setting. Exercise&#xD;
      mode will be aerobic and self-selected (i.e. treadmill, bike) at an intensity level of 50-85%&#xD;
      VO2peak. Blood glucose will be monitored before and after exercise. The dietary intervention&#xD;
      will consist of 6 meetings with a registered dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular disease risk measures will be different following a 3-month exercise and&#xD;
           diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  H1: Blood markers for coronary artery disease risk, as measured by CRP, TC, LDL,&#xD;
                TG, FG, fasting insulin, and HbA1c, will be different following a 3-month exercise&#xD;
                and diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  H2: Anthropometric measures of coronary artery disease risk, as measured by WHR,&#xD;
                will be different following a 3-month exercise and diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  H3: Resting blood pressure, as measured by SBP and DBP, will be different following&#xD;
                a 3-month exercise and diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  H4: Total body fat, as measured by DXA, will be different following a 3-month&#xD;
                exercise and diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related measures will be different following a 3-month exercise and diet&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  H1: Cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)&#xD;
                will be different following a 3-month exercise and diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  H2: Bone-mineral density, as measured by DXA, will be different following a 3-month&#xD;
                exercise and diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  H3: Dietary measures (total daily kcal, and daily fat kcal) will be different&#xD;
                following a 3-month exercise and diet intervention.&#xD;

      -  Recruitment: Participants who have signed up for the research recruitment mailing list&#xD;
           at the UCSF/Mt. Zion Osteoporosis Center will be mailed a CHR approved recruitment&#xD;
           letter that briefly describes the study purpose and eligibility criteria. Only the&#xD;
           individual's name and address are on the mailing list; there is no medical information.&#xD;
           Medical records are not accessed. Telephone screening will take place in the ESS&#xD;
           Department at USF. A script will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre and Post-Testing: Interested subject candidates will be scheduled to meet with Dr.&#xD;
           Orri or Dr. Thompson at USF to provide written informed consent and complete a health&#xD;
           history questionnaire (see appendix) to evaluate their CV risk. They will obtain written&#xD;
           medical notification from their physician stating that they are in adequate diabetic&#xD;
           control and cleared to begin an exercise program. Once selected, measurements of HT, WT,&#xD;
           WHR, SBP, and DBP will take place in the ESS lab at USF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws: Subjects will arrive at the UCSF GCRC after a 12-hr fast. The blood&#xD;
           variables obtained will include: CRP, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, FG, fasting insulin (HOMA&#xD;
           calculated for marker of insulin resistance), and HbA1c. Approximately 2 tablespoons of&#xD;
           blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone mineral density: BMD measurements (dual X-ray absorptiometry, DXA) will take place&#xD;
           at the General Clinical Research Center at UCSF following the blood draw. A snack will&#xD;
           be provided to the subjects prior to entering the DXA scanning area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiorespiratory fitness: Maximal exercise testing will be using a treadmill protocol&#xD;
           in the Exercise Physiology Laboratory at UCSF General Clinical Research Center. Tests&#xD;
           will be conducted by Dr. Orri, Dr. Thompson, and Joanne Krasnoff, M.S. The Naughton&#xD;
           protocol will be used in which the grade is increased 3.5% every 2 min, while the speed&#xD;
           remains at 2 mph after the warmup. The subject continues until volitional exhaustion or&#xD;
           the exercise technicians terminate test end as designated by the American College of&#xD;
           Sports Medicine (ACSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during the testing sessions to&#xD;
      monitor for dysrhythmias or ischemia. Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored every 2&#xD;
      minutes. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be assessed every minute of the test.&#xD;
      Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), as well as maximal levels of blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and RPE will be recorded at the end of the test and used to&#xD;
      determine the exercise training intensity. Expired gases will be collected throughout the&#xD;
      test with CO2 and O2 and volume analyzed for calculation of oxygen uptake using a Quinton QMC&#xD;
      computerized gas analysis system (Quinton Instruments, Bothell WA). All exercise technicians&#xD;
      will be CPR and first-aid certified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition and BMD: Per cent body fat (%BF) and BMD will determined using dual&#xD;
           energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). All scans will be done on a GE-Lunar Prodigy&#xD;
           (Madison, WI). Variables of interest from the DXA scan will be %BF, total fat mass, lean&#xD;
           body mass (LBM), and bone mineral density in g/cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise intervention: The 3-month exercise intervention will take place at the&#xD;
           Millberry Union fitness center at UCSF, times per week for 30 min each session,&#xD;
           accompanied by certified fitness professional who is trained to work with special&#xD;
           populations. All standard emergency procedures will be followed by the trained UCSF&#xD;
           staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise program design: Study participants will be required to complete 36 exercise&#xD;
           sessions in the 12 week program. They will exercise a minimum of 3 times per week for 30&#xD;
           min, accompanied by certified fitness professional who is trained to work with special&#xD;
           populations. Participants will wear a HR monitor and be instructed to maintain an&#xD;
           intensity in the range of 50-85% VO2peak obtained through max testing. During the&#xD;
           initial phase of training (first 4 weeks), participants who are unable to exercise&#xD;
           continuously for 30 minutes will perform intermittent exercise bouts of 10 minutes&#xD;
           followed by 5 min of rest. Mode of exercise will be self-selected and will involve large&#xD;
           muscle groups, incorporating any combination of the following machines: treadmill,&#xD;
           stationary cycle, elliptical, Stairmaster, or rowing ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood glucose monitoring: Participants will be instructed to consume a snack 30-60 min&#xD;
           before exercise. Prior to beginning each exercise session, all subjects will monitor&#xD;
           their blood glucose to verify that it is between 100 and 250 mg/dl, in the absence of&#xD;
           hypo/hyperglycemic symptoms (6). In addition, subjects will be monitored for 30 min&#xD;
           post-exercise to verify that their BG is &gt; 70 mg/dl. Juice and protein snacks (peanut&#xD;
           butter &amp; crackers) will be available to the subjects in case of post-exercise&#xD;
           hypoglycemia. The exercise supervisor will be aware of those subjects who are taking&#xD;
           medications that promote insulin production and will carry a glucagon pen. Late-evening&#xD;
           exercise sessions will be avoided in order to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary intervention: The subjects will receive six 30-min nutrition group counseling&#xD;
           sessions with a dietitian. Sessions 1 and 6 will involve instruction on preparing 3-day&#xD;
           dietary logs, while sessions 2-5 will consist of selected topics (i.e. dietary&#xD;
           recommendations, low sodium diets, blood glucose control).&#xD;
