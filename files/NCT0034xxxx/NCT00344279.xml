    <textblock>
      This study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Tuberculosis Research&#xD;
      Centre and YRG-Care in Chennai, India, will examine how treatment of lymphatic filariasis in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients influences the amount of HIV virus in the blood and the progression of&#xD;
      HIV infection to AIDS. Filarial infections are common in Chennai, and it is important to&#xD;
      understand whether treatment of filariasis affects the course of HIV disease. The information&#xD;
      gained from this study could be used to modify treatments for people both with HIV and&#xD;
      filarial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are receiving treatment for HIV infection at the&#xD;
      Government Hospital HIV clinic or YRG-Care may be eligible for this study. Two groups of&#xD;
      patients will be recruited - patients with both HIV and filarial infections, and patients who&#xD;
      have HIV infection alone, without filariasis. Candidates are screened with a medical history&#xD;
      and review of medical records, physical examination, and blood and stool tests. Women have a&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one month of screening, all participants receive a single dose of diethylcarbamazine&#xD;
      and albendazole, a drug regimen commonly used to treat filarial infection. Patients are&#xD;
      followed closely for the first 2 weeks after treatment to check for side effects. They are&#xD;
      then seen at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment dose for a physical examination and&#xD;
      blood test.&#xD;

      To determine the effect of pre-existing filarial infection and its treatment on viral burden&#xD;
      and clinical parameters in patients infected with HIV, this study aims to follow plasma HIV&#xD;
      loads, CD4 counts, and clinical parameters in a population of HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      co-infected with Wuchereria bancrofti, prior to and after treatment of filarial infection.&#xD;
      The study individuals will be drawn from the patient cohort followed by the HIV Clinic at the&#xD;
      Government General Hospital and the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, India, or those&#xD;
      from YRG-Care (Chennai, India), an area endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF) and where the&#xD;
      prevalence of HIV infection in the general population is about 7%. These patients are adults&#xD;
      of all ages, both males and females, come from the states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradhesh.&#xD;
      Having established as part of a previous protocol (01-I-N022) an HIV/filarial coprevalence of&#xD;
      6-10% based on W. bancrofti circulating antigen detection in HIV-positive and -negative&#xD;
      individuals, patients in whom co-infection with HIV and LF has been diagnosed will be paired&#xD;
      with two HIV-positive (but filarial antigen negative) clinic controls matched for age,&#xD;
      gender, viral load antiretroviral therapy and CD4 count. All efforts will be made to connect&#xD;
      study participants with programs for antiretroviral distribution. Within a month of a&#xD;
      baseline clinical evaluation, patients and controls will receive a single dose of the&#xD;
      combination of diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (the drug combination given as part of national&#xD;
      campaigns to eliminate LF) and will then be followed with viral loads, CD4 counts and&#xD;
      clinical examinations at one week, as well as 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the administration.&#xD;
      By assessing these changes, the influence of a co-existing filarial infection on plasma HIV&#xD;
      viral load, CD4 count and clinical course can be determined. At the end of the study period,&#xD;
      all participants will be re-assessed for filarial antibody and antigen to ensure absence of&#xD;
      the parasite. Any patient who has evidence of ongoing filarial infection with W. bancrofti&#xD;
      will be re-treated with DEC/albendazole.&#xD;
