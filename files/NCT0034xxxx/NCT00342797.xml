  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric ocular tumor caused by germline and/or somatic mutations&#xD;
      in the tumor suppressor gene RB1. Survivors of retinoblastoma, particularly those with the&#xD;
      hereditary form of the disease (germline RB1 mutations) are highly susceptible to developing&#xD;
      additional malignancies, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Since 1984, REB&#xD;
      has followed a cohort of 2136 (including 1,995 one-year) retinoblastoma survivors to&#xD;
      investigate the contributions of treatment and genetic risk factors to second cancer&#xD;
      etiology. The last systematic follow-up for second cancer incidence and cause-specific&#xD;
      mortality was completed in 2009. As the cohort ages, we now propose to conduct another&#xD;
      interview survey to collect information on newly diagnosed second cancers. Additionally, we&#xD;
      propose to expand collection of germline DNA for additional molecular studies in survivors.&#xD;
      Retinoblastoma survivors have now entered adult ages when epithelial tumors would be expected&#xD;
      to occur with greater frequency. Given that the somatic mutations in the RB1 pathway have&#xD;
      been identified in several epithelial tumors (bladder, brain, breast, esophagus, liver, lung,&#xD;
      prostate) in addition to sarcomas, it is important to collect new information on these&#xD;
      epithelial tumors, and to investigate whether the previously identified high risks of&#xD;
      sarcomas and melanoma will persist as the cohort ages. Additionally, our understanding of&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility to second cancers is limited. Given that this is the only cohort of&#xD;
      long-term survivors of retinoblastoma being followed in the U.S., combined with the&#xD;
      leadership role of REB in the study of second cancers, continued follow-up of this cohort&#xD;
      will provide unique clinical and epidemiologic data on the long-term cumulative risk of&#xD;
      second cancers in this distinctive cohort of childhood cancer survivors.&#xD;
