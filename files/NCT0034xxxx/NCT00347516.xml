  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantation of an intraocular lens is the gold standard in modern day cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriate lens power needed to achieve the desired refractive outcome can be calculated&#xD;
      with a whole variety of formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been no prospective study conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the IOL&#xD;
      power calculation formulae commonly in use. It is well established that the frequently used&#xD;
      IOL formulas do not show significant differences when used in eyes of average axial length&#xD;
      (i.e. between 22mm and 25mm) and it is at the extremes of axial lengths where discrepancies&#xD;
      arise. Our aim is to find the most appropriate formula(e) for these 'long' and 'short eyes'&#xD;
      particularly in our population where there is a significant proportion of high myopes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to compare three IOL power calculation formulae and determine the&#xD;
      most appropriate formula for accurate prediction of postoperative refractive error in Asian&#xD;
      eyes with axial length less than 22mm and greater than 25mm that are undergoing&#xD;
      phacoemulsification cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized prospective study in patients with axial lengths less than 22mm and&#xD;
      greater than 25mm undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery and IOL implantation. Each&#xD;
      patient will be randomly assigned to have their IOL power calculated using one of three IOL&#xD;
      power calculation formulae (SRK-T, Hoffer Q and Holladay 2). A randomization list will be&#xD;
      used to decide the IOL formula allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of this study is the mean absolute error (MAE) which is&#xD;
      calculated by subtracting the intended formula-derived preoperative refractive error from the&#xD;
      actual postoperative refractive error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the estimates from a previous study, it is postulated that the MAE for Hoffer Q,&#xD;
      Holladay 2, and SRK-T are +0.36 D, +0.53 D &amp; +0.74 D, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest here is pair-wise comparisons amongst SRK-T, Hoffer Q and Holladay 2. The sample&#xD;
      size calculations for each pair-wise comparison is based on a SD of 0.57 D with a power of&#xD;
      80% and a 2-sided test of 5%. Using equal randomization, a total of 176 subjects would be&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve statistical differences between Hoffer Q over the Holladay 2 &amp; SRK-T&#xD;
      and also the Holladay 2 over SRK-T (standardized effect difference of 30% between Hoffer Q &amp;&#xD;
      Holladay 2; 67% &amp; 37% effect size for Hoffer Q vs SRK-T and Hollady 2 vs SRK-T,&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factoring in an attrition rate of 20%, a total sample size of 210 eyes will be recruited for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, Snellen visual acuity will be assessed and all patients will undergo a&#xD;
      non-cycloplegic autorefraction, keratometry measurement and axial length measurement with the&#xD;
      Zeiss IOL Master (see below Visit 1). All patients will undergo phacoemulsification and&#xD;
      'in-the-bag' IOL implantation (Visit 2). Surgery will be performed through a 2.75mm temporal&#xD;
      clear corneal incision and only the Alcon MA60BM or MA60MA 3-piece acrylic foldable IOL will&#xD;
      be implanted. A standard postoperative topical antibiotic and anti-inflammatory regime&#xD;
      consisting of tobramycin and beclomethasone will be administered (Visit 3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be examined at the following intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Within 90 days prior to surgery Preoperative (Visit 1) Within 30 days prior to&#xD;
      surgery Operative (Visit 2) Day of surgery Postoperative (Visit 3) 1 day after surgery&#xD;
      Postoperative (Visit 4) 3-5 days after surgery Postoperative (Visit 5) 4-5 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery Postoperative (Visit 6) 3-4 months after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, logMAR visual acuity will be recorded at every visit and non-cycloplegic&#xD;
      refraction will be carried out at Visit 5 and Visit 6.&#xD;
