  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mycobacterium w in new&#xD;
      lung tuberculosis patients. Mycobacterium w is a strain of bacterium which is being used as&#xD;
      vaccine and adjunct drug against leprosy. This agent has also been found to be useful in the&#xD;
      treatment of lung tuberculosis in limited number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are conducting this study in category-I patients( As per World Health Organization,Geneva&#xD;
      classification of tuberculosis) having lung tuberculosis to see the efficacy and also to see&#xD;
      any change in the immunological parameters.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium w is a recently introduced immunomodulator ,which has been found to be useful&#xD;
      in rapid killing of Mycobacterium leprae. It improves clearance of Mycobacterium leprae from&#xD;
      body and is thereby useful in reducing duration of therapy significantly for multibacillary&#xD;
      leprosy. Mycobacterium w shares antigens with Mycobacterium leprae as well as Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis. Mycobacterium w is also found to be useful in prevention of tuberculosis in&#xD;
      experimental animals. Previous studies for efficacy of Mycobacterium w as immunomodulator in&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis patients have shown faster sputum conversion rates in patients given&#xD;
      Mycobacterium w as an adjuvant therapy along with standard anti-tuberculosis treatment. It&#xD;
      has faster and remarkable sputum converting capacity. Similar studies conducted in pulmonary&#xD;
      TB category -II [Re-treatment as per Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP),&#xD;
      Govt. of India] patients have shown improved cure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycobacterium w is commercially available under the brand name of &quot;Immuvac&quot; injection in 0.5&#xD;
      ml multi-dose vials approved for use as immunomodulator against Mycobacterium leprae in&#xD;
      patients with leprosy. Each vial has 500 million heat-killed bacilli in a buffered solution.&#xD;
      It is manufactured by Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Ahmedabad, Gujarat-382 210, India. In this&#xD;
      clinical trial one dose consists of 0.1 ml given as intradermal injection, which contains 100&#xD;
      million bacilli. A total of 6 doses are given during the Intensive Phase(as per&#xD;
      RNTCP,Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,Govt.of India) of treatment. Two injections on&#xD;
      both upper arms on day-0 and subsequently one injection on days 14,28,42 and 56. No&#xD;
      injections are given during the Continuation Phase(as per RNTCP,Ministry of Health and Family&#xD;
      Welfare,Govt.of India)of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of now it is not commercially available for therapeutic use in TB patients as&#xD;
      immunomodulator.Therefore we are investigating Mycobacterium w for its efficacy in TB&#xD;
      patients in a &quot;double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical control trial&quot; fashion. We&#xD;
      are conducting this trial in Category-I pulmonary TB Patients(as per RNTCP,Ministry of Health&#xD;
      and Family Welfare,Govt.of India),and are assessing the outcome in the form of clinical&#xD;
      improvement,sputum conversion and immunological parameters. This is a multi-centric trial&#xD;
      sponsored by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of&#xD;
      India and Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India.&#xD;
