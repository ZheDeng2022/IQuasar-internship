  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1948, the Framingham Study has examined a group of men and women every two years for&#xD;
      the primary purpose of studying the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      its risk factors. In 1971 the Framingham Study began a study of the offspring of the original&#xD;
      group, including data collection on blood pressure, cigarette smoking, weight, and other&#xD;
      factors that are of interest to studies of eye disease. Researchers gave eye exams to some of&#xD;
      the original group and to the offspring group. Data from these eye exams have been used to&#xD;
      examine risk factors for cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, myopia, and glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use the previously collected data for continued research on&#xD;
      eye-related disorders. No new eye examinations will be conducted.&#xD;

      We propose to continue to analyze existing Framingham Eye and Heart Study data to identify&#xD;
      possible risk factors for various eye diseases. Originally begun in 1948 by the National&#xD;
      Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the Framingham Heart Study has been examining a&#xD;
      population-based cohort of men and women biennially since 1948 for the primary purpose of&#xD;
      studying the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. In 1971&#xD;
      the Heart Study began a prospective study of the offspring of the original cohort. The Heart&#xD;
      Study has collected data on blood pressure, cigarette smoking, weight and many other factors&#xD;
      of interest for epidemiologic studies of eye disease. Eye examinations were conducted on the&#xD;
      survivors of the original cohort in a collaborative effort between the NEI and the NHLBI&#xD;
      between 1973 and 1975 (Framingham Eye Study I; FES I) and then again between 1986 and 1989&#xD;
      (Framingham Eye Study II; FES II). Eye examinations were conducted on the Offspring Cohort&#xD;
      from 1989 to 1991 (Framingham Offspring Eye Study; FOES). The Framingham data are unique in&#xD;
      allowing epidemiologic studies with both cross sectional and longitudinal designs. Over the&#xD;
      years, data from the Heart Study and the various eye studies have been used to examine&#xD;
      demographic and risk factor characteristics for cataract, diabetic retinopathy, myopia, and&#xD;
      glaucoma. To date this collaborative effort has yielded 31 publications by the National Eye&#xD;
      Institute's Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research; Rita Hiller is an author of 11.&#xD;
      This proposal is for the continued use of the previously collected Framingham data. All&#xD;
      studies will be done in collaboration with Heart Study investigators from Boston University&#xD;
      which manages the study and conducts annual IRB reviews. No new eye examinations will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
