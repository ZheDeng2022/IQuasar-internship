  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether genetic differences among individuals affect blood levels of&#xD;
      certain chemicals called DBPs after showering. Chemicals such as chlorine and ozone are used&#xD;
      to kill germs in water. These chemicals may react with organic matter in the water and form&#xD;
      other chemicals called disinfection byproducts, or DBPs. Although people are usually exposed&#xD;
      to DBPs by drinking tap water, these chemicals may also penetrate the body during showering.&#xD;
      This study will see whether the levels of DBPs after showering vary among individuals&#xD;
      depending on differences in genes that code for enzymes called GSTT1, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1,&#xD;
      which break down DBPs. This study, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, is conducted at the University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh's Center for Clinical Pharmacology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults between 18 and 45 years of age who do not smoke cigarettes and are not taking&#xD;
      any medicines may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history&#xD;
      and blood and urine tests. Participants are given a diary to record the foods they eat and&#xD;
      how much water they drink during the 2 days before their study appointment. The following&#xD;
      activities are scheduled on the appointment day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of blood pressure, height, and weight, and pregnancy test for women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about alcohol consumed and medications taken in the last 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of food and water diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview for demographic information (name, address, date of birth, etc.) and other&#xD;
           information, such as sex, height, weight. Subjects are also asked about anything, such&#xD;
           as exercise, that might affect their breathing, since breathing problems are a rare side&#xD;
           effect of chlorzoxazone, a drug used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw and insertion of a small catheter (plastic tube) to allow for additional&#xD;
           blood draws during the test procedure without having repeated needle sticks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10-minute shower in a private bathroom&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection 10 minutes after the shower and again at 30 minutes after the&#xD;
           shower&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose of chlorzoxazone (a drug used to treat muscle pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview about subject's exposure to water&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Light breakfast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine collections 2 hours after the chlorzoxazone dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lunch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observation for drug side effects for 2 hours, or longer if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven blood samples totaling 75 milliliters (about 5 tablespoonfuls) of blood are collected&#xD;
      during this study. The blood is tested for chemicals called trihalomethanes to see how they&#xD;
      are broken down. The urine samples are tested for chemicals called haloacetic acids, which&#xD;
      are found in tap water after it has been treated with chlorine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disinfection byproducts in drinking water (DBP) are inadvertently created when chlorine&#xD;
      interacts with organic compounds in the untreated water. DBP have been implicated in elevated&#xD;
      risk of several types of cancer. Until recently, ingestion was considered to be the major&#xD;
      route of exposure. However, an NCI collaborative study in Spain is now showing a link between&#xD;
      bladder cancer and exposure to DBP in water during showering or bathing. However, little is&#xD;
      known of the mechanisms of action. Almost all drinking water disinfected with chlorine&#xD;
      contains measurable levels of DBP. The DBP found in greatest concentration are the&#xD;
      trihalomethanes [(THM); chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane, and&#xD;
      dibromochloromethane]. Previously, our collaborators from the CDC measured changes in blood&#xD;
      THM levels after showering and bathing, and ingesting water. Showering resulted in the&#xD;
      largest increases, with a wide range in the increase among subjects with similar exposures.&#xD;
      Enzyme variants due to genetic polymorphisms may be responsible for these differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to assess the association between the presence of enzyme variants (genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms) and the increase of trihalomethanes in the blood of people exposed to DBP&#xD;
      while showering. The study will be conducted at the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC),&#xD;
      Center for Clinical Pharmacology (CCP), University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Robert Branch,&#xD;
      Director. Approximately 250 volunteers will be identified from Dr. Branch's ongoing research&#xD;
      program. These subjects will have been pre-screened with a normal standard blood panel and&#xD;
      for genetic polymorphisms of interest. From this pool of pre-screened individuals, we will&#xD;
      recruit approximately 100 people who have enzyme variants of differing activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask the 100 volunteers to provide seven 10-mL blood samples and two urine samples,&#xD;
      and take a 10-minute shower at the study site (the CCP in Pittsburgh, PA). Blood samples will&#xD;
      be analyzed for trihalomethane concentrations, and red blood cell enzyme activities. To study&#xD;
      the activity of the enzyme CYP2E1, we will administer a single dose of chlorzoxazone, a&#xD;
      muscle relaxant metabolized by this enzyme. We will measure enzyme activity by analyzing&#xD;
      blood samples collected 2 hours post-administration. We will conduct a brief interview with&#xD;
      each volunteer to obtain demographic and other information that might impact the dose of THM.&#xD;
      We will collect ambient air samples before, during and after showering for each participant&#xD;
      and analyze them for levels of THMs. A water sample will be collected during showering and&#xD;
      analyzed for levels of THM and haloacetic acids. We will ask 10 randomly selected study&#xD;
      subjects to repeat study activities for quality control purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of THM in blood before and after showering, and the rate of decrease in blood&#xD;
      concentration, will be analyzed with respect to the presence of genetic polymorphisms for&#xD;
      selected enzymes, or their phenotypic activity. Blood THM levels will also be compared with&#xD;
      various demographic and physiologic measurements. To test intra-individual variation in&#xD;
      several measures, ten randomly selected participants (stratified by sex, i.e. 5 males and 5&#xD;
      females) will be asked to conduct the study twice, with the two study appointments separated&#xD;
      by at least a week.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study population will be comprised of non-smoking males and females in the age range&#xD;
        18-45 years. The age range was selected to limit variability in activity of important&#xD;
        enzyme systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSIONS CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons with lung conditions will be excluded because inhalation is a major route of&#xD;
        exposure for trihalomethanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Liver conditions will be excluded because of the potential risks possibly associated with&#xD;
        chlorzoxazone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant and lactating women will be excluded from participation in the study, for multiple&#xD;
        reasons, the major one being possible (but unknown) adverse health risks from chlorzoxazone&#xD;
        exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, we will exclude persons with chronic conditions such as diabetes who&#xD;
        chronically use medication, such as Orinase or others. These persons will be excluded due&#xD;
        to unknown effects of such disease on the enzyme systems under investigation and to avoid&#xD;
        any possible adverse effects of the study, including chlorzoxazone administration.&#xD;
