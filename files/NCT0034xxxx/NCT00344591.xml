  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Structured Ecosystems Therapy (SET), a form of&#xD;
      therapy that includes family and caregivers, at reducing HIV transmission risk behaviors and&#xD;
      improving treatment adherence in HIV infected men newly released from prison.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals in prison are four times more likely to have HIV or AIDS as compared to&#xD;
      non-incarcerated people. Once HIV infected individuals are released from prison, they have a&#xD;
      high risk of transmitting HIV to their sexual or needle-sharing partners. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      important to encourage HIV risk reduction behavior among such inmates who are nearing release&#xD;
      from prison. SET is a therapy program that mobilizes family and caregivers as a way to&#xD;
      support and encourage behavior change within an individual. This study will use a tailored&#xD;
      SET program to meet the specific needs of prisoners who are infected with HIV. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to compare the effectiveness of the tailored SET program versus an individually&#xD;
      focused therapy program at reducing sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk factors and&#xD;
      increasing HIV treatment adherence in HIV infected men who have recently been released from&#xD;
      prison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 12-month study will enroll HIV infected men who are being released from the California&#xD;
      Medical Facility Prison in Vacaville, California or the San Quentin State Prison in Marin&#xD;
      County, California. Participants will meet with study recruiters while in prison and complete&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk behaviors and&#xD;
      treatment adherence; they will also participate in a health education session. Participants&#xD;
      will then be randomly assigned to either a 4-month tailored SET program or a 4-month&#xD;
      individually focused therapy program. All participants will meet with study counselors twice&#xD;
      while still in prison, and then weekly during the first 4 months following release from&#xD;
      prison. Participants in the SET program will work with study counselors to tailor the program&#xD;
      to meet their individual needs. Therapy sessions will be designed to restructure interactions&#xD;
      and communication patterns between the participant and his support network; main goals will&#xD;
      include reducing sexual and drug-related risk behaviors and improving HIV treatment&#xD;
      adherence. Participants in the individually focused therapy program will focus on harm&#xD;
      reduction, goal setting, and motivational enhancement. HIV transmission risk behaviors and&#xD;
      treatment adherence will be assessed with surveys administered at Months 4, 8, and 12 for all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
