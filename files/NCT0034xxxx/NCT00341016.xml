    <textblock>
      Leukemia holds a special place in the study of radiation-related cancer because bone marrow&#xD;
      is one of the tissues most sensitive to the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation,&#xD;
      radiogenic leukemia has the shortest latent period among radiation-induced cancers, and its&#xD;
      appearance suggests that solid tumors may follow. These same characteristics also contribute&#xD;
      to its considerable significance in radiation protection. There are, nevertheless, important&#xD;
      gaps in existing knowledge of radiation-induced leukemia, gaps that derive from&#xD;
      characteristics of the study of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and from&#xD;
      studies of the effects of medical irradiation and studies of nuclear workers, these being the&#xD;
      studies that have provided most of the information to date. These gaps include the presumed&#xD;
      reduction in risk resulting from dose-fractionation and low dose-rate, and the time-response&#xD;
      function in the first five years after exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate leukemia risk as a function of such&#xD;
      radiation; it would constitute the largest epidemiologic study conducted to date among&#xD;
      working-age males, a group of particular concern in establishing occupational radiation&#xD;
      safety standards. In addition, data on cases of multiple myeloma and myelodysplasia&#xD;
      identified in the cohort will be collected to test the hypothesis of a dose related&#xD;
      association between radiation and increased risk for each of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary scientific objectives of the proposed study are to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
      (a) that there is a dose-related increase in risk of leukemia among these liquidators; (b)&#xD;
      that the magnitude of any observed risk per unit dose is less than that seen in the atomic&#xD;
      bomb survivors, exposed to essentially instantaneous radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsidiary objectives include: (a) to investigate the nature of the dose-response&#xD;
      relationship among liquidators and to identify modifiers of risk, including time since&#xD;
      exposure, age at exposure, etc.; (b) to test the hypothesis that there is a dose-related&#xD;
      increased risk of multiple myeloma; (c) to test the hypothesis that there is a dose-related&#xD;
      increased risk of myelodysplasial; (d) to collect and store buccal cells from about 2,000&#xD;
      liquidators with a wide range of dose estimates extending to well over 1 Gy for possible use&#xD;
      in future molecular studies of their DNA.&#xD;

      Leukemia holds a special place in the study of radiation-related cancer because bone marrow&#xD;
      is one of the tissues most sensitive to the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation.&#xD;
      Radiogenic leukemia has the shortest latent period among radiation-induced cancers, and its&#xD;
      appearance suggests that solid tumors may follow. These same characteristics also contribute&#xD;
      to its considerable significance in radiation protection. There are, nevertheless, important&#xD;
      gaps in existing knowledge of radiation-induced leukemia, gaps that derive from&#xD;
      characteristics of the study of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and from&#xD;
      studies of the effects of medical irradiation and studies of nuclear workers; these are the&#xD;
      studies that have provided most of the information to date. The gaps include the presumed&#xD;
      reduction in risk resulting from dose-fractionation and low dose-rate, as well as the time-&#xD;
      response function in the first five years after exposure. The study described herein is&#xD;
      intended to fill those gaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chornobyl accident exposed hundreds of thousands of people to radiation, notably those&#xD;
      involved in its cleanup operations. The second phase of a case-control study of ionizing&#xD;
      radiation and leukemia is being conducted in a cohort of approximately 100,000 Ukrainian&#xD;
      &quot;liquidators&quot; involved in cleanup work following the accident at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power&#xD;
      Plant in northern Ukraine which occurred on April 26, 1986. The cohort is restricted to&#xD;
      liquidators who first worked around the power plant between 1986 and 1990 and were residents,&#xD;
      when first registered in the Chornobyl State Registry, in Kyiv City or in one of five oblasts&#xD;
      (major civil divisions) that comprise the study area. This cohort, consisting of males of&#xD;
      working age, received mean bone marrow doses of approximately 80-100 milli-gray (mGy) at low&#xD;
      to moderate dose rates, with those sent earlier receiving the highest doses. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to investigate leukemia risk as a function of such radiation; it&#xD;
      constitutes probably the largest epidemiologic study conducted to date among working-age&#xD;
      males, a group of particular concern in establishing occupational radiation safety standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary scientific objectives of the proposed study are to evaluate whether there is a&#xD;
      doserelated increase in risk of leukemia among these liquidators, and how it compares with&#xD;
      the observed risk per unit dose seen in the atomic bomb survivors, exposed to essentially&#xD;
      instantaneous radiation. A secondary objective is to identify any modifiers of risk,&#xD;
      including time since exposure, age at exposure, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field work for the second phase of the study, with an extended case ascertainment for&#xD;
      2001 through 2006 has been complated. As a result of the second phase, a total of75 confirmed&#xD;
      cases of leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma have been ascertained. We are currently in&#xD;
      the process of database construction, dosimetric calculation for data analyses for leukemia,&#xD;
      and manuscript preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small sub-study on uncertainties associated with human factors is to be started upon&#xD;
      SSIRB approval.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We intend to include in the proposed study all 350 clean-up workers with &quot;historical&quot;&#xD;
        records and 150 proxies to be identified by the liquidators; however, we anticipate a&#xD;
        considerable number of them will not be available for the study due to deaths, not being&#xD;
        able to be traced, no response, refusals, etc. The study subjects will be interviewed in&#xD;
        person. All study subjects are males, median age of early liquidators is 64 y while for&#xD;
        clean-up workers sent to mission is about 61 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded from the study will be those who have been found to be deceased, cannot be&#xD;
        located, refuse to participate in the study, or do not provide informed consent.&#xD;
