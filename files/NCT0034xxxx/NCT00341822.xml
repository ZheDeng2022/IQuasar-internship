      This study will explore the decision-making experiences of women who are currently pregnant&#xD;
      following a period of infertility on whether or not to undergo an invasive prenatal test&#xD;
      (IPT) procedure, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Women who become&#xD;
      pregnant after infertility often experience heightened anxiety regarding the outcome of the&#xD;
      pregnancy. When choosing whether or not to have IPT they are faced with a complex decision,&#xD;
      set in the unique context of a pregnancy that they often perceive as exceptionally&#xD;
      precarious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are pregnant with their first child after a period of infertility and have made a&#xD;
      decision regarding whether or not to undergo IPT may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete an online password-protected questionnaire that measures infertility&#xD;
      and decision-making variables and explores women's perceptions of the impact of infertility&#xD;
      on their IPT decision-making process. The questionnaire covers the following areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's demographic information, such as age, marital status, number of children,&#xD;
           education, race, ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's infertility history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's thoughts and feelings about infertility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's thoughts and concerns about other people's (e.g., husband, doctor, other&#xD;
           infertile women) opinions about IPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's decision about whether or not to have IPT and her feelings regarding the&#xD;
           decision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of subject's infertility history on her decision to have or not have IPT&#xD;

      Women who are pregnant after infertility often experience heightened anxiety regarding the&#xD;
      outcome of the pregnancy. When choosing whether or not to have invasive prenatal testing they&#xD;
      are faced with a complex decision, set in the unique context of a pregnancy that they often&#xD;
      perceive as exceptionally precious. The proposed study aims to explore the invasive prenatal&#xD;
      testing decision-making experiences of women who are pregnant after infertility. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional design will be used to investigate relationships between the infertility&#xD;
      experience and decisional conflict associated with deciding whether or not to have invasive&#xD;
      prenatal testing. Women who are pregnant after infertility will be recruited from online&#xD;
      support groups and websites for pregnancy after infertility. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire that measures infertility and decision-making variables and elicits&#xD;
      their perceptions of the impact of infertility on their IPT decision-making experience. The&#xD;
      main outcome measure is decisional conflict.&#xD;
