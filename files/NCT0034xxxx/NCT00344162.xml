  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine a possible genetic basis for preeclampsia, a disorder of high blood&#xD;
      pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy. Preeclampsia is a major pregnancy&#xD;
      complication affecting both mother and baby. Previous research has shown that preeclampsia&#xD;
      tends to run in certain families. This study will determine which genes may be involved in&#xD;
      preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have had preeclampsia (called the index woman) may be eligible for this study. They&#xD;
      will be recruited through the Preeclampsia Foundation. In addition, the following relatives&#xD;
      of the index woman may be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The child from the preeclampsic pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The index woman's biological parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The index woman's siblings who have given birth or fathered a child and their family&#xD;
           members&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will exclude any index women or family members who have had chronic hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, or whose pregnancy that involved preeclampsia was a&#xD;
      multiple fetus pregnancy or that was conceived through use of fertility technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women participants fill out a questionnaire to collect demographic data (e.g., age, race,&#xD;
      marital status, etc.) and information on their medical and reproductive history, use of&#xD;
      tobacco and medicines, and other factors that may be associated with preeclampsia syndrome.&#xD;
      Women who have had preeclampsia or hypertension in pregnancy are asked to sign a medical&#xD;
      record release form for study investigators to obtain a copy of the medical record for that&#xD;
      pregnancy. All male and female participants provide a mouthwash rinse sample for extraction&#xD;
      of DNA for gene studies. For babies too young to rinse with mouthwash, a soft brush is used&#xD;
      to brush the inside of the mouth to collect cheek cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouthwash samples are analyzed for genes that may be associated with preeclampsia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a syndrome of hypertension accompanied by proteinuria. It is a major&#xD;
      pregnancy complication, associated with premature delivery, fetal growth restriction,&#xD;
      abruptio placentae, and fetal death, as well as maternal morbidity and mortality. Although&#xD;
      preeclampsia has been recognized for centuries, the etiology of this disorder remains&#xD;
      unknown. Familial clustering of preeclampsia has long been identified, leading to the concept&#xD;
      of a genetic basis for this syndrome. We propose a familial genetic study of preeclampsia. As&#xD;
      such a study is often difficult to do, we plan to conduct a pilot study to test the&#xD;
      feasibility, logistics and examine frequency of genetic polymorphism of certain genes in the&#xD;
      target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 women who had preeclampsia during their first pregnancy will be identified&#xD;
      through the Preeclampsia Foundation. Women who had chronic hypertension or diabetes prior to&#xD;
      the first pregnancy will be excluded. We also will try to enroll their family members to this&#xD;
      study. All subjects will be asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire and collect&#xD;
      mouth wash samples. Women who reported having hypertension during pregnancy will be asked to&#xD;
      sign a medical record release form. A copy of the medical record will be obtained to confirm&#xD;
      the diagnosis of preeclampsia. DNA will be extracted from buccal cells. Frequency of&#xD;
      polymorphisms for a number of candidate genes (e.g., HLA-G, AGT, eNOS, MTHFR, IL-1 beta,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, Prothrombin, and Factor V Leiden) will be examined. Information and experience&#xD;
      gained from this pilot study will be most valuable for use to plan a main study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who have had documented severe preeclampsia or eclampsia in their first pregnancy in&#xD;
        the past 10 years will be potentially eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Through the index woman, we will invite her biological parents, siblings who have given&#xD;
        birth or fathered a child and their family members to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded will be those who had chronic hypertension, diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome,&#xD;
        or the index pregnancy was a multifetal gestation or conceived by assisted reproductive&#xD;
        technology.&#xD;
