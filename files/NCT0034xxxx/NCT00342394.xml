  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes an exposure assessment study of farmers in North Carolina and Iowa&#xD;
      who personally apply the fungicides captan, thiophanate-methyl, and benomyl to apple and&#xD;
      peach orchards. The exposure assessment will include environmental measurements as well as&#xD;
      biological monitoring data. The biomonitoring data will be based on 24-hour urinary&#xD;
      metabolites of the three fungicides selected for study. The study is being done in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Argicultural Health Study (AHS), a large prospective health study of&#xD;
      licensed private (farmer) and commercial applicators, and the spouses of private applicators.&#xD;
      The AHS is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of&#xD;
      Environmental Health Sciences and the Environmental Protection Agency. The study described&#xD;
      here will be conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the objectives of this study are 1) to measure actual exposures to the target&#xD;
      fungicides using both environmental and biological measures of exposure, 2) to identify and&#xD;
      quantify major determinants of exposure, 3) to describe within- and between-worker exposure&#xD;
      variability, and 4) to evaluate, to the extent possible, agreement between exposure estimates&#xD;
      computed using the AHS exposure algorithms and exposure estimates based on actual&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;

      This protocol describes an exposure assessment study of farmers in North Carolina and Iowa&#xD;
      who personally apply the fungicides captan, thiophanate-methyl, and benomyl to apple and&#xD;
      peach orchards. The exposure assessment will include environmental measurements as well as&#xD;

      The AHS is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of&#xD;
      Environmental Health Sciences and the Environmental Protection Agency. The study described&#xD;
      here will be conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal degeneration among applicators in the AHS has been associated with cumulative days of&#xD;
      use of five fungicides, including captan and benomyl, which are or have been heavily used in&#xD;
      orchards. Minimal monitoring data are available on fungicide exposures among orchard&#xD;
      applicators in the U.S. Agent-specific exposure classification in the AHS is based primarily&#xD;
      on questionnaire data, supplemented by exposure monitoring data from non-cohort studies in&#xD;
      the literature. An algorithm has been developed by AHS to estimate an individual's cumulative&#xD;
      exposure using information on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure from&#xD;
      questionnaires. The intensity piece of this algorithm identifies factors that either increase&#xD;
      or decrease exposure and a &quot;weight&quot; is assigned to each factor to reflect the relative impact&#xD;
      of that factor on exposure. Exposure data are need to validate these algorithms, to identify&#xD;
      major exposure determinants, and to evaluate the appropriateness of the assigned weights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fungicides are applied at regular intervals throughout the spring and summer in orchards.&#xD;
      Captan is a frequently applied fungicide that will serve as the primary marker for fungicide&#xD;
      exposures in orchards. Participants from the AHS will be selected based on planned use of&#xD;
      captan. A benzimidazole fungicide, such as thiophanate-methyl or benomyl, is often applied&#xD;
      with captan and exposure to thiophanate-methyl and benomyl will also be monitored. Applicator&#xD;
      exposure will be measured using both environmental (air, dermal patch, hand) and biological&#xD;
      monitoring methods. Captan is metabolized to tetrahydrophthalimide, which is excreted into&#xD;
      the urine. Thiophanate-methyl an benomyl share a common metabolite, methyl&#xD;
      (5-hydroxy-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-carbamate, which is also excreted into the urine. Dupont is&#xD;
      voluntarily withdrawing its benomyl product from the market as of December 31, 2001; however,&#xD;
      existing supplies of benomyl may be used in 2002. Due to this &quot;carryover&quot; use of benomyl and&#xD;
      the presence of a metabolite in the urine common to thiophanate-methyl, it is prudent to&#xD;
      monitor benomyl exposure among participating applicators. A repeated measures design has been&#xD;
      proposed to address the likelihood of high within-worker variability for exposure measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the objectives of this study are 1) to measure actual exposures to the target&#xD;
      fungicides using both environmental and biological measures of exposure, 2) to identify and&#xD;
      quantify major determinants of exposure, 3) to describe within- and between-worker exposure&#xD;
      variability, and 4) to evaluate, to the extent possible, agreement between exposure estimates&#xD;
      computed using the AHS exposure algorithms and exposure estimates based on actual&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
