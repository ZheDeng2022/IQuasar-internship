  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) has increased during the twentieth&#xD;
      century and is of particular concern as it primarily affects young men. It is the most common&#xD;
      cancer among U.S. males ages 25-34. The only well-described risk factors are cryptorchism&#xD;
      (undescended testis), family history of TGCT, and personal history of TGCT. To better&#xD;
      understand the environmental and genetic determinants of TGCT risk, a case-control study will&#xD;
      be conducted among members of the U.S. armed forces. The study will include men who have&#xD;
      donated a blood sample to the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) between 1989 and&#xD;
      2000. All DoDSR donors who have developed GCT will be matched to DoDSR donors who have not&#xD;
      developed TGCT. Approximately 1,080 men with TGCT, 1,080 controls, and 2,160 mothers will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DoDSR serum sample will be tested for organochlorines levels, gonadotropin levels, and&#xD;
      viral antibody titres. Each participant will donate a saliva specimen that will be used in an&#xD;
      examination of genetic susceptibility. Each participant will also complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      concerning a variety of possible risk factors such as physical activity, medical history,&#xD;
      medication history, and other risk factors. The mothers of all participants will be invited&#xD;
      to participate by completing a questionnaire concerning perinatal exposures and events and by&#xD;
      donating a saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three main objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine whether environmental endocrine modulators (i.e., chlorinated pesticides and&#xD;
           polychlorinated biphenyls) are related to risk of GCT and, if so, whether their effects&#xD;
           are augmented by other risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine whether genetic susceptibility to GCT exists and to characterize the&#xD;
           environmental risk factors related to that susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine whether there are distinct causes of GCT by relating the tissue structures of&#xD;
           the tumors to the risk factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) has increased during the better part of&#xD;
      the twentieth century and is of particular concern as it primarily affects young men. Though&#xD;
      the tumor is relatively infrequent in the population as a whole, TGCT is the most common&#xD;
      cancer among U.S. males in the age group 15-34 years. Despite the increases in TGCT rates,&#xD;
      the etiology is still poorly understood. The only well described risk factors for TGCT are&#xD;
      cryptorchism, family history of TGCT and personal history of TGCT. Therefore, in order to&#xD;
      understand better the environmental and genetic determinants of TGCT risk, a case-control&#xD;
      study will be conducted among members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The study will include men&#xD;
      who have donated a blood sample to the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) between&#xD;
      the years 1989 and 2003. All DoDSR donors who have developed GCT will be matched to DoDSR&#xD;
      donors who have not developed TGCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1682 servicemen were enrolled in the study; 754 cases and 928 controls. Of these&#xD;
      participants, 1303 men (77%, 590 cases, 713 controls) donated buccal cell samples. In&#xD;
      addition to the servicemen, a total of 1090 mothers of servicemen were enrolled and 952 (87%)&#xD;
      provided a buccal specimen. The DoDSR serum samples have been assayed for levels of&#xD;
      organochlorines pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, insulin-like growth factors&#xD;
      and gonadotropins and steroid hormones. DNA isolated from the buccal cell specimens have thus&#xD;
      far been genotyped for polymorphysms in the hormone metabolism and immune function pathway,&#xD;
      immune function pathway, insulin-like growth factor pathway and for single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the 8q24 locus. In addition, a genome-wide association study has completed.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses of the questionnaire data are continuing.&#xD;
