  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is severe, chronic, disabling autoimmune disease that&#xD;
      significantly affects health status and quality of life. Since the disease occurs most often&#xD;
      in young to middle-aged adults, SLE can also affect work and disability. However, there is&#xD;
      currently little information on work-related disability from longitudinal, population-based&#xD;
      studies of SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were enrolled into the Carolina Lupus Study between February, 1997 and July&#xD;
      1999. We plan to conduct two telephone contacts with patients and one telephone contact with&#xD;
      controls in a follow-up study to be conducted in 2001. The first patient contact will follow&#xD;
      an introductory letter that describes the follow-up study. This letter provides participants&#xD;
      the opportunity (via a toll-free phone number) to decline further contact about this study.&#xD;
      The first patient contact will be a short (5 minute) interview in which we determine their&#xD;
      current source of lupus-related medical care, timing of next expected visit, and update&#xD;
      contact information. The second contact will involve a 60-minute telephone interview covering&#xD;
      medical care utilization, current health status (including a patient-administered measure of&#xD;
      lupus activity), work and disability issues, psychosocial attributes (e.g. helplessness,&#xD;
      social support, daily stressors including race-related issues), and changes in exposures&#xD;
      since the initial interview. We will attempt to schedule the patients' interviews within 3&#xD;
      months before or after the patient sees his or her own physician for SLE-related evaluation&#xD;
      or treatment. A short (15 minutes or less) telephone interview will be conducted with&#xD;
      controls focusing on current health, work status, and daily stresso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ddisease damage will be assessed using the System Lupus international Collaborating Clinics&#xD;
      (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index, a standardized and validated&#xD;
      instrument that is completed by the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will seek death certificates for patients and controls who have died in order to obtain&#xD;
      cause of death information. Next-of-kin information from death certificates will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow up to determine the feasibility of obtaining reliable data on disease&#xD;
      damage from more than 50 physicians involved in the treatment of patients in the Carolina&#xD;
      Lupus Study. This developmental work is a necessary foundation for any additional follow-up&#xD;
      studies of the Carolina Lupus Study cohort. We will also be able to examine associations with&#xD;
      disability in patients and in controls and to examine the contribution of various factors to&#xD;
      the increased disease severity experience by African-American SLE patients.&#xD;
