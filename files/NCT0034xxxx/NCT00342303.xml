  <brief_summary>

      We will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The activity of the desaturating/elongating enzymes assessed by the in vivo conversion&#xD;
           of deuterated a-linolenic and linoleic acids to DHA and AA, respectively, will be&#xD;
           related to the duration of gestation and to postnatal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dietary w-3 and w-6 LCPUFAs in human milk or DHA and AA supplemented formula will&#xD;
           inhibit the desaturation/elongation of deuterated a-linolenic and linoleic acids&#xD;
           demonstrating in vivo inhibition of the metabolic pathway by respective products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present evidence suggests that the parent essential fatty acids (EFA), linoleic acid (18:2&#xD;
      w-6) and a-linolenic acids (18:3 w-3) are insufficient to fully satisfy EFA nutrition during&#xD;
      early life in the human. A possible need for long chain (LC, longer than 18 C chain length)&#xD;
      EFAs in the human is suggested by the accretion rates of elongated and desaturated products&#xD;
      in the developing fetus; the altered plasma and red cell fatty acid patterns, and the&#xD;
      abnormal visual function observed in infants receiving solely the parent EFAs; and by the&#xD;
      relatively high concentration of LC EFAs in human milk. Most milk formula, as compared to&#xD;
      human milk, are lower in oleic acid, higher in linoleic, have little a-linolenic acid and&#xD;
      virtually no LC w-3 or w-6 polyunsaturated FA (LC PUFA). This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      capacity of human infants to form w-3 and w-6 LCPUFAs from the parent EFAs as affected by&#xD;
      developmental stage and dietary EFA supply. The precursors will be labeled with deuterium and&#xD;
      the products analyzed by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry GC/MS. The main products of&#xD;
      the desaturation / elongation pathway are docosahexaenoic (DHA) and arachidonic (AA) acids&#xD;
      for the w-3 and w-6 series, respectively. Infants will be fed human milk or formulas with or&#xD;
      without supplemental LCPUFAs as part of a study to evaluate the effect of EFAs on CNS&#xD;
      functional development. Infants included in this study of the effect of developmental stage&#xD;
      on EFA desaturation/elongation will be 2-5 days of age (before any fat is administered&#xD;
      enterally or parenterally) and 28, 32, 36 or 40 weeks gestation. In addition, infants born at&#xD;
      28 and 40 weeks gestation will be studied 2 and 6 weeks postnatally after dietary fat has&#xD;
      been provided for at least 7 days and energy intake is sufficient to assure growth. To&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of dietary EFA on DHA and AA formation we will assess elongation/&#xD;
      desaturation in infants receiving 3 diets: human milk (which contains w-3 and w-6 LCPUFAs);&#xD;
      cow milk based formula providing 18:2 w-6 and 18:3 w-3 but no LCPUFAs; or formula&#xD;
      supplemented with added LCPUFAs (DHA and AA). This study should provide new information on&#xD;
      the effects of developmental stage and w-3 and w-6 LCPUFA supply in determining the activity&#xD;
      of EFA elongation/desaturation in the human. This knowledge may help in improving early&#xD;
      neonatal nutritional practices to assure meeting the EFA needs of the developing CNS.&#xD;

      the 18-C precursors will be compared to the 20-C precursors with respect to their metabolic&#xD;
      endpoints. This study should provide new information on the effects of developmental stage&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Newborns with birth weights appropriate for their gestational age born at 28, 32, 36 and 40&#xD;
        weeks gestation that are recovering from common neonatal morbidity will be recruited to&#xD;
        enter the study before 5 days of age. This disease condition will not be life threatening&#xD;
        at the time of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The typical disease conditions expected based on the pilot phase of study are infants&#xD;
        recovering from asphyxia, infants recovering from transient tachypnea, infants recovering&#xD;
        from suspect pneumonia, infants recovering from hyaline membrane disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hyperbilirubinemia in conjunction with disease condition will not be a reason for&#xD;
        exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Newborns with birth weights below the tenth percentile of the weight distribution for a&#xD;
        given gestational age born at 30-34 and 36-38 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Will include infants born at 28 to 40 weeks who are free of major neonatal morbidity and&#xD;
        will be recruited to enter the study at 10 days of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Maternal factors which may affect their fatty acid metabolism of the neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vegetarian or vegan diet during pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metabolic disease which may affect essential fatty acid status of the fetus&#xD;
             (hyperlipidemia, diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Postnatal factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Birth weight inadequate for gestational age (birth weight below the 10th percentile or&#xD;
        above the 90th percentile for gestational age)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant acute neonatal morbidity which interferes with normal lipid metabolism during&#xD;
        the study period. Infants who are recovering from common neonatal morbidities that do not&#xD;
        have obvious effects on elongase/desaturase activity will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Feeding other than prescribed for the study.&#xD;
