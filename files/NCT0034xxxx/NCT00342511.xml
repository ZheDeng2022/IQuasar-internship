      This study will evaluate a method of testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. For women&#xD;
      who have had Pap test results that are abnormal, a new test can be done for HPV, that is,&#xD;
      viruses that sometimes cause bumpy or flat warts. Such infections all usually disappear by&#xD;
      themselves in 1 or 2 years if someone's Pap test shows a mild abnormality. But if the HPV&#xD;
      does not go away, the infection can slowly lead to cancer of the cervix. Through this study,&#xD;
      researchers will examine patients in conjunction with a colposcopy, that is, a diagnostic&#xD;
      tool to determine the cause of abnormal Pap test results. The researchers hope to improve on&#xD;
      the efficiency of detecting HPV and reducing the risk of cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 21 and older who are not pregnant and who have not had a hysterectomy and who&#xD;
      are attending a colposcopy clinic may be eligible for this study. This study will enroll 150&#xD;
      patients. Two pilot studies will be done: one at the Cleveland Clinic, with the use of the&#xD;
      POI sampler (Preventive Oncology International ) and the other at the University of Arizona,&#xD;
      with the use of the Fournier sampler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study part that uses the POI sampler, patients will be recruited from the existing&#xD;
      colposcopy schedule. For the Fournier sampler, patients will be recruited as they attend&#xD;
      their scheduled colposcopy visit. During the procedure, the doctor will collect two&#xD;
      (Cleveland Clinic) or three (University of Arizona) specimen from the patients while the&#xD;
      patients are sitting. A speculum is not placed in the vagina at that time. Then the doctor&#xD;
      will conduct a routine pelvic exam, with the use of a speculum, while the patients are lying&#xD;
      down, and perform the colposcopy. One final specimen will be collected before the the&#xD;
      colposcopic evaluation. Those three or four specimens will be used just for research&#xD;
      purposes, and they make up the only part different from the regular colposcopy exam. The&#xD;
      pelvic exams may sometimes be slightly uncomfortable, and patients may have temporary vaginal&#xD;
      spotting of blood afterward. The collection of additional specimens may also cause slight&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research specimens, which will not be labeled with information that directly identifies&#xD;
      the patients, will be stored at a repository sponsored by NIH. Those specimens would be&#xD;
      tested now or in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be told about the results of their tests as part of the routine management&#xD;
      of their abnormal Pap results. Women participating at the University of Arizona will receive&#xD;
      $25 for the time they spend in the study. Benefits that patients receive from being part of&#xD;
      this study include helping researchers to discover new ways to prevent cervical cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytology screening programs have efficiently reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality&#xD;
      in the U.S. by &gt; 75%. However, these programs rely on the insensitive Pap smear and,&#xD;
      consequently, are inefficient and overly expensive. Therefore, the needs of undeserved&#xD;
      populations are not well-served by the current cytology-based programs for cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening. Based on the central role of oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) causing&#xD;
      virtually all cases of cervical cancer, HPV DVA testing is already approved by the FDA as an&#xD;
      adjunctive screening modality to cytology in this country and as a primary screening modality&#xD;
      internationally. A validated screening program of HPV DNA testing of self-collected&#xD;
      cervicovaginal specimens might provide more sensitive and wider coverage screening than&#xD;
      cytology in the populations underserved by cytology-based (Papanicolaou [Pap] smear or&#xD;
      liquid-based cytology) screening programs and therefore are at an elevated risk of cervical&#xD;
      cancer. We are currently evaluating self-collection devices for optimal detection of HPV DNA,&#xD;
      including one (POI sampler) designed by Jerry Belinson (Cleveland Clinic) and one (Fournier&#xD;
      device) by Arthur Fournier (University of Miami).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare HPV DNA detection in cervicovaginal specimens collected using newly developed&#xD;
      self-collection devices, the POI sampler or the Fournier device, to HPV DNA detection in&#xD;
      cervicovaginal specimens collected using a Darcon swab and HPV DNA detection in&#xD;
      physician-directed cervical specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two pilots will be done, one at the Cleveland Clinic with the POI sampler and one at the&#xD;
      University of Arizona using the Fournier device (with two different tip designs), in which we&#xD;
      will recruit 150 consenting women attending a colposcopy clinic, including 50 women referred&#xD;
      due to HSIL pap. Prior to undergoing a pelvic exam and insertion of the speculum, the&#xD;
      attending physician will simulate self-collection of cervicovaginal specimens using, in&#xD;
      alternating order, one of the new devices and a Dacron swab. After collection of the&#xD;
      cervicovaginal specimens, women will then undergo a standard colposcopic evaluation but with&#xD;
      an added cervical specimen collected from the os of the cervix to serve as the referent&#xD;
      standard. Specimens (n=450, 3 paired specimens per woman, for the POI sampler pilot; n = 600,&#xD;
      4 paired specimens per woman, for the Fournier device pilot) will be tested in a masked&#xD;
      fashion for oncogenic HPV DNA using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Digene Corporation Gathersburg,&#xD;
      MD) at the NCI HPV DNA core testing facility.&#xD;
