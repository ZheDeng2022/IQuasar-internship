  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labor is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Several investigators&#xD;
      have reported that ultrasound evaluation of the cervix can predict the risk of preterm&#xD;
      delivery. Three-dimensional ultrasound may provide additional information about how to best&#xD;
      counsel parents about the chances of premature birth. This technology has the capability for&#xD;
      accurate volume measurements of irregular structures that is superior to conventional&#xD;
      ultrasound. Therefore, it is possible that three-dimensional ultrasound methods may better&#xD;
      characterize cervical changes and the risk for preterm delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our protocol will attempt to identify prognostic indicators of adverse pregnancy outcome by&#xD;
      three-dimensional ultrasound. A maximum of 680 pregnant women with the diagnosis of preterm&#xD;
      labor will be prospectively studied to characterize cervical morphology and volume as&#xD;
      predictors of preterm delivery risk. These results will be correlated with placental&#xD;
      pathology and pregnancy outcome. We will also compare the performance of conventional&#xD;
      two-dimensional endovaginal ultrasound with three-dimensional ultrasound findings. This&#xD;
      information is expected to improve our understanding about the nature and timing of cervical&#xD;
      volume changes in relation to pregnancy outcome....&#xD;
