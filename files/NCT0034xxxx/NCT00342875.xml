    <textblock>
      Data from the new cancer atlas covering the period 1974 1994 indicates that deaths from&#xD;
      bladder cancer among white men and women are elevated in the northeastern United States,&#xD;
      particularly the northern parts of New England. The reason for these elevated rates of&#xD;
      incidence of and deaths from bladder cancer is unknown. Only part of the excess risk can be&#xD;
      explained by exposure to the textile and leather industries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that contribute to the high rates of&#xD;
      incidence of and death from bladder cancer in northern New England. The main objectives are&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimate the risk of developing bladder cancer associated with inorganic arsenic in&#xD;
           drinking water, other water contaminants, tobacco use, occupational exposures,&#xD;
           residential proximity to industrial sites, dietary factors, ethnicity, and use of&#xD;
           wood-burning stoves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimate the extent to which water containing inorganic arsenic explains the increased&#xD;
           rates of bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimate the extent to which exposure to other risk factors explains the increased&#xD;
           rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate risk of bladder cancer according to genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine interactions of these factors with tobacco use, occupational exposure, and&#xD;
           environmental exposure to arsenic and other compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All people ages 30 79 with confirmed cases of bladder cancer will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Twelve hundred people with bladder cancer and twelve hundred individuals with no previous&#xD;
      bladder cancer will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After potential participants are recruited and agreement is obtained over the telephone, they&#xD;
      will complete a calendar and collect toenail clippings prior to the home interview. During&#xD;
      the home visit, an investigator will administer a computer-assisted personal interview,&#xD;
      collect drinking water samples and the clippings, and obtain a global positioning satellite&#xD;
      reading. Other biological samples, such as saliva samples, urine, and blood, may be&#xD;
      requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Private wells at any previous homes of participants will also be sampled. The location of&#xD;
      previous homes will be determined and the current homeowner will be asked to allow sampling&#xD;
      of the well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associations between bladder cancer and environmental exposures will be examined and the&#xD;
      extent to which exposures to such risk factors explain the elevated mortality and incidence&#xD;
      in northern New England will be estimated.&#xD;

      Data from the new cancer atlas covering the period 1970-94 indicate that bladder cancer&#xD;
      mortality rates among white men and women are elevated in the northeastern U.S., particularly&#xD;
      in the northern parts of New England including Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The reasons&#xD;
      for these high mortality rates are unclear. The persistent elevations in mortality and&#xD;
      incidence for bladder cancer among both men and women suggest the possible role of&#xD;
      environmental etiologic factors. A leading suspect environmental exposure is inorganic&#xD;
      arsenic in drinking water, which is elevated in private wells in parts of New England. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the risk factors that explain the high mortality and&#xD;
      incidence rates for bladder cancer in men and women in northern New England. The study will&#xD;
      be a population-based case-control study of carcinoma of the urinary bladder in three states:&#xD;
      New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine. All histologically-confirmed incident cases of carcinoma&#xD;
      of the bladder occurring within a three-year period among residents of the study areas&#xD;
      between the ages of 30 and 79 years will be eligible for the study. Controls will be selected&#xD;
      randomly from the general population of each study area, frequency matched to the age-,&#xD;
      race-, and gender-specific distributions of incidence cases of bladder cancer in each state.&#xD;
      We expect to interview 1,200 cases and 1,200 controls. Several data collection activities&#xD;
      will be incorporated in this study: a self-administered residential/occupational history&#xD;
      calendar, a self-administered diet questionnaire, in-person interviews with subjects using a&#xD;
      computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), collection of drinking water to determine levels&#xD;
      of arsenic and other contaminants in drinking water, a collection of buccal cells, toenails,&#xD;
      spot urine, four-day urinary habits diary, overnight urine (from a sample of 240 cases and&#xD;
      240 controls), and blood (from a sample of 180 cases and 180 controls). Tumor tissue samples&#xD;
      will be obtained for cases. We will examine associations between bladder cancer and&#xD;
      environmental exposures, and estimate the extent to which exposures to such risk factor&#xD;
      explain the elevated mortality and incidence in northern New England.&#xD;

        Case patients included all patients with histologically confirmed carcinoma of the urinary&#xD;
        bladder (including carcinoma in situ) newly diagnosed between 2001 and 2004 among residents&#xD;
        of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, age 30 to 79 years. Patients were ascertained through&#xD;
        hospital pathology departments and hospital and state cancer registries. Control subjects&#xD;
        were selected randomly from state Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) records (age 30-64&#xD;
        years) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) beneficiary records (age 65-79&#xD;
        years), frequency matched to case patients by state, sex, and five-year age group at&#xD;
        diagnosis. We interviewed 1418 (594 DMV, 824 CMS) control subjects (64.8% of eligible DMV&#xD;
        and 64.7% of eligible CMS control subjects).@@@&#xD;
