  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1976 an accidental explosion in a chemical plant 16 miles north of Milan resulted in&#xD;
      contamination of the local population with 2, 3, 7, 8-terachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD).&#xD;
      There is evidence that TCDD and related phenoxy herbicides act as teratogens, tumor&#xD;
      promoters, and carcinogens in experimental animals. In human, TCDD causes chloracne in those&#xD;
      exposed. Associations with various cancers have been reported, but the precise role in human&#xD;
      toxicity, immune and reproductive dysfunction, and cancer is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Seveso accident provides a unique opportunity for an epidemiological investigation in&#xD;
      that the exposures are the highest recorded in humans, the exposure involves TCDD without&#xD;
      other contaminants, and a cohort in the involved and surrounding area has been enumerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is inter-individual variation in the action of genes involved in TCDD effect in human&#xD;
      cells. The quality of human AH receptor, and the CYP1A1 and arnt genotypes are examples of&#xD;
      susceptibility markers that may identify subjects at high risk for TCDD-related disease. A&#xD;
      hypothesis that could explain the inconsistent association of TCDD exposure with cancer is&#xD;
      that genetic susceptibility may influence which individuals are adversely affected by TCDD&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is proceeding in three phases. The first is a pilot/validation study that is&#xD;
      complete (field activities) and involved 126 subjects. The second is a case-control study of&#xD;
      about 100 individuals with chloracne and 100 controls. The field components of phase one and&#xD;
      two are complete, and analyses of results are underway. The third and final phase is a&#xD;
      planned case-control study of TCDD-related cancers that will include approximately 125 cases&#xD;
      and 125 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a questionnaire/interview and a biospecimen collection; 73 ml of blood are&#xD;
      obtained from each participant.&#xD;

      In 1976 an accidental explosion in a chemical plant 16 miles north of Milan resulted in&#xD;

&#xD;
      The Seveso accident provides a unique opportunity for an epidemiological investigation in&#xD;
      that the exposures are the highest recorded in humans, the exposure involves TCDD without&#xD;
      other contaminants, and a cohort in the involved and surrounding area has been enumerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is inter-individual variation in the action of genes involved in TCDD effect in human&#xD;
      cells. The quality of human AH receptor, and the CYP1A1 and arnt genotypes are examples of&#xD;
      susceptibility markers that may identify subjects at high risk for TCDD-related disease. A&#xD;
      hypothesis that could explain the inconsistent association of TCDD exposure with cancer is&#xD;
      that genetic susceptibility may influence which individuals are adversely affected by TCDD&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in three phases. The first is a pilot/validation study of 126 highly exposed and&#xD;
      not exposed subjects. The second is a case-control study of 100 individuals with chloracne&#xD;
      and 100 controls. The field components of phase one and two are complete. The third and final&#xD;
      phase is a planned case-control study of TCDD-related cancers that will include approximately&#xD;
      125 cases and 125 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using different methods to estimate TCDD levels below the detection limit, we found that,&#xD;
      approximately 20 years after the accident, plasma TCDD was still elevated in subjects from&#xD;
      the exposed areas, particularly in women, and was negatively associated with IgG plasma&#xD;
      levels. Subjects who developed chloracne after the accident had high TCDD levels, and no&#xD;
      evidence of TCDD-related long-term toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses of the expression of key genes in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway,&#xD;
      which is necessary for most TCDD effects, showed a significant reduction in AhR expression by&#xD;
      increasing plasma dioxin levels. Cytochrome P450 gene SNPs and haplotypes were associated&#xD;
      with variable TCDD-related gene inducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-going studies are examining the proteomics and gene expression pattern (by microarray) in&#xD;
      exposed subjects compared with not exposed individuals, and the frerquency of t(14;18)&#xD;
      translocations in lymphocytes from the same subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a questionnaire/interview and a biospecimen collection; 73 ml of blood&#xD;
      were obtained from each participant.&#xD;
