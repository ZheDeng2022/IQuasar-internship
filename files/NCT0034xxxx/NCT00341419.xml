  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will characterize the gene mutations responsible for pseudoxanthoma elasticum&#xD;
      (PXE) and correlate them with disease manifestations in males and females. PXE is an&#xD;
      inherited disorder that affects the connective tissue in some parts of the body. Calcium and&#xD;
      other minerals are deposited in the connective tissue, causing changes in the skin, eyes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal system. Some effects of PXE can cause serious&#xD;
      medical problems, while others have less impact. Symptoms often appear earlier and are more&#xD;
      severe in females than in males, but there is no way to predict how the disorder will&#xD;
      progress in any given individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates for this study are recruited through PXE International, an organization that&#xD;
      provides patient support and supports research on the disease. The organization collects&#xD;
      biological samples and medical information on patients and family members to help further&#xD;
      research on the disease. Families that have samples from the patient, both parents, and at&#xD;
      least one sibling may be eligible for this study. Grandparents and extended family members&#xD;
      may be included in certain instances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants provide a blood sample, a sample of cells scraped from the inside of the cheek&#xD;
      (buccal cells) and a medical history. The samples are analyzed for gene variants and the&#xD;
      findings are correlated with disease signs and symptoms.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized&#xD;
           by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCC6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PXE while it is known that patients have two mutated alleles of the ABCC6 gene,&#xD;
           significant questions remain about the segregation of the disease, the presentation in&#xD;
           males versus females and the correlation of mutation to clinical phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The objective is to examine the role of variants in the ABCC6 gene in PXE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples from study participants were obtained through the PXE International BioBank.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Families were selected that have samples from both parents and at least one sibling in&#xD;
           addition to the proband.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants DNA was sequenced to identify variants and genotyped for linked markers to&#xD;
      follow the segregation of mutant alleles and compare the results with the clinical outcomes.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A representative set of collected families will be studied. No subjects within these&#xD;
        families will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Families will be selected that have samples from both parents and at least one sibling in&#xD;
        addition to the proband.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The siblings will include both affected and unaffected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If grandparents are available they will also be typed to help in phase determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Extended relatives will only be selected in multiple generation families.&#xD;
