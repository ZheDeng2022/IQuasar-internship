  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective one, exploring the hypothesis that a person's genotypic makeup&#xD;
      may be associated with a clinical response or toxic effect to a drug. Genetic polymorphisms,&#xD;
      that is, states of being able to assume different forms, that are in drug-metabolizing&#xD;
      enzymes, transporters, and receptors may affect a patient's response to drug therapy. To&#xD;
      date, there have been limited studies looking at a drug-metabolizing genotype (genetic&#xD;
      makeup) or phenotype (result of the genotype's interaction with the environment). However, it&#xD;
      is often wondered if the variations in a drug's action, that is, pharmacokinetic effect, come&#xD;
      from the genotype phenotype relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who entered previous clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute, as&#xD;
      approved by the Central Institutional Review Board, may be eligible for this study. Studies&#xD;
      for which pharmacokinetic analyses were or are being performed will be the source of the&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping experiments will be performed through genomic DNA isolated from stored frozen&#xD;
      serum. The genotyping results will be compared with pharmacokinetic data and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Clinical data will consist of what is obtained during the course of the principal&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study. The results of the retrospective analyses will provide no direct&#xD;
      benefit to the participants.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters/receptors, and transcription&#xD;
      factors might affect an individual s response to drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy are especially&#xD;
      important given the narrow therapeutic index of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During analysis of investigational agents, inter-individual variances in pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics are often noted. It is often wondered if these variances might in part be&#xD;
      explained by genetic differences in drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or other&#xD;
      critical regulators of gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the genotype-phenotype relationship, additional analysis correlating&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data with relevant genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals previously enrolled on IRB approved clinical trials at the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these retrospective studies, the association between an individual s pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile and the genetic variation in their drug metabolizing enzymes and other critical&#xD;
      regulators of gene expression will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that an individual s genotypic constitution may be associated with clinical&#xD;
      response and/or toxicity will be explored.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In this retrospective study, any cancer patients entered on IRB approved clinical trials at&#xD;
        the National Cancer Institute are eligible. Studies for which pharmacokinetic analyses&#xD;
        were/are being performed will be the source of the patient population. At this time&#xD;
        enrollment will be limited to patients with pharmacokinetic samples obtained during&#xD;
        treatment on protocol 00-C-0033, 00-C-0080, 01-C-0049, 01-C-0124, 01-C-0215, 02-C-0061,&#xD;
        02-C-0083, 02-C-0130, 02-C-0149, 02-C-0215, 02-C-0218, 02-C-0229, 03-C-0030, 03-C-0157,&#xD;
        03-C-0176, 03-C-0284, 04-C-0132, 04-C-0257, 04-C-0262, 04-C-0273, 04-C-0280, 05-C-0022,&#xD;
        05-C-0049, 05-C-0167, 05-C-0186, 06-C-0083, 06-C-0088, 06-C-0164, 06-C-0221, 07-C-0047,&#xD;
        07-C-0059, 07-C-0106, 07-C-0107, 08-C-0030, 08-C-0074, 94-C-0169, 95-C-0015, 97-C-0135,&#xD;
        97-C-0171, and 98-C-0015.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient will be excluded if there is an insufficient quantity of sample available to&#xD;
        perform the genotyping procedure. This is not anticipated to be of significance for this&#xD;
        study since the methodology does not require a large serum sample.&#xD;
