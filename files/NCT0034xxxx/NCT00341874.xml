      Objective: One objective of this study is to genetically map and identify mutated genes for&#xD;
      human hereditary hearing loss. A second objective is to study the function of these genes in&#xD;
      the auditory system using mouse models. Human hereditary hearing impairment is the result of&#xD;
      abnormal ear development, abnormal ear function or both. Although the genes for numerous&#xD;
      deafness loci have been mapped and identified, there are still many families segregating&#xD;
      deafness as a monogenic trait but a mutant allele can t be ascribed to one of the currently&#xD;
      reported deafness genes . In order to map and identify novel mutated genes associated with&#xD;
      hearing loss in humans, we will continue to ascertain large families segregating syndromic&#xD;
      and nonsyndromic deafness as a monogenic trait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: This study will ascertain subjects from consanguineous Pakistani families&#xD;
      segregating hearing loss consisting of both nonsyndromic and syndromic forms of deafness of&#xD;
      genetic etiology. Since a majority of Pakistani marriages are between first cousins, this&#xD;
      tends to bring together the same recessive mutations for hearing loss with multiple affected&#xD;
      individuals within single family lines, which is an advantage for this genetic study. A few&#xD;
      years ago we stopped ascertaining families in India. We continue to ascertain both affected&#xD;
      and unaffected Pakistani family members from age 2 years and up. Adults provide informed&#xD;
      consent both for themselves and their children who agree to participate in this study. We&#xD;
      will ascertain both genders and all Pakistani races and ethnicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects will be screened and consented by our collaborating Associate Investigator&#xD;
      in Pakistan. After consenting, the subjects will undergo a history and physical, audiological&#xD;
      assessment and testing, vestibular assessment and testing, and blood and urine analysis&#xD;
      tests, along with a blood sample or buccal swab sample that will be used for genomic DNA&#xD;
      extraction. Probands at the time of ascertainment are initially assumed to have a form of&#xD;
      nonsyndromic deafness. Additional tests may be performed depending on the history or physical&#xD;
      of the individual or after the deafness gene is identified. Data from functional studies in&#xD;
      animal models may also point to other concomitant clinical features along with hearing loss.&#xD;
      These additional tests may include: photographs or videotapes of a subject s body and face;&#xD;
      eye and vision examinations for those with suspected or known eyesight problems related to&#xD;
      their genetic hearing loss mutations, and EKGs and/or Echocardiograms for those with&#xD;
      suspected or known heart problems related to their genetic hearing loss mutations. Urine and&#xD;
      blood analyses may be requested for those individuals with genetic nephritic issues or&#xD;
      infertility. For example, when a deaf female individual in a family is subsequently&#xD;
      discovered to have Perrault syndrome, a recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss&#xD;
      (usually the initial manifestation) and ovarian dysgenesis/primary amenorrhea, additional&#xD;
      evaluations would then be conducted for a definitive diagnosis of Perrault syndrome. Such an&#xD;
      evaluation would include a pelvic ultrasound scan and measurements of serum estrogen and&#xD;
      gonadotropins. Similarly, in some of these families, hearing impaired males may be asked&#xD;
      about their fertility since the possibility of male infertility in families segregating&#xD;
      Perrault syndrome remains an open question. For genetic analyses, genomic DNA extracted from&#xD;
      a blood sample or a buccal swab from affected and unaffected members of families segregating&#xD;
      hereditary hearing loss will be genetically screened with polymorphic markers (STRs or SNPs)&#xD;
      for linkage to the known deafness loci. The hearing phenotype of children (&gt;2 years old),&#xD;
      adolescent and adult subjects will be assigned on the basis of performance from audiological&#xD;
      examinations. Genomic DNA from families where deafness is found to be unlinked to the known&#xD;
      deafness loci will then be used in genome wide screens with approximately 950,000 SNP markers&#xD;
      distributed across the entire human genome to identify novel deafness loci. Alternatively,&#xD;
      DNA samples from affected and unaffected individuals will undergo whole exome sequencing&#xD;
      (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) with a focus on potentially pathogenic variants&#xD;
      located only in chromosomal regions of markers genetically linked to deafness. Subsequently,&#xD;
      novel deafness genes will be positionally identified and their functions studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Novel deafness loci and genes associated with hearing loss will be&#xD;
      identified and will provide new insight into mechanisms required for sound transduction in&#xD;
      humans. Data from this study is likely to be the basis of commercially available tests for&#xD;
      early diagnosis and timely genetic counseling for at risk couples as well as the development&#xD;
      of strategies to preserve hearing and prevent hearing loss....&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Affected and unaffected members of families segregating deafness caused by genetic&#xD;
             etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults must be able to provide informed consent for children who are at least two&#xD;
             years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All communities, ethnicities, and races as found in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with non-genetic forms of hearing loss likely due to acquired causes such as&#xD;
             an infection, head or noise trauma, or exposure to an ototoxic drug will not be&#xD;
             included in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Syndromic forms of inherited deafness are excluded if the gene for the disorder is&#xD;
             known and there is no reason to believe the disorder is genetically heterogeneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects cannot provide informed consent or have a parent/guardian that cannot provide&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children under the age of two years will not be included in this study because an&#xD;
             objective audiological examination such as an ABR analysis may require sedation, which&#xD;
             is presently not feasible in Pakistan.&#xD;
