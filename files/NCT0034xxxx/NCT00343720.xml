  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the objective response rate (complete response +&#xD;
      partial response), following treatment with Alimta plus VELCADE, Alimta alone, or VELCADE&#xD;
      alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who&#xD;
      have failed prior preventative therapy for Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC. The Alimta alone treatment&#xD;
      group will be used as the control. The VELCADE single-agent treatment group will be used to&#xD;
      determine if VELCADE administered weekly can demonstrate response rates.&#xD;

             part and protein testing part of the study; participation in the genetic and protein&#xD;
             testing component is mandatory for testing, but optional for future research.&#xD;
