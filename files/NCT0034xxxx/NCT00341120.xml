      This study is being conducted at the University Hospital of Lund University in Malmo, Sweden,&#xD;
      in collaboration with the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The&#xD;
      study will try to identify genetic causes of impaired sperm production and male infertility.&#xD;
      It will focus on the possible role of the MTHFR and CBS genes, which regulate absorption and&#xD;
      metabolism of the vitamin, folate in infertility. If the nutritional intake or metabolism of&#xD;
      this vitamin is related to male infertility, then this cause of infertility would be&#xD;
      potentially curable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fertile and infertile men between 20 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Criteria include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fertile men: men whose partners are younger than age 40 and are attending Lund&#xD;
           University prenatal clinic; who have fathered one or more pregnancies and who stopped&#xD;
           birth control to achieve the present pregnancy; who achieved the present pregnancy in&#xD;
           less than 12 months of unprotected intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infertile men: men referred to the Scandian Andrology Centre whose infertility is&#xD;
           unexplained, whose partners are younger than age 40 and who have had regular sexual&#xD;
           intercourse without contraception for at least 12 months without achieving a pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a questionnaire providing information about their reproductive and medical&#xD;
           history and recent dietary history;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide blood samples for analysis of red cell folate, plasma folate, plasma&#xD;
           homocysteine, plasma B12, and for genetic evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a semen sample for routine analysis, including volume, sperm concentration,&#xD;
           sperm motility, and sperm morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, infertile men will undergo a physical examination and review of their medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is evident that genetic variation plays a substantial role in the etiology of male&#xD;
      infertility. Studies of children fathered through intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI&#xD;
      have revealed mutations on the AZF region of the Y chromosome linked to male infertility.&#xD;
      Mutations of other genes may also be involved. Candidates would include genes for the&#xD;
      androgen receptor, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone, and genes involved&#xD;
      in the regulation of spermatogenesis and sperm motility. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA have&#xD;
      been linked to poor sperm motility and raise the possibility that some types of male&#xD;
      subfertility may be inherited only through the female line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to assess the role of folate/homocysteine status and MTHFR and CBS gene variants&#xD;
      in infertile men in Sweden with no known cause for their infertility and whose wives/partners&#xD;
      appear to be fertile. We propose to perform the study in Sweden since Sweden, unlike the&#xD;
      U.S., at present does not mandate the enrichment of flour or other foodstuffs with folate.&#xD;
