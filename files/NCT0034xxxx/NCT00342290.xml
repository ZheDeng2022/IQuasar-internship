  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early pregnancy is associated with numerous physiologic alterations - many of which are&#xD;
      required to establish normal pregnancy outcome. Three-dimensional ultrasound may provide new&#xD;
      opportunities to better characterize some of these early changes. This noninvasive method&#xD;
      allows one to arbitrarily scan through a digital ultrasound volume data, visualize organs&#xD;
      from different perspectives, and render anatomical features through computer processing.&#xD;
      Retrospective measurement of distances and volumes are even possible in the physical absence&#xD;
      of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New information provided by three-dimensional ultrasound may lead to improved understanding&#xD;
      about how to counsel parents regarding early pregnancy complications such as bleeding. For&#xD;
      example, vaginal bleeding complicates approximately 15-20% of first trimester pregnancies. A&#xD;
      common association is subchorionic hemorrhage which is associated with increased risk for&#xD;
      miscarriage, preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes, stillbirth, and&#xD;
      placental abruption. Several studies have attempted to characterize subchorionic hemorrhage&#xD;
      by conventional two-dimensional ultrasound which is not particularly well-suited for accurate&#xD;
      measurement of small irregular hematomas. Consequently, there has been considerable debate&#xD;
      about the significance of this finding especially in asymptomatic women who undergo prenatal&#xD;
      ultrasound examination for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will attempt to identify prognostic indicators of adverse pregnancy outcome. A&#xD;
      maximum of 400 pregnant women up to 20 weeks' gestation with sonographically detected&#xD;
      subchorionic hemorrhage will be serially studies to characterize sac volume, placental&#xD;
      volume, hematoma volume, and placental blood vessel patterns by 3DUS techniques. These&#xD;
      results will be correlated with pregnancy outcome, hormonal markers, and placental pathology.&#xD;
      This information is expected to improve our understanding of the natural history of&#xD;
      subchorionic bleeding and spontaneous miscarriages as well as prognostic factors influencing&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women.&#xD;

      Miscarriage is the most common outcome of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding complicates up to 25%&#xD;
      of all pregnancies, and this clinical sign is associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      spontaneous abortion (also known as miscarriage) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, such&#xD;
      as spontaneous preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, pre-eclampsia and&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction. Despite the importance of vaginal bleeding in clinical&#xD;
      obstetrics, there is inadequate understanding about the mechanisms leading to vaginal&#xD;
      bleeding, and of tests to predict pregnancy outcome in the majority of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common finding in patients with first trimester vaginal bleeding is subchorionic&#xD;
      hemorrhage, which is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery,&#xD;
      preterm premature rupture of membranes, stillbirth, and placental abruption. Previous&#xD;
      attempts to characterize subchorionic hemorrhage have used two-dimensional ultrasound, which&#xD;
      is not well-suited for accurate measurement of the volume irregular hematomas. It is not&#xD;
      surprising that there has been debate about the significance of subchorionic hemorrhage,&#xD;
      especially in asymptomatic women undergoing prenatal ultrasound examination for other reasons&#xD;
      in which an intrauterine hematoma is found. Three-dimensional ultrasonography has the&#xD;
      potential to improve the characterization of volume and location of intrauterine hematomas.&#xD;
      This information may be of value in predicting pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Perinatology Research Branch proposes that first trimester bleeding is one of the great&#xD;
      obstetrical syndromes; conditions characterized by a collection of signs and symptoms (in&#xD;
      this case vaginal bleeding and cramping), with multiple etiologies. We propose that first&#xD;
      trimester bleeding may be the result of a hemostatic disorder of the prenatal endometrium&#xD;
      (deciduas), caused by pathologic factors including (1) genetic disorders such as chromosomal&#xD;
      abnormalities which often is the result in miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy;&#xD;
      (2) congenital or acquired hemostatic abnormalities due to thrombophilic mutations; (3)&#xD;
      abnormal endocrine processes which may lead to dysregulation of endometrial events required&#xD;
      for successful pregnancy; (4) abnormal immunological responses in the maternal/embryo/fetal&#xD;
      interface. These abnormalities, which could have clinical significance, cannot be&#xD;
      investigated with ultrasound. This protocol describes a comprehensive and systematic study of&#xD;
      women who present with bleeding during the first trimester of pregnancy, to improve&#xD;
      understanding of the relationship between the location and the size of hematomas (with&#xD;
      three-dimensional ultrasounds) and the other factors that may determine the subsequent&#xD;
      development of adverse pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Branch will execute this protocol by establishing a first-trimester clinic to study&#xD;
      patients who present with this common complication of pregnancy. First trimester bleeding is&#xD;
      a common and important complication of pregnancy which has been a neglected area of&#xD;
      investigation by private and public agencies. We intend to address what has been an orphan&#xD;
      area of clinical research.&#xD;

&#xD;
        All pregnant subjects will be recruited under informed consent at Hutzel Hospital. The&#xD;
        study population for both arms of this protocol will involve pregnant women between the&#xD;
        ages of 15 years-old and older at Hutzel Hospital. The ethnic backgrounds are estimated to&#xD;
        involve approximately 60 percent Caucasian and 40 percent African American between both&#xD;
        sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Accurate pregnancy dating criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated gestational age less than or equal to 20 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visible fetus with normal heart rate and rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor visualization of the fetus due to technical factors (e.g. obesity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Risk factors that increase risk for not keeping serial ultrasound appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Desire not to have vaginal ultrasound scans.&#xD;
