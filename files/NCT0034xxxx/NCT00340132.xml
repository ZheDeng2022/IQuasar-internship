  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance and a defect in early insulin secretion are risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A recent longitudinal analysis which tracked the&#xD;
      development of diabetes demonstrated that both insulin action and early insulin secretion&#xD;
      deteriorate as individuals progress from normal to impaired glucose tolerance and then to&#xD;
      diabetes. These results suggest that both inherent (apparent in normal glucose tolerant&#xD;
      subjects who progress to diabetes and likely to have a genetic basis) and acquired (evident&#xD;
      as individuals progress from NGT to IGT to diabetes and possibly environmental in origin)&#xD;
      defects in insulin action and secretion contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. To&#xD;
      identify the genetic and environmental determinants of diabetes we are continuing to&#xD;
      determine: (1) if there are genes that segregate with metabolic risk factors for diabetes&#xD;
      which might therefore be genetic markers for type 2 diabetes and (2) the mechanisms mediating&#xD;
      genetic and environmental determinants of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers for this study will be admitted to the clinical research ward where they will&#xD;
      undergo several tests to determine body composition, oral and intravenous glucose tolerance&#xD;
      and in vivo insulin action. In addition, in selected subjects, adipose and/or skeletal muscle&#xD;
      tissue will be obtained by percutaneous biopsy for in vitro studies of gene expression and&#xD;
      insulin action in these tissues. A transformed lymphocyte cell line will be established for&#xD;
      each subject as a permanent source of DNA for genetic studies. Genetic markers for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and insulin resistance will be sought by typing each individual at positional and&#xD;
      functional candidate loci in the hopes of finding an association between these loci and&#xD;
      obesity, insulin secretion, insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have any acute or chronic diseases or conditions not specifically mentioned that in&#xD;
             the opinion of the provider may interfere with the study or decrease safety for&#xD;
