      This study, conducted in Bamako, Mali (West Africa), will collect blood and sputum samples to&#xD;
      establish normal values for laboratory test results among Malians. Researchers are starting a&#xD;
      new initiative to study HIV and tuberculosis in Africa, using Mali as a model country. In&#xD;
      order to perform these studies, the scientists need to know what constitutes normal&#xD;
      laboratory values among the population. People in developing countries may have dramatically&#xD;
      different laboratory values from those who live in developed countries, and there is&#xD;
      currently little information available to distinguish normal from abnormal results in&#xD;
      Malians. This study will establish normal ranges that will provide a basis for future HIV and&#xD;
      tuberculosis research in Mali. Additionally it will provide blood and sputum samples to&#xD;
      researchers to study different scientific questions related to HIV and Tuberculosis&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and people infected with HIV or tuberculosis, or both, who are 18 years of&#xD;
      age or older and who live in Bamako, Mali, may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants provide a blood or sputum sample, or both, for laboratory analysis. Blood is&#xD;
      collected through a needle inserted into an arm vein, and sputum is collected by having the&#xD;
      participant cough deeply and spit in a cup. Participants may agree to provide samples one&#xD;
      time only or on a returning visit basis. Returning visits may be scheduled daily or weekly.&#xD;
      Subjects may continue to participate for the duration of the 4-year study, provided their&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination are updated once a year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV and tuberculosis are major health issues in the developing world - HIV and tuberculosis&#xD;
      affect several million people worldwide. Individually and together these two diseases kill&#xD;
      more people than any other infections, with the worst suffering occurring on the African&#xD;
      continent. Mali is a West African state awakening to the reality of these issues. While&#xD;
      tuberculosis has always been a major problem in Mali, more recently HIV incidence has begun&#xD;
      to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are commencing a new research initiative to study HIV and tuberculosis in Africa, using&#xD;
      Mali as a model country. However, there is little baseline epidemiological, hematological,&#xD;
      immunological or microbiological data to help distinguish normal from abnormal results;&#xD;
      establishing normal population baseline values is necessary to facilitate future research. We&#xD;
      will collect whole blood and sputum samples to establish baseline values, for the purpose of&#xD;
      facilitating ongoing or future HIV and tuberculosis research. Specifically, samples will be&#xD;
      used to determine normal hematological, immunological and other parameters for Malian people.&#xD;
      In addition, we will use samples to optimize routine and specialized research assays. Sputum&#xD;
      samples will be used in bacteriological and genetic studies intended to optimize studies&#xD;
      relating to tuberculosis.&#xD;
