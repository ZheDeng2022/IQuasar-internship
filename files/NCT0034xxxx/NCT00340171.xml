      Fetal growth abnormalities, such as macrosomia and intrauterine growth retardation, are an&#xD;
      important cause for increased perinatal mortality in the United States. Toward this end,&#xD;
      accurate fetal weight determinations are very important for guiding prenatal care.&#xD;
      Three-dimensional ultrasound is a recent technology that provides a new way to evaluate the&#xD;
      fetus. This technique allows one to arbitrarily scan through a digital ultrasound volume&#xD;
      dataset, visualize organs from different perspectives, and render anatomical features through&#xD;
      computer processing. It also allows the retrospective measurement of distances and volumes&#xD;
      even in the physical absence of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 400 pregnancies will be serially studied by three-dimensional ultrasound to&#xD;
      characterize the growth of volume parameters such as the fetal thigh. This information will&#xD;
      be applied to the Rossavik model of individualized growth assessment. The technique allows&#xD;
      growth evaluation by comparing various ultrasound measurements or birth characteristics to&#xD;
      the individual growth standards specified by the prediction model. Newborn infant body&#xD;
      composition will also be studied within 48 hours of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate cross-sectional study of up to 2,577 fetuses will allow development of birth&#xD;
      weight prediction models based upon fetal volume measurements and further analysis of fetal&#xD;
      growth abnormalities. Individual growth curve standards utilizing these volume parameters&#xD;
      should allow one to evaluate deviations from expected growth or birth weight by using each&#xD;
      fetus as its own control.&#xD;

      Fetal growth abnormalities, such as macrosomia and intrauterine growth retardation, are an&#xD;
      important cause for increased perinatal mortality in the United States. Toward this end,&#xD;
      accurate fetal weight determinations are very important for guiding prenatal care.&#xD;
      Three-dimensional ultrasound is a recent technology that provides a new way to evaluate the&#xD;
      fetus. This technique allows one to arbitrarily scan through a digital ultrasound volume&#xD;
      dataset, visualize organs from different perspectives, and render anatomical features through&#xD;
      computer processing. It also allows the retrospective measurement of distances and volumes&#xD;
      even in the physical absence of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol consists of two study arms and emphasizes the ability of 3D ultrasound to&#xD;
      reliably measure fetal soft tissue as an index of generalized nutritional status. The&#xD;
      longitudinal arm will enroll 400 pregnancies to allow the use of 2D and 3D ultrasonography&#xD;
      for characterizing serial growth patterns of sonographic parameters throughout pregnancy.&#xD;
      This approach compares ultrasound measurements or birth characteristics to individual growth&#xD;
      standards specified by Rossavik prediction models. After delivery, a maximum of 329 newborn&#xD;
      infants, resulting from the same pregnancies, will have correlative photographs and&#xD;
      measurements of their head, abdomen, thigh, skin folds, weight, and crown-heel length taken&#xD;
      to classify growth outcome. Noninvasive air displacement plethymography will be used to&#xD;
      measure neonatal percent body fat and lean body mass after delivery. Infant body composition&#xD;
      data will allow the precise classification of neonatal growth outcome for subsequent&#xD;
      correlation to prenatal sonographic studies. The cross-sectional arm of this protocol will&#xD;
      allow sonographic studies of 2,577 fetuses with similar correlative neonatal evaluation of&#xD;
      1,212 infants for a total of 3,789 subjects. The results will be used to develop a new fetal&#xD;
      weight estimation models that combine 2D and 3D sonographic parameters to improve accuracy&#xD;
      and precision of these predictions. A maximum of 50 newborns from this cross-sectional arm&#xD;
      will also be re-evaluated for infant body composition at 1 and 2 weeks following delivery to&#xD;
      document changes in percent body fat and fat-free mass. Therefore, the subject recruitment&#xD;
      ceiling would be (2,577 mothers + 1,212 infants) + (400 mothers + 329 infants) or 4,518 total&#xD;
      subjects for this Protocol.&#xD;
