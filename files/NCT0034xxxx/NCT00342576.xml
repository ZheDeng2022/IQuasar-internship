  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted on this protocol will have, or be suspected of having, one of the lymphatic&#xD;
      filarial infections affecting humans. After routine clinical evaluation they will be studied&#xD;
      in depth immunologically, and their blood cells and/or serum will be collected to provide&#xD;
      reagents (eg., specific antibodies, T cell clones, etc.) that will be used in the laboratory&#xD;
      to address the broader questions of immunodiagnosis, immunoregulation, immunopathology and&#xD;
      immunoprophylaxis. Careful observations of the patients' clinical and immunologic responses&#xD;
      to therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up of these changes. It is anticipated&#xD;
      both that the patients will receive optimal clinical care for their infections and that the&#xD;
      specimens collected from them will prove to be valuable reagents for the laboratory studies&#xD;
      of the immunologic responses unique to filarial or other helminthic infections.&#xD;

      This study is designed to determine the presence of and the immune response to filarial and&#xD;
      stronglyloides infections in an area endemic for both infections in South India. This study&#xD;
      will aim to examine the presence of filarial and Strongyloides stercoralis infection at a&#xD;
      community level as well as in hospital settings. After routine clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      screening, individuals enrolled in this protocol will be studied in depth immunologically,&#xD;
      and their blood cells and/or serum will be collected to address the broader questions of&#xD;
      immunodiagnosis, immunoregulation and immunopathology. Careful observations of the individual&#xD;
      s clinical and immunologic responses to therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up&#xD;
      of these changes. In addition to infected individuals, this protocol will also be used to&#xD;
      study individuals with filarial pathology and endemic normal individuals. This will enable us&#xD;
      to characterize the immunological profiles of infected, uninfected and diseased individuals&#xD;
      in an endemic area and provide greater insight into the pathogenesis of lymphatic filarial&#xD;
      disease as well as the immunology of strongyloides infection.&#xD;
