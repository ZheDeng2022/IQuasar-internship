      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, Phase 1,&#xD;
      multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and viral shedding&#xD;
      of MEDI-534 in healthy children 1-9 years of age who are seropositive for respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) at screening.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 multi-center&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and viral shedding of MEDI-534 in&#xD;
      healthy children 1-9 years of age who are seropositive for RSV and PIV3 at screening.&#xD;
      MEDI-534 will be administered at dosage levels of 10:4 TCID50, 10:5 TCID50, or 10:6 TCID50 to&#xD;
      three cohorts of subjects in a staggered, step-wise fashion. A single dose of study vaccine&#xD;
      (MEDI-534 or matched volume of vehicle placebo) will be administered on Study Day 0 by nasal&#xD;
      spray, one-half dose into each nostril. The target sample size is 120 subjects randomized 1:1&#xD;
      (MEDI-534 to placebo), with 40 subjects in each of three cohorts. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by site. This study will enroll during the RSV off season at multiple sites in the&#xD;
      United States and Chile.&#xD;
