      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An inadequate filtering system at the Mayak nuclear weapons production facility in&#xD;
           Ozyorsk, Russia, allowed the release of various radioactive materials, particularly&#xD;
           I-131 (radioactive iodine) into the city's atmosphere during the 1950s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A recent pilot study found a higher prevalence of thyroid nodules in Ozyorsk residents&#xD;
           who were exposed to the radiation in childhood during years of heavy atmospheric&#xD;
           emissions (1952-1953) than in children exposed in later years (between 1967 and 1991)&#xD;
           when there were almost no radioactive releases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding the role of I-131 in the development of thyroid disease is important&#xD;
           because I-131 is commonly used in medicine (e.g., to treat hyperthyroidism and thyroid&#xD;
           cancer and to diagnose thyroid disease), and it is the major source of thyroid gland&#xD;
           exposure in fallout from atomic bomb explosions, nuclear power plant accidents, and&#xD;
           atmospheric venting from plutonium manufacturing facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To expand the pilot study to include 350 Ozyorsk residents who were exposed in childhood to&#xD;
      moderate levels of radiation in order to evaluate thyroid disease in relation to the dose of&#xD;
      I-131 exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -People who were born and living in Ozyorsk, Russia between 1954 and 1955, the period of mild&#xD;
      radioactive releases from the Mayak nuclear weapons plant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants' thyroid gland and structure are examined with an ultrasound examination&#xD;
           and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with a possible thyroid gland disorder are referred to specialists for&#xD;
           additional diagnostic procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to expand a completed pilot study that evaluated the prevalence of thyroid&#xD;
      abnormalities in relation to childhood exposure to atmospheric emissions of radioactive&#xD;
      iodines from the Mayak Nuclear Weapons Plant in Ozyorsk, Russia. The pilot study population&#xD;
      was composed of a defined cohort of approximately 900 Ozyorsk residents who were born between&#xD;
      January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1953. The exposed population was comprised of persons who&#xD;
      lived in Ozyorsk during the years of heavy atmospheric releases (1952-1953). Members of the&#xD;
      nonexposed group moved to Ozyorsk between 1967 and 1991, i.e. when there were almost no&#xD;
      radioactive releases. Results from the pilot study suggest an elevated prevalence of thyroid&#xD;
      nodules in the exposed population. Given the positive results from the pilot study and the US&#xD;
      Department of Energy's (DOE) decision to fund a dose reconstruction project for the Ozyorsk&#xD;
      population, we intend to expand the study to include an additional 350 people born and living&#xD;
      in Ozyorsk between 1954 and 1955, i.e. exposed to moderate levels of radiation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods similar to those used in the pilot study will be used in the expanded study. Members&#xD;
      of the study population will be invited to participate in a special thyroid screening&#xD;
      protocol when they come for their annual routine medical examination at the Ozyorsk automated&#xD;
      dispensary system (ASDOC). The thyroid gland is clinically examined by two ASDOC physicians&#xD;
      specifically trained in thyroid palpation. Thyroid abnormalities will be detected based on&#xD;
      physical examinations, assessment of TSH levels, and ultrasound imaging. Biochemical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, including Free T(4), and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies will be assayed as&#xD;
      necessary. Patients are sent to a consulting endocrinologist if the palpation, ultrasound or&#xD;
      laboratory findings suggest a thyroid disorder. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is&#xD;
      performed when a tumor is suspected. Although the FNA is not be done as part of the study&#xD;
      research, but rather as part of the regular Ozyorsk medical system, the results will be given&#xD;
      to the study staff to help make diagnostic decisions. Patients with complicated thyroid&#xD;
      disease will be referred to an experienced consulting thyroid specialist. Patients with&#xD;
      diagnosed thyroid disease are treated within the regular medical system in Ozyorsk.&#xD;
