  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma, an optic neuropathy characterized by progressive visual field loss, is the leading&#xD;
      cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The condition has a substantial heritable basis,&#xD;
      as illustrated by the numerous loci and genes identified to date, and the large proportion of&#xD;
      patients having a family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-1 (Il-1) is an important mediator of inflammation. There are 2 pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta. The genes encoding Il-1 are located within a 430kb&#xD;
      region on chromosome 2q14.2. The role of Il-1 in glaucoma is a subject of recent interest. It&#xD;
      has been shown that Il-1, produced endogenously by glaucomatous cells, inhibits the apoptotic&#xD;
      response to oxidative stress, and Il-1 has also been reported to increase outflow facility by&#xD;
      stimulating the _expression of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes, which in turn reduces extra&#xD;
      cellular resistance. Recently, polymorphisms in Il-1 (particularly +3953T of the Il-1 β) were&#xD;
      found to reduce the risk of primary open angle glaucoma. In this pilot study, we aim to&#xD;
      investigate the role of Il-1 polymorphisms in both normal tension and high pressure glaucoma&#xD;
      in our glaucoma patients. Both open and closed angle glaucoma will be studied. This is a&#xD;
      pilot study of the role of immune system related polymorphisms and depending on the results,&#xD;
      we may embark on a larger investigation of other immune genes in glaucoma&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To investigate if polymorphisms in the Il-1 gene cluster are protective&#xD;
      for glaucoma in Asian populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To determine if there are differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      of the Il-1 gene cluster in normotensive glaucoma patients versus high-pressure glaucoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glaucomas are a group of heterogeneous optic neuropathies characterized by progressive&#xD;
      loss of axons in the optic nerve. Based on WHO Global Data Bank on Blindness, glaucoma&#xD;
      accounts for 5.1 million of the estimated 38 million blind in the world.1Glaucoma affects&#xD;
      approximately 70 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness&#xD;
      in the world2. As the number of elderly in the world rapidly increases, glaucoma morbidity&#xD;
      will rise, causing increased health care costs and economic burden. This has important public&#xD;
      health implications for a condition in which visual loss, once established, cannot be&#xD;
      reversed. The major risk factor in glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure due to reduction&#xD;
      in aqueous outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that glaucoma is a major cause of visual morbidity in&#xD;
      Singapore3-5. In a population based survey conducted on Chinese Singaporeans in the Tanjong&#xD;
      Pagar district, the age-standardized prevalence of glaucoma was found to be 3.2% (95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, 2.3-4.1) in the population 40 years and older.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma has a major genetic basis, estimated to account for a third (range 20 - 60%) of all&#xD;
      glaucoma cases, 6-8 although a recent report suggests that this is an underestimate.9 Genetic&#xD;
      heterogeneity is illustrated by the more than 15 loci and 7 glaucoma-causing genes identified&#xD;
      to date, 10 including 2 genes identified for POAG.11-12 A diverse variety of genetic&#xD;
      mechanisms have been found to induce open angle and developmental glaucomas and these include&#xD;
      coding mutations, particularly in transcription factors, 13 altered gene dosage14 and&#xD;
      dominant negative effects.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of inflammation. There are 2 pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta. Both are produced by monocytes, macrophages and&#xD;
      epithelial cells as host responses to tissue injury. The genes encoding Il-1 are located&#xD;
      within a 430kb region on chromosome 2q14.216. Polymorphisms of the Il-1 gene cluster have&#xD;
      been shown to alter protein _expression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked to&#xD;
      other diseases such as pre-eclampsia among other medical conditions17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      _Expression of the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) in trabecular meshwork&#xD;
      cells has been identified to be a diagnostic marker of glaucoma18. _Expression of ELAM-1 is&#xD;
      controlled by activation of Il-1 autocrine feedback loop, which is controlled through&#xD;
      transcription factor NF-Kappa -Beta. It has been shown that Il-1 produced endogenously by&#xD;
      glaucomatous cells inhibits the apoptotic response to oxidative stress18. Il-1 has also been&#xD;
      reported to increase outflow facility by stimulating the _expression of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase enzymes, which in turn reduces extra cellular resistance19-22. The effect&#xD;
      of Il-1 on the synthesis of Nitric oxide causing a relaxation in ciliary muscle tone may also&#xD;
      be contributory in increasing aqueous outflow23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Wang et al has shown that Il-1 variants result in increased secretion of Il-1 and&#xD;
      thus reduces the risk of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) 24. This was presented at the&#xD;
      recent ARVO meeting 2005 in Florida, USA, under &quot; New ideas in glaucoma&quot;. The group led by Dr&#xD;
      Elizabeth Fini from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, identified genetic variants (+3953T)&#xD;
      of the Il-1 β, which is a protective factor against POAG. They assessed genomic DNA from 100&#xD;
      POAG patients and 104 normal controls in the Caucasian population over 40 years. The allele&#xD;
      frequency of Il-1 Beta (+3953T) was significantly higher in normal controls than in the POAG&#xD;
      group (28% versus 17%, p=0.01). They also found that the allele frequency of Il-1 alpha&#xD;
      (-889T) was higher in normal controls than in the POAG group at borderline significance (39%&#xD;
      versus 29%, p=0.06). This may prove to be significant with a larger sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we hope to determine if polymorphisms in the Il-1 gene cluster found in the&#xD;
      Caucasians are also protective for glaucoma patients in Asian populations. We also aim to&#xD;
      determine if there are differences in the distribution of polymorphisms of the Il-1 gene&#xD;
      cluster in normotensive glaucoma patients versus high-pressure glaucoma patients. Both&#xD;
      primary angle closure and primary open angle glaucoma patients will be studied. The study&#xD;
      will be the first to investigate such changes in PACG, a major cause of blindness in Asia,&#xD;
      and considered to be an IOP-dependent disease. The study findings may have implications on&#xD;
      the genetic basis of glaucoma, placing the focus on the role of the immune system in IOP&#xD;
      response and glaucoma pathogenesis. This is a pilot study of the role of immune system&#xD;
      related polymorphisms and depending on the results, we may embark on a larger investigation&#xD;
      of the role of other immune genes in glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 300 patients with primary glaucoma will be recruited in the study from glaucoma&#xD;
      clinics at Singapore National Eye Centre. This will consist of PACG, POAG and NTG patients.&#xD;
      There will be another 100 control patients with no clinical evidence of glaucoma recruited&#xD;
      from the general clinics. Individuals with secondary angle closure and other ocular diseases&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment and examination Examination, of both eyes, will include best-corrected&#xD;
      Snellen visual acuity, goniscopy, intraocular pressure measurement by Goldmann applanation&#xD;
      tonometer, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, lens, vitreous and retina. In&#xD;
      addition, a scanning laser ophthalmoscope, the Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT, Heidelberg&#xD;
      Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) will be used to image the optic disc in all subjects.&#xD;
      Global and segmental disc and cup areas will be analysed directly by means of HRT software&#xD;
      (version 2.01b) using the standard reference plane. Rim area will be calculated by&#xD;
      subtracting the cup area from the disc area. Glaucoma severity will be classified by global&#xD;
      indices in the visual fields as well as by HRT neuroretinal rim area. Axial length will also&#xD;
      be measured with the IOL-Master (Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany). 10 mls of blood will&#xD;
      be obtained from each patient by venepuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized inclusion criteria for glaucoma will be used, which is the presence of&#xD;
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy (defined as loss of neuroretinal rim with a cup:disc ratio of&#xD;
      0.7 or greater) with compatible visual field loss. PACG will be defined as the presence of at&#xD;
      least 180 degrees of angle in which the trabecular meshwork is not visible on gonioscopy with&#xD;
      the presence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. POAG patients will have open angles on&#xD;
      gonioscopy; POAG patients with a mean IOP without treatment that is consistently less than 21&#xD;
      mm Hg on diurnal testing will be classified as NTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA Preparation and Genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA will be extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood using Nucleon DNA&#xD;
      Extraction kits. The Il-1alpha (-889), Il-beta (-511), and Il-1beta (+3953) variants will be&#xD;
      detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (using primers in Table 1), followed by&#xD;
      digestion with restriction enzyme digests as described in Table 1. Confirmation of&#xD;
      polymorphisms would be carried out by direct sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology is fairly straightforward and the lab work can be performed by Dr Alicia How&#xD;
      (Registrar, SNEC) during her research session each week. Dr How has undergone basic molecular&#xD;
      genetics lab training and will be supervised by Dr Aung Tin.&#xD;
