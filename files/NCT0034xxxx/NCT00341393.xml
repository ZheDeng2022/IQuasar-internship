      This study will evaluate a system for predicting the effectiveness of antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment in African HIV clinics where standard testing methods for measuring viral load,&#xD;
      such as RNA polymerase chain reaction, are not available or affordable. Without accurate&#xD;
      tests to monitor viral load, treatment decisions often are based on insufficient clinical and&#xD;
      immunologic information. This study will see if combined analysis of patients' antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment history, adherence to treatment, clinical findings and simple laboratory tests can&#xD;
      predict whether their treatment is effectively lowering their viral load. An effective&#xD;
      monitoring system such as this could reduce the number of patients kept on ineffective&#xD;
      treatments for prolonged periods of time as well as reduce the development of drug&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who are being followed in the Adult&#xD;
      Infectious Disease Clinic at Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, and who have been taking&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment for more than 6 months may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' medical charts are reviewed and their medical history is taken, including&#xD;
      questions about their treatment history, adherence to treatment, and changes in symptoms. A&#xD;
      blood sample is drawn to determine viral load, CD4+ and CBC counts, and, if necessary,&#xD;
      anti-viral resistance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Routine virological monitoring of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is&#xD;
      not currently affordable or available in most African HIV clinics using standard methods such&#xD;
      as RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Alternative cheaper technologies to quantify the&#xD;
      viral load are still awaited. Therefore the majority of patients are monitored just&#xD;
      clinically and sometimes immunologically. Decisions about switching to second-line ART for&#xD;
      treatment failure are based upon insensitive (for virological failure) clinical and&#xD;
      immunological criteria, such as those suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that using a combination of detailed treatment and adherence history and&#xD;
      changes in clinical and laboratory parameters, virological failure or success may be&#xD;
      predicted in the majority of patients taking ART in a typical African HIV clinic. Using a&#xD;
      monitoring algorithm in which patients are classified according to their likelihood of&#xD;
      failure, it would be possible to reduce the number of viral loads required by an ART clinic&#xD;
      while at the same time increasing the detection of those failing virologically, enabling a&#xD;
      switch to a new effective regimen earlier than would be possible using the WHO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the protocol team proposes a cross-sectional study of patients being treated in a&#xD;
      busy African HIV clinic. We will include protease-inhibitor (PI)-naive patients who are on&#xD;
      first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) based ART and have been on&#xD;
      treatment for more than 6 months. Each patient will undergo a structured interview, have&#xD;
      their notes reviewed and have blood taken for complete blood count, CD4+, viral load and&#xD;
      genotypic and phenotypic anti-viral resistance testing (if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment, adherence, clinical and laboratory parameters would then be individually and&#xD;
      collectively assessed for their ability to predict virological failure using various&#xD;
      statistical procedures including a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. From&#xD;
      this, the monitoring algorithm would be refined. Its performance would then be compared&#xD;
      against the current WHO recommendations for switching therapy to see what proportion of&#xD;
      patients failing virologically could be switched earlier using this system and at what extra&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a monitoring system could reduce the number of patients being allowed to fail their&#xD;
      first-line regimens for prolonged periods of time, for an affordable increase in cost. This&#xD;
      could, therefore, reduce the evolution and transmission of drug resistance and significantly&#xD;
      prolong the effectiveness of the roll out of ART in Africa.&#xD;
