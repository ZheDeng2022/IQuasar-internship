      In CHF impaired insulin sensitivity is a common finding characterised by elevated fasting&#xD;
      insulin levels and impaired effectiveness of insulin to utilise glucose in peripheral&#xD;
      tissues, mainly in skeletal muscle tissue. Additionally, impaired insulin sensitivity, i.e.&#xD;
      insulin resistance, progresses in parallel to severity of CHF and relates to major clinical&#xD;
      symptoms such as reduced exercise capacity and muscle fatigue. In survival analyses, insulin&#xD;
      resistance is a significant predictor of mortality, independently of and additionally to&#xD;
      other established prognostic markers such as age, NYHA class, peak oxygen consumption, or&#xD;
      LVEF. These findings indicate that insulin resistance is involved in CHF pathophysiology.&#xD;
      Importantly, insulin resistance in CHF occurs independently of ischemic etiology. In&#xD;
      ischaemic heart disease, however, insulin resistance as part of the metabolic syndrome is&#xD;
      also an important prerequisite for the development of arteriosclerosis. Accordingly insulin&#xD;
      resistance was found worst in CHF patients with ischemic etiology compared to patients with&#xD;
      CHF due to dilated cardiomyopathy and those with ischaemic heart disease without heart&#xD;
      failure. On the basis of these findings we hypothesise that therapeutically improving insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity may have additional beneficial effects on energy utilisation and therefore&#xD;
      improve clinical symptoms such as reduced exercise capacity and muscle fatigue.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ambulatory patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (NAHY II-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ischemic etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. LVEF â‰¤ 45%&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. standard medical treatment for CHF (such as diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors,&#xD;
             aspirin or warfarin). Patients should be treated with ACI inhibitor for at least 12&#xD;
             months prior to enrolment into the study. Patients should not be treated with&#xD;
             angiotensin II receptor antagonists during the study other than the trial medication.&#xD;
             Further medical treatment such as spironolactone, amiodarone and others are allowed if&#xD;
             the patient is on a stable dose at the beginning of the trial. Dosages should be kept&#xD;
             stable during the trial except adjustment is judged necessary for clinical reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient should be hospitalised due to deterioration of the cardiac disease at least&#xD;
             once in the last 12 months under ACE-I therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. age &gt; 21 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. hospitalisation with intervention within 2 weeks of intended randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. unstable IHD or Myocardial infarction &lt; 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. open diagnosed diabetes mellitus / antidiabetic treatment with insulin, metformin,&#xD;
             sulfonylurea, glinides&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. COPD treated with steroids&#xD;
