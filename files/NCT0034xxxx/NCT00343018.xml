      This study, conducted by the NICHD in collaboration with Lancaster University in Lancaster,&#xD;
      England, will evaluate the accuracy of information obtained from children using AN ADAPTED&#xD;
      VERSION OF NICHD's interview protocol. The NICHD protocol was developed to help forensic&#xD;
      interviewers OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM children who may be victims of or witnesses to a crime&#xD;
      ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. This study does not involve forensic interviews, but is DESIGNED TO&#xD;
      OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM children ABOUT an event that takes place at their school. The study&#xD;
      will examine how children report a brief interaction with an unfamiliar adult, how the memory&#xD;
      of the event changes over time, and how the use of different interview techniques can help&#xD;
      children give a fuller and more accurate accounts of past experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children 5 and 6 years of age who attend local schools in the Lancaster, England, area may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants will be told that they are going to have their pictures&#xD;
      taken and will be escorted by a researcher to a room at the school with another researcher&#xD;
      who is posing as a photographer. The &quot;photographer&quot; and the child will put on a costume, such&#xD;
      as a pirate's outfit, over their street clothes, helping each other put on pieces of the&#xD;
      costume. The photographer will take pictures of the child in the costume. They will each take&#xD;
      off the costumes and the child will be told that he or she will receive the photographs at a&#xD;
      later time. Another researcher posing as a photographer will come into the room, interrupting&#xD;
      the event, and begin to argue with the first photographer about who had booked the equipment.&#xD;
      They will resolve the argument and apologize to the child for the interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 weeks after the event, the children will be interviewed using the ADAPTED VERSION OF&#xD;
      NICHD interview protocol. Half will be interviewed first about the staged event (the photo&#xD;
      session), followed by an interview about a fictitious event (e.g., a class visit to the fire&#xD;
      station) that could plausibly have happened but did not. The other half of the children will&#xD;
      be interviewed first about the fictitious event and then about the staged event. The children&#xD;
      will be interviewed according to one of the following three procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NICHD protocol preceded by a rapport-building phase that includes the rules of the&#xD;
           interview and open-ended questions about the child and a recently experienced event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NICHD protocol preceded by a rapport-building phase that includes the rules of the&#xD;
           interview and direct questions about the child and a recently experienced event, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NICHD protocol preceded by the rules of the interview and open-ended questions about&#xD;
           the child, but no opportunity to practice talking about a recently experienced event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interviewer has elicited as much information as is likely to be gained from verbal&#xD;
      questions, he or she will present the child with a line drawing of a gender neutral person&#xD;
      and ask the child to indicate where the child was touched by the photographer and where the&#xD;
      child touched the photographer. Any child who provides a report of the fictitious event will&#xD;
      be interviewed in the same way about the fictitious event. After 1 year, the children will be&#xD;
      interviewed again in the same manner as the 6-week interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be audio- and videotaped to record the kind of information the children&#xD;
      talk about and compare it to what actually happened in the event.&#xD;

      The NICHD interview protocol was designed to aid forensic interviewers in adhering to best&#xD;
      standards of practice when interviewing children. Field studies evaluating its use have&#xD;
      demonstrated improvements in both interviewer behavior, and the amount and quality of&#xD;
      information obtained from children, compared to interviews conducted prior to its&#xD;
      implementation in test sites. Because field studies were conducted in forensic settings,&#xD;
      however, it has not been possible to evaluate the protocol's effect on the accuracy of&#xD;
      information reported by children. This present study therefore aims to evaluate the accuracy&#xD;
      of information obtained using the NICHD interview protocol in an analog study. In addition&#xD;
      the study is designed to explore children's willingness to provide details of a suggested,&#xD;
      non-experienced event, and the effectiveness of including a human figure drawing as an&#xD;
      auxiliary technique for eliciting further information. Furthermore, we will explore the&#xD;
      importance of the pre-substantive/rapport-building phase of interviews, and the impact this&#xD;
      has on children's reports of experienced and suggested events. Finally, we will explore the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the interview protocol with children when a long delay has occurred between&#xD;
      the event and the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will take part, individually, in a staged event at their school, and approximately&#xD;
      six weeks later, be interviewed at the university about what they experienced. In addition,&#xD;
      children will be asked to talk about a suggested fictitious event (one that has not&#xD;
      happened). The order of the interviews will be counter-balanced across children and&#xD;
      rapport-building conditions. Some children will be interviewed with an open-ended script that&#xD;
      includes practice in episodic memory, some with a script made up of direct questions,&#xD;
      including a practice in episodic memory, and some with one that uses open-ended questions but&#xD;
      does not provide practice in talking about an event from episodic memory. Approximately one&#xD;
      year later children will be interviewed again, so that we can examine children's reports in&#xD;
      protocol interviews over a long delay. Children's reports will be analyzed for both overall&#xD;
      amount and accuracy of information reported, as well as in response to the different cues and&#xD;
      props given in the course of the interview. It is not anticipated that the study will pose&#xD;
      any risks to the children involved, and we expect that both the staged event and the&#xD;
      interviews will be enjoyable and stimulating. We expect that the results of the study will&#xD;
      provide further support for the use of NICHD interview as a safe and effective means of&#xD;
      interviewing children about past experiences. In addition to general information on&#xD;
      children's eyewitness capabilities, the study is expected to supplement field studies by&#xD;
      contributing knowledge about the accuracy of children's memory using the NICHD interview&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

        All children within the nominated age range attending the participating schools, whose&#xD;
        parents have given consent, will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If children are identified as having specific disabilities that may affect their abiity to&#xD;
        give a report about their experience (e.g., a developmental delay), or if English is a&#xD;
        second language and inadequate mastery at the time of interview affects the child's&#xD;
        reports, they will be included in the event and interviewed, but their data will be&#xD;
        excluded from later analysis.&#xD;
