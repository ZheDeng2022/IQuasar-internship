  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of genetics in the etiology and&#xD;
      prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancer, primarily esophageal cancer, but also cancers of&#xD;
      the gastric cardia and body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in China and the seventh&#xD;
      most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Evidence suggests that genetic factors may play&#xD;
      an important role in the etiology of this malignancy, and identification of esophageal cancer&#xD;
      susceptibility genes may allow screening of populations to identify persons at particularly&#xD;
      high risk, who could then be targeted for prevention strategies (e.g., chemoprevention or&#xD;
      early detection). There are several lines of evidence supporting the idea that there is&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility for esophageal cancer in high-risk Chinese populations, including an&#xD;
      association of positive family history with increased risk, evidence of familial aggregation&#xD;
      of cases, and segregation analyses suggesting Mendelian inheritance in high-risk families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several different but complementary approaches will be used to identify esophageal cancer&#xD;
      susceptibility genes. (Because of etiologic similarities and for logistic reasons, parallel&#xD;
      efforts will be made with gastric cardia and body cancers.) First, a tumor/non-tumor study&#xD;
      will be conducted in which a biological specimen bank consisting of samples (tumor,&#xD;
      non-tumor, venous blood, finger stick blood, and buccal cells) from several hundred cases of&#xD;
      esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric body cancers will be developed in Taiyuan that can be&#xD;
      used for the identification of esophageal (as well as gastric cardia and body) cancer&#xD;
      susceptibility genes and potential early genetic markers of these cancers. High-density&#xD;
      genome-wide scans with microsatellite markers will be used in a limited number of cases to&#xD;
      identify potential hot spots followed by further testing of these hot spots and other&#xD;
      candidate markers in additional tumor/non-tumor samples. Premalignant morphologic lesions&#xD;
      will also be examined. Second, blood samples for DNA will be collected from approximately 100&#xD;
      healthy individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas to examine&#xD;
      potential population differences in polymorphisms for selected genomic markers. Third, a&#xD;
      large case-control study with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and body of stomach will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate polymorphisms in the candidate markers identified in other components&#xD;
      of this project, and to evaluate gene-environment interactions. Finally, a family study will&#xD;
      be conducted to evaluate linkage of candidate markers with cancer in families having 2 or&#xD;
      more cases with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and/or body of stomach.&#xD;

        First, several hundred cases of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer (both cardia and body)&#xD;
        ascertained in Taiyuan at the Shanxi Cancer Hospital. Second, several hundred healthy&#xD;
        individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas. Third, a large&#xD;
        case-control study with cases of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer (both cardia and&#xD;
        body) and neighborhood controls selected from Shanxi Province was conducted. Follow-up of&#xD;
        cases from the case-control study has been conducted to determine vital status. Fourth, a&#xD;
        family study is in progress with selection of families having 2 or more cases with&#xD;
        esophageal cancer or gastric cancer; follow-up of family members and accrual of new&#xD;
        families is ongoing in Yangcheng county, Shanxi Province. Finally, an endoscopic study has&#xD;
        been conducted at Shanxi Cancer Hospital to obtain specimens from a morphologic spectrum of&#xD;
        disease ranging from normal to early invasive esophageal cancer.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients over the age of 18 presenting to the SCHI with upper GI signs or symptoms&#xD;
        requiring upper GI endoscopy over a defined calendar period (depending on prevalence of&#xD;
        premalignant lesions, but estimated to be approximately 3 years) will be potentially&#xD;
        eligible for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are eligible only if they meet one of the following two conditions: (1) a visible&#xD;
        lesion unlikely to be cancer or (2) no visible lesions on routine endoscopy (without&#xD;
        mucosal iodine staining) but an unstained (abnormal) lesion following iodine spraying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Invitation for participation will be based solely on the visual appearance of an esophageal&#xD;
        abnormality without or with mucosal iodine staining, but before histologic confirmation is&#xD;
        obtained, and will occur during the same clinic visit as the qualifying endoscopic&#xD;
        examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be invited to participate in this study until after they have undergone&#xD;
        their routine endoscopic evaluation.&#xD;
