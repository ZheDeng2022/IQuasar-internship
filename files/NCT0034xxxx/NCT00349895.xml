  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized study. Approximately 90 patients from up&#xD;
      to 16 centers will be entered in the study. Patients will be followed clinically for up to 5&#xD;
      years post-procedure. All patients will have a repeat angiography at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Genous&#xD;
      Bio-engineered R stentTM in conjunction with optimal statin therapy (80mg of atorvastatin),&#xD;
      in the treatment of elective patients with up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions.&#xD;
      The Genous stent received CE mark for the intended indication in August 2005&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently available coronary stents are prone to thrombosis and restenosis. It is believed&#xD;
      that the accelerated re-establishment of a functional endothelial layer on damaged stented&#xD;
      vascular segments may help to prevent potentially serious complications by providing a&#xD;
      barrier to circulating cytokines, and by the ability of endothelial cells to produce&#xD;
      substances that passivate the underlying smooth muscle cell layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By recruiting the patient's own EPCs to the site of vascular injury (e.g. the site of a&#xD;
      coronary stent implant), an acceleration of the normal endothelialization process would&#xD;
      occur. It is theorized that the rapid establishment of a functioning endothelial layer may&#xD;
      promote the transformation of the injured site to a healthy state. For example, in the case&#xD;
      of coronary stent implantation, rapid re-endothelialization may reduce inflammation,&#xD;
      thrombosis and potentially eliminate restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influences of EPC recruitment and reendothelialization on restenosis range from the&#xD;
      effects on the vascular repair response, to the prevention of platelet aggregation and&#xD;
      activation, angiogenesis, and enhancement of vasomotor response. Recently it has been shown&#xD;
      that the integrity and functional activity of the endothelial monolayer play a crucial role&#xD;
      in the prevention of atherosclerosis. However, risk factors for coronary artery disease such&#xD;
      as age, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes reduce the number and functional&#xD;
      activity of these circulating EPCs, thus limiting the regenerative capacity. The impairment&#xD;
      of stem cells by risk factors in CAD patients may contribute to the limited regenerative&#xD;
      capacity of diseased endothelium, as well as to atherogenesis and atherosclerotic disease&#xD;
      progression. Therefore, relating the number and function of circulating EPCs to the&#xD;
      functional outcome of stent technology is crucial to identify a beneficial effect on in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis formation and vascular (dys) function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HEALING FIM and HEALING II clinical studies sought to define the safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      stent designed to sequester circulating endothelial progenitor cells to the luminal surface&#xD;
      of the stent struts by an anti-CD34 antibody coating, thereby promoting reendothelialization&#xD;
      of the coronary stent and the vascular healing response following stent deployment. Enhanced&#xD;
      vascular healing will reinstate vascular integrity, prevent platelet aggregation and&#xD;
      sub-acute in-stent thrombosis, reinstate vasoreactivity and inhibit restenosis formation. In&#xD;
      the HEALING II study, a correlation was found between EPC levels and angiographic/IVUS&#xD;
      outcomes in patients receiving the Genous stent. Patients with normal EPC titers had&#xD;
      significantly less in-stent late loss compared to those with low EPCs (0.53 vs 1.02mm). This&#xD;
      is consistent with the results from drug eluting stent trials, thereby establishing proof of&#xD;
      concept of the EPC capturing technology, provided adequate EPC target cell population is&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several animal studies demonstrating that statin therapy was associated with a 2.5&#xD;
      to 3 fold increase of circulating EPCs leading to accelerated reendothelialization, vascular&#xD;
      repair and improved angiogenesis. In addition, Dimmeler and co-workers found similar results&#xD;
      in a small cohort of cardiovascular patients receiving atorvastatin therapy (n=7, Circulation&#xD;
      2001), suggesting an angiotrophic effect of atorvastatin therapy in addition to its&#xD;
      previously defined pleiotrophic properties. Similarly, Drexler and co-workers described&#xD;
      similar EPC recruiting properties of simvastatin in CAD patients unrelated to/ irrespective&#xD;
      of LDL reduction (n=10, Circulation 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study seeks to confirm the safety and optimize the effectiveness of the EPC&#xD;
      capture technology (Genous Bio-engineered R stent) by incorporating a high dose statin&#xD;
      therapy, specifically atorvastatin 80mg, for at least two weeks prior to the index procedure.&#xD;
