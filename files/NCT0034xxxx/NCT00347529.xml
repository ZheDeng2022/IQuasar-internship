  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated at sites where&#xD;
      administrations are given, any effects it may have on subjects' wellbeing and whether it can&#xD;
      produce antibody responses in the body that may protect against the subjects catching a&#xD;
      pandemic strain of flu&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pandemic influenza occurs when a strain of influenza to which the human population has not&#xD;
      been exposed develops the ability to infect man and spread from person to person. Some&#xD;
      pandemics can have very severe health impacts and be widespread. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      PowderMed's Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) DNA vaccine for pandemic influenza as&#xD;
      a potential alternative to other vaccine technologies. This study represents the first study&#xD;
      with this vaccine and will provisionally assess its safety and immunogenicity (ability to&#xD;
      generate an immune response) at four different dose combinations. The vaccine will be given&#xD;
      as a prime-boost regimen with vaccination on Days 0 and 28&#xD;
