  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tipranavir (TPV) plus ritonavir (RTV) is indicated for use as part of an antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment regimen for resistant HIV-1 infection in adult patients. Since significant&#xD;
      cholesterol and triglyceride elevations are commonly reported during TPV/RTV treatment,&#xD;
      effective treatment strategies are critical to prevent long-term cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin, a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is&#xD;
      unlikely to interact with TPV/RTV since it is not extensively metabolized, however, a formal&#xD;
      drug interaction study is needed before this combination can be recommended. This study will&#xD;
      examine the pharmacokinetic interactions between tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/RTV [TPV/r] 500&#xD;
      mg/200 mg twice daily [B.I.D]) and single dose rosuvastatin when the two are co-administered&#xD;
      to healthy adult volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that if tipranavir 500 mg is&#xD;
      co-administered with low-dose ritonavir 200 mg and rosuvastatin (10 mg) no significant&#xD;
      clinical interaction will occur.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, open-label pharmacokinetic study in healthy HIV seronegative adults.&#xD;
      This study will examine the pharmacokinetic interactions between steady-state TPV/r 500&#xD;
      mg/200 mg B.I.D. and single dose rosuvastatin 10 mg when the drugs are co-administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin 24 hour pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on days 1-2 and 12-13.&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin 48 hr samples will be collected on days 3 and day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tipranavir and ritonavir 12 hour pharmacokinetic sampling will be on day 11 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments (physical examination, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests) will be performed at screening, during the study and prior to discharge. Subjects will&#xD;
      be continuously monitored for adverse events throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, subjects will receive a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin. Beginning on Day 3,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a combination of TPV 500 mg/RTV 200 mg twice daily for 11 days (Days&#xD;
      3-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 12, subjects will receive a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin co-administered with&#xD;
      TPV/r.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive (BMI = weight&#xD;
             (kg)/[height (m)]2) and weigh at least 50 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or females, ages &gt; 18 to &lt; 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not be nursing or pregnant. All women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (have not reached menopause nor undergone hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (HCG) test performed at screening (within 24 hours before the start of&#xD;
             study day 1). Female subjects who are not of reproductive potential (have reached&#xD;
             menopause or undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or&#xD;
             whose male partner has undergone successful vasectomy with resultant azoospermia or&#xD;
             has azoospermia for any other reason, are eligible without requiring the use of&#xD;
             contraception. Documentation of menopause, sterilization (hysterectomy, oophorectomy,&#xD;
             tubal ligation, or vasectomy) and azoospermia by patient-reported history is&#xD;
             acceptable. Both male and female study volunteers of reproductive potential must agree&#xD;
             not to participate in a conception process (i.e., active attempt to become pregnant or&#xD;
             to impregnate via sperm donation or in vitro fertilization), and, if participating in&#xD;
             sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study volunteer/male partner&#xD;
             must use a form of contraception as specified below while receiving protocol-specified&#xD;
             medication(s) and for one month after stopping the medication(s). Male study&#xD;
             volunteers will be required to use a barrier method for at least 3 months after&#xD;
             completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History or current evidence of any significant acute or chronic medical illness that,&#xD;
             within the investigator's discretion, would interfere with the conduct or&#xD;
             interpretation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of acute or chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, or chronic renal insufficiency.&#xD;

             with the conduct or interpretation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment. Any gastrointestinal surgery that&#xD;
             could impact upon the absorption of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donation of blood or plasma to a blood bank or in a clinical study (except a screening&#xD;
             visit) within 4 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate oral medication.&#xD;
