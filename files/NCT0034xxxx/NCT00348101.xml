  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical investigations have demonstrated the utility of β-adrenergic blockade in&#xD;
      reducing perioperative ischaemic events, ultimately translating into a decrease in cardiac&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. However, β-blocker therapy remains underutilized in clinical&#xD;
      practice because of concerns of potential adverse effects such as a reduced inotropic state,&#xD;
      which might result in acute congestive heart failure or hypotension. Therefore, additional&#xD;
      treatment with a positive inotropic agent might be needed. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors&#xD;
      (PDEIs) offer a favourable pharmacological profile in this setting and stimulate cardiac&#xD;
      function in the absence of the β-adrenergic receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the combination of PDEI and β-blocker therapy would decrease&#xD;
      perioperative plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients requiring&#xD;
      major vascular surgery. BNP is chosen as our primary outcome variable because of its&#xD;
      importance as a sensitive correlate of myocardial dysfunction and its prognostic value for&#xD;
      predicting the risk of cardiac death across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac complications, such as, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and life-threatening&#xD;
      dysrhythmias, are the leading cause of perioperative death among patients undergoing major&#xD;
      vascular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of perioperative ischaemic events is most certainly multifactorial and&#xD;
      includes persistent activation of several neurohormonal pathways, such as the natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous clinical investigations have demonstrated the utility of β-adrenergic blockade in&#xD;
      reducing perioperative ischaemic events, ultimately translating into a decrease in cardiac&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality especially in patients who had or were at high risk for coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. Therefore, the administration of β-blockers to all patients at high risk for&#xD;
      coronary events who are scheduled to undergo major noncardiac surgery is strongly supported&#xD;
      by consensus recommendations and clinical guidelines. Despite the evidence of benefit,&#xD;
      β-blockers remain underutilized in clinical practice because of concerns of potential adverse&#xD;
      effects such as a reduced inotropic state, which might result in myocardial depression, acute&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, and hypotension [13]. Therefore, additional treatment with a&#xD;
      positive inotropic agent might be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) offer a favourable pharmacological profile in this&#xD;
      setting and retain their haemodynamic effects in the face of full β-blockade. Preliminary&#xD;
      data suggest that the combination of PDEI and β-blocker therapy may be better tolerated and&#xD;
      allows for expression of the known effects of β-blocker therapy and improved myocardial&#xD;
      functioning without the adverse effects of either therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore hypothesize that the combination of PDEI and β-blocker therapy would decrease&#xD;
      perioperative plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients requiring&#xD;
      major vascular surgery documented to have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease and&#xD;
      limited coronary reserve. BNP is chosen because of its pivotal role as a sensitive correlate&#xD;
      of myocardial dysfunction and its prognostic value for predicting the short- and long-term&#xD;
      risk of cardiac death across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes.&#xD;
