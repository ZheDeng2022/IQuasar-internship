  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, will examine how&#xD;
      insulin metabolism and cardiovascular risk are altered in response to weight loss. Insulin is&#xD;
      a natural hormone that causes cells to remove glucose (sugar) from the blood. People who are&#xD;
      insulin-sensitive remove glucose efficiently. People who are insulin-resistant require more&#xD;
      insulin to remove glucose from the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult volunteers will be recruited for this study through advertisements in local newspapers&#xD;
      in communities around Stanford University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin sensitivity testing: Before beginning the study, participants will be tested for&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity. For the test, two small catheters (plastic tubes) are placed into&#xD;
           two veins - one for infusing glucose, insulin, and sandostatin (a drug that blocks&#xD;
           insulin secretion from the pancreas), and one for drawing blood samples. The infusions&#xD;
           are done over 3 hours. Blood samples are collected before, during, and at the end of the&#xD;
           study to measure how well the cells remove glucose from the blood in response to&#xD;
           insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research diet: Participants are assigned to a low-calorie diet tailored to the&#xD;
           individual's metabolic rate. The diets contain either 40 or 60 percent of total calories&#xD;
           as carbohydrates, 40 or 20 percent as fat, and the rest as protein. People with type 2&#xD;
           diabetes who are taking diabetes medicine with have a diet of 45 to 50 percent&#xD;
           carbohydrates, 35 to 40 percent fat, and the rest protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meal profile: Before beginning the diet and after 4 months on the diet, participants are&#xD;
           tested for the effects of the various study diets on control of blood sugar and fats. On&#xD;
           the day of each test, participants have a physical examination and provide a medical&#xD;
           history. Then, a small catheter is placed in a vein. Blood samples are drawn before&#xD;
           breakfast and then hourly for up to 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are diabetic are randomly assigned to take one of three diabetes&#xD;
           medications - rosiglitazone, glucophage, or a sulfonylurea compound - to help control&#xD;
           blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging: This diagnostic test uses a strong magnetic field and radio&#xD;
           waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan, the&#xD;
           participant lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field, wearing&#xD;
           ear plugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning&#xD;
           process. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times&#xD;
           during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these procedures, patients may be asked to have a fat cell biopsy. This is&#xD;
      done to determine whether insulin-resistant people have fewer fat cells but more fat per cell&#xD;
      than insulin-sensitive people. For this test, a small piece of fat tissue is surgically&#xD;
      removed, under local anesthetic, from an area of the lower abdomen. With the participant's&#xD;
      consent, genetic testing may be done on the fat tissue sample to look for genes that may link&#xD;
      central obesity to insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may be asked to be followed for an additional 3 months after completion of&#xD;
      the study for a continued weight loss program. The follow-up includes weekly visits for&#xD;
      weight measurements and a review of food records.&#xD;

      Little is known about the turnover of adipose cells in the fat depots of normal animals and&#xD;
      human subjects. However, microarray analysis of adipose cell gene expression in high risk&#xD;
      insulin-resistant human subjects suggests that a reduced rate of adipose cell turnover is&#xD;
      associated with enhanced adipose cell size and systemic insulin resistance. New technology&#xD;
      now permits a detailed analysis of adipose cell size including the detection of smaller cells&#xD;
      which may be in the process of active differentiation. We propose to examine the relationship&#xD;
      between adipose cell size distribution and systemic insulin resistance in obese human&#xD;
      subjects. Adipose tissue biopsies will be obtained at Stanford University under protocols and&#xD;
      consent forms approved by the Stanford University IRB. Only procedures already being&#xD;
      performed on subjects under these protocols will be used.&#xD;
