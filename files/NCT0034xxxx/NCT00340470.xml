    <textblock>
      Teens are at high risk for traffic violations and car crashes because of their young age,&#xD;
      lack of driving experience, and exposure to high-risk driving conditions. The Checkpoints&#xD;
      Program has used increased parental restrictions on teen driving through at least the first 4&#xD;
      months after their children obtain a driver's permit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Checkpoints Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 400 teens in Michigan will participate in one of two study groups. One group&#xD;
      will take standard driver education classes; the other group will take driver education&#xD;
      classes that incorporate the Checkpoints Program. Teens and their parents will complete a&#xD;
      written survey after completing the classes and a telephone survey after teens obtain a&#xD;
      driver's permit. Teens will complete additional telephone surveys 1, 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      after obtaining a driver's permit. Researchers will use this information to study how parents&#xD;
      manage teen driving practices, teen driving experiences (amount and conditions of), and&#xD;
      high-risk teen driving behaviors.&#xD;

      Teens are at high risk for traffic violations and motor vehicle crashes because of their&#xD;
      young age, lack of driving experience, and exposure to high-risk driving conditions. Crash&#xD;
      risk is greatest during the first two years of driving, and especially elevated during the&#xD;
      first months of driving. Increasing parent involvement is becoming an important target of&#xD;
      young driver education; however, little attention has been devoted to parental management of&#xD;
      teen driving after teen licensure. Increased parental management of teen driving could reduce&#xD;
      the risk of serious injury during the first months of driving and establish clear&#xD;
      expectations for their teens' safe driving thereafter. In two randomized trials, the&#xD;
      Checkpoints Program has been demonstrated to increase parental restrictions on teen driving&#xD;
      through at least four months post-licensure. In this proposed research, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the Checkpoints Program as applied to driver education. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the extent to which exposure to the Checkpoints Program during driver education&#xD;
      classes in Michigan results in increased restrictions on young drivers during the first year&#xD;
      of provisional licensure. The design is a randomized trial in which 24-30 commercial driver&#xD;
      education classes will be randomly assigned to be either standard driver education or driver&#xD;
      education that integrates the Checkpoints Program, Approximately 400 teens enrolled in driver&#xD;
      education and one of their parents will be recruited and will complete written surveys at&#xD;
      baseline and telephone surveys one month after teens obtained provisional licenses. Teens&#xD;
      will complete additional telephone surveys one, three, six, and 12 months after provisional&#xD;
      licensure. Study outcomes include parent management practices of teen driving, teen driving&#xD;
      experience including the amount and conditions of driving during the first 12 months of&#xD;
      licensure, and teen risky driving behaviors.&#xD;
