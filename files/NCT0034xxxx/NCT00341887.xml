      This project, called PHIDISA I, will screen uniformed personnel of the South African National&#xD;
      Defense Force (SANDF) and their registered family members for HIV, hepatitis B and C,&#xD;
      gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia to determine the incidence and prevalence of these&#xD;
      sexually transmitted diseases. It will identify people who may be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      clinical trials for preventing or treating HIV disease and will provide information that will&#xD;
      be helpful in developing policy and better care for people affected with HIV and other&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is part of the South Africa-U.S. PHIDISA Programme-a collaboration between the&#xD;
      South African Military Health Service (SAMHS) of the SANDF, the U.S. Department of Defense,&#xD;
      and the U.S. National Institutes of Health-to help prevent HIV transmission among South&#xD;
      African military and civilian employees and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uniformed SANDF personnel or their family members who are eligible for health services from&#xD;
      the SAMHS may enroll in the study. Participants visit the clinic every 6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years for the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out a demographic information questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out a HIV risk assessment questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out a quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of test results and counseling session with a doctor or nurse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who test positive for HIV have a physical examination and additional blood draws.&#xD;

      The South Africa - U.S. PHIDISA Project is a cooperative HIV/AIDS treatment research&#xD;
      initiative established in 2003 for a likely duration of at least five years. It is an&#xD;
      extension of the Masibambisane Programme, which is a cooperative initiative to help prevent&#xD;
      the transmission of HIV/AIDS among South African military and civilian employees and their&#xD;
      families. The PHIDISA Project is a collaboration between the South African Military Health&#xD;
      Service of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), the U.S. Department of Defence&#xD;
      and the National Institutes of Health of the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PHIDISA Project has conducted clinical and operational research in HIV/AIDS in military&#xD;
      and military-associated civilian populations. Scientists engaged in the research have been&#xD;
      from South Africa, the United States and Australia and represent military and civilian&#xD;
      medical, research and academic institutions. The project has established clinical research&#xD;
      infrastructure within the SANDF and a network of its clinics, sick bays and hospitals. This&#xD;
      has established important biomedical and public health research capacity that can be used in&#xD;
      the future to address health issues of critical importance for military force preparedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Executive Committee that includes South African and U.S. members manages the PHIDISA&#xD;
      Project. An independent External Advisory Committee advises the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of this project, information will be generated to assist SANDF in its future&#xD;
      decisions about how best to manage the HIV/AIDS epidemic in military settings to assure SANDF&#xD;
      combat readiness and to expand the wealth of knowledge regarding the best way to treat HIV&#xD;
      infections. As a project complimentary to the Masibambisane Programme it also is anticipated&#xD;
      that the PHIDISA Project will also contribute to the success of HIV transmission prevention&#xD;
      activities in the military. The results of the PHIDISA Project also may contribute to&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS clinical management, and related policy decisions, in the South African civilian&#xD;
      sector.&#xD;
