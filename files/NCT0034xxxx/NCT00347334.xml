  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term torticollis is Latin for &quot;twisted neck&quot;. It can be caused by a tightness of the&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid muscle manifested by a head tilt to the same and neck rotation to the&#xD;
      opposite side. Treatment includes a comprehensive physical therapy program. Torticollis&#xD;
      typically presents itself within the first three months of life. Currently research in&#xD;
      infants concludes that a physical therapy stretching program is effective in the majority of&#xD;
      cases.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine how positioning time correlates to rate of recovery. Overall&#xD;
      incidence of torticollis has increased dramatically since the inception of the back to sleep&#xD;
      program in 1994.2 The back to sleep program is an educational awareness program promoting&#xD;
      families to place infants to sleep on their backs to reduce the risks of sudden infant death.&#xD;
      The increase use of semi-upright positioning equipment prior to developmental head control&#xD;
      may also be contributing to the increase. Families are placing babies in semi-upright&#xD;
      position ie. car seat or swing prior to developmental head control. Head control typically&#xD;
      emerges by three months of age. Unfortunately the use of positioning devices occurs prior to&#xD;
      the child reaching their third month birthday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study will include measuring the rate of recovery for infant&#xD;
      torticollis. Recovery will be defined as achieving full neck rotation and no head tilt. The&#xD;
      length of time spent in developmental positions and positioning equipment such as belly&#xD;
      lying, side lying, semi-upright and sitting will also be monitored and recorded. No specific&#xD;
      position will be prescribed; the study will monitor positions only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be initiated upon referral to Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital for&#xD;
      physical therapy evaluation. Baseline for cervical rotation and lateral tilt will be&#xD;
      assessed. Families will be trained regarding a home stretching program and asked to diary&#xD;
      home positioning time. Routine plan of care will continue a minimum of every other week until&#xD;
      full active range of motion is achieved. At each visit cervical range of motion will be&#xD;
      determined as well as parent report regarding home positioning time. Recovery will be defined&#xD;
      as full active range of motion, no head tilt, and symmetrical head righting reactions. Post&#xD;
      recovery analysis of recovery rates and positioning time will be done to assess correlations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Torticollis come from Latin,&quot;torti&quot; meaning twisted and &quot;collis&quot; meaning neck.1 Torticollis&#xD;
      is a tightening of sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle resulting in a head tilt to involved side&#xD;
      and rotation to the opposite side. The conditions presents from birth through the first 2&#xD;
      months of life during which time infants' neck muscles are developing. There are three&#xD;
      clinical groups of torticollis-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. palpable SCM tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. muscular SCM- tightening and thickening of SCM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. postural torticollis - posturing but no tightness or tumor 2 The causes of torticollis&#xD;
           may include damage or shortening of SCM possibly due to: in utero positioning ie. lack&#xD;
           of space traumatic birth multiple birth therefore limiting space low amniotic fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current physical therapy referrals for torticollis have increased dramatically perhaps due to&#xD;
      an increase in multiple births, infant size and premature birth. Graham states that the back&#xD;
      to sleep program initiated in 1994 has resulted in an epidemic of plagiocephaly and&#xD;
      positional torticollis estimated from 1 in 300 to 1 in 60.3 In addition the increase use of&#xD;
      infant seats places children in semi-upright postures before an age of developmental head&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research has established that physical therapy is effective in 90% of the cases. The&#xD;
      treatment is correlated with severity of restriction and the presence of tumor.4 The role of&#xD;
      home positioning has not been addressed in torticollis research. A community education&#xD;
      program to promote awareness limiting time in a semi-upright position ie. could help decrease&#xD;
      the surge of torticollis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study significance is to establish how home positioning time correlates to rate of&#xD;
      recovery for Torticollis. Does positioning the child out of semi-upright improve recovery&#xD;
      rates? Can we establish a better physical therapy intervention? This improves quality of&#xD;
      physical therapy care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point physical therapy research interventions for Torticollis have focused on a&#xD;
      stretching program. This study will determine how home positioning correlates to the&#xD;
      torticollis rate of recovery. The hypothesis is to determine the relationship between&#xD;
      developmental positions and rate of recovery for Torticollis. Does home positioning affect&#xD;
      recovery? Recovery will be determined by time to achieve full active range of motion and&#xD;
      symmetrical head control as measured by a goniometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims include measuring Torticollis recovery time, documenting neck movements using a&#xD;
      goniometer, a standardized physical therapy measurement tool. As well as recording home&#xD;
      positioning through parent report. All participants will be consented prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational design study to determine: Is home positioning time associated&#xD;
      with torticollis rate of recovery? Infants with a torticollis diagnosis, six months of age or&#xD;
      younger, referred to Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital will be eligible for the study to&#xD;
      obtain a sample of 150 children. A marketing campaign to locale physicians will educate them&#xD;
      regarding the study existence at the four satellite locations. The study will explore the&#xD;
      relationship between home positioning times and recovery rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be followed a minimum of every other week to assess active and passive neck and&#xD;
      trunk range of motion, head and neck control including strength and righting reactions.&#xD;
      Parents will diary reporting weekly time spent in developmental postures: back, side belly,&#xD;
      and semi-upright posture ie. infant car seat. Postures will advance with developmental age to&#xD;
      sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy interventions during weekly sessions include routine plan of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      stretching of neck and trunk strengthening of neck and trunk kineseotaping of neck and trunk&#xD;
      Parent education regarding home stretching and environmental adaptation Massage/Soft tissue&#xD;
      mobilization and myofascial release to head and trunk Environmental adaptation encourage&#xD;
      child to look the opposite Orthotic management - Tot collar use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocols for taping and stretching will be followed. A tubular orthosis for Torticollis (TOT&#xD;
      collar) will be utilized at 4.5 months if a head tilt is still present at this age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once full passive range of motion is achieved treatment will progress to address active range&#xD;
      of motion, strengthening as well as postural asymmetries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized torticollis assessment, plan of care and weekly note will be used by all&#xD;
      clinicians for documentation. Staff training will occur prior to initiation of study and&#xD;
      quarterly throughout the study. These training will be videotaped and all clinicians will be&#xD;
      required to view prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plagiocephaly often accompanies infants with torticollis. Referral to craniofacial physician&#xD;
      for helmeting consultation will occur at 6 months of age if indicated. Plagiocephaly is a&#xD;
      flattened head due to asymmetrical resting posture of the infant. Plagiocephaly will be&#xD;
      defined as greater than a 4mm cross sectional difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery is defined as :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full symmetrical active range of motion of neck, trunk and extremities as measured by&#xD;
           goniometry per Norkin.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 80* active cervical rotation in supine, prone, sitting and stance as measured by&#xD;
           goniometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Active midline trunk and head alignment during static and dynamic activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Symmetrical righting and equilibrium reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Symmetrical antigravity head and trunk strength as measured by manual muscle strength&#xD;
           testing by Hoppenfeld.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variables are rate of recovery as defined by length of time from recovery&#xD;
      and initial assessment. Positioning time spent in developmental postures: belly, back,&#xD;
      semi-upright and sit. Other parameters which will be documented are: age of parents, birth&#xD;
      weight, birth order, multiple births: yes or no, plagiocephaly, helmet use and TOT collar&#xD;
      use. Data will be coded and recorded on an Excel spreadsheet. Reports will be recorded&#xD;
      aggregately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess the relationship between recovery time and positioning time in each position&#xD;
      using Pearson's correlation coefficient or the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation&#xD;
      coefficient as necessary. We will use multiple linear regression models to assess these&#xD;
      relationships while adjusting for baseline and treatment factors such as birth order,&#xD;
      plagiocephaly and TOT collar use. All tests will be two-tailed and performed at a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05. All analyses will be performed using SAS 9.1 software (SAS&#xD;
      institute, Cary NC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: With the 150 subjects we anticipate, we will have greater than 90% power to&#xD;
      detect correlation coefficient of at least 0.30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full medical assessment is necessary to rule out associated anomalies such as hip&#xD;
      dysplasia, vertebral anomalies due to syndromes ie. Down's syndrome. A secondary diagnosis&#xD;
      often associated with torticollis is plagiocephaly. Asymetrical resting posture often results&#xD;
      in a flattened head (plagiocephaly). This may cause a progressive cranial asymmetry. In some&#xD;
      cases plagiocephaly requires helmeting to apply pressures and reshape the infants head.&#xD;
      Children with vertebral anomalies will be excluded; children will plagiocephaly will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for torticollis primarily includes physical therapy interventions. Ninety percent&#xD;
      of cases respond to physical therapy. In severe cases when after a six month stretching&#xD;
      program there still remains greater than 15* head tilt more aggressive treatment may be&#xD;
      indicated. Other interventions include Botulinum Toxin injection to weaken the muscle and&#xD;
      possibly surgery to lengthen the muscle.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      treatment initiated at another facility medical complication interfered with treatment&#xD;
      surgery radiology results of vertebral anomaly, ocular imbalance or nerve injury treatment&#xD;
      initiated after six months of age previous BOTOX or cervical manipulations clients who attend&#xD;
      daycare full time compliance with less than 80% scheduled sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive routine plan of care. Additional procedures required for&#xD;
      participants include completing a diary/questionnaire regarding home positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be attained by treating physical therapist prior to initial assessment.&#xD;
