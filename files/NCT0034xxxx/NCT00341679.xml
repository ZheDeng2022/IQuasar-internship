      This study will define the major genetic risk and protective factors for idiopathic&#xD;
      inflammatory myopathies (IIM), a group of immune disorders affecting connective tissues such&#xD;
      as muscles. It will also identify new environmental risk factors for IIM and identify immune&#xD;
      responses in myositis and related diseases. There are many forms of IIMs, and the causes of&#xD;
      these diseases are unknown. However, scientists suspect that they result when people with&#xD;
      some genetic factors that predispose them-that is, put them at greater risk-are exposed to&#xD;
      certain environmental triggers. Some of those triggers include food, drugs, biologics (such&#xD;
      as a vaccine to prevent disease), medical devices and occupational exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, including children under 18, who had a diagnosis of myositis, a related autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, or a rheumatic disease, as well as their blood relatives, and control subjects who&#xD;
      were in good health have already been recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation consisted of one outpatient visit to the patient's doctor, who will obtain a&#xD;
      medical history and conduct a physician examination. Patients spent 20 to 30 minutes to&#xD;
      answer written questions. There was a blood collection of about 6 tablespoons. If there was a&#xD;
      major change in patients' medical conditions, they were asked to return for a second&#xD;
      outpatient evaluation to determine whether any of the blood tests or antibodies, which show&#xD;
      an immune response, had changed. Blood samples collected will be used only for laboratory&#xD;
      research studies. The samples have been identified by a code, and all other identifying&#xD;
      information have been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, researchers will explore possible environmental risk factors, including&#xD;
      studies of infectious and non-infectious agents. They will analyze the blood for genetic&#xD;
      markers and test for certain antibodies. Laboratory results will be evaluated as they relate&#xD;
      to the signs, symptoms, and severity of patients' illnesses. That would help researchers to&#xD;
      better understand patterns of the diseases and the outcomes for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not have a direct benefit for patients. However, results from the study can&#xD;
      be made available to patients' doctors for use in appropriate care. Also, it is hoped that&#xD;
      information gained can help other people in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who develop chronic harmful inflammation in association with self-reactive&#xD;
      autoantibodies or T cells are said to have autoimmune diseases. The causes of these diseases&#xD;
      are unknown but they are thought to occur in genetically susceptible individuals after&#xD;
      exposure to selected environmental agents. There are many forms of these diseases, but we&#xD;
      have been focusing on one of the rarest and most poorly-studied group of autoimmune&#xD;
      disorders, known as the Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIM). This heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      diseases includes polymyositis, dermatomyositis and related disorders. This is a natural&#xD;
      history protocol designed to continue our study of these diseases and begin the evaluation of&#xD;
      related connective tissue disorders associated with environmental exposures. We plan to&#xD;
      further delineate important groups of patients and familial cases, and obtain useful material&#xD;
      for further investigations of the clinical presentations, etiology, pathogenesis, and&#xD;
      immunologic abnormalities of autoimmune/connective tissue diseases. Clinical data and patient&#xD;
      blood, urine and tissue specimens have been collected by referring physicians and sent to us.&#xD;
      The blood samples have been separated into cells and plasma, frozen and then placed into cell&#xD;
      and plasma banks. Often the diagnosis of an IIM can be confused with other illness (such as&#xD;
      adult-onset dystrophies), and therefore, we have also included patients with other illnesses&#xD;
      (who are referred with a preliminary diagnosis of an IIM or an unknown myopathy), including&#xD;
      patients with other autoimmune diseases. In order to understand more fully the genetic risk&#xD;
      factors for these diseases, family members of selected patients who have several blood&#xD;
      relatives with autoimmune or connective tissue diseases will also be studied. In summary,&#xD;
      this natural history protocol will attempt, through a series of hypothesis-testing and&#xD;
      hypothesis-generating studies, to obtain new information regarding the clinical presentation,&#xD;
      risk and protective factors, pathogeneses and prognostic features for myositis and related&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
