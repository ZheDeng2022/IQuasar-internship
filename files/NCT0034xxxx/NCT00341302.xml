  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By the end of 1999, it was estimated that 1.2 million children were living with HIV&#xD;
      infection. During 1999 alone, 600,000 children were newly infected with HIV, mostly in&#xD;
      less-developed countries. Most HIV-infected children are infected by transmission from mother&#xD;
      to child during pregnancy, at birth, or through breast milk. Antiretroviral medications,&#xD;
      cesarean section before rupture of membranes, and avoidance of breastfeeding are ways to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of transmission. This study will determine mother-to-child transmission rates&#xD;
      and the effects on infants of exposure to antiretroviral medications and mode of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 180 to 240 HIV-infected pregnant women in Mexico and Argentina will be enrolled&#xD;
      during the first year of this 5-year study. HIV-infected women will be evaluated during&#xD;
      pregnancy, during delivery, and 6 months after delivery. At each visit, a history will be&#xD;
      taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-exposed infants will be evaluated through 6 months of age. At each of 2 visits, a history&#xD;
      will be taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests;&#xD;
      and growth will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective cohort study to describe the characteristics of&#xD;
      HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-exposed, uninfected children at participating clinical&#xD;
      sites in Latin America where the following are available: 1) antiretrovirals (ARVs) for&#xD;
      treatment of HIV-infected women and for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of&#xD;
      HIV; and 2) infant formula. We will describe the utilization of interventions related to&#xD;
      decreasing the risk of MTCT, including ARV prophylaxis, cesarean section before labor and&#xD;
      before ruptured membranes, and complete avoidance of breastfeeding. We will describe receipt&#xD;
      of maternal ARV regimens and determine rates of MTCT of HIV. This study will describe&#xD;
      maternal adverse events during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition, the study&#xD;
      will describe child outcomes potentially related to in utero and early postnatal exposure to&#xD;
      ARVs. HIV-infected women will be evaluated antepartum, intrapartum, 6 months postpartum and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years after delivery. HIV-exposed, uninfected children will&#xD;
      be evaluated for up to 5 years of follow-up.&#xD;
