      This study will collect information on the height and weight of women who participated in a&#xD;
      1998 study in Triana, Alabama, on the risk of breast cancer and benign breast disease in&#xD;
      relation to environmental exposure to the pesticide DDT and similar chemicals. This&#xD;
      additional information is needed to calculate the participants' body mass index (BMI), which&#xD;
      is required for completing analysis of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1998 study-a collaborative effort of the National Cancer Institute, the Triana Area&#xD;
      Medical Fund, and the College of Nursing at the University of Alabama at&#xD;
      Huntsville-investigated possible effects of DDT and other compounds on the risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer, predominantly among African-American women in the area of Triana, Alabama. The study&#xD;
      was initiated as a result of medical findings showing high blood levels of DDT among the&#xD;
      local population who had consumed fish from a tributary of the Tennessee River that had been&#xD;
      polluted by the discharge over several decades of large quantities of pesticides from a DDT&#xD;
      production plant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women participating in the study had a mammogram, physical examination, breast examination,&#xD;
      and blood draw, and completed a questionnaire on diet and lifestyle factors. In order to&#xD;
      complete analysis of the data and determine whether there is an association between&#xD;
      environmental exposure to DDT and related chemicals and breast cancer risk, additional&#xD;
      information on BMI is required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A DDT production plant in Alabama discharged large quantities of the pesticide into the&#xD;
      tributaries of the Tennessee River for several decades before it was discovered in the&#xD;
      1970's. A survey found that local primarily African-American, populations consuming fish from&#xD;
      the river had accumulated body burdens of the chemical that were orders of magnitude above&#xD;
      the general population. The settlement of law suits involving 1000 named plaintiffs by the&#xD;
      Federal District Court in Birmingham, AL led to the development of the Triana Area Medical&#xD;
      Fun, Inc. This fund provides 'health care and monitoring' for named plaintiffs as well as&#xD;
      other residents of Triana who, as of August 1983, had not asked the Court for damages. The&#xD;
      Board managing the activities of the Fund has given approval for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with the Triana Area Medical Fund and the&#xD;
      College of Nursing at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, is conducting a study to&#xD;
      investigate the possible effects of environmental exposures, such as the pesticide DDT and&#xD;
      other organochlorines compounds, on the risk of breast cancer. Individuals covered by the&#xD;
      Triana Area Medical Fund and other nearby residents were asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with organochlorines&#xD;
      exposures among predominatly African-American women. This project is comprised of two major&#xD;
      components (1) comparison of blood serum levels of DDT, DDE and other organochlorines&#xD;
      compounds among members of the Triana Area Medical Fund population with a high percentage of&#xD;
      mammographic densities to women without this condition and (2) methodologic investigations on&#xD;
      organochlorines retention/decay patterns within the well-characterized Triana Area Fund&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators offered mammographic screening to all women within the cohort over the age&#xD;
      of 35 (about 350), as well as others who requested it. As a service to the participants, the&#xD;
      investigators provided a standard clinical chemistry on blood samples and made the results&#xD;
      available to the subject and their physician, if they so chose. If individuals did not have a&#xD;
      regular physician, they were assisted in locating one to provide consultation and&#xD;
      interpretation of examination results. Standard blood chemistries were performed locally in&#xD;
      Alabama. The remainder of the blood sample was processed and sent to NCI for analysis and&#xD;
      storage. Serum analyses were conducted by the National Center for Environmental Health at the&#xD;
      CDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the mammography, clinical examination and blood chemistries were provided to the&#xD;
      participants in a manner agreeable to each. If the subject wished, the results were sent to&#xD;
      her private physician. They made arrangements with several local hospitals to provide&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation and therapy for women with breast diseases uncovered by mammography who&#xD;
      lacked health insurance. Nurse practitioners or physicians involved in the study were&#xD;
      available to discuss and explain results. For women who required additional diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluation or therapy, they developed a follow back procedure to make sure appropriate&#xD;
      actions are being taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is complete. Two hundred twenty eight women received mammograms, a physical&#xD;
      examination, provided a serum sample (50 ml) and completed a questionnaire on diet and&#xD;
      lifestyle factors. During the past year the investigators obtained information on height and&#xD;
      weight, which is necessary to calculate body mass indices. Analyses of the data are underway&#xD;
      and manuscripts are being developed.&#xD;
