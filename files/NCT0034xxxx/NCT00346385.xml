      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as BB-10901, can block tumor growth in different ways.&#xD;
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help&#xD;
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BB-10901 in&#xD;
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of BB-10901&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive BB-10901 IV over 40 minutes once daily on days 1-3.* Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients who do not tolerate 3 consecutive daily infusions of BB-10901 may receive&#xD;
      infusions of BB-10901 on 3 alternate days, upon approval by the investigator and/or the&#xD;
      independent Safety Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of BB-10901 until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4-6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity in course 1. Up to 40 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for short term and long term&#xD;
      follow up and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued to this study.&#xD;
