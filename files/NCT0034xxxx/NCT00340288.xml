  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyomas, commonly called fibroids, are a major health concern for women of&#xD;
      reproductive age. The objectives of the study described herein are to investigate the growth&#xD;
      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas in a clinically relevant population of women. We will test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that uterine leiomyomas are heterogeneous in terms of their growth characteristics&#xD;
      and in their clinical symptoms or outcomes, and that differences in leiomyoma growth dynamics&#xD;
      can be discriminated by molecular markers and cellular phenotypes. Participants will include&#xD;
      300 premenopausal women (greater than 18 years old) with at least one uterine leiomyoma. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for patient enrollment is confirmed diagnosis of leiomyoma by ultrasound.&#xD;
      At least one leiomyoma must be equal to or greater than 2 cm in diameter and the uterus must&#xD;
      be enlarged to the size typical during the eigth week of pregnancy. After enrollment and&#xD;
      informed consent, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans will be conducted&#xD;
      beginning at the first visit and then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Each patient will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, provide urine and blood samples at each MRI visit, and respond to an initial&#xD;
      extensive telephone-administered questionnaire followed by abbreviated monthly questionnaire&#xD;
      updates. A number of the enrolled women will require surgical intervention&#xD;
      (hysterectomy/myomectomy) as standard care. If surgery is an outcome for women enrolled in&#xD;
      the study, MRI will be conducted before surgery and the surgical pathologist will map uterine&#xD;
      leiomyomas for comparison to MRI. Leiomyoma samples will be analyzed for histopathological&#xD;
      and molecular changes correlated with growth. Because hysterectomy and myomectomy are common&#xD;
      outcomes in women with leiomyomas, we anticipate tissue will be available from at least 100&#xD;
      of the 300 women in the study. For those women who opt for surgery, we will also administer a&#xD;
      brief (less than 5 minute) questionnaire clarifying their reason for electing surgery. Upon&#xD;
      completion of data collection, we will be able to compare leiomyoma growth as a function of&#xD;
      multiplicity and location; examine the relationship between leiomyoma growth and clinical&#xD;
      symptoms or outcome; identify molecular, cellular, and pathological characteristics of&#xD;
      leiomyomas with differing growth dynamics; and examine endocrinological parameters and&#xD;
      lifestyle factors related to differential growth dynamics of uterine leiomyomas. The data may&#xD;
      be used to establish a clinical severity scale and establish diagnostic markers currently not&#xD;
      available for uterine leiomyomas.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women included in the study must be at least 18 years if age, premenopausal, speak English,&#xD;
        and have one or more uterine leiomyomas at least 2 cm in diameter and the utuerus must be&#xD;
        enlarged to the size typical during the 8th week of pregnancy. Note that while the&#xD;
        selcetion criteia are set to recruit women in which surgical intervention is a likely&#xD;
        outcome, surgery is not a requirement for study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be excluded if they are pregnant because of potential safety concerns associated&#xD;
        with imaging and image contrast enhancements. If women become pregnant during the study,&#xD;
        they wil have the option to stay in the study, but will have pelvic ultrasound scans in&#xD;
        place of MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are taking or likely to start taking GnRH therapy will be excluded because this&#xD;
        therapy, which is used as a treatment method for leiomyomas, sometmes induces their&#xD;
        regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are greater than 52 inches in circumference or greater than 350 pounds will be&#xD;
        excluded because they will be too large to fit in the imaging equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women that have an intra-uterine device (IUD) will be excluded because these metal devices&#xD;
        create 'shadowing' in MR images, making accurate measurement and interpretation of&#xD;
        leiomyomas in the MRIs difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women are not excluded if they had a prior myomectomy, or if they are taking oral&#xD;
        contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion of only women of premenopausal age (greater than 18 years old) in this study&#xD;
        is dictated by the nature of the condition.&#xD;
