  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine the extent of genetic damage in oral mucosal lesions ascertained&#xD;
      in the study, whether specific genotypes are associated with genetic damage observed in the&#xD;
      oral mucosal lesions, whether the extent of genetic damage changes over time, and what&#xD;
      factors (e.g. smoking) contribute to those changes. Genetic damage indicators will include&#xD;
      among others DNA adduct formation, particularly related to tobacco smoke carcinogens such as&#xD;
      polycyclic aromatic hydocarbons. The genotypes of interest will be focused on these affecting&#xD;
      carcinogen metabolism, (e.g., (CYP family), but may also include those related to growth&#xD;
      factors, cell cycle control, and DNA repair. Microsatellite instability is another key&#xD;
      indicator of damage that we plan to examine. This study was undertaken due to the paucity of&#xD;
      data on the types of oral lesions seen in general dental practice and the limited knowledge&#xD;
      of the natural history of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons were enrolled who had red and/or white oral lesions identified at 6 Dental Clinics at&#xD;
      VA Medical Centers. The VA Centers involved were: Washington, DC; Atlanta, GA; Durham, NC;&#xD;
      San Francisco, CA; Danville, IL; and San Antonio, TX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a dentist found a red or white lesions in the course of routine outpatient examinations&#xD;
      and care, obvious causes such as denture frictional lesions could be ruled out, and the&#xD;
      normal standard of care for the lesion was biopsy, the patient was considered for enrollment&#xD;
      into the study. The study was described to the patient, the consent for was signed, the&#xD;
      patient received an intraoral examination to identify and characterize the oral lesions, the&#xD;
      lesions were photographed, an oral epithelial cell sample was taken from the site and from&#xD;
      the rest of the oral mucosa, and the patient was interviewed using a standard questionnaire&#xD;
      that requested information about sociodemograhic, medical, and lifestyle factors,&#xD;
      particularly tobacco and alcohol use all as part of the study protocol, and the patient&#xD;
      received a biopsy as part of normal care. The biopsy report was obtained as was a small piece&#xD;
      of the biopsy material that was not needed for patient diagnostic purposes. The subjects&#xD;
      returned every 4-6 months for reassessment of the lesion or to determine that the lesion had&#xD;
      not returned. The patients completed a questionnaire at each of these visits so that&#xD;
      lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol use could be reassessed. Also oral epithelial&#xD;
      cell scrapings were obtained at each of these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is particularly valuable because longitudinal data was collected and because the&#xD;
      data were collected over time using standard procedures.&#xD;

      This longitudinal research project is part of a long-term effort by the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research to improve&#xD;
      modalities for prevention, early detection, and treatment of oral cancers. This is a natural&#xD;
      history study designed to identify markers or early malignant transformation that potentially&#xD;
      could be used in predicting which oral soft tissues are most likely to lead to oral cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with white, red, or red/white oral mucosal lesions seen at six Veterans Affairs&#xD;
      hospitals in the United States will be selected for the study. Study subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      biopsy of all suspect oral lesions. At this baseline examination, the patient will complete a&#xD;
      consent form and a questionnaire which will obtain data on potential modifiers of the&#xD;
      relationship between histopathology and molecular marker status such as sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics, tobacco and alcohol use, and medical history. A clinician will describe and&#xD;
      photograph the lesion. In addition, the mucosa will be gently scraped to obtain buccal cells.&#xD;
      Selected data on dental and medical characteristics of study subjects will be extracted from&#xD;
      computerized VA hospital data bases. Biopsy specimens will be analyzed using&#xD;
      immunohistochemical and molecular biological approaches to describe their pathological status&#xD;
      and to assess the presence of specific molecular events. The analysis of molecular markers&#xD;
      may include tests of the presence or activity of certain molecules thought to be associated&#xD;
      with the malignant phenotype including p53-dependent growth suppressors, pRb-dependent growth&#xD;
      control factors, growth factor receptor-modulated pathways, carcinogen-metabolizing alleles&#xD;
      and functioning, and viral agents. To ensure that the best possible scientific paradigm for&#xD;
      early malignant changes is tested using this study population, decisions about which genetic&#xD;
      and immunohistological assays to conduct on the biopsy material will be made by consensus of&#xD;
      the principal and coinvestigators at the time that an adequate sample size is achieved. When&#xD;
      biological assays are complete, statistical analysis will determine associations between&#xD;
      molecular markers from the oral lesions and the lesions' histopathology and will examine how&#xD;
      environmental, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors influence these associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will then be followed longitudinally over a two-year period to ascertain&#xD;
      recurrence of lesions. These study subjects will be asked to return to the dental clinics&#xD;
      every 4 months during the first year of the study and every 6 months during the second year.&#xD;
      At each visit the patient will receive the same oral examination as at baseline. The patient&#xD;
      will be classified as having normal-appearing mucosa or an oral lesion. If a lesion is&#xD;
      present, it will be evaluated and characterized as at the baseline and then biopsied.&#xD;
      Patients not returning on schedule will be traced, contacted and asked to return for an&#xD;
      evaluation. Changes in histopathology and the relationship of these changes to changes in&#xD;
      biomarker levels will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed that if a gene or genetic change that might be useful for patients&#xD;
      with oral lesions is identified, they will be contacted to see whether they would like to&#xD;
      have information on which gene types may be associated with oral cancer risk. At that time,&#xD;
      prior to making a decision, they will be informed of the various risks and consequences of&#xD;
      obtaining such information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 14 years, development of new lesions will be identified through 2020 through medical&#xD;
      and 3 dental record review and patients vital status and cause of death will be ascertained.&#xD;
