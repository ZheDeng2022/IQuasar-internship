      This study will evaluate the safety of two experimental malaria vaccines in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and examine their immune response to them. Safety will be assessed by comparing&#xD;
      vaccine side effects in groups of volunteers who receive increasing doses of the same vaccine&#xD;
      (dose-escalating study). Immune response will be evaluated by comparing the levels of&#xD;
      antibody production with each dose. (Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins produced by&#xD;
      the immune system.) The two vaccines in this study contain different types of a malaria&#xD;
      protein called MSP1: one type is MSP142FVO and the other is MSP1423D7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria parasites are spread from person to person by mosquitoes. There are four types of&#xD;
      malaria parasites. The vaccine tested in this study is designed to work against Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum, the parasite responsible for most deaths in children due to malaria in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa. The vaccine stimulates the body to produce antibodies that prevent P.&#xD;
      falciparum from entering the person's red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this 12-month&#xD;
      study, conducted at Quintiles Phase 1 Services in Lenexa, Kansas. Candidates are screened&#xD;
      with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive three doses of the vaccine-on the first day of the study (day 0), at 1&#xD;
      month (day 28), and at 6 months (day 180) -through injection into an arm muscle. The first&#xD;
      group of subjects receives 5 micrograms of vaccine, the second group receives 20 micrograms,&#xD;
      and the third group receives 80 micrograms. All participants are observed in the clinic for&#xD;
      30 minutes after each immunization for immediate reactions to the vaccine and keep a record&#xD;
      of their temperature and of any reactions and side effects they experience for 6 days after&#xD;
      the vaccination. At various intervals throughout the study, participants undergo a brief&#xD;
      physical examination and blood tests. Women of childbearing potential have a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test on the day of each injection.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Phase 1 clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      two asexual blood stage vaccines for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, MSP1(42)-FVO/Alhydrogel&#xD;
      and MSP1(42)-3D7/Alhydrogel, in healthy adult volunteers. Between 2-3 million deaths occur&#xD;
      each year as a result of malaria. Most of these deaths are a result of P. falciparum malaria,&#xD;
      in children under five years of age, in sub-Saharan Africa. A safe and effective vaccine that&#xD;
      would reduce both morbidity and mortality secondary to P. falciparum infection would be a&#xD;
      valuable resource in the fight against this disease. The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1)&#xD;
      is the first protein to be identified on the surface of the blood stage parasite. A portion&#xD;
      of MSP1 is carried into the newly invaded erythrocyte on the surface of the parasite.&#xD;
      Clinical symptoms of malaria in humans are due to the asexual blood stage. Therefore, this&#xD;
      vaccine was designed to protect an individual from illness due to the asexual stage of P.&#xD;
      falciparum infection by inhibiting parasite invasion of erythrocytes. The MSP1(42)/Alhydrogel&#xD;
      vaccines have been used in five preclinical animal trials and no clinically significant risks&#xD;
      have been identified. The study will be conducted at Quintiles Phase I Services (Lenexa, KS).&#xD;
      We will evaluate three dose levels of both the MSP1(42)-FVO/Alhydrogel and the&#xD;
      MSP1(42)-3D7/Alhydrogel vaccines (5 micro g, 20 micro g, 80 micro g). Sixty healthy male and&#xD;
      non-pregnant female volunteers ages 18 to 50 will be enrolled. Ten volunteers in each group&#xD;
      will receive a 5 micro g, 20 micro g, or 80 mirco g dose of either MSP1(42)-FVO or&#xD;
      MSP1(42)-3D7 vaccines by intramuscular injection in an open label study on months 0, 1, and&#xD;
      6. The groups will be staggered such that adequate safety evaluation can be performed prior&#xD;
      to dose escalation. The duration of the study is 12 months per volunteer. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this trial is to determine the frequency and severity of vaccine-related adverse&#xD;
      events for each dose. The secondary objective is to determine the dose that generates the&#xD;
      highest serum antibody levels to homologous MSP1(42) antigen at Day 42.&#xD;
