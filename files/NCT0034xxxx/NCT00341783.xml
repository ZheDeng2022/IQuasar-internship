  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are about 300-500 million cases of malaria worldwide each year, with 2-3 million&#xD;
      deaths. Plasmodium falciparum, one of four types of malaria, is responsible for most of these&#xD;
      deaths. Because of increasing resistance of this parasite to drugs and of mosquitoes to&#xD;
      insecticides, a vaccine would be valuable in the fight against malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Don gu bougou, Mali, is an area of seasonal malaria transmission that is being investigated&#xD;
      as a possible suitable site for testing investigational malaria vaccines. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to characterize the population of this site in terms of common hematologic (blood)&#xD;
      and biochemistry parameters that may be used to determine eligibility for participation in&#xD;
      vaccine trials. The study will also assess the prevalence of preexisting medical conditions&#xD;
      that might affect assessments of vaccine safety and efficacy. Also, the natural immunity to&#xD;
      antigens in the investigational malaria vaccines will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Don gu bougou, Mali, was chosen because of its high malaria rates. Data will be collected at&#xD;
      four time-points. At least 50 individuals will be recruited from each of the following age&#xD;
      groups: 6 months-5 years; 6-10 years; 11-15 years; and 16-45 years. Village-wide consent will&#xD;
      be obtained and about 25 of the 111 family compounds will be randomly selected. Individual&#xD;
      consent will also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled volunteers will undergo a baseline medical history and physical examination. Blood&#xD;
      will be collected for various tests, and, for women of childbearing age, urine pregnancy&#xD;
      tests will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of three followup visits, a brief medical history and physical exam will be&#xD;
      conducted. Blood will be drawn for tests. Also, blood, urine, and/or stool tests not done at&#xD;
      baseline will be done at one of the followup visits.&#xD;

      Doneguebougou, Mali, is an area of seasonal malaria transmission that is being investigated&#xD;
      as a suitable site for testing investigational malaria vaccines. The overall goal of this&#xD;
      study is to characterize the population of this site in terms of common hematologic and&#xD;
      biochemistry parameters that may be used to determine eligibility for participation in&#xD;
      vaccine trials, as well as in terms of preexisting medical conditions and preexisting&#xD;
      immunity to potential malaria vaccine antigens, both of which might impact on the assessment&#xD;
      of vaccine safety and efficacy. The development of high quality laboratory proficiency to&#xD;
      assess these parameters in Mali will also be achieved by this study.&#xD;
