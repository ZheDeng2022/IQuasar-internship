    <textblock>
      This study will examine why some people who become infected with the leishmaniasis parasite&#xD;
      develop skin lesions and others do not. The parasite that causes leishmaniasis is transmitted&#xD;
      by the bite of a sandfly. It can cause skin lesions that may persist for several months,&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body, and become infected with bacteria. Treated with medicine,&#xD;
      leishmaniasis can be cured completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 1 year of age and older who live in the Mali villages of Kemena or Sougoula may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are injected with a small amount of inactive parasites into the skin of their&#xD;
      arm. People who have a reaction to the test, and thus have been exposed to the parasite, are&#xD;
      examined for skin lesions. Their lesions, if any, are evaluated and treated, and their&#xD;
      participation in the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not react to the skin test are examined for skin lesions every month for&#xD;
      5 months. Those who are 18 years of age or older and have mild leishmaniasis skin lesions may&#xD;
      have a small amount of fluid injected into a lesion in order to remove parasites for&#xD;
      laboratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' lesions may be photographed to compare what they look like before and after&#xD;
      treatment. Lesions are treated with an ointment containing an antibiotic and a disinfectant&#xD;
      twice a day for 20 days. The lesions are examined 1 and 3 weeks after treatment is completed&#xD;
      to see if the disease has been cured. A few months later, the skin test is repeated to&#xD;
      determine whether the person has been exposed to parasites over the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample may be drawn from some participants, depending on whether they have a reaction&#xD;
      to the second skin test and whether they have developed skin lesions. The sample is drawn&#xD;
      only from patients 18-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some blood drawn for the study may be used for genetic tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the research program is to develop a vaccine against cutaneous&#xD;
      leishmaniasis (CL) based on sandfly salivary proteins (SFSPs). In order to determine whether&#xD;
      vaccination with SFSPs can reduce the subsequent incidence of Leishmania major infections or&#xD;
      CL in humans, it is first necessary to establish baseline rates of parasite infection and&#xD;
      disease. We have selected two rural villages in central Mali where we have readily observed&#xD;
      CL lesions in individuals of all ages and large numbers of sandflies that are known to&#xD;
      transmit L. major in West Africa. The main objectives of this study are to estimate a&#xD;
      cross-sectional prevalence of L. major exposure; to determine the prevalence of CL; to&#xD;
      determine an annual incidence rate of L. major infection; and to determine whether robust in&#xD;
      vitro T and B cell responses to SFSPs correlate with protection against newly acquired L.&#xD;
      major infection or CL. To meet these objectives, a standard leishmanin skin test (LST) will&#xD;
      be administered to all residents of two Malian villages in order to identify a cohort of&#xD;
      subjects who are at risk for newly acquired L. major. After the sandfly biting and disease&#xD;
      transmission seasons, all subjects will be examined for the development of CL lesions every&#xD;
      month for 5 months total. CL lesions will be treated topically with paromomycin-&#xD;
      methylbenzethonium chloride ointment twice daily for 20 days. Response to therapy will be&#xD;
      documented on days 28 and 42 of the protocol. After allowing adequate time for the&#xD;
      development of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to parasite antigens, LSTs will be&#xD;
      re-administered to all subjects. Conversion from a negative to positive LST will be taken as&#xD;
      evidence of newly acquired L. major infection. LST conversion data and clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      CL lesions will allow us to calculate both the incidence of new L. major infections and CL in&#xD;
      our study population. In vitro T and B cell responses to SFSPs will be measured from a subset&#xD;
      of individuals and correlated with relative resistance to both L. major infection and the&#xD;
      development of clinically apparent lesions.&#xD;
