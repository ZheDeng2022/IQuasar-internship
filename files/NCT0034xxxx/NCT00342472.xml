      The overall goal of this project is to determine whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons&#xD;
      (PAHs) are contributing to the high rate of esophageal cancer in Linxian, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most fatal cancers worldwide with Linxian, China having one&#xD;
      of the highest rates in the world. In the United States esophageal cancer causes&#xD;
      approximately 10,000 deaths each year. It is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in&#xD;
      black males and the eighth leading cause of cancer death in men of all races. Although&#xD;
      several recent studies have identified some of the molecular changes associated with&#xD;
      esophageal cancer, its prevention and treatment within high risk groups continues to be&#xD;
      limited by our inability to identify specific etiologic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human exposure to PAHs, including benzo [a]pyrene (B[a]P), is associated with an increased&#xD;
      rate of skin, lung, and upper GI tumors and also with an increased mortality from causes&#xD;
      related to atherosclerosis. Evidence, including the preliminary results from histologic and&#xD;
      food analysis pilot studies, supports the idea that this region's high rate of esophageal&#xD;
      cancer may be related to long-term, high-level exposure to PAHs via inhalation of air-borne&#xD;
      pollution and ingestion of food cooked with soft coal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, to assess the association of PAHs with the high rate of esophageal cancer in Linxian,&#xD;
      China, we plan to analyze samples of food for the presence of PAHs, samples of blood for Hb&#xD;
      adducts (a marker of long-term PAH exposure), samples of urine for 1-OH-Pyrene glucuronide (a&#xD;
      maker of short-term PAH exposure), and samples of coal for characteristics that may be&#xD;
      associated with increased carcinogenesis. We will also administer environmental&#xD;
      questionnaires that will include questions about the type of fuel used for cooking and&#xD;
      heating, the location and type of stove and/or heating unit (i.e., vented versus unvented),&#xD;
      and time spent cooking.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project is to determine whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (P&#xD;
      AHs) or acetaldehyde are contributing to the high rate of esophageal cancer in Linxian,&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most fatal cancers worldwide and Linxian, China has some of&#xD;
      the highest rates of this cancer in the world. In the United States esophageal cancer causes&#xD;
      approximately 14,000 deaths each year. It is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in&#xD;
      black males and the eighth leading cause of cancer death in men of all races. The prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of esophageal cancer within high risk groups continues to be limited by our&#xD;
      inability to identify specific etiologic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human exposure to PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene (B [a]P) is associated with increased rates&#xD;
      of skin, lung, esophageal and gastric tumors and also with an increased mortality from causes&#xD;
      related to atherosclerosis. Preliminary results from histologic and food analysis pilot&#xD;
      studies supports the possibility that the high rates of esophageal cancer in Linxian may be&#xD;
      related to long-term, high level exposure to PAHs via inhalation of air-borne pollution and&#xD;
      ingestion of food cooked with soft coal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to acetaldehyde could also be an etiologically significant exposure in Linxian.&#xD;
      Acetaldehyde is a carcinogenic metabolite, and small quantities of ethanol where recently&#xD;
      found in homogenized Linxian food samples. The Salaspuro laboratory at the University of&#xD;
      Helsinki has demonstrated that oral bacteria can produce acetaldehyde from food containing&#xD;
      similar small concentrations of ethanol, so such acetaldehyde exposure could be etiologically&#xD;
      significant in Linxian. Genetic polymorphisms, particularly those involving alcohol and&#xD;
      acetaldehyde dehydrogenases, may also influence the effect of this exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the association of PAHs and acetaldehyde with the high rate of esophageal cancer in&#xD;
      Linxian, China, we plant o analyze samples of food for the presence of PAHs, ethanol and&#xD;
      acetaldehyde, samples of blood for Hb and DNA adducts( markers of long-term PAH or&#xD;
      acetaldehyde exposure), samples of urine for 1-OH-Pyrene glucuronide (a marker of short term&#xD;
      PAH exposure) samples of saliva for acetaldehyde and samples of coal for characteristics that&#xD;
      may be associated with increased carcinogenesis. We will also administer environmental&#xD;
      questionnaires that will include questions about the type of fuel used for cooking and&#xD;
      heating, the location and types of stove and/or heating units, and the time spent cooking.&#xD;
