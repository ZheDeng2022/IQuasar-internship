  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody. It works by attaching to a protein called epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor found on normal and cancer cells. When panitumumab attaches, it blocks&#xD;
      another protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF) from attaching to the cell. This is&#xD;
      important because, when EGF is blocked, a cell's growth slows down or stops. Panitumumab may&#xD;
      also help radiation therapy work. Also because panitumumab is a fully-human antibody, it may&#xD;
      be less toxic than other monoclonal antibodies made to block the EGF receptor. Chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin, works to kill cancer cells directly. Capecitabine given&#xD;
      during radiation helps radiation therapy work better. This study is being done to learn how&#xD;
      rectal cancer tumors that are not removed surgically respond to treatment with panitumumab&#xD;
      and chemotherapy given before radiation therapy begins followed by treatment with panitumumab&#xD;
      and capecitabine given with radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancers express EGF and/or EGFR mRNA in 66% of primary tumors, 44% of adjacent&#xD;
      mucosa, and up to 62% of positive lymph nodes. Patients enrolled in NSABP FR-1 will begin&#xD;
      therapy with the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab--which has shown single-agent activity in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients--in combination with CAPOX, an effective treatment for patients&#xD;
      with advanced colorectal cancer, with the convenience of using an oral fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      (capecitabine.) The intent with this first phase is to expose distant metastases to the&#xD;
      agents early and to shrink the tumor before giving radiation therapy. After chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiotherapy with capecitabine and panitumumab will be given to destroy the primary tumor.&#xD;
      Panitumumab is added to the radiochemotherapy regimen because data showed positive results&#xD;
      when another anti-EGFR antibody was added to radiotherapy in patients with head and neck&#xD;
      cancer. This approach aims to improve neoadjuvant combined modality therapy for rectal&#xD;
      cancer; it should provide effective therapy for eligible patients and valuable information&#xD;
      about clinical tumor response rates and treatment tolerability, which, if favorable, may be&#xD;
      used to develop future Phase III trials.&#xD;
