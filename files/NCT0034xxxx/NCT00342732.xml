  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity in the United States has reached alarming proportions with 33% of&#xD;
      adults over the age of 20 being overweight. Obesity is more than twice as prevalent, however,&#xD;
      in the Pima Indians of Arizona. Although there have been a number of advances in our&#xD;
      understanding of the genetics of obesity, the environmental influences on the genetic&#xD;
      expression of obesity requires further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to understand some of the influences on the high prevalence of obesity in the&#xD;
      Pima Indians, the present study was designed to investigate eating behaviors and food&#xD;
      preferences, most especially the preference for high fat foods, in sib-pairs of Pima Indians&#xD;
      who have been previously genotyped in our genomic scan for loci linked to diabetes/obesity.&#xD;
      Most specifically, we will utilize several questionnaires and methods of assessing eating&#xD;
      behavior and the preference for high fat foods to create a food intake phenotype. In&#xD;
      addition, we will study Caucasians so that comparisons can be made between these two groups.&#xD;
      We will make these evaluations by assessing eating behavior, food preferences including usual&#xD;
      fat intake and preferences for high fat foods, body image perceptions, and energy&#xD;
      expenditure. It is hoped that the data gathered from this study will elucidate some of the&#xD;
      risk factors for the development of obesity among the Pima Indians.&#xD;

      The prevalence of obesity in the United States has reached alarming proportions with 33% of&#xD;
      adults over the age of 20 being overweight. In some populations, obesity is even more&#xD;
      prevalent. Although there have been a number of advances in our understanding of the genetics&#xD;
      of obesity, the environmental influences on the genetic expression of obesity requires&#xD;
      further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to understand some of the influences on the high prevalence of obesity, the&#xD;
      present study was designed to investigate what drives how much people eat. More specifically,&#xD;
      we will try to understand what drives food intake utilizing 1) questionnaires that assess&#xD;
      eating behavior, 2) measurements in blood, urine or fat tissue, and 3) genotypic associations&#xD;
      to investigate the various factors that control what and how much people eat. We will make&#xD;
      these evaluations by assessing eating behavior, food preferences including usual fat intake&#xD;
      and preferences for high fat foods, body image perceptions, and energy expenditure. It is&#xD;
      hoped that the data gathered from this study will elucidate some of the risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of obesity.&#xD;

&#xD;
             8. Use of medications affecting metabolism and appetite&#xD;

        diagnosis of contraindications following admission, and development of illness/infection&#xD;

        withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
