  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of NeuroVision NVC vision correction technology to improve the&#xD;
      vision of subjects with Low and Moderate Myopia in Asian eyes in Singapore&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NeuroVision has developed a novel vision correction technology, which is a scientifically&#xD;
      based treatment to improve vision based on new principles of visual psychophysics.&#xD;
      NeuroVision NVC Vision Correction Technology is a non-invasive, patient-specific treatment&#xD;
      based on visual stimulation and facilitation of neural connections responsible for vision.&#xD;
      The treatment involves a programmed series of interactive visual exercises in front of a&#xD;
      computer, and does not involve any form of prescription medications, or surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology has been proven in both Israel and Singapore's pilot study to work for myopia&#xD;
      -1.50D and below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a clinical trial for Singapore Ministry of Defence personnel to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of this treatment beyond the proven myopia range. There will be 2 phases in the&#xD;
      study; Phase 1 will include low myopes from -0.50D to -1.50D while Phase 2 covers moderate&#xD;
      myopes from -1.75D to -3.00D. Subjects will be randomised into treatment and placebo group in&#xD;
      the ratio of 3:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized double masked controlled trial conducted in 2 Phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will involve 140 study subjects with low myopia randomized in a 3:1 randomization to&#xD;
      receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that the withdrawal rate will not exceed 20%, so that at least 112 study&#xD;
      subjects will complete the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis with stopping rule will be conducted after 3/4 of the patients complete the&#xD;
      treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will involve 180 study subjects with moderate myopia randomized in a 3:1&#xD;
      randomization to receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 phases will be separate RCTs, with recruitment of Phase II subjects subsequent to&#xD;
      completion of Phase I NVC treatments.&#xD;
