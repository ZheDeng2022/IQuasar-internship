  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research and development in genetic testing for cancer susceptibility genes has advanced&#xD;
      rapidly in recent years, allowing healthy individuals, cancer patients, and their families to&#xD;
      determine if they carry mutations which increase their risk of breast, ovarian, prostate,&#xD;
      colon, and other cancers. Initial efforts have unfolded primarily in academic medical centers&#xD;
      targeting families at high risk for cancer. There is currently no information available for&#xD;
      assessing the prevalence of genetic testing for cancer susceptibility genes at the national&#xD;
      level, or for evaluating the knowledge of and attitudes toward such testing among primary&#xD;
      care physicians. The objectives of this survey are to determine the utilization of genetic&#xD;
      tests by physicians at the national level; to ascertain physician knowledge of available&#xD;
      genetic tests for specific cancer susceptibility genes, to examine physicians' general&#xD;
      attitudes toward testing, and; to explore possible variation in utilization and&#xD;
      knowledge/attitudes by medical specialty, type of practice, year of training completion,&#xD;
      board status, urbanicity, and geographic region. The primary research question that this&#xD;
      survey will address is what is the prevalence of use of genetic testing for cancer&#xD;
      susceptibility among primary care physicians in the U.S.? The survey will also assess whether&#xD;
      there are statistically significant differences in 1) self-reported knowledge, current use&#xD;
      of, and future intentions to use genetic testing for cancer susceptibility, and 2)&#xD;
      perceptions of barriers to testing, among primary care physicians by their type and location&#xD;
      of practice, and recency of training. Primary care physicians (internists,&#xD;
      obstetrician/gynecologist, family and general practitioners) will also be compared with&#xD;
      specialty groups (gastroenterologists, surgeons, urologists) and oncologists with respect to&#xD;
      their use, attitudes towards, and knowledge of, genetic testing for cancer susceptibility. A&#xD;
      questionnaire is being administered by mail, telephone, facsimilie or Internet to a&#xD;
      nationally representative sample of 2,100 physicians. Responding physicians select their&#xD;
      preferred response mode. Study participants are primary care and specialty physicians with&#xD;
      active licenses to practice medicine in the U.S. A data file with personal identifiers&#xD;
      deleted will be prepared for statistical analysis to estimate the prevalence and determine&#xD;
      predictors of use and intentions to genetic tests for inherited cancer susceptibility.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All physicians in the U.S. commonly considered to be adult primary care practitioners:&#xD;
        family practitioners, general practitioners, general internists, and&#xD;
        obstretrician/gynecologists (excluding physicians who practice only obstetrics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For comparison purposes, physicians in the specialties of oncology, general surgery,&#xD;
        gastroenterology and urology will also be included since they treat cancer patients and&#xD;
        individuals at high risk for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Physicians who are retired and/or do not hold active licenses, involved in full-time&#xD;
        teaching, research or administration and not clinical practice, and physicians in training&#xD;
        who are not yet board-eligible for their specialty re excluded from selection for the&#xD;
        survey.&#xD;
