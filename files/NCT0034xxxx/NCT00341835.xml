    <textblock>
      This study will search for genes that greatly increase the risk of developing lung cancer in&#xD;
      conjunction with cigarette smoking or other environmental agents, or both. Lung cancer is the&#xD;
      second most common cancer diagnosed among men and women and the leading cause of cancer death&#xD;
      in the United States. It has been frequently given as an example of cancer determined only by&#xD;
      the environment, certain occupations, and dietary habits. Yet researchers have long had a&#xD;
      hypothesis that people vary in their risk of becoming affected when exposed to these factors.&#xD;
      Also, some evidence has shown that lung cancer in families may be due to the combined effects&#xD;
      of inheritance of a major gene and cigarette smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who have a confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family history of lung cancer&#xD;
      may be eligible to enroll their families in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members will be asked to do one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a questionnaire about personal medical history, lifestyle, and diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have blood drawn from a vein in the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a family member has had a biopsy or is scheduled for one, give permission to obtain&#xD;
           medical records and a portion of the stored tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If any relatives have died of cancer, sign a release form to allow researchers to get&#xD;
           copies of medical and pathology records, and tissue samples from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the family members agree, they may be recontacted to answer questions about their health&#xD;
      and those of their family, during an annual telephone conversation. Follow-up questionnaires&#xD;
      may be sent to participants, to determine if any new cancers have developed in the family. In&#xD;
      the event of a new cancer, the classification of the family may change from the low-risk to&#xD;
      intermediate risk-level and from the intermediate-risk to high-risk level. Follow-up will&#xD;
      continue, to get information about tumors and death. Also, a newsletter for lung cancer&#xD;
      families will occasionally be distributed to participants. In the future, the Internet will&#xD;
      also provide information for families.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, and represents a significant&#xD;
      burden on health care resources. Accumulated evidence suggests that there are genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility components in lung cancer, and that gene-environment interactions are&#xD;
      important. While major breakthroughs have been made in understanding the genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility basis of other cancers, studies to identify specific major loci affection lung&#xD;
      cancer risk are notably lacking. The high case fatality rate (14 percent 5-year survival&#xD;
      rate) and low resection rate (25 percent) makes the study of lung cancer families&#xD;
      particularly challenging because it is difficult to collect adequate numbers of biospecimens&#xD;
      for DNA analysis. Only a collaborative effort to identify, accrue, and genotype familial lung&#xD;
      cancer (FLC) families will be successful in characterizing the genetic basis of familial lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is part of a multi-center, multi-investigator, interdisciplinary team highly&#xD;
      experienced in genetic epidemiology, gene mapping, lung biology, and cancer molecular&#xD;
      genetics, known as the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC) formed to&#xD;
      identify a lung cancer susceptibility gene(s) and to estimate gene-environment interaction in&#xD;
      the etiology of this neoplasm in order to elucidate a strategy for the prevention, control&#xD;
      and clinical management of this disease through identification of genetically high-risk&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of a genetic predisposition for lung cancer may be possible by using linkage&#xD;
      analysis to localize the putative susceptibility gene to a specific chromosomal region. The&#xD;
      strength of linkage analysis is dependent upon the recruitment of multiple large kindreds for&#xD;
      which tissue samples are available and the history of tumor incidence exists for two,&#xD;
      preferably more, generations. Our strategy is to combine the most informative pedigrees but&#xD;
      preferably eventually up to 500 pedigrees. This strategy yields a substantial increase in&#xD;
      power and cost-effectiveness over the usual strategy of each site working independently and&#xD;
      genotyping many marginally informative families. To date this strategy appears successful, in&#xD;
      that results from our first 52 genotyped families resulted in significant evidence in favor&#xD;
      of linkage to a region on chromosome 6q and suggestive evidence for several other regions. We&#xD;
      believe that ongoing data collection and analysis of these preliminary results will also be&#xD;
      fruitful. Recently, the National Cancer Institute funded this ongoing project in a&#xD;
      competitive renewal (5 years) of our multi-center R01 that supports data collection and work&#xD;
      at all sites besides NHGRI and NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection is under the direction of each P.I. at the data collection sites and&#xD;
      funded by their respective grants and contracts. NHGRI investigators do not have any contact&#xD;
      with study subjects and no NHGRI employees receive any funds from these grants. Because this&#xD;
      disorder is complex and has a high likelihood of being caused by multiple loci, multiple&#xD;
      parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis will be employed. Heterogeneity will be&#xD;
      taken into account during these analyses, as will environmental covariates, such as the&#xD;
      effect of smoking. Only statistical analyses are performed at the NHGRI site, but laboratory&#xD;
      work ranging from genotyping, sequencing, array CGH, model organism experiments and other&#xD;
      methods occurs at other sites as part of this collaboration.&#xD;

        These are coded samples and data that were previously collected at multiple clinical data&#xD;
        collection sites. They were mainly identified through a clinical site that diagnosed one&#xD;
        family member with lung cancer and then offered enrollment in this study because of&#xD;
        additional family history of disease. No study participants are enrolled at the NIH.@@@&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All individuals with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family of&#xD;
        lung cancer are eligible to enroll their family in the study. Five major histologic types&#xD;
        of lung cancer, i.e., adenocardinoma, squamous cell, small cell, large cell, and&#xD;
        unspecified nonsmall cell carcinoma will be included. In addition to lung cancer patients,&#xD;
        LSU will also contact patients newly diagnosed with bronchus or tracheal cancer in target&#xD;
        hospital areas to request their enrollment in their study. In addition, several sites&#xD;
        including LSU, Mayo Clinic and Karmanos Cancer Institute also collect DNA samples from&#xD;
        unaffected, geographically and ethnically matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the purposes of this study, an eligible family must meet the minimum criteria for&#xD;
        familial lung cancer: at least 2 first-degree relatives in the family have had lung cancer.&#xD;
        Priority will be given to more highly loaded pedigrees and to families in which the&#xD;
        affected persons had onset of the disease at an early age (less than 50 years). Lung cancer&#xD;
        cases may be living or deceased. Relatives with lung cancer are defined as first- o&#xD;
        second-degree relatives or cousins of index cases will be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
        study because their familial relationships might provide useful linkage information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult participants must be physically able to tolerate removal of 25 to 40 ml of blood, or&#xD;
        buccal brush sampling of their cheek. Children above 5 years old must be able to physically&#xD;
        tolerate an amount of blood drawn that is equal to 4ml/kg of their weight. Adults must be&#xD;
        willing to complete a self-administered environmental exposure questionnaire, and all&#xD;
        participants must be able to consent to the study procedures (or have appropriate&#xD;
        assent/parental consent). Biological specimens, including blood samples, archived tumor&#xD;
        blocks and other medical records will be obtained from patients treated at the various&#xD;
        hospitals and collection sites and from individuals with strong family history of lung&#xD;
        cancer (either affected or unaffected) who have either been self-referred or physician&#xD;
        referred to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded from the study are families or individuals within the family who do not meet the&#xD;
        minimum criteria described above. Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be&#xD;
        excluded, and families for whom all necessary members do not sign the Consent Form may be&#xD;
        excluded. MAYO also excludes patients who (1) do not speak English, (2) are non-US citizens&#xD;
        or residents and (3) are diagnosed with an uncommon tumor type that is not among the above&#xD;
        specified types (e.g.) mixed cell or unspecified non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoids,&#xD;
        sarcomas and lymphomas of the lung and bronchus). This is done at MAYO because the family&#xD;
        study is piggy-backed onto a case-control study. No fetuses, prisoners or institutionalized&#xD;
        individuals will be enrolled. While this study does not target pregnant women, because&#xD;
        contact with many of the families will be by mail we will not be able to exclude pregnant&#xD;
        women. Additionally, the participant's own physician or health care clinic will draw blood&#xD;
        samples from long-distance participants and therefore can determine if there is any risk to&#xD;
        the woman or her fetus. UMHS also excludes children as research participants in their site.&#xD;
