  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases may involve nearly any organ and are characterized by abnormal activation&#xD;
      or response of certain cells. Evidence suggests that farm work, exposure to silica from&#xD;
      farming activities and exposure to pesticides may contribute to the development of autoimmune&#xD;
      disease. Associations between autoimmune diseases and farming, however, have not been&#xD;
      extensively investigated, and exposure data in the currently available studies are extremely&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major challenges in conducting population-based research on autoimmune diseases is&#xD;
      case ascertainment. Self-report of previous diagnosis has proven to be unreliable. This&#xD;
      protocol outlines a strategy to confirm self-reported diagnoses of systemic autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Sjogren&#xD;
      syndrome) within the Agricultural Health Study group (AHS; a group of licensed pesticide&#xD;
      applicators and spouses who completed a questionnaire). The confirmed cases will constitute a&#xD;
      refined case group to allow analyses of pesticides and other farming-related exposures as&#xD;
      possible risk factors for these diseases using data that have already been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be selected from participants in the AHS who reported one of the diseases being&#xD;
      studied. A short telephone interview will be conducted with participants, who will be&#xD;
      requested to provide written consent for review of information from medical records. To&#xD;
      confirm the self-diagnosis, participants' physicians will be contacted. Specific information&#xD;
      will be requested in the form of a checklist. Responses will be reviewed for evidence of&#xD;
      diagnosis and classified as confirmed, probable, physician-diagnosed, or unconfirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the correct interpretation of conflicting self-reports that are provided at two&#xD;
           different times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the usefulness of specific questions that could potentially be used in future&#xD;
           studies to validate self-reported cases of rheumatoid arthritis in men.&#xD;

      Farming-related exposures (including pesticides and silica) may contribute to the etiology of&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. However, associations between autoimmune diseases and farming have not&#xD;
      been extensively investigated, and exposure data in the currently available studies is&#xD;
      extremely limited. One of the major challenges in conducting population-based research on&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases is case ascertainment. Self-report of previous diagnosis has been shown&#xD;
      to be very unreliable. This protocol outlines a strategy to confirm self-reported diagnoses&#xD;
      of systemic autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
      scleroderma, and Sjogren syndrome) within the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort. The&#xD;
      confirmed cases will constitute a refined case group to allow etiologic analyses of&#xD;
      pesticides and other farming-related exposures as possible risk factors for these diseases&#xD;
      using data that have already been collected. The codes can also be used in a nested&#xD;
      case-control study that could be designed to collect additional exposure data (for example,&#xD;
      on silica-related exposures).&#xD;
