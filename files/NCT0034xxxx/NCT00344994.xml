  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the equipotent dose of ropinirole and pramipexole&#xD;
      for patients switched from pramipexole to ropinirole in patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The rationale behind Switch is that patients with&#xD;
      Restless Legs Syndrome can maintain stable efficacy and tolerability if correctly switched&#xD;
      from one dopamine agonist to an equipotent dose of another.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Dopamine agonists such as ropinirole (Requip) and pramipexole (Mirapex) are&#xD;
      effective treatments for Restless Legs Syndrome and Parkinson Disease. However, although the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy may be established, it is common for clinicians to switch between&#xD;
      therapies in order to seek optimal symptomatic relief for their patients. The best strategy&#xD;
      for switching from other dopamine agonists to Requip is currently undetermined. Currently,&#xD;
      ropinirole is the only medication indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe RLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will have an individual response to each dopamine agonist. Usually patients are&#xD;
      switched from one dopamine agonist to another due to the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of response or loss of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictable and dose-related side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ergot-associated adverse events (pulmonary fibrosis, cardiac valvulopathy, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep events (sudden onset of sleep)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of clinical data makes it difficult to recommend switching guidelines that are&#xD;
      suitable for all patients. It is therefore recommended that the switching regimen be based on&#xD;
      clinical judgment with individualization for each patient. Switching from one dopamine&#xD;
      agonist to another is dependent upon a number of factors including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The currently prescribed dopamine agonist&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The dose of the current dopamine agonist&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether dopamine agonist is being administered as monotherapy or as adjunct therapy to&#xD;
           L-dopa&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Individual patient response to both the current agonist and to the other dopamine&#xD;
           agonist (efficacy and tolerability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Stage of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      In placebo-controlled, clinical trials for Requip, a protocol for switching patients to&#xD;
      Requip was not utilized. Patients were generally required to discontinue previous dopamine&#xD;
      agonist medications at least two weeks prior to baseline evaluation. Patients already on&#xD;
      dopamine agonists were discontinued according to the practices of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of switching that have been studied previously include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Withdrawal of the current dopamine agonist according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
           recommendations followed by initiation of the other dopamine agonist based upon the&#xD;
           manufacturer's recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An overnight switch with abrupt cessation of the current dopamine agonist followed by&#xD;
           initiation of an estimated equivalent dose of the other dopamine agonist&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gradual withdrawal of the current dopamine agonist with simultaneous upward titration of&#xD;
           the other dopamine agonist&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           SWITCH is a principal investigator-initiated, open-label study that is being conducted&#xD;
           at two sites, to include the Medical College of Georgia and the VA Medical Center&#xD;
           (VAMC). A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled at MCG/VAMC. Individuals who choose to&#xD;
           participate will have approximately three to four study visits over a four week time&#xD;
           period. Patients with moderate to severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome will be included&#xD;
           in the study. All RLS medications will be at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
           enrollment. Patients will be switched overnight at the Baseline Visit at a ratio of&#xD;
           either 1:4 or 1:6 Mirapex (pramipexole) to Requip (ropinirole) per Conversion Table 1&#xD;
           below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 1: Conversion Table&#xD;

&#xD;
           0.75mg------------------4mg (1X4mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the baseline study visit, a signed and dated consent will first be obtained from the&#xD;
           subject. In addition, inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed before the start of&#xD;
           any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the course of the study, some or all of the following procedures will be&#xD;
           performed, when patients come to the clinic for their study visit (Table 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health and Medication Review: Ask patients to answer questions about their health,&#xD;
                medical history, and their medications. (All visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mini-Mental State Examination: Patients will be asked a series of questions to&#xD;
                determine their mental status. (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CGI-S/CGI-I: (Visits 1, 2, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IRLS: (Visits 1, 2, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale: (Visits 1, 2, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ECG: An &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; is a test that measures the electrical&#xD;
                activity of the heart. (Visits 1, 2, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood Tests: The study staff will draw about 3 tablespoons. The study doctor will&#xD;
                use this blood for Hematology and Chemistry panel laboratory tests. (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnancy Tests: If the patient is female and can have children, their blood (about&#xD;
                one extra tablespoon will be needed to perform this test) will be tested to see if&#xD;
                they are pregnant. Patients will be told if the test results are positive. The&#xD;
                results of the test must be negative in order for the patient to be in the study.&#xD;
                (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neurological and Physical Exam: The study doctor will perform both a neurological&#xD;
                and a physical exam. (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Brief Physical Exam (Visits 2 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concomitant Medication Review (All visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood Pressure, Pulse (Visits 1, 2, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Height (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study Drug: Give patients a supply of study drug and tell them how to take it.&#xD;
                Patients will be asked to bring back all unused study drug to each visit. (Visits&#xD;
                1, 2, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drug Compliance (Visits 2, 3, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse Event Review (Visits 2, 3, and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Telephone Contact: The study doctor or study staff will call the patient to check&#xD;
                on his/her health and see how he/she is handling the study drug. If the study&#xD;
                doctor decides that the patient is doing well on the medication, Visit 3 could only&#xD;
                consist of a telephone contact to include a review of concomitant medications,&#xD;
                adverse events, and drug compliance. If the patient is experiencing breakthrough&#xD;
                symptoms, a clinic visit will be required for Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All study visits will take approximately two (2) hours and the telephone contact should&#xD;
           take no longer than thirty (30) minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Patients will see both the study coordinator and an investigator at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of study treatment, subjects will be given treatment options; subjects will&#xD;
           have the option of continuing on ropinirole or returning to the use of pramipexole.&#xD;
           Subjects will then return to the care of their primary care physician/neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           USE OF HUMAN SUBJECTS and/or HUMAN DERIVED MATERIALS&#xD;
&#xD;
           SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS Patients with moderate to severe Restless Legs Syndrome that are&#xD;
           currently taking a stable dose of Pramipexole will be approached during their visit to&#xD;
           the MCG Movement Disorders Clinic and the VA Neurology Clinic and asked to participate&#xD;
           in SWITCH. If it becomes necessary to recruit from outside of MCG/VAMC, all&#xD;
           advertisement materials will be submitted to the HAC for approval prior to use. SWITCH&#xD;
           is a double site study. We plan to enroll a total of 25-30 individuals between the two&#xD;
           sites. Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled at MCG/VAMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MANAGING SIDE EFFECTS As with all drugs, the possibility of unforeseeable risks and side&#xD;
           effects exist. The patients will be told of any important new information that might&#xD;
           affect their decision to continue in the study in a timely manner. Their Restless Legs&#xD;
           Syndrome may not improve or may worsen, despite participation. In previous studies,&#xD;
           patients taking ropinirole reported the following side effects to include: nausea,&#xD;
           headache, dizziness, drowsiness, or sleepiness. Individuals taking ropinirole may&#xD;
           experience dizziness, nausea, sweaty or faintness when first standing up from lying&#xD;
           down. Hallucinations (unreal visions, sounds, or sensations) have also been reported in&#xD;
           patients taking ropinirole, especially in elderly patients, patients taking ropinirole&#xD;
           with L-dopa, or patients taking higher amounts of ropinirole. If a patient is taking&#xD;
           L-dopa for Parkinson's disease, ropinirole may worsen some of the side effects of&#xD;
           L-dopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, ropinirole has been associated with sedating effects, including somnolence&#xD;
           and the possibility of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living,&#xD;
           including operation of a motor vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Syncope or symptomatic hypertension may also occur, particularly during initial&#xD;
           treatment or dose titration. Patients should be cautioned against rising rapidly after&#xD;
           sitting or lying down. Because of possible additive effects, it is recommended that&#xD;
           caution be exercised with patients who have sleep disorders or are taking sedating&#xD;
           medications, alcohol, CNS depressants, or medications that increase ropinirole plasma&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients should get medical help and contact the study doctor or study staff, if they&#xD;
           have any of these or any other side effects during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the study doctor considers that it is in the patient's best interest to discontinue a&#xD;
           current medication so that they can enter the study, the patient may experience some&#xD;
           withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The risks and discomforts of blood drawing from a vein include the possibility of pain&#xD;
           or bruising at the site of the blood draw; occasional feelings of lightheadedness; and,&#xD;
           rarely, infection at the site of the blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently, Ropinirole is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of RLS. There are&#xD;
           currently other medications used for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome such as&#xD;
           Pramipexole, gabapentin, Sinemet, clonazepam, opiods (pain medications), benzodiazepines&#xD;
           (sleep medications), anticonvulsants (medications to prevent seizures), and iron&#xD;
           therapy. The study doctor will discuss the benefits and risks associated with these&#xD;
           alternatives with each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a research related event arises, the study team will manage the patient's care. In&#xD;
           the event of an emergency, the research team is available any time, day or night, via&#xD;
           the MCG paging operator.&#xD;
