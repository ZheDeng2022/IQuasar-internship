  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a passive follow-up of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention&#xD;
      (ATBC) Study cohort. Originally, this was a large, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial primary prevention trial testing the effects of&#xD;
      alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation on cancer incidence and mortality. The&#xD;
      study was conducted in Finland as a collaboration between the U.S. National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) and the National Public Health Institute of Finland. NCI has maintained passive&#xD;
      surveillance of the cohort through Finnish national registries, including the cancer&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the ATBC cohort follow-up is to use the existing risk factor data and&#xD;
      biological specimens (i.e., serum, whole blood, DNA, red blood cells, and toenails) to test&#xD;
      hypotheses relevant to cancer etiology, survival, early detection, and prevention. These data&#xD;
      and biospecimens continue to provide an invaluable resource for the study of biochemical,&#xD;
      nutritional, genetic, and molecular hypotheses. These analyses are made all the more&#xD;
      informative and powerful by the addition of cases identified annually during the follow-up&#xD;
      period, and the research benefits from a longer pre-diagnosis period (now over 30 years).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ATBC study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, primary prevention trial&#xD;
      to determine whether daily supplementation with a-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or both would&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of lung or other cancers among male smokers. Between 1985 and 1988,&#xD;
      29,133 men ages 50 to 69 years, who smoked at least five cigarettes per day, were recruited&#xD;
      from southwestern Finland. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a-tocopherol&#xD;
      as dl-a-tocopheryl acetate (50 mg/day), beta-carotene as all-trans-beta-carotene (20 mg/day),&#xD;
      both supplements, or placebo capsules for 5-8 years (median 6.1 years) through April 30,&#xD;
      1993. Post-intervention follow-up has continued through the Finnish Cancer Registry and other&#xD;
      national registries, and epidemiological analyses continue to be conducted.&#xD;
