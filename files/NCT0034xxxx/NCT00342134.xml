  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of autologous hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT) and immunoablation by high-dose cyclophosphamide in multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis is poorly understood although T-cell&#xD;
      mediated immune destruction of myelin is thought to be an important element. We hypothesize,&#xD;
      and the results of previous studies suggest, that radical immuno-ablation characterized by a&#xD;
      profound T cell depletion can arrest the progression of disease. Patients with MS with poor&#xD;
      prognosis based on the rate of progression and refractoriness to approved treatments&#xD;
      (interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate) will be enrolled in clinical trials at the&#xD;
      collaborating institution (NWU-Dr. R. Burt; Dr. D Kerr, JHU) and will receive either immune&#xD;
      ablation with cyclophosphamide and the antibody Campath-1 followed by reconstitution with&#xD;
      autologous peripheral blood stem cells, a procedure similar to autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation, or high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment without stem cell rescue. While the&#xD;
      overall treatment-related mortality worldwide is approximately 10%, the collaborating&#xD;
      institution and investigators have an outstanding safety record in performing the procedure&#xD;
      with no fatal adverse events after having transplanted more than 30 transplants with a&#xD;
      previously more aggressive regimen than the one that is in use now. The underlying rationale&#xD;
      for this treatment is that immuno-ablation could eliminate myelin-reactive T cells which, in&#xD;
      disease-susceptible individuals, may have been activated by previous exposure to&#xD;
      environmental agents or other acquired mechanisms of immune dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study we plan to address whether HSCT or immunoablation without stem cell&#xD;
      rescue act beneficially in MS via the eradication of myelin-reactive T cells and&#xD;
      reconstitution of a functional and non-autoimmune immune repertoire. To achieve this goal, we&#xD;
      will compare peripheral blood T cell reactivities to myelin antigens before and after the&#xD;
      treatment in 34 patients with MS. In parallel, to identify potential disease-mediating cells&#xD;
      that do not recognize these myelin antigens, we will search for clonally expanded cells in&#xD;
      the blood of MS patients before treatment employing molecular analysis of T cell receptor&#xD;
      repertoire. Expanded T cell clones will be tracked during post-transplant follow-up of&#xD;
      patients. If the eradication of certain clonotypes resulting from immuno-ablation correlates&#xD;
      with disease remission, we will attempt to isolate these cells in culture from pre-treatment&#xD;
      samples and determine their specificity using combinatorial peptide libraries. We would use&#xD;
      the same approach in case of reappearance or new clonal expansions concomitant to disease&#xD;
      relapses. We will combine these studies with a broader, unbiased approach that employs&#xD;
      microarray technology to identify potential changes in gene expression profiles. This&#xD;
      approach may also lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
