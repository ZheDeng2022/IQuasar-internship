      To assess the relations of infertility causes and treatment to cancer risk, we will conduct a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study of approximately 12,000 women evaluated for infertility between&#xD;
      1965-1988. These women will be ascertained from several large infertility clinics and private&#xD;
      practices in various geographic locations in the United States: Boston, Chicago, Detroit, New&#xD;
      York, and Palo Alto. These practices were selected on the basis of their having large number&#xD;
      of patients who received ovulation stimulating drugs many years in the distant past.&#xD;
      Abstractors reviewed clinic medical records to identify eligible study participants and&#xD;
      abstract data needed to classify causes of infertility and document therapies employed. Using&#xD;
      a variety of tracing sources (including the National Death Index, credit bureaus, and&#xD;
      postmasters), the vital status and location of the study subjects were determined. Subjects&#xD;
      who were traced and identified as alive are being sent a detailed questionnaire that requests&#xD;
      information on their health status as well as on a number of lifestyle practices. For&#xD;
      subjects who report a cancer, medical verification is being sought from the diagnosing&#xD;
      physicians and/or facilities. Death certificates are being sought for deceased subjects....&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: We previously conducted a retrospective cohort study of 12,193 patients evaluated&#xD;
      for infertility between 1960-1988 at five clinical sites. Detailed information abstracted&#xD;
      from the medical records, along with questionnaires administered to located patients and&#xD;
      cancer incidence and mortality data derived from cancer registries and the National Death&#xD;
      Index, allowed us to examine cancer risk related to different causes of infertility and&#xD;
      treatments while controlling for other patient characteristics. Although there were some&#xD;
      increases of certain cancers related to various causes of infertility, we generally did not&#xD;
      observe substantial relationships related to use of different fertility drugs. The one&#xD;
      exception was some increased risk of uterine cancers with clomiphene use, of interest given&#xD;
      the drug's chemical similarity to tamoxifen. Our numbers of patients with certain cancers&#xD;
      (e.g., ovarian, uterine) were, however, limited and we had insufficient power to evaluate&#xD;
      subgroup effects (e.g., drug relationships among nulligravid women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: We therefore conducted an updated follow-up of these patients in order to assess&#xD;
      cancer risk in relation to causes of infertility and therapeutic regimens used to treat these&#xD;
      causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY: This study gained an additional 10 years of follow-up among the patients deemed&#xD;
      eligible for the previous investigation. This included women with both primary and second&#xD;
      infertility. Approximately 39% of the cohort previously were prescribed clomiphene citrate,&#xD;
      while 10% received gonadotrophins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Passive follow-up was attempted for patients who previously did not participate and&#xD;
      for whom only information available in clinic records could be retained. All other patients&#xD;
      were traced for active as well as passive follow-up. Active follow-up involved requesting&#xD;
      that patients complete a short questionnaire, whereas passive follow-up was via linkage to&#xD;
      cancer registries and the National Death Index. While cancer risks were assessed in relation&#xD;
      to the general population, the majority of comparisons were internal ones, involving the&#xD;
      calculation of relative risks (RRs) associated with different causes of infertility or&#xD;
      treatment regimens while controlling for other cancer risk predictors.&#xD;

&#xD;
        The following criteria for inclusion in the study cohort will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient was evaluated for infertility between (and including) 1965 and 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
