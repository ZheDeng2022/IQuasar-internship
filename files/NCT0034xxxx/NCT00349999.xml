      The purpose of this study is to better understand how the body fights and protects against&#xD;
      cholera. Two hundered fifty people presenting to the International Centre for Diarrhoeal&#xD;
      Diseases Research, Bangladesh, admitted with acute cholera, 50 of whom (healthy, nonpregnant,&#xD;
      18-45 year olds) will be enrolled in this substudy of mucosal immunity involving duodenal&#xD;
      biopsy. The remainder of the study is observational, involving collection of stool, vomit,&#xD;
      and blood samples only. The biopsy requires a flexible tube with a camera be inserted through&#xD;
      the mouth into the stomach and intestine. During this procedure, small samples will be&#xD;
      collected from the intestine. The study includes medical history, physical, blood testing,&#xD;
      hospitalization and urine pregnancy testing. This study will last for 5 years and patients&#xD;
      will participate for 3 years.&#xD;

      Diarrheal diseases are some of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the world&#xD;
      today. Unfortunately, effective vaccines for most of the infectious causes of diarrhea are&#xD;
      not yet available. Vibrio cholerae (V cholerae) is an important infectious cause of severe&#xD;
      secretory diarrhea in humans. The purpose of this study is to assess the duration of immune&#xD;
      responses in a group of 250 individuals, aged 2-60 years, presenting to the International&#xD;
      Centre for Diarrheal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) hospital who are admitted with&#xD;
      acute cholera. Fifty of these participants will be enrolled in a substudy of mucosal immunity&#xD;
      involving duodenal biopsy. This protocol focuses exclusively on the subset of 50 study&#xD;
      participants (healthy 18-45 year old non pregnant subjects) enrolled in the substudy of&#xD;
      mucosal immunity involving duodenal biopsy. This study is linked to DMID protocol 06-0045.&#xD;
      The remainder of the study is observational, involving collection of stool, vomit, and blood&#xD;
      samples only (DMID protocol 06-0045). A duodenal biopsy will be performed on enrollment or&#xD;
      the next day and at Day 30. Twenty five subjects will undergo a third duodenal biopsy after 6&#xD;
      months of follow-up and 25 subjects will undergo a third duodenal biopsy after 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up. The objectives of this study are as follows: to measure immune responses directed&#xD;
      against Vibrio cholerae antigens and evaluate the development of anti-V cholerae memory B&#xD;
      cells in study participants with cholera; to assess the duration of the immune responses&#xD;
      following an episode of cholera; and to correlate the duration of antigen-specific,&#xD;
      antibody-secreting cells for various cholera antigens in duodenal tissue with measurements of&#xD;
      the duration of immunity based on antibody responses in serum, as well as circulating&#xD;
      antigen-specific memory B cells. This is a single site study with a 5 year duration requiring&#xD;
      three years of patient participation.&#xD;
