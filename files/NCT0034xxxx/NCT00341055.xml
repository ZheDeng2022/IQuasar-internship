  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hematologic response, safety, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of PROCRIT administered once a week in anemic cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When comparing the proposed study dose to current literature, the initial study dose of&#xD;
      80,000 Units administered once per week is equivalent to an individual dose of 1142 Units/kg&#xD;
      body weight for a 70 kg patient. It is also common in clinical practice for anemic cancer&#xD;
      patients to be treated with a dose of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) of 40,000 Units weekly. This&#xD;
      study was an open-label, non-randomized pilot study of cancer patients with non-myeloid&#xD;
      malignancies with a hemoglobin &lt; = 11 g/dL planned to receive at least 12 weeks of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The objective of the study was to evaluate the hematologic response, safety,&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) at 80,000 Units given subcutaneously (under&#xD;
      the skin) once weekly in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. If, at any time the&#xD;
      hemoglobin was &gt; 13 g/dL, PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) therapy was held until the hemoglobin was &lt;=&#xD;
      12 g/dL, then resumed at 60,000 Units once weekly. The dose was also reduced if the&#xD;
      hemoglobin rose by &gt; 1.3 g/dL in a 2 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the incidence of anti-erythropoietin antibodies at baseline and at end of&#xD;
      study/early withdrawal in study patients who have received a minimum of two or more doses of&#xD;
      PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) over at least a one-month period was evaluated. Rarely, antibodies to&#xD;
      erythropoietin may form in patients who have some types of diseases (e.g., autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, anemia of chronic disease) or in response to exposure to&#xD;
      erythropoietin products such as Epoetin alfa necessitating discontinuation of the&#xD;
      erythropoietin agent and medical treatment that may include blood transfusions. Hemoglobin&#xD;
      level, vital signs (blood pressure) and occurrence and severity of adverse events was&#xD;
      assessed throughout the study. PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) was given at a dose of 80,000 Units&#xD;
      subcutaneously (under the skin) for 12 weeks. The PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) dose was monitored&#xD;
      throughout the study and the dose was withheld or reduced as necessary to maintain hemoglobin&#xD;
      level and rate of hemoglobin rise.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of any non-myeloid malignancy planned to have&#xD;
             received at least 12 weeks of chemotherapy with hemoglobin &lt;= 11 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance&#xD;
             Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both male and female patients with reproductive potential must have used an adequate&#xD;
             contraceptive method (e.g., abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptives,&#xD;
             barrier device with spermicide or surgical sterilization) during treatment and for&#xD;
             three months after completing treatment. Female patients with reproductive potential&#xD;
             had a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of the first dose of study drug.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation therapy to &gt; 25% bone marrow reserve or planned radiation during&#xD;

             deficiency, hemolysis or GI bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with Epoetin alfa or any investigational forms of erythropoietin&#xD;
             (e.g., gene-activated erythropoietin, novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein) within&#xD;
