  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at the Children's Hospital of Boston and the Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital in Boston, will examine the natural history of infant development in the first year&#xD;
      of life and how different types of infant feeding may affect that development. During&#xD;
      pregnancy, babies are exposed to the female hormone estrogen from their mothers. Estrogen&#xD;
      affects development of breasts and milk production, as well as the development of the uterus,&#xD;
      ovaries and possibly other hormonally responsive organs in both males and females. Between 6&#xD;
      and 12 months of age, the effects are reduced. Breast milk and some infant formulas may&#xD;
      contain compounds that can act like female hormones in the body and may prolong the estrogen&#xD;
      effects. This study will examine the natural history of estrogen activity in infants on&#xD;
      different feeding regimens, breast milk, cow's milk, and soy milk and will serve as&#xD;
      preparation for a larger study of the effects of soy formula on estrogen activity in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-term female babies (37 to 41 weeks gestational age at birth) from 0 to 12 months of age&#xD;
      and male babies from birth to 6 months of age who weigh from 2501 to 4499 grams (about 5.5 to&#xD;
      10 pounds) at birth and who have no chromosomal abnormalities, major malformations, or&#xD;
      endocrine problems may be eligible for this study. Males must have palpable testes. Babies&#xD;
      being fed a diet of breast milk, soy milk, or cow's milk will be included. Study procedures&#xD;
      include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of the baby's dietary intake since birth, provided by the parent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound measurement of the uterus, ovaries, and breasts in female babies; the testes,&#xD;
           prostate, and breasts in males; and the thymus, thyroid, and kidneys in all babies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of all babies' weight, length, and head circumference.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Term newborns have anatomic and sonographic evidence of in utero estrogen exposure. Over the&#xD;
      first six months to a year of life, as the influence of maternal hormone wanes, these&#xD;
      findings recede. Soy infant formula contains large amounts of isoflavones (daidzein and&#xD;
      genistein) that can occupy estrogen receptors and act as estrogens in the laboratory. A food&#xD;
      substance with estrogen activity might prolong the effect of maternal hormones, or interfere&#xD;
      with hormonal homeostasis in the child. This cross-sectional pilot study will be undertaken&#xD;
      in order to establish methods for a future multi center study designed to assess the&#xD;
      potential effects of soy formula on estrogen activity in infants. In this pilot study (SEAD&#xD;
      1), 156 examinations on full-term infants, ages 0-12 months and on one of three feeding&#xD;
      regimens (soy formula, breast milk or cow's milk formula) will be completed to see if their&#xD;
      exposure to soy estrogen compared to breast milk and non-soy formulas prolongs anatomical&#xD;
      evidence of estrogen exposure and response. A schedule of visits for SEAD 1 is included in&#xD;
      Appendix A. In addition to SEAD 1, two other cross-sectional studies (SEAD 2 and SEAD 3) will&#xD;
      be undertaken to evaluate anatomical evidence by physical examination (SEAD 2) and assess the&#xD;
      hormonal and biochemical status of full-term infants ages 0-12 months (SEAD 3). These studies&#xD;
      will be conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in parallel with the SEAD 1&#xD;
      study. Further details of SEAD 2 and 3 will not be presented in this protocol. The purpose of&#xD;
      the SEAD 1 pilot study is twofold. The first is to develop and finalize recruitment and&#xD;
      collections procedures in preparation for a larger, comprehensive trial of biological&#xD;
      response in children to soy formula with and without the estrogenic isoflavones. The second&#xD;
      is to study the natural history of estrogen activity in infants on a variety of feeding&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Full term infants defined as age 37-41 weeks gestational age at birth. Ultrasound evidence&#xD;
        or reliable reporting of last menstrual period (LMP) by infant's mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Can be categorized into one of the feeding definitions:&#xD;
