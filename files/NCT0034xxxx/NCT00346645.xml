  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bortezomib is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have not received any prior chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      for advanced disease.&#xD;

      Chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mainly Cisplatin-based combinations,&#xD;
      provides a measurable but modest survival benefit for selected patients with advanced&#xD;
      disease. Advanced NSCLC remains largely fatal, with the positive impact of chemotherapy&#xD;
      limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance, manifested clinically by early progression and&#xD;
      transient responses. Current chemotherapy regimens have limited efficacy with a magnitude of&#xD;
      survival benefit that is still modest, and lead to significant toxicity, with many patients&#xD;
      unable to receive this kind of treatment, even in first line setting. There is, therefore, a&#xD;
      great need to provide patients with less toxic agents such as the novel targeted therapies,&#xD;
      with the potential to improve the efficacy and maintain a good quality of life. Bortezomib, a&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitor, has shown benefit as single agent in pretreated patients with similar&#xD;
      or lesser toxicity compared to chemotherapy. The current project is a phase II trial that&#xD;
      will include 46 patients with advanced NSCLC and without prior chemotherapy. An early tumor&#xD;
      assessment (after 6 weeks of therapy) will be performed, combined with regular clinical and&#xD;
      symptom assessment to allow for rapid and appropriate management of non-responding patients,&#xD;
      with cross over to another therapy as per the investigator and patient choice. The primary&#xD;
      objective is efficacy of bortezomib as determined by the rate of no progression at 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are efficacy of bortezomib as determined by objective response rate&#xD;
      (incidence of CR and PR), disease control rate (CR, PR and stabilization), duration of&#xD;
      disease control, duration of objective response, progression-free survival,overall survival,&#xD;
      safety of bortezomib, rate of doublet therapy in second line.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented, inoperable, unresectable, incurable, locally advanced,&#xD;
             recurrent or metastatic (Stage IIIB or Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer. (Note:&#xD;
             Histology is the preferred method of diagnosis. However, in case only cytology is&#xD;
             available, specimens from brushing, washing or needle aspiration etc. are acceptable&#xD;
             for diagnosis. Sputum cytology alone is not acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic anti-tumour therapy (e.g., monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody therapy). Prior surgery and/or localized irradiation (palliative RT or&#xD;
             curative RT) is permitted. Pre operative or post operative anti neo-plastic therapy is&#xD;
             allowed if ended more than 2 years ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. EGFR TK Inhibitors,&#xD;
             Herceptin)&#xD;
