  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a study to increase our understanding of farming practices and of the&#xD;
      potential for previous exposure to DDT in North Carolina African American male agricultural&#xD;
      workers, a group especially likely to have had high DDT exposure. Because of potentially&#xD;
      widespread DDT exposure from agricultural activities, African American farmers and farm&#xD;
      workers may be uniquely at risk for any associated health effects. However, little is known&#xD;
      about levels of pesticide exposure in African American farming populations. Three hundred and&#xD;
      eighty-nine African American men who are current or former farmers or farm workers will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in the study. These men are members of the Supplemental Minority Cohort&#xD;
      of the NCI/NIEHS/EPA Agricultural Health Study (AHS). The AHS is a prospective study of the&#xD;
      potential health effects associated with agricultural exposures. Men in the supplemental&#xD;
      cohort were recruited in 1996. At that time, they completed an enrollment questionnaire that&#xD;
      focused on lifetime agricultural exposures, demographics, lifestyle factors and health. In&#xD;
      this new study, a follow-up questionnaire will be administered by telephone by a trained&#xD;
      interviewer to all men. Following the interview, the participant will be asked to donate a&#xD;
      blood specimen, to have anthropometric indices (e.g., height, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference, etc.) measured, and to have a top- and side view Polaroid photograph of their&#xD;
      head taken during one visit to a central community location, such as the local church or&#xD;
      health clinic. We will quantitatively document serum p,p'-DDE levels, correlate these with&#xD;
      self-reported farming activities and DDT exposure, and describe the health status of these&#xD;
      men. We will also correlate serum p,p'-DDE levels and androgen concentrations, since p,p'-DDE&#xD;
      is thought to be a potent androgen receptor antagonist. This exploration of the potential&#xD;
      link between levels is important because the demonstration of any subclinical physiological&#xD;
      effects of p,p'-DDE would increase the plausibility of a wide range of health effects that&#xD;
      have been postulated to be associated with the endogenous endocrine environment and the&#xD;
      so-called endocrine disrupters. In addition, we will evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      several important physiological parameters which can be easily and accurately measured in&#xD;
      serum, and physical characteristics including hair patterning and distribution of body fat in&#xD;
      these African American men.&#xD;
