  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Dexmedetomidine, a&#xD;
      selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, which has recently gained increased popularity for&#xD;
      ICU and intraoperative sedation as a sedative during awake fiberoptic intubation, as compared&#xD;
      to Remifentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that Dexmedetomidine will provide at least equal if not better conditions&#xD;
      (sedation and analgesia) required for awake fiberoptic intubation (Ramsay Sedation Scale 3)&#xD;
      with less respiratory and cardiovascular adverse effects, as well as less recall than&#xD;
      Remifentanil.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Awake nasal or oral fiberoptic intubation remains the method of choice for airway management&#xD;
      in the expected difficult airway. This technique requires that a patient be comfortable,&#xD;
      relaxed, cooperative and able to maintain their airway with spontaneous ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve these conditions, the pharmacologic agent chosen for sedation should be&#xD;
      short acting and highly titratable, provide the required amount of sedation and have little&#xD;
      suppression of spontaneous ventilation. There have been numerous reports of the use of&#xD;
      Remifentanil and Propofol used either alone or in combination to achieve this level of&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil has the following advantages which makes it a useful drug for this purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ultra short acting with a constant half life&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anti-tussive effects which help prevent coughing with tracheal manipulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reversible with an antagonist naloxone&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Attenuates cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortcomings of Remifentanil include undesirable side effects, such as hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability and respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting, selective alpha-2 agonist which has gained increasing&#xD;
      popularity since 1999 as a drug for sedation in ICU settings. It has also been used for&#xD;
      intraoperative sedation during surgery under regional anesthesia and for awake craniotomies,&#xD;
      as well as for sedation of pediatric patients in different settings. Finally, there are also&#xD;
      case reports of Dexmedetomidine being used for awake fiberoptic tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of Dexmedetomidine make it&#xD;
      an ideal drug as a single agent for sedation for awake fiberoptic intubation. Venn et al&#xD;
      showed that in both healthy individuals and ICU patients, Dexmedetomidine shows a rapid onset&#xD;
      and equally rapid distribution half life with quick recovery. This study also demonstrated&#xD;
      stable hemodynamics during airway manipulation (extubation) with no adverse cardiovascular or&#xD;
      respiratory events during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have demonstrated that Dexmedetomidine attenuates cardiovascular responses to&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and intubation and reduces the need for perioperative opioids. In small doses,&#xD;
      it has been demonstrated to have good sedative, amnestic and analgesic effects, as well as&#xD;
      anti-sialogogue effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine does, however, have some drawbacks. In higher bolus doses it can cause&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes, such as excessive bradycardia and hypertension followed by hypotension.&#xD;
      This drug has also been associated with decreased regional and global cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      despite maintenance of MAP within the auto-regulating parameters. These deleterious effects&#xD;
      are more prominent in patients with hypovolemia, systemic vasoconstriction, AV block and with&#xD;
      rapid bolus infusion.&#xD;
