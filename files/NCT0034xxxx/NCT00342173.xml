  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A population-based study was initiated in Costa Rica in June 1993 to investigate the natural&#xD;
      history of human papillomaviruses (HPV) and cervical neoplasia. Over a period of 18 months,&#xD;
      ending in December 1994, 10,080 women were recruited into our study, after informed consent&#xD;
      was obtained. At the initial recruitment visit, all women were administered a brief risk&#xD;
      factor questionnaire, had 15ml of blood collected and, if sexually active, were given a&#xD;
      pelvic examination. At the time of the pelvic examination, a Pap smear was collected, as were&#xD;
      additional cervical cells which were then used for additional monolayer smears (ThinPrep) and&#xD;
      for human papillomavirus and other testing. Pictures of the cervix, known as cervigrams, were&#xD;
      also taken as a third screening test. Based on these screening tests, women were referred to&#xD;
      colposcopy, at which time a more detailed risk factor questionnaire was administered,&#xD;
      additional cervical cells and blood (15ml) were collected, and histological specimens were&#xD;
      obtained, if indicated by the colposcopy. Women diagnosed with a high-grade cervical lesion&#xD;
      (HSIL) or cervical cancer were treated by Social Security Administration clinicians using&#xD;
      standard local protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women without evidence of HSIL or cancer at enrollment comprise the group of subjects who&#xD;
      have been followed as part of our longitudinal study. Three distinct groups of women of&#xD;
      approximately equal size (about 3,000 women each) exist within our longitudinal cohort. The&#xD;
      first group consists of women who at enrollment had evidence of low-grade cervical lesions&#xD;
      (LSIL) or equivocal lesions and a sample of the remaining cohort members. This group is being&#xD;
      followed actively at 6-12 month intervals through their seventh anniversary in the cohort.&#xD;
      The second group consists of women who were cytologically normal at enrollment but randomly&#xD;
      selected for active follow-up. This second group will be seen once after enrollment, at their&#xD;
      fifth anniversary in the cohort. Women in this group with evidence of LSIL at the fifth&#xD;
      anniversary visit will be added to the first group described above and followed at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals. The final group consists of the remaining women in our cohort (all cytologically&#xD;
      normal at enrollment). These women are being followed passively via linkage to the cytology&#xD;
      and tumor registries in Cost Rica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical visits conducted during follow-up consist of a brief personal interview that&#xD;
      collects information on exposures since enrollment, the collection of 15ml blood, and a&#xD;
      pelvic examination. Pap smear is prepared during the pelvic examination, and additional&#xD;
      cervical specimens are collected and used to prepare a monolayer smear (ThinPrep) and for&#xD;
      human papillomavirus and other testing. Similar to the enrollment visit, cervigrams are also&#xD;
      collected from each participant at the time of their follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up, women with any evidence of progression to HSIL or cancer (by Pap smear,&#xD;
      ThinPrep, cervicography, or by visual inspection) are referred to colposcopy, censored from&#xD;
      the study, and treated by Social Security Administration clinicians using standard local&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
