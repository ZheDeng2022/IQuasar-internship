      This study, conducted by NIH and the University of Bamako in Mali, Africa, will study the&#xD;
      effect of concurrent infections with malaria and filariasis on patients' immune response.&#xD;
      Lymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with very small parasitic worms called Wuchereria&#xD;
      bancrofti that are acquired from mosquitoes. The worms may cause no illness in many who are&#xD;
      infected, but is some, they can cause swelling of the arms, legs, breast and genitalia, which&#xD;
      may progress to permanent swelling referred to as elephantiasis. Malaria is caused by&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum, another parasite that is spread by mosquitoes. It can cause fevers,&#xD;
      headaches, body aches and weakness, and, if untreated, it can cause severe illness and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8-month study will analyze measures of immune function in blood cells from people with or&#xD;
      without filarial infections who become infected with malaria. The goal of the studies is to&#xD;
      see if having a filarial worm infection affects immunity against malaria. Results of analysis&#xD;
      of immune function in persons with malaria but without filaria infections will be compared&#xD;
      with those harboring both filaria and malaria infections and also with results from healthy&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy individuals and patients with malaria and filarial infections between 1 and 8 years&#xD;
      of age and between 18 to 65 years of age who live in N'Tessoni and healthy individuals living&#xD;
      in Bamako, Mali (controls), may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have blood samples collected as follows during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will be collected at the beginning of the study. Individuals found to&#xD;
           have the filarial worm infection have a second sample drawn at nighttime when the&#xD;
           filarial worms are present in the blood. Treatment for filaria infection will be offered&#xD;
           to all infected individuals at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second sample will be collected during malaria season. Subjects will be interviewed&#xD;
           about their health during the malaria season and re-tested for filarial and malaria&#xD;
           infections with a finger-prick test. Those who test positive for malaria will be offered&#xD;
           treatment to begin immediately after collection of the donated blood sample..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A third sample will be collected after the end of the malaria season. Subjects will be&#xD;
           interviewed again about their health and re-tested for filarial and malaria infections&#xD;
           with a finger prick test. Those who have positive results for either infection will be&#xD;
           offered treatment after collec...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Residents of malaria-endemic regions are frequently exposed to a variety of other parasites&#xD;
      concurrently with malarial parasites. In Mali, lymphatic filariasis co-exists in several&#xD;
      regions highly endemic for malaria. Because of the chronicity of filarial infections and an&#xD;
      associated bias towards the development of an adaptive immune response dominated by Th2&#xD;
      cytokines, a pre-existing filarial infection has the potential to alter the immune response&#xD;
      towards incoming malarial parasites, clearance of which are considered to be dependent on a&#xD;
      robust Th1 response. Conversely, immune responses to filarial parasites may be modulated in&#xD;
      the presence of malarial parasites. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of&#xD;
      concurrent infections with malarial and filarial parasites on innate and adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses to homologous and heterologous antigens. We will characterize the responses of&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells to antigens derived from both filarial (Wuchereria&#xD;
      bancrofti) and malarial (Plasmodium falciparum) parasites in groups of individuals with or&#xD;
      without filarial infections and follow them through a malaria transmission season, when they&#xD;
      are repeatedly exposed to malarial parasites, to determine how co-infection with the filarial&#xD;
      parasite affects the cellular and humoral responses to malarial and filarial antigens. These&#xD;
      studies may provide the basis for modifying treatment strategies of mass treatment of malaria&#xD;
      in regions co-endemic for lymphatic filariasis.&#xD;
