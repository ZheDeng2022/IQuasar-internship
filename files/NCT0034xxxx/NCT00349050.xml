  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain represents a huge public health concern and is generally poorly understood at a&#xD;
      basic neurobiological level. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive&#xD;
      technique that uses electromagnetic pulses to temporarily stimulate specific brain areas in&#xD;
      awake people (without the need for surgery, anesthesia, or other invasive procedures).&#xD;
      Previous research suggests that TMS may be effective in reducing pain perception in healthy&#xD;
      adults and in patients with various types of pain conditions, such as neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      However, there is relatively little research on TMS and pain that addresses optimal TMS&#xD;
      device parameters, optimal cortical targets, and potential differences in response to TMS&#xD;
      between healthy persons and those with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to study the effects of TMS on pain perception. Specifically,&#xD;
      this study will determine optimal device parameters (dose) and brain targets for stimulation&#xD;
      with TMS in order to reduce pain in patients with neuropathic pain and in healthy adults&#xD;
      using laboratory pain methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with Neuropathic Pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial screening, eligible participants with neuropathic pain will receive a&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to help determine the best target for TMS stimulation&#xD;
      later in the study. Participants will be asked to record their pain experiences every day for&#xD;
      2-4 weeks before receiving the first of 2 laboratory pain assessments. The laboratory pain&#xD;
      assessment uses a small device, controlled by a computer and attached to the underside of the&#xD;
      forearm, to produce different temperature stimulations. As the device reaches a level&#xD;
      considered painful to the participant, he/she can push a button to return to a level of&#xD;
      comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next part of the trial involves two, 20-minute TMS treatment sessions per day for 5-days.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A will receive real TMS&#xD;
      and Group B will receive &quot;sham&quot; TMS. Study participation time for individuals with TGN is&#xD;
      about 8 weeks, including about 10 hours (7 visits) at the Medical University of South&#xD;
      Carolina (MUSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to an interview with researchers regarding medical history, healthy participants&#xD;
      will complete a self-report screening to assess pain history and level of depression and&#xD;
      anxiety. Eligible participants will be given a laboratory pain assessment, and be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups: group A will receive real TMS and group B will receive &quot;sham&quot;&#xD;
      TMS. After TMS, participants will receive another full laboratory pain assessment and&#xD;
      complete questionnaires. For healthy volunteers, participation in the study will take about 3&#xD;
      hours and may be completed in one or two visits.&#xD;

    <description>There will be two, 20-minute, 3-day TMS treatment sessions. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A will receive real TMS for the first 3-day treatment and &quot;sham&quot; TMS (which does not involve real stimulation) for the second treatment. Group B will receive &quot;sham&quot; TMS for the first treatment, and real TMS for the second treatment. Regardless of the group, participants will receive both real and &quot;sham&quot; TMS.</description>
