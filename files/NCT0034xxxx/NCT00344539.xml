    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an experimental malaria vaccine in about 75 healthy&#xD;
      adults, 18-45 years of age. The study will also test an experimental adjuvant which is a&#xD;
      material added to a vaccine to help the body make more defense cells. The body's immune&#xD;
      response (response to foreign substances) and the safety of the vaccine will be tested. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive 3 doses of vaccine on days 0, 28, and 56 and doses may increase during&#xD;
      the study. Participation in the study is expected to be up to 323 days and includes 16&#xD;
      visits. Study procedures include medical history, physical exams, urine and blood testing.&#xD;

      This phase I, dose escalating study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      experimental malaria vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel®, and the ability of the TLR-9 agonist CPG&#xD;
      7909 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) to augment antibody responses to the vaccine and alter the&#xD;
      Th1/Th2 bias. The vaccine preparations to be studied contain an equal mixture of AMA1 from&#xD;
      two different clones of Plasmodium falciparum (FVO and 3D7). Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive Alydrogel® formulated vaccine with or without CPG 7909 in a point of use&#xD;
      formulation. The study will be conducted at the University of Rochester Vaccine and Treatment&#xD;
      Evaluation Unit. Subjects for this study will be healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 45&#xD;
      years with no history of malaria or of recent travel to malaria-endemic areas. Subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled in three consecutive dose-escalation cohorts with review by a Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee between cohorts. Subjects will receive 3 vaccinations with the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel®&#xD;
      vaccine formulated in Alhydrogel® with or without CPG 7909 adjuvant over 2 months (0, 1, 2&#xD;
      months) by intramuscular (IM) injection. Subjects will have multiple blood samples obtained&#xD;
      over the next 6 months. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity of the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® + CPG 7909 vaccine. The secondary objectives of the&#xD;
      study include the following: to demonstrate that the addition of CPG 7909 improves the immune&#xD;
      responses to AMA1-FVO and AMA1-3D7, as compared to AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® at day 70 (14 days&#xD;
      after 3rd vaccination; to determine the dose of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® + CPG 7909 that generates&#xD;
      the highest serum antibody levels of AMA-FVO and AMA1-3D7 at day 70; to assess and compare&#xD;
      the duration of antibody responses to AMA1-FVO and AMA1-3D7 proteins by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) over an 8 month period (6 months after 3rd vaccination); and to&#xD;
      perform exploratory studies of B and T cell populations both before and after vaccination.&#xD;
      The safety trial endpoints include the frequency and severity of local and systemic adverse&#xD;
      events after each dose reported on the subject diary card (solicited adverse events) or&#xD;
      reported by subjects spontaneously (unsolicited adverse events) and the presence of abnormal&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests after immunization in each group. The immunogenicity endpoints&#xD;
      include the frequency and titer of vaccine induced neutralizing and binding antibody, and the&#xD;
      presence and quantity of antigen-specific B cells and CD4 and CD8 T cells producing specified&#xD;
      cytokines following vaccination.&#xD;
