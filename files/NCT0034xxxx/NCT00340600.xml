      Diethylstilbestrol (DES), a drug first synthesized in 1938, was administered to several&#xD;
      million pregnant women in the U.S. and Europe for the prevention of spontaneous abortion and&#xD;
      premature delivery. In 1971, Herbst reported a strong association between DES use in&#xD;
      pregnancy and the occurrence of vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) in exposed female&#xD;
      offspring. Animal models have demonstrated a range of DES effects on offspring exposed in&#xD;
      utero, including reproductive dysfunction, immune system changes, behavioral and sexual&#xD;
      abnormalities, and increases in various reproductive cancers in males and females. In the&#xD;
      mid-1970's, several separate cohorts of DES-exposed daughters and unexposed comparison groups&#xD;
      were followed for the occurrence of cancer, precursor lesions, and reproductive effects, but&#xD;
      systematic follow-up of these cohorts had ceased by 1990. In 1992, Congress passed a bill&#xD;
      (H;.R. 4178) mandating the continued follow-up of DES-exposed cohorts. The National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute, in collaboration with five field centers, reassembled previously studied cohorts&#xD;
      of DES-exposed and unexposed mothers, daughters and sons, and identified subjects with&#xD;
      documented exposure status who had not been studied previously, through familial links within&#xD;
      the cohorts. Standardized baseline questionnaires were mailed to cohort members to ascertain&#xD;
      the risk of cancer and other disorders. Pathology reports were collected for reported cancers&#xD;
      and preneoplastic conditions. Two separate rounds of follow up have been conducted and a&#xD;
      third is almost complete. Patients from the Registry for Research on Hormonal Transplacental&#xD;
      Carcinogenesis (the Registry) will be added to the follow-up effort in the third phase. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to continue the follow-up, by means of mail questionnaires and&#xD;
      medical record collection, which was begun during the first phase of the study. Concern has&#xD;
      arisen that DES-exposed daughters may be at higher risk of breast cancer. Exposure to high&#xD;
      levels of endogenous estrogen in utero has been hypothesized to increase the risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer and DES is a potent estrogen. Cancer risk in the sons will also continue to be&#xD;
      assessed, especially for increased risks of prostate cancer. Since the offspring who were&#xD;
      exposed to DES in utero are currently reaching their late forties, when cancer rates begin to&#xD;
      rise, it is important to continue the follow-up of these cohorts to determine if there are&#xD;
      long-term increases in cancer risk.&#xD;

      Diethylstilbestrol (DES), a drug first synthesized in 1938, was administered to several&#xD;

      (H;.R. 4178) mandating the continued follow-up of DES-exposed cohorts of mothers, daughters,&#xD;
      sons and grandchildren. The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with five field&#xD;
      centers, reassembled previously studied cohorts of DES-exposed and unexposed mothers,&#xD;
      daughters and sons, and identified subjects with documented exposure status who had not been&#xD;
      studied previously, through familial links within the cohorts. Standardized baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires were mailed to cohort members to ascertain the risk of cancer and other&#xD;
      disorders. Pathology reports were collected for reported cancers and preneoplastic&#xD;
      conditions. Three separate phases of follow up have been conducted. Patients from the&#xD;
      Registry for Research on Hormonal Transplacental Carcinogenesis at the University of Chicago&#xD;
      will be added to the follow-up effort and mailed the questionaire used in the third phase of&#xD;
      follow-up. A cohort of daughters of women exposed and not exposed to DES in utero have been&#xD;
      added to the study to assess the effects of DES on third generation women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study as a whole is to continue the follow-up, by means of mailed&#xD;
      questionnaires and medical record collection, which was begun during the first phase of the&#xD;
      study. Concern has arisen that DES-exposed daughters may be at higher risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
      Exposure to high levels of endogenous estrogen in utero has been hypothesized to increase the&#xD;
      risk of breast cancer and DES is a potent estrogen. Cancer risk in the sons will also&#xD;
      continue to be assessed, especially for increased risks of prostate cancer. Since the&#xD;
      offspring who were exposed to DES in utero are currently reaching their late forties, when&#xD;
      cancer rates begin to rise, it is important to continue the follow-up of these cohorts to&#xD;
      determine if there are long-term increases in cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning to add a biospecimen collection component to the study. We propose to conduct&#xD;
      a pilot study, nested within our ongoing combined cohort of DES-daughters, at Boston&#xD;
      University to determine the feasibility of recruiting women participating in our study for&#xD;
      phlebotomy and to investigate potential differences in the hormone metabolites and&#xD;
      methylation patterns of germline DNA in 60 of these samples representing three groups of&#xD;
      women: those exposed to high doses of DES prenatally, those exposed to low-doses of DES&#xD;
      prenatally, and unexposed. Hormone metabolites and DNA methylation will be assessed in&#xD;
      relation to DES exposure. Hormone metabolites will be measured at NCI s Frederick laboratory.&#xD;
      DNA methylation will be assessed by Dr. Shuk-Mei Ho, the Jacob G. Schmidlapp Chair of the&#xD;
      Department of Environmental Health, Director of the Center for Environmental Genetics, and&#xD;
      Co-Leader of the Hormonal Malignancies Program in the Joint Cancer Center, at the College of&#xD;
      Medicine in the University of Cincinnati, OH, and at Stephen Chanock s laboratory at NCI. The&#xD;
      findings of this pilot study may have profound implications for the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      endocrine disruption in the fetus influences human health. IRB approval of the data&#xD;
      collection protocol has been received from Boston University.&#xD;
