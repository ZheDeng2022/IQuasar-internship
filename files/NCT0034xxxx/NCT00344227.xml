  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PrONTO Study was designed to evaluate the response of neovascular age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (AMD) patients to intravitreal Lucentis using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)&#xD;
      imaging. OCT was then used to determine the need for retreatment after 3 monthly injections&#xD;
      of Lucentis. Patients would be followed for 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab (LucentisTM).&#xD;
      Ranibizumab is an anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) antibody fragment.&#xD;
      Approximately 40 subjects with primary or recurrent subfoveal choroidal neovascularization&#xD;
      (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) will be enrolled. Lesion types&#xD;
      included will be minimally classic or occult (predominatly occult) lesions or predominantly&#xD;
      classic CNV, if the patient had received prior PDT (no more than 3 treatments). The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at one study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reading the informed consent and having all their questions answered by the&#xD;
      investigator and the coordinator, the subjects will sign the informed consent prior to&#xD;
      participation in a screening period that could last up to 28 days to determine eligibility.&#xD;
      Fluorescein angiograms (FA) will be used to determine CNV classification for study&#xD;
      eligibility. In addition, optical coherence tomography (OCT) will provide information on&#xD;
      retinal thickness, subretinal fluid and sub retinal pigment epithelium fluid for study&#xD;
      eligibility. Fluorescein angiograms and OCT will be evaluated by the Bascom Palmer Reading&#xD;
      Center. OCT images will be evaluated primarily using the standard Zeiss Stratus OCT software&#xD;
      (Vers. 3) to determine study eligibility and retinal thickness. Proprietary software&#xD;
      algorithms in development and not yet validated by the FDA may be used for future data&#xD;
      analysis but will not be included in the intial data analysis. The angiographic features that&#xD;
      will permit participation will include evidence of CNV with subfoveal involvement of the&#xD;
      lesion. The OCT features that will permit participation will include retinal thickness&#xD;
      (macular edema) ≥300 microns, subretinal fluid ≥100 microns in thickness, or a detachment of&#xD;
      the retinal pigment epithelium ≥100 microns in thickness. ETDRS visual acuity measurements&#xD;
      must be between 20/40 and 20/400.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects will receive a ranibizumab dose of 500 micrograms at baseline and every&#xD;
      30 days thereafter for the first two months. ETDRS visual acuity testing and OCT measurements&#xD;
      will be performed prior to injection. After each of the first 3 injections (baseline,&#xD;
      Month-1, and Month-2), patients will return on post-injection days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. OCT&#xD;
      measurements will be performed at those visits. ETDRS visual acuity measurements will be&#xD;
      performed on each injection day and on post-injection day #14. At the Month-3 follow-up exam&#xD;
      and thereafter, if the vision is stable or improved (stable visual acuity score= ±4 letters;&#xD;
      improved visual acuity score ≥ 5 letters) from the previous visit, and there is no evidence&#xD;
      of leakage from CNV as determined by fluorescein angiography and OCT, then no injection will&#xD;
      performed. If the previous criteria are not met, then injections are continued monthly until&#xD;
      these criteria are fulfilled. At that point, no further injections will be given until there&#xD;
      is evidence of recurrent CNV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects, who did not have predominantly classic CNV at baseline but converted to&#xD;
      predominantly classic CNV within the study, will be offered veteporfin photodynamic therapy&#xD;
      (PDT). If a patient receives PDT, there will be no injection of ranibizumab at that visit,&#xD;
      and the next injection of ranibizumab will not be performed for at least 1 month. Patients&#xD;
      will continue in the study and receive additional PDT at 3 months intervals if needed. There&#xD;
      will alaways be at least a 1 month separation between PDT and the subsequent ranibizumab&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria will need to be fulfilled to resume injections. There will need to be&#xD;
      evidence of vision loss ≥ 5 letters associated with evidence of leakage from CNV as&#xD;
      determined by OCT or fluorescein angiography, or a new-onset macular hemorrhage, or new onset&#xD;
      classic CNV, or an increase in central macular thickness ≥ 100 microns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one eye will be chosen as the &quot;study eye&quot;. Only the study eye will receive intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of ranibizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have scheduled monthly visits throughout the study for the evaluation of safety&#xD;
      and efficacy. Subjects will have the first treatment of a ranibizumab injection by the&#xD;
      injecting physician on Day 0 and will undergo retinal analysis by OCT on Days 1, 2, 4, 7 and&#xD;
      14 after the first 3 study treatments. At subsequent visits (every month [30±7 days]), the&#xD;
      subject will have a safety evaluation by the evaluating physician prior to possible&#xD;
      retreatment. After months 3 subjects will be contacted by the site personnel 2 days (±1 day)&#xD;
      after each study treatment to elicit reports of any decrease in vision, eye pain, unusual&#xD;
      redness, or any other new ocular symptoms; subjects will also be asked whether they have&#xD;
      taken the prescribed self-administered post-injection antimicrobials. During the first 3&#xD;
      months, these questions will be asked when they return to clinic. Every 3 months, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography. Subjects will have a final&#xD;
      safety visit at Month 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography will be performed at baseline and at months 3,&#xD;
      6, 12, 18, and 24. Additional fluorescein angiography will be performed at visits when it is&#xD;
      decided that injections should be stopped (if continued past Month-3) or be resumed due to&#xD;
      decreased vision and possible evidence of leakage from CNV. Optical coherence tomography will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline and on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 after each of the first 3 injections.&#xD;
      Since preliminary data suggest that OCT imaging can detect the earliest manifestations of&#xD;
      recurrent CNV, all patients will be monitored once injections have been stopped using monthly&#xD;
      ophthalmologic exams, ETDRS visual acuity measurements, and OCT imaging at each monthly&#xD;
      follow-up visit up to month 24.&#xD;

                  patient must have had prior PDT (up to 3 previous photodynamic therapy&#xD;
                  treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
