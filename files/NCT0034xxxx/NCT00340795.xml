      This study will evaluate the impact of a Media-Smart Youth (MSY) curriculum on adolescent&#xD;
      knowledge and behavioral intent regarding media messages, nutrition, and physical activity.&#xD;
      The study is part of the U.S. Government's efforts to fight obesity and increase physical&#xD;
      activity among American youth. The MSY program seeks to empower adolescents to make healthful&#xD;
      choices about nutrition and physical activity by helping them understand how media can&#xD;
      influence their lives. This is important because it is estimated that young people view as&#xD;
      many as 40,000 commercial messages a year on television alone, many of which promote&#xD;
      unhealthy snack foods and beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth between 11 and 13 years of age who are participating in selected after-school programs&#xD;
      in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to either receive the MSY curriculum or serve as controls.&#xD;
      Youth in the MSY group participate in a workshop consisting of 10 lessons and a creative&#xD;
      project to create a media message for their peers on the topic of nutrition and physical&#xD;
      activity. During the sessions, the young people receive information on nutrition and physical&#xD;
      activity and learn about media production and how to critically examine the media. Youth in&#xD;
      the control group participate in after-school programs unrelated to MSY. All participants&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires measuring their knowledge, skills, and behavioral intent related to&#xD;
      media analysis, nutrition and physical activity both at the start of the study and at its&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;

      A. Objectives of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the Media-Smart Youth (MSY)&#xD;
      curriculum on adolescent knowledge skills and behavioral intent in the areas of media&#xD;
      analysis, nutrition, and physical activity. The study asks whether youth participating in the&#xD;
      MSY curriculum 1) increase their skills in analyzing media messages; 2) increase their&#xD;
      knowledge of the basic principles of healthful and nutritious foods and increase their skills&#xD;
      and behavioral intent to make healthful food choices in real-life settings; and 3) increase&#xD;
      their knowledge of the importance of daily physical activity in promoting health and increase&#xD;
      their skills and behavioral intent to be more active in their daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will use a group randomization design, in which 18 after-school programs will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either receive the MSY curriculum or serve as controls. Nine&#xD;
      youth-serving agencies running pre-existing structured after-school programs in the&#xD;
      Washington, DC metropolitan area will be solicited to participate in the evaluation. For each&#xD;
      agency, two program sites will be selected with each pair of sites matched for socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, race and ethnicity, all factors that may affect the program outcomes. The sites will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. During the implementation&#xD;
      of the MSY curriculum at the treatment sites, participants in the control sites will receive&#xD;
      after-school programming unrelated to MSY. Fifteen youth in each after-school program, or 270&#xD;
      youth, will be recruited to participate in the study. Parental consent and youth assent will&#xD;
      be obtained. At the end of the program implementation, program staff from the treatment and&#xD;
      control sites will be offered training in implementing the MSY curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSY program outcomes on knowledge, skills and behavioral intent related to media&#xD;
      analysis, nutrition, and physical activity will be measured using a paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire (SAQ). All 270 youth will complete the SAQ pretest before the&#xD;
      start of the MSY curriculum. Following the completion of the curriculum, all 270 youth will&#xD;
      complete the SAQ posttest. For the treatment of after-school participants, data collection is&#xD;
      incorporated into the MSY curriculum delivery. Following implementation of the MSY&#xD;
      curriculum, the treatment group facilitators will be interviewed to identify any&#xD;
      modifications made to the ascribed curriculum. Program directors of the control groups will&#xD;
      also be interviewed to determine the general content of the program(s) in which the control&#xD;
      youth participated.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Youth aged 11-13 are the primary participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All youth identified in either the treatment or control groups will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At no point during the program implementation, including the data&#xD;
&#xD;
        collection, will any participant be excluded from the group&#xD;
&#xD;
        membership or activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment subjects who have participated in less than seven lessons will be excluded from&#xD;
        the treatment group for the purpose of analyzing program effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They will, however, be included in intent-to-treat analyses to check for biases from&#xD;
        excluding these participants.&#xD;
