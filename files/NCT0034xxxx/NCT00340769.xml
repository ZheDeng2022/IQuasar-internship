  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins are members of a small family of proteins that regulate&#xD;
      the stability of certain types of mRNA containing so-called class II AU-rich elements in&#xD;
      their 3'-untranslated regions. The best studied member of this protein family,&#xD;
      tristetraprolin (TTP), exerts this destabilizing effect on at least two mRNAs coding for&#xD;
      physiologically and medically important cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha and&#xD;
      granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. The physiological functions of the other&#xD;
      two members of this protein family in mammals, 11B and 11D, are not known, but in&#xD;
      experimental transfection studies they too can destabilize mRNAs containing this type of&#xD;
      AU-rich element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the Environmental Genome Project, we resequenced the protein coding portions of&#xD;
      the human genes encoding these three proteins, and uncovered a dinucleotide splice site&#xD;
      mutation in the 11B gene in one of 144 alleles sequenced. We showed that this mutation&#xD;
      created a novel restriction fragment length polymorphism, and that this mutation resulted in&#xD;
      the failure of splicing and expression of the mRNA encoded by the mutant allele. Based on our&#xD;
      previous data with mice completely deficient in TTP, we anticipate that complete deficiency&#xD;
      of this protein, and possibly its partial deficiency, would result in human disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mutant allele was from an anonymous adult Aka Pygmy women from the Central African&#xD;
      Republic. We propose to genotype up to 1000 members of this ethnic group after obtaining&#xD;
      buccal cell DNA from them. This will give us an approximate idea of the prevalence of this&#xD;
      mutation in this population. If the mutation is found in a significant number of living&#xD;
      individuals in this initial screen, then we will propose a later study of the individuals who&#xD;
      have this genotype and their families. This second study, which will be reviewed separately,&#xD;
      will attempt to correlate this genotype with a human trait or phenotype and possible y&#xD;
      treatable human disease.&#xD;
