  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Building Futures for Youth (BFY) project is a pilot intervention program for 6th grade&#xD;
      students and their parents in the District of Columbia public school system. The full&#xD;
      intervention will include students in the 6th, 7th and 8th grades. The primary overall goal&#xD;
      of the project is to help students learn to make healthy life choices and delay sexual&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixth-grade children and parents in four Washington, D.C., public schools will be recruited&#xD;
      for this study. Children from two schools will participate in the BFY intervention program&#xD;
      and children from two other schools will serve as controls. Participants are guided through&#xD;
      three study phases, with each phase spanning one school year, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixth-grade students are given a foundation in goal setting, decision-making and&#xD;
      communication skills. They gain knowledge about puberty, reproduction, and the negative&#xD;
      consequences associated with having a child at a young age. They learn strategies for getting&#xD;
      out of situations in which they feel pressured to engage in sexual activity. Through lessons,&#xD;
      activities, and discussions they are given tools to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who am I? Students engage in self-reflection activities and discussions that allow them&#xD;
           to become aware of their values, beliefs and strengths, increasing self-esteem and a&#xD;
           positive self-image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What do I want for my life? Students engage in goal-setting activities, creating&#xD;
           short-term and long-term goals and mapping out the necessary steps to achieve the goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do I get there? Students are instructed in decision-making, problem-solving and&#xD;
           communication skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How can having sex too early affect my life and the goals I want to achieve? Students&#xD;
           explore the negative impact that engaging in sexual activity too early and getting&#xD;
           pregnant or getting someone pregnant can have on their emotional, social and financial&#xD;
           lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventh grade students are given the tools and skills necessary to deal with a variety of&#xD;
      challenges they may experience during their developmental years. They receive comprehensive&#xD;
      sex education, in conjunction with life skills such as relationship negotiation, dating&#xD;
      skills, violence prevention and problem-solving skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighth grade students are guided through a series of activities that encourage students to&#xD;
      translate knowledge gained in the 6th and 7th grade phases into long-term behavioral changes&#xD;
      and risk reduction. Activities include writing and performing skills, creating an&#xD;
      informational pamphlet, designing T-shirts and creating poetry that affirms the BFY message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, students participate in a program of community service projects, such as the&#xD;
      Anacostia River clean-up coordinated by the Earth Conservation Corps and Martin Luther King&#xD;
      Day events coordinated by Howard University's Community Association and Project Change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents are provided skills training and information on a variety of issues relating to&#xD;
      adolescent sexuality, parental monitoring and parent-child communication.&#xD;

      The Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Project, or Building Futures for Youth, is embarking on a&#xD;
      pilot year in order to test the effectiveness of a revised children's intervention for Grade&#xD;
      6. Although there was some evidence of a positive effect of the intervention for girls during&#xD;
      Phase II, there were no significant effects for boys. In light of these findings, BFY will&#xD;
      spend the current project year piloting a revised classroom intervention as well as a newly&#xD;
      adapted after-school intervention component.&#xD;
