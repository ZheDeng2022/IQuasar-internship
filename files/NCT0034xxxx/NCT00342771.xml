    <textblock>
      This study will examine the association of genetic variants and gene expression patterns with&#xD;
      the risk of prostate cancer. There will be (It will include?) genotype analysis of blood DNA&#xD;
      from 600 patients with the disease and from 600 healthy people, and there will be a gene&#xD;
      expression analysis of prostate tumors. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of death among men&#xD;
      in Western countries. It is estimated that 220,000 or more new cases of the disease will&#xD;
      occur in the United States during 2004. The disease incidence is rising. About 25% to 30% of&#xD;
      the cancers become aggressive. The nonhereditary disease rarely occurs in men who are younger&#xD;
      than age 40. There are large differences in incidence by geography and race. The highest&#xD;
      rates are seen among African-American men in the United States. Also, although Caucasians&#xD;
      have a lower rate of disease incidence and mortality in the United States, the rates among&#xD;
      them are high compared with rates in some European countries. The reasons for such&#xD;
      differences are not well understood, but both environmental and genetic risk factors are&#xD;
      thought to be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 40 to 80 years who have had prostate cancer confirmed within the past 6 months,&#xD;
      who reside in Baltimore City or adjacent metropolitan counties, and who were born in the&#xD;
      United States may be eligible for this study. They will be recruited in collaboration with&#xD;
      the Departments of Pathology and Urology at the University of Maryland and the Baltimore&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Those men serving as controls in this study will be&#xD;
      identified through the Department of Motor Vehicles database and will be matched by age and&#xD;
      race with the patients who have cancer. The study will include 600 participants with prostate&#xD;
      cancer and 600 participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained interviewers will administer two questionnaires. The primary questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used to assess information such as medical and cancer history, tobacco use, current&#xD;
      medications, occupational history, family medical history, and socioeconomic status. A&#xD;
      supplemental questionnaire will pertain to patients' exposure to risk factors for prostate&#xD;
      cancer. It will assess the human body, diet, medical history, family medical history, and&#xD;
      sexual history. The section on sexual history will be self-administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo collection of blood and urine for various tests. For cancer patients&#xD;
      with prostate surgery, there will also be a collection of tissue, to be performed at the time&#xD;
      that the prostate gland is scheduled for surgical removal. The pattern of gene expression&#xD;
      will be analyzed in low- and high-stage tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no direct benefit from participating in the study, but participants will&#xD;
      receive an incentive of up to $75 to participate in the study. No form of treatment is&#xD;
      involved in this study. However, it is hoped that the study findings will improve&#xD;
      researchers' understanding of prostate cancer biology with respect to the causes of the&#xD;
      health variances between African-Americans and Caucasians.&#xD;

      We are conducting an epidemiological prostate cancer case-control study in Baltimore,&#xD;
      Maryland. Participants will be African American and Caucasian males who reside in Baltimore&#xD;
      city and surrounding areas. The study is ongoing and will recruit 1000 prostate cancer cases&#xD;
      and 1000 population-based controls. The cases are recruited at two Baltimore hospitals, the&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of Maryland Center. Cases will have&#xD;
      pathologically confirmed prostate cancer. The population-based controls are identified&#xD;
      through the Maryland Department of Motor Vehicle Database, and are frequency-matched by age&#xD;
      and race to cases. Enrollment of controls started concurrently with case accrual. The first&#xD;
      12 months of the study constituted a pilot study, during which we evaluated the recruitment&#xD;
      procedures. The study involves the administration of two questionnaires and collection of&#xD;
      blood from all study subjects. The two questionnaires consist of a main questionnaire and a&#xD;
      supplemental questionnaire. The questionnaires evaluate family cancer history, tobacco use,&#xD;
      medication, occupational history, socioeconomic status and risk factors for prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Fresh-frozen tumor specimens will be obtained from cancer patients if available. The study is&#xD;
      supported by an epidemiological infrastructure that has been developed by our resource&#xD;
      contractor at the University of Maryland for a lung cancer case-control study. This lung&#xD;
      cancer study is ongoing, and the controls that are recruited for the prostate cancer study&#xD;
      are joint controls with the lung cancer study. Hence, population-based male controls&#xD;
      recruited by our contractor have double eligibility for the concurrent lung and prostate&#xD;
      cancer studies. To achieve an age and race matching of cases and controls in the prostate&#xD;
      study, we will over-sample male controls in the lung study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the primary hypothesis that genes and environmental exposures, including&#xD;
      infections and medical history, and interactions between those exposures and genetic factors&#xD;
      modify prostate cancer susceptibility. As the secondary goal, we will study gene expression&#xD;
      profiles of prostate tumors to identify changes in tumor biology that are associated with&#xD;
      exposure to genetic and environmental risk factors. It is a focus of this research to&#xD;
      identify mechanisms in tumor biology that may cause the aggressive nature of prostate cancer&#xD;
      in African American men.&#xD;
