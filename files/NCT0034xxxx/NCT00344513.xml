    <textblock>
      This program is designed to improve medical care and education of hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      heart failure and accelerate the initiation of evidence-based heart failure guideline&#xD;
      recommended therapies by administering them before hospital discharge. A registry component&#xD;
      focusing on admission to discharge and 60- to 90-day follow-up is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      demographic, pathophysiologic, clinical, treatment, and outcome characteristics of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with heart failure.&#xD;
