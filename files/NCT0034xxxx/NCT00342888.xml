  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood leukemia is the most common type of childhood cancer and its etiology is largely&#xD;
      unknown. Most case-control studies of childhood leukemia have reported elevated risks among&#xD;
      children whose parents were occupationally exposed to pesticides or who used pesticides in&#xD;
      the home or garden. Investigators at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) conducted&#xD;
      a case-control study of childhood leukemia in 35 counties in the San Francisco Bay area and&#xD;
      the agricultural Central Valley of California. A major focus of the UCB study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether household or occupational exposure to pesticides increases the risk of childhood&#xD;
      leukemia. Our collaboration provided additional funding to collect carpet dust samples for&#xD;
      the measurement of pesticides and other chemicals. For 470 participants, we attempted to&#xD;
      collect carpet dust using a special high volume small surface sampler (HVS3) vacuum and by&#xD;
      taking dust from participants vacuum cleaner. As of July 2006, dust samples will be collected&#xD;
      only from participant's vacuum cleaner. Samples were collected at a home visit approximately&#xD;
      3-6 months after the first in-person interview. We will also provide support for mapping of&#xD;
      the crops (i.e., determining crop field boundaries and crop species) within 1200 meters (3/4&#xD;
      mile) of residences so that the residential proximity to agricultural fields treated with&#xD;
      pesticides can be determined. We will conduct the epidemiologic analysis of pesticide and&#xD;
      other chemical levels in carpet dust and risk of childhood leukemia. We will also evaluate&#xD;
      whether residential proximity to agricultural pesticide use is associated with risk of&#xD;
      leukemia. Further, we will conduct an Exposure Pilot Study that will include a subset of the&#xD;
      study population. Two components of the Pilot Study will evaluate how well a used vacuum bag&#xD;
      and a window sill wipe predict pesticide and other chemical concentrations in carpet dust&#xD;
      samples collected with the more complicated HVS3 vacuum method. The third component will&#xD;
      compare pesticides detected in carpet dust with pesticides predicted by geographic proximity&#xD;
      to agriculture.&#xD;
