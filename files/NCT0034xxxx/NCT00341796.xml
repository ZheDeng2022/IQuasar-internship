    <textblock>
      This study, conducted in Tamil Nadu, India, was initiated in response to the developing&#xD;
      epidemic of HIV/AIDS in India. It is divided into two stages, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women registered in the pregnancy clinics at the Namakkal District Hospital or the&#xD;
      Rasipuram Government Hospital in the state of Tamil Nadu in India will be offered&#xD;
      participation in an educational session on HIV infection and transmission. It will include a&#xD;
      pre-educational assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs, and a post-educational&#xD;
      assessment of knowledge about HIV infection and transmission. All women at the clinic,&#xD;
      regardless of whether or not they participate in the educational and assessment sessions,&#xD;
      will be offered HIV counseling and testing. The objectives of this stage of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the acceptance of education about HIV infection and transmission among pregnant&#xD;
           women at the participating sites and their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the acceptance of voluntary counseling and HIV testing among pregnant women at&#xD;
           these sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the prevalence of infection among women who accept HIV testing at these sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant HIV-infected women at the pregnancy clinics at the Namakkal District Hospital or the&#xD;
      Rasipuram Government Hospital who are 18 years of age or older will be offered enrollment in&#xD;
      Stage II of this study. Participants will be followed during their pregnancy and until their&#xD;
      baby is a year old. The baby will be a part of the study from birth to one year of age. After&#xD;
      delivery, both the mother and baby will be followed with regularly scheduled visits that&#xD;
      include a physical examination and blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with the anti-AIDS drug zidovudine will be offered for both the mother and child.&#xD;
      For the study protocol, the mother will receive the drug starting the 28th week of pregnancy&#xD;
      and continuing through labor and delivery. The infants will start drug treatment within the&#xD;
      first 24 hours of life and continue for 6 weeks. Women who do not choose to take zidovudine&#xD;
      according to this schedule will be offered standard treatment with a shorter course of drug,&#xD;
      beginning with the 36th week of pregnancy, and no preventative treatment for their infants.&#xD;
      All women will be offered education and counseling about the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      breastfeeding and the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding. The objectives of this&#xD;
      stage of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of zidovudine given according to this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the acceptance of and adherence to the zidovudine regimen in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the acceptance of education and counseling about breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the mother-to-child HIV transmission rates in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rates of illness and death through 12 months after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV&#xD;

      This study is divided into two stages. In Stage I, all women registered in the antenatal&#xD;
      clinics at the Namakkal District Hospital or at the Rasipuram Government Hospital in the&#xD;
      state of Tamil Nadu in India will be offered the opportunity to participate in an educational&#xD;
      session on HIV infection and transmission. With informed consent, a systematic sample of the&#xD;
      population will be asked to participate in a pre-educational session assessment of knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and beliefs, and in a post-educational assessment of knowledge, regarding HIV&#xD;
      infection and transmission. All women will be offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing,&#xD;
      irrespective of participation in the education session (those who refuse to participate&#xD;
      although education offered) and in the pre- and post-educational assessments (those among the&#xD;
      systematic sample who do not provide signed informed consent). The objectives of Stage I are:&#xD;
      (1) to assess the acceptance of education regarding HIV infection and transmission among&#xD;
      antenatal women at the participating clinical sites and, among a systematic sample of those&#xD;
      offered such education, to assess knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs, as well as changes in&#xD;
      knowledge; (2) to assess the acceptance of voluntary counseling and HIV testing among&#xD;
      antenatal women at the participating clinical sites; and (3) to describe the HIV&#xD;
      seroprevalence among antenatal women at the participating clinical sites who accept HIV&#xD;
      testing. The main outcomes of interest are the proportions of women in the antenatal clinics&#xD;
      who agree to undergo HIV testing and, of these, the proportion who are seropositive for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV seropositive women will be offered enrollment in Stage II (a prospective cohort study).&#xD;
      All women enrolled in the prospective cohort study will be offered education and counseling&#xD;
      regarding infant feeding, i.e. the risks and benefits of breastfeeding, factors which are&#xD;
      likely to increase the risk of transmission through breastfeeding, and the potential&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages of early weaning from breastmilk and replacement feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women enrolled in the prospective cohort study at Rasipuram Government Hospital who meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be offered Protocol ZDV/NVP: zidovudine prophylaxis beginning at 28&#xD;
      weeks gestation (or as soon as possible thereafter up to 36 weeks gestation if late&#xD;
      presentation for antenatal care or other reasons preclude initiation at 28 weeks) and&#xD;
      continuing through labor until delivery, and one dose of nevirapine at the onset of labor or&#xD;
      as soon as possible thereafter. Their infants will receive zidovudine beginning within the&#xD;
      first 24 hours of life and continuing through the end of the sixth week of life, and one dose&#xD;
      of nevirapine within 24 hours after birth. Those women who decline protocol ZDV/NVP, or who&#xD;
      enroll after 32 weeks gestation, can receive the standard of care: the two dose nevirapine&#xD;
      regimen. (Women enrolled at Namakkal District Hospital could receive the two-dose nevirapine&#xD;
      regimen.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of Stage II are: (1) to assess the safety and tolerability of protocol&#xD;
      ZDV/NVP; (2) to assess the acceptance of, and adherence to, protocol ZDV/NVP; (3) to assess&#xD;
      the acceptance of education and counseling regarding infant feeding; and (4) to describe the&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission rates, among HIV-infected women and their infants enrolled in&#xD;
      the prospective cohort study. The secondary objectives of Stage II are: (1) to describe&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates through 12 months after delivery/birth; and (2) to describe&#xD;
      risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV, among HIV-infected women and their&#xD;
      infants enrolled in the prospective cohort study. The primary outcomes of interest are the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of protocol ZDV/NVP, the proportion of HIV-infected women who agree&#xD;
      to receive protocol ZDV/NVP, the mother-to-child HIV transmission rate (overall as well as&#xD;
      according to receipt of protocol ZDV/NVP and infant feeding modality), and risk factors for&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
