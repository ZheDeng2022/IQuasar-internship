      The purpose of this study is to collect information about what happens to certain chemicals&#xD;
      produced in the body called hormones during respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis.&#xD;
      Bronchiolitis is an infection of small airways in the lungs caused by a virus. This&#xD;
      infection, which causes swelling and injury in the lungs, is commonly seen in infants and&#xD;
      children less than 2 years of age.&#xD;

      Intravascular volume and serum osmolality are tightly regulated by a balance of various&#xD;
      neurohumoral mediators. In critical illness, these regulatory mediators may be modified by&#xD;
      disease or treatment, either benefiting or harming the patient. Such regulatory mediators of&#xD;
      intravascular volume and fluid balance include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) and vasopressin (also called antidiuretic hormone-ADH). Although&#xD;
      well studied in adult cardiac patients, these neurohormones have not been investigated in&#xD;
      pediatric respiratory diseases such as bronchiolitis, a common cause of admission to the&#xD;
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Understanding the effects of pediatric respiratory&#xD;
      diseases and treatment interventions on the concentrations of these neurohormonal regulators&#xD;
      such as ANP and BNP is a crucial first step in formulating more effective fluid therapy. For&#xD;
      example, some patients with bronchiolitis have elevated ADH levels. Increased ADH&#xD;
      concentration predisposes to fluid retention and increases the risk of pulmonary edema. Since&#xD;
      ANP and BNP antagonize the action of ADH, simultaneous measurement of all three hormones may&#xD;
      help elucidate the mechanisms of fluid balance in bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP in infants and children&#xD;
      with bronchiolitis are inversely associated with ADH concentration and lung hyperinflation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP in bronchiolitis are associated directly&#xD;
      with increased oxygen requirement and positive fluid balance. The significance of this study&#xD;
      is to better understand the relationship between various neurohormones that regulate&#xD;
      intravascular fluid volume in patients with respiratory failure and bronchiolitis. The&#xD;
      understanding of this complex relationship has the potential to improve fluid/diuretic&#xD;
      therapy and patient outcome with severe respiratory distress in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 100 patients in this study. The population will be infants and children&#xD;
      between 37 weeks and 2 years of age (corrected for gestational age). 50 patients with&#xD;
      bronchiolitis will be enrolled to collect ANP, BNP, and ADH plasma levels along with serum&#xD;
      osmolality and urine osmolality for up to 5 consecutive days in Shands Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: 50 control patients will be enrolled to record normal baseline plasma ANP, BNP,&#xD;
      and ADH at the time of admission in Shands Hospital surgical center at the University of&#xD;
      Florida.&#xD;
