      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the experimental malaria vaccine&#xD;
      AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark) and determine whether a new, additional component&#xD;
      of the vaccine may increase its effectiveness. Malaria is a debilitating and potentially&#xD;
      fatal blood disease transmitted by a parasite found in certain mosquitoes. The AMA1-C1&#xD;
      vaccine has been designed to create an immune response against the parasite and prevent the&#xD;
      disease. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the additional component-protein&#xD;
      pieces known as CpG- improves the immune response to the vaccine without causing problematic&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers must be healthy adults between 18 and 45 years old. Individuals who have had&#xD;
      malaria in the past or have recently traveled to areas where malaria is endemic will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood&#xD;
      tests, and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be involved in a three-stage study. In the first stage, a group of&#xD;
      participants will receive either a high dose of the vaccine alone or a low dose combined with&#xD;
      the CpG protein. In the second stage, a different group of participants will receive a high&#xD;
      dose of the vaccine alone or a high dose combined with CpG. In the third stage, a larger&#xD;
      group of participants will receive a high dose of the vaccine alone or a high dose combined&#xD;
      with CpG. The vaccine will be injected into the muscle of the upper arm, and all participants&#xD;
      will receive three doses of the vaccine with 28 days between doses to monitor possible&#xD;
      reactions and side effects. Participants will be monitored for 30 minutes after each&#xD;
      injection and will record any symptoms they experience over the six days after receiving&#xD;
      their dose. In addition, participants will be examined over the course of six months during&#xD;
      and after the trial with physical exams and blood and urine tests.&#xD;

      Purpose: This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the experimental malaria&#xD;
      vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark), and the ability of the TLR-9 agonist CPG&#xD;
      7909 oligodexoynucleotide (ODN) to augment antibody response to the vaccine and alter the&#xD;
      Th1/Th2 bias. The vaccine preparations to be studied contain an equal mixture of AMA1 from&#xD;
      two different clones of Plasmodium falciparum (FVO and 3D7), both produced separately as&#xD;
      recombinant proteins expressed by Pichia pastoris (PpAMA-1 FVO and PpAMA-1 3D7). Bulk PpAMA-1&#xD;
      antigens were purified from culture medium of transformed yeast grown in a 60L fermenter. The&#xD;
      correctly folded PpAMA-1 was purified from this mixture by a combination of affinity, ionic,&#xD;
      hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography. Purified PpAMA-1 FVO and PpAMA-1 3D7 were&#xD;
      subsequently mixed and adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide gel (Alhydrogel® (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark)). The CPG 7909 ODN formulation used in this study (CPG 7909) is manufactured by&#xD;
      Coley Pharmaceutical Group. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive Alhydrogel®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark) formulated vaccine with or without CPG 7909 in a point of use&#xD;
      formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Environment: The study will be conducted at the University of Rochester Vaccine and&#xD;
      Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Subjects for this study will be healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years&#xD;
      with no history of malaria or of recent travel to malaria-endemic areas. Subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in three consecutive dose-escalation cohorts with review by a Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee between cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation: Subjects will receive three vaccinations with the AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark) vaccine formulated in Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark) with or&#xD;
      without CPG 7909 adjuvant over 2 months (0, 1, 2 months) by intramuscular (IM) injection.&#xD;
      Subjects will have multiple blood samples obtained over the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be Investigated: Samples will be tested for binding antibody to AMA1 and for&#xD;
      ability to inhibit the growth of plasmodia in vitro. In addition, antigen-specific activated&#xD;
      B cells in peripheral blood will be enumerated, as well as the relative ratio of&#xD;
      antigen-specific Th1-like and Th2-like T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefits: The risks of participating in this study are those associated with&#xD;
      administration of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark) and of CPG 7909, and include&#xD;
      local pain, systemic inflammatory responses including fever and influenza-like symptoms, and&#xD;
      induction of autoimmune responses. As with any other investigational vaccine, there are&#xD;
      unknown risks. Subjects may derive no benefit from participation in this study. Development&#xD;
      of effective vaccines to prevent malaria is an important societal benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: Volunteers will have code numbers and will not be identified by name.&#xD;
