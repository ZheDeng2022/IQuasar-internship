      PEGS BackgroundPEGS Phenotype-by-Genotype Beginnings&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Personalized Environment and Genes Study (PEGS) aims to provide a resource for&#xD;
      environmental health translational research by examining gene-environment interactions in&#xD;
      health and disease. The PEGS started in 2005 as a phenotype-by-genotype registry of&#xD;
      participants who had donated DNA samples, and who had agreed to be contacted for follow-up&#xD;
      clinical translational studies based on their DNA genotypes. At the time, the only&#xD;
      information available was a participant s age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Further phenotyping&#xD;
      of a participant and/or any biospecimens obtained were investigated during a follow-up&#xD;
      translational clinical study on participants recruited based on their genotype (hence&#xD;
      phenotype-by-genotype) and the PEGS was the first recruit-by- genotype study at the&#xD;
      NIH.1Following a period focused on recruiting approximately 15,000 participants to enable&#xD;
      genotyping of rare (approximately 1% minor allele frequency) single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      (SNPs), the PEGS Consortium Project was undertaken in 2010- 2011 to examine, using the DNA of&#xD;
      nearly 4,000 participants ( the PEGS 4000 ), approximately 700 SNPs in approximately 80&#xD;
      environmental response genes that work in concert with environmental exposures to elicit a&#xD;
      phenotype.2Several clinical follow-up studies, genotype-phenotype association studies, and&#xD;
      publications have resulted from the PEGS Consortium Project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEGS Recruiting by Genotype, Phenotype, and/or Exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      To expand phenotype information available to researchers, between 2013-2014, the PEGS Health&#xD;
      and Exposure Questionnaire was administered and has had responses from approximately 9,000&#xD;
      participants. This has proven to be a great resource for genotype-phenotype association&#xD;
      studies and the protocol was amended to allow disease and exposure specific recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEGS Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the PEGS is to provide a resource for environmental health translational research&#xD;
      by examining gene-environment interactions in health and disease by the following three aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incorporate information of individuals for environmental health translational research&#xD;
      through multiple data sources through a personalized/precision medicine based approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extend the PEGS as a resource to both intramural and extramural investigators through&#xD;
      collaborations and providing accessible databases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engage as a longitudinal study taking advantage of cross-sectional information already&#xD;
      obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEGS Aim 1: PEGS as a Personalized/Precision Medicine Based ResourcePEGS Population-based&#xD;
      Resource Beginnings&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEGS started out as a population-based resource where investigators could access&#xD;
      participants based on genotypes for further clinical/translational studies. The idea of using&#xD;
      the cohort for population-based studies fully emerged after approximately 9,000 participants&#xD;
      provided phenotype and some exposure data between 2013-2014. Genotype-phenotype association&#xD;
      studies began in earnest at that time through the NIEHS PEGS Laboratory and the ability of&#xD;
      enabling studies of larger population groups within the PEGS began to emerge. A second&#xD;
      population-based questionnaire was given to participants in early 2017 to study the external&#xD;
      and internal exposomes . After the initial web-based only effort, approximately 3,000&#xD;
      participants have completed the two-part survey. Plans have also started to take advantage of&#xD;
      the prospective nature of the PEGS and the advantages of a longitudinal study over a cross-&#xD;
      sectional one in studying gene-environment interactions (see PEGS Aim 3: PEGS as a&#xD;
      Longitudinal Study below). However, the interest of most investigators has focused on sub-&#xD;
      groups of the PEGS based on questionnaire answers such as asthmatics, those with Crohn s and&#xD;
      other auto-immune diseases, smokers, black cohosh users, etc. A major utility of the PEGS has&#xD;
      also been its ability to provide control participants for study groups of interest. For&#xD;
      example, several groups have undertaken projects to genotype participants DNA for&#xD;
      polymorphisms in genes that when placed in transgenic mice have given phenotypes (such as&#xD;
      diabetes) with an interest in finding a milder phenotype (such as insulin resistance) in&#xD;
      participants with the polymorphism. In addition, investigators prefer participants who are&#xD;
      able to come in to the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit and the focus in recruitment for these&#xD;
      studies is often on PEGS participants who live within 100 miles of Research Triangle Park,&#xD;
      NC. Hence there are limitations for the PEGS as a strictly population-based cohort for&#xD;
      studies, and a great interest in specific groups of patients which can augment an&#xD;
      investigator s need for specific groups of patients based on an individual s genotype,&#xD;
      phenotype, and external and internal exposome/exposures to pursue the investigator-driven&#xD;
      environmental health translational research.&#xD;

      phenotype, and external and internal exposome/exposures to pursue the investigator-driven&#xD;
      environmental health translational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized/Precision Medicine Based Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a desire of investigators to utilize specific groups of PEGS participants, the PEGS is&#xD;
      well poised to take advantage of a personalized/precision medicine approach for future&#xD;
      studies. Precision medicine grew out of a 2011 National Research Council (NRC) publication,&#xD;
      Toward Precision Medicine which proposed an Information Commons of data collection (an&#xD;
      individual s exposome, signs and symptoms, genome, epigenome, microbiome, and other types of&#xD;
      patient data) as the basis of a transformative paradigm in individual health care that per&#xD;
      the NRC would lead to more accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatments, and ultimately&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes. The NIH s Precision Medicine Initiative, now the All of US&#xD;
      Research Program, was one of two national programs (the other being the Precision Medicine&#xD;
      Initiative for Oncology) to focus on bringing this vision to fruition. All of Us is described&#xD;
      as a participant- engaged, data-driven enterprise supporting research at the intersection of&#xD;
      human biology, behavior, genetics, environment, data science, computation and much more to&#xD;
      produce new knowledge with the goal of developing more effective ways to treat disease with&#xD;
      the goal of enrolling 1 million participants nationwide. The PEGS, over the last few years,&#xD;
      has been building the infrastructure and pursuing the goal of similarly merging data&#xD;
      regarding an individual s genome, exposome, epigenome, microbiome, and electronic health&#xD;
      records (EHR) to examine gene-environment interactions in health and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of PEGS with Personalized/Precision Medicine Based Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEGS has begun collaborating with individuals involved in the NCATS funded Biomedical&#xD;
      Data Translator Program (Translator) which is an initiative to develop a comprehensive,&#xD;
      relational, N-dimensional Biomedical Data Translator that integrates multiple types of&#xD;
      existing data sources, including objective signs and symptoms of disease, drug effects, and&#xD;
      intervening types of biological data relevant to understanding pathophysiology. One&#xD;
      illustrative use-case of the Translator demonstrates the potential of a precision medicine&#xD;
      approach examining individual s gene environment and clinical data that integrates research&#xD;
      surrounding a rare group of participants and a larger cohort. Drs. Maureen Hoatlin and&#xD;
      Melissa Haendel of the Oregon Health and Science University are integrating through developed&#xD;
      ontology, data from patients with Fanconi Anemia (a rare hereditary disorder with defective&#xD;
      DNA damage response and repair) with those with deficient aldehyde processing (540 million&#xD;
      people worldwide are deficient in acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) activity through a&#xD;
      single polymorphism,&#xD;
&#xD;
      which can manifest as Asian Flushing Syndrome with alcohol consumption). Fanconi anemia&#xD;
      patients with polymorphisms in ALDH2 have accelerated progression of bone marrow failure as&#xD;
      do those with idiopathic aplastic anemia. Individuals with the alcohol flushing response are&#xD;
      also at an elevated risk of squamous cell esophageal cancer from alcohol consumption and may&#xD;
      be at heightened risk of other pathologies. The Oregon Translator use-case project is&#xD;
      exploring through genomic, environmental, and clinical database integration how other&#xD;
      aldehyde gene variants modify the Fanconi anemia phenotype and how exposures in general&#xD;
      affect those with ALDH2 variants compared to those without variants. A collaborator of the&#xD;
      Oregon Translator project, Dr. Peter Robinson of the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine&#xD;
      who is heading the Monarch Initiative, which developed the Human Phenotype Ontology, a&#xD;
      vocabulary to describe human disease features (phenotypes), is interested in using the PEGS&#xD;
      Exposome Survey data as part of his effort to develop a similar ontology for exposures.&#xD;
      Because of the overlap between PEGS and UNC participants [at least approximately 6,000; data&#xD;
      from the UNC affiliated Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) unpublished], the PEGS is&#xD;
      working with members of the Translator teams to collaborate on existing use-case scenarios&#xD;
      including one with Dr. Ashok Krishnamurthy at UNC which is examining the asthma-like&#xD;
      phenotype (clinically observable signs and symptoms and characteristic test results) in the&#xD;
      context of an asthma endotype [biomarkers, biological pathways, genetic background, and&#xD;
      (socio)environmental exposures]. The Translator collaborations are just one illustrating how&#xD;
      the PEGS could use a precision medicine-type of approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another example of a collaborative efforts that uses small precision medicine accessible&#xD;
      populations within the PEGS is in the examination of the microbiome. In collaboration with&#xD;
      Dr. Stavros Garantziotis, PEGS asthmatic participants with a polymorphism in the TLR5 gene&#xD;
      are having their microbiome examined in comparison with controls. High impact papers have&#xD;
      recently found microbiome correlations with several small disease cohorts including Alzheimer&#xD;
      s disease (using 25 Alzheimer s patients), posttraumatic stress disorder (using 18&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder patients), and dPEGSession (using 44 irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      patients). Similar precision medicine driven studies can be used involving epigenomic and&#xD;
      exposome factors, such as PEGS black cohosh using participants. The PEGS plans to utilize&#xD;
      specific groups including arhinia participants, hypothalamic amenorrhea participants, and&#xD;
      other more specific groups involving pediatric participant, and groups from the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center in the near future to uniquely address gene-environmental interactions in unique&#xD;
      populations that may have broader implications. Enriching for these types of specific groups&#xD;
      will make the PEGS even more valuable as a resource both at the NIEHS and with extramural&#xD;
      collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEGS Aim 2: PEGS as a Resource for both Intramural and Extramural Investigators through&#xD;
      Collaborations and Providing Accessible Databases&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEGS Existing Databases&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEGS has a Master Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database to facilitate rapid access to&#xD;
      genotype data on PEGS participants. Prior to creation of the database, genotype readings had&#xD;
      been stored in individual files (one per SNP), with individual files for specific&#xD;
      investigator projects. This arrangement flowed out of the above-mentioned PEGS Consortium&#xD;
      Project in which multiple investigators collectively identified over 600 SNPs from candidate&#xD;
      genes in a range of diseases approximately 3,700 PEGS participants were then genotyped on&#xD;
      those 600+ SNPs. Investigators could receive their specified SNP files from the set. Over&#xD;
      time, however, additional SNPs and PEGS participants have been genotyped, generating yet more&#xD;
      files. It is not infrequent to combine newer and older readings, and to join these with&#xD;
      phenotypic data now available from the Health and Exposure Survey and the Exposome Survey.&#xD;
      Also, investigators sometimes have an interest sharing their SNPs sets in collaborative&#xD;
      efforts. The Master SNP Database supports these needs by aggregating all genotypes in one SAS&#xD;
      dataset making it easy to select any combination of SNPs desired for a given analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEGS is using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) for a Core Medical History Form&#xD;
      obtained on participants seen in the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit and future administration&#xD;
      of the Health and Exposure Survey. REDCap is a secure web application for building and&#xD;
      managing online surveys and databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information is made available to internal and external investigators through a review&#xD;
      process. Additional information when obtained, may be placed into public facing databases,&#xD;
      such as DbGAP for whole genome sequencing data, when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic Health Records&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personalized/precision medicine based approach requires data from many sources from&#xD;
      individual participants to enhance the effectiveness of translational research, including&#xD;
      clinical data. To facilitate this approach, the PEGS will obtain electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR) data from a number of collaborating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from UNC will be obtained in collaboration with the North Carolina Translational and&#xD;
      Clinical Sciences (TraCS) Institute at UNC. This will ultimately allow the PEGS to link and&#xD;
      analyze UNC EHR data with PEGS study data for the estimated 6,000 PEGS participants with UNC&#xD;
      records (information from RENCI). The ongoing collaboration began with a use case (described&#xD;
      in Examples of PEGS with Personalized/Precision Medicine Based Approach) which may also&#xD;
      involve the UNC Translator use case project examining asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEGS will also obtain EHR data through an ongoing collaboration with Duke University. The&#xD;
      size of the overlapping Duke-PEGS population is being determined as a first step in the&#xD;
      collaboration. Characterization of this overlap will inform the strategy and prioritization&#xD;
      of EHR&#xD;
&#xD;
      sharing. When the PEGS obtains Duke EHR data, it will be linked and analyzed with PEGS study&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UNC and Duke are part of the Carolina Collaborative, a consortium of Health Sciences South&#xD;
      Carolina and four Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) programs that also&#xD;
      includes Medical University of South Carolina, UNC and Wake Forest University, which is a&#xD;
      data resource that harmonizes the EHR data of these institutions to expedite clinical&#xD;
      research and quality improvement. The PEGS is engaged in talks with members of the&#xD;
      Collaborative to similarly gain access to EHRs for overlap participants with other medical&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole Genome / Whole Exome Sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pursuit of the best utilization of a precision based medicine approach to environmental&#xD;
      health translational research and pivotal to examining gene-environment interactions in&#xD;
      health and disease, the PEGS will extensively genotype the DNA of approximately 9,000 PEGS&#xD;
      participant through a combination of whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and SNP&#xD;
      arrays with imputation. Besides having value in specific groups of interest, sequencing&#xD;
      healthy controls may have research benefits beyond polymorphism associated research. As part&#xD;
      of the MedSeq project, 50 generally healthy adults were sequenced. Eleven of the 50 had&#xD;
      variants of rare diseases, though only two showed demonstrable signs of disease. One had a&#xD;
      variant for fundus albipunctatus with poor night vision and the other a variant for variegate&#xD;
      porphyria, a condition that manifests as sunlight sensitivity and reactions to certain&#xD;
      medications. However, every individual in the MedSeq study had at least one recessive carrier&#xD;
      gene linked to certain conditions. Importantly, PEGS participants with actionable variants of&#xD;
      pathological genes will have genetic counseling made available to them through NHGRI, once&#xD;
      the variations are confirmed by a CLIA certified laboratory by NHGRI. Studies of individuals&#xD;
      in the PEGS in the context of specific disease groups, exposure groups, or as healthy groups&#xD;
      in conjunction with other precision medicine information will greatly enhance the PEGS s&#xD;
      ability to answer environmental health translational research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing data on PEGS participants will be placed into DbGAP and individual level&#xD;
      information will be made available to investigators through a yet to be determined process.&#xD;
      Data will be also stored at NIEHS to facilitate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEGS Collaborations&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing resources which investigators can independently use after a review&#xD;
      process through the PEGS Internal Advisory Committee (IAC)/PEGS Principal Investigator (PI),&#xD;
      the PEGS seeks both intramural and extramural collaborations. Examples extramurally include&#xD;
      the aforementioned Translator UNC asthma use case scenario, using the PEGS Exposome Survey&#xD;
      data to develop a human exposure ontology, linking PEGS data with UNC EHRs in collaboration&#xD;
      with TraCS, and genotyping, sample selection, and data analysis for external investigators&#xD;
      through the PEGS laboratory. In addition, the PEGS is in talks with the All of Us research&#xD;
      program to make the Exposome available for their planned Precision Medicine Initiative&#xD;
      cohort. Intramural collaboration examples include the above-mentioned microbiome&#xD;
      collaborative study, and numerous genotype-phenotype correlation studies where genotyping,&#xD;
      statistical analysis are provided by the PEGS laboratory in conjunction with study planning&#xD;
      and conclusion determination in collaboration with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate collaborations, the PEGS is also part of the recently formed The Genomic&#xD;
      Ascertainment Cohort (TGAC). This will be a super-cohort of at least 10,000 research&#xD;
&#xD;
      participants who have undergone exome or genome sequencing, and who are available for post-&#xD;
      sequencing phenotyping in order to facilitate predictive genomic medicine studies at NIH.&#xD;
      Participating individuals will be consented in a way that data can be shared and subjects&#xD;
      recalled to answer additional questions beyond those of the original study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contributors to the super-cohort include the PEGS, the NIH ClinSeq cohort, the Inova&#xD;
      Translational Medicine Institute, intramural NIH investigators who have a group of &gt;= 100&#xD;
      research participants who are consented for sequencing and genotyping, and others when deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the project oversight committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further facilitate collaborations, PEGS is joining with the Coronavirus Pandemic&#xD;
      Epidemiology (COPE) Consortium, headed by the Mongan Institute at Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital, to assist in understanding COVID-19 symptoms, engage in a comprehensive assessment&#xD;
      of COVID-19 risk factors, and understand the long-term health factors from the pandemic. PEGS&#xD;
      is interested in advancing COVID-19 research by utilizing its large active research cohort&#xD;
      with a repository containing health and environmental exposure data. This data is useful in&#xD;
      understanding how COVID-19 infection affects a range of health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, understanding the broad impacts of COVID-19 are key to correctly interpreting&#xD;
      future exposure-disease relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial phase of collaboration, PEGS encourages participants to sign up for the&#xD;
      consortium s COVID Symptom Study App, developed by King s College and Zoe Global, Ltd.&#xD;
      Participants can choose to input their symptoms in the daily symptom tracker, which&#xD;
      integrates symptom data with participant information collected by the app. Eventually, PEGS&#xD;
      will integrate PEGS participants consortium data with their PEGS data. PEGS will receive data&#xD;

      App. Any analysis of this data would be submitted as a separate protocol to the IRB for&#xD;

      PEGS Aim 3: PEGS as a Longitudinal Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures begin in utero and epigenetic changes are crucial to the developing embryo. Life&#xD;
      course studies have shown that early life environmental processes influence adult function&#xD;
      and the likelihood to acquire chronic diseases later in life. Chronic diseases are a result&#xD;
      of more than an individual s genetic variants and are most likely a result of environmental&#xD;
      and behavioral stressors interacting with genetic predisposition. Cross-sectional studies&#xD;
      have limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
      in detecting gene-environment interactions while longitudinal and prospective cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      studies can characterize exposures and risk factors before disease onset, therefore reducing&#xD;
      some of the common biases of case-control studies and the assessment of environmental risk&#xD;
      factors. As a case and point, individuals who grew up during World War 1 would be expected to&#xD;
      have different exposures and lived under different circumstances than those who grew up&#xD;
      during the Great Depression, the Green Revolution of the late 60s early 70s, or the present.&#xD;
      In addition, with the necessity of keeping health and exposure data up to date to match other&#xD;
      precision based medicine data, it is imperative to repeat measurements of PEGS participants&#xD;
      throughout their life course. To this end, the PEGS has begun pediatric recruitment which is&#xD;
      a valuable asset not just to the PEGS but investigators interested in pediatric research&#xD;
      associated questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires developed by the PEGS are now available in electronic form and can be easily&#xD;
      re- administered to participants, which is crucial for obtaining follow-up health and disease&#xD;
      information that follows participants as they age and are likely to develop diseases, and&#xD;
      also for tracking their exposures across a lifetime. Questionnaires available for&#xD;
      longitudinal analysis include the PEGS Health and Exposure Survey and the PEGS Exposome&#xD;
      Survey, in addition to investigator developed questionnaires. Also, PEGS has developed the&#xD;
      infrastructure for obtaining repeat blood samples or saliva samples. This is important for&#xD;
      gathering biospecimens for analysis of epigenetic changes that may have occurred after&#xD;
      significant exposures or length of time. Similarly, microbiome sampling may be conducted in a&#xD;
      longitudinal manner.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-Pregnant adults (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) or minors (ages 8-17&#xD;
             years old) are eligible to enroll in the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to understand and provide written informed consent (adult&#xD;
             participants or parent/ guardian of minors) and assent (minors) to participate.&#xD;
