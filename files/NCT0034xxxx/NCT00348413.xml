    <textblock>
      This project will compare the efficacy and safety of 2 methods of disease modification in the&#xD;
      treatment of active moderate and severe thyroid orbitopathy. A prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel, controlled multidisciplinary clinical trial involving Singapore&#xD;
      National Eye Centre, National University Hospital, Changi General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng&#xD;
      Hospital and University of British Columbia Orbital Services, Singapore Eye Research&#xD;
      Institute, Singapore General Hospital Endocrinology and Radiology Departments and Tan Tock&#xD;
      Seng Hospital Rheumatology Department is planned. The SingHealth-SGH High Field MR Research&#xD;
      Laboratory will be involved in the MR imaging of the trial patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      this trial. After informed consent (Appendix B) is obtained, each patient will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of two treatment arms: 1) Intravenous high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone (1 gram&#xD;
      infusion over 1 hour per day with a total of 3 doses over 3 days; 4 cycles at 6 weekly&#xD;
      intervals) and oral placebo and 2) Intravenous high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone (same&#xD;
      dose) plus oral methotrexate 7.5 mg per week for 2 weeks, increased to 10 mg per week for&#xD;
      another 2 weeks then 12.5 mg per week for 5 months (total 6 months of methotrexate&#xD;
      treatment). Depending on patient response, the dose can be further increased by 2.5mg per&#xD;
      week every 4 weeks to a maximum of 20 mg per week. A strict management protocol will be&#xD;
      observed for each recruited patient. Patients who develop adverse side effects or need for&#xD;
      surgical intervention will receive appropriate treatment (i.e. treatment will deviate from&#xD;
      the protocol but will continue to be monitored). Patients who refuse treatment will be&#xD;
      observed clinically and with imaging as a natural control group until such time as&#xD;
      intervention is accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have a baseline assessment followed by regular visits to assess treatment&#xD;
      response and adverse effects. Observations will include the use of an inflammatory index,&#xD;
      motility measurements including quantitative ductions, exophthalmometry readings, palpebral&#xD;
      aperture readings and indices of optic nerve function. With regards to the imaging, the&#xD;
      patients will be assessed with an initial quantitative CT scan and 3-Tesla MRI scan prior to&#xD;
      treatment. After treatment is started, patients will also undergo repeat MRI scan at 24 weeks&#xD;
      and 72 weeks to assess quantitative changes with treatment using the Muscle Diameter Index&#xD;
      (MDI) and Pixel Value Ratio (PVR) for the inferior rectus, superior rectus, the medial&#xD;
      rectus, lateral rectus and orbital fat (Appendix E). Serum and urine will be obtained at the&#xD;
      same time intervals as the MRI scan to assess levels of thyroid hormones, thyroid antibodies&#xD;
      and urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Free T4, free T3 and TSH will be recorded to monitor&#xD;
      control of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid antibodies measured will include thyroid stimulating&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (TSI), thyrotropin-binding inhibition antibody (TB II), thyroid peroxidase&#xD;
      antibodies and thyroglobulin antibody. Other tests including the full blood count, urea and&#xD;
      electrolytes will be run prior to each dose of steroid treatment and during follow-up to&#xD;
      monitor for adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the assessments will be analyzed for significant differences in treatment&#xD;
      response between the 2 groups. The indices of interest will include the percentage of&#xD;
      patients in each group who demonstrate a decrease in the inflammatory index of at least 2&#xD;
      points and the time taken for 50% of patients to show such a decrease. Other parameters that&#xD;
      reflect the visual function and motility will be compared at different points in time after&#xD;
      starting treatment to observe response and sustainability of response. From the serial MRI&#xD;
      scans, quantitative analysis of orbital tissues will be done to identify changes with&#xD;
      treatment. Antibody and GAG levels will be analyzed to detect any change with treatment. The&#xD;
      types and frequency of adverse side effects in the 2 groups will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 normal subjects will be recruited for MRI scan of the orbits and brain to obtain normative&#xD;
      values for the MDI and PVR for the Asian population (Appendix E). This will include 20&#xD;
      subjects from each of 4 decades (21-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years, 51-60 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normative data will also be used to create a virtual orbital atlas. This aspect of the&#xD;
      study will be performed in collaboration with the Labs for Information Technology (A-Star).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since 1835 when Graves first described the eye changes in thyroid disease, considerable&#xD;
      literature on investigating the basic disease process, the clinical behaviour, natural&#xD;
      history and various medical and surgical treatments on thyroid orbitopathy has developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Pathogenesis 11, 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLA-DR histocompatibility loci which play a role in T-cell response have been associated with&#xD;
      thyroid orbitopathy but no specific gene has been identified as yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that TSH receptors may be the autoantigen in Graves' hyperthyroidism,&#xD;
      orbitopathy and pretibial myxoedema. Somehow, T-lymphocytes are activated and proceed to&#xD;
      infiltrate orbital and other soft tissues. This sets off cytokine release which together with&#xD;
      oxygen free radicals and fibrogenic growth factors leads to increased hydrophilic&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis and pre-adipocyte transformation. The overall effect is an&#xD;
      increase in orbital muscle and fat volume and inflammatory oedema which ultimately may result&#xD;
      in muscle fibrosis and optic nerve compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histopathological features correlate with the immunogenetic theory in thyroid&#xD;
      orbitopathy. The extraocular muscles are infiltrated by lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma&#xD;
      cells and mast cells. Hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides are deposited and are seen separating&#xD;
      the muscle bundles and fibres. In the later stages, fibrosis and muscle degeneration with fat&#xD;
      replacement is noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Clinical Features&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on literature review and the experience of the University of Columbia Orbital Clinic&#xD;
      which saw over 2000 cases from 1976 to 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Indices of disease activity (largely subjective)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acuity of onset and progression&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Acute (within a week) or subacute (3 months or under 3 months) or chronic&#xD;
                     onset (over 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Slow or rapid development (progression)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjective symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Spontaneous retrobulbar pain&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pain on extraocular movement&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Soft tissue features&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Swelling, injection and chemosis noted by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient assessment of symptoms and signs - Same, better or worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Indices of disease severity and extent (largely objective)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lid and conjunctival swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Extraocular muscle function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proptosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Optic nerve function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Imaging changes in orbital tissues The NOSPECS classification of thyroid&#xD;
                orbitopathy 13,14 does not give a clear picture of disease activity and severity.&#xD;
                It does not guide prognostication and management and is thus abandoned in favour of&#xD;
                the above assessment which looks specifically at indices which allow one to judge&#xD;
                whether the disease is active and how severe it is 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From such an assessment, a treatment algorithm can be formulated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Current Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact aetiology and pathophysiology of thyroid orbitopathy remains unclear, what&#xD;
      is known about the disease suggests an autoimmune mechanism at work 1,2. The initial phase of&#xD;
      the disease is marked by clinical inflammatory changes and is followed by quiescence during&#xD;
      which cicatricial and persistent orbital volume changes are more pronounced. In this latter&#xD;
      phase, surgery alone works to alleviate symptoms. To avoid these end-stage developments, the&#xD;
      disease should be treated during the active stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent trend in the management of thyroid orbitopathy has been to treat active disease with&#xD;
      intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone 1,3-8. This step away from oral steroids arose from a&#xD;
      desire to avoid the many known complications of prolonged oral steroid use as well as&#xD;
      perceived lower success rates with the use of oral steroids. Marcocci et al 9 published in&#xD;
      August 2001 results of a prospective, single-blind, randomized study that compared the&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerability of intravenous or oral glucocorticoids in association with&#xD;
      orbital radiotherapy in the treatment of severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. This and other&#xD;
      studies found that both treatments were effective (60-85% showing improvement) with the&#xD;
      intravenous route associated with a lower rate of side effects. 3,4,5,6,7,9 Another treatment&#xD;
      was reported by Smith and Rosenbaum in the British Journal of Ophthalmology 10. They&#xD;
      described the use of oral methotrexate in the management of non-infectious orbital&#xD;
      inflammatory disease. In their study, there were 3 patients with recalcitrant thyroid&#xD;
      orbitopathy who had previously been treated with oral prednisolone, irradiation and surgical&#xD;
      decompression. Two were still on oral prednisolone when oral methotrexate was started. All 3&#xD;
      showed clinical benefit and the 2 who were also on steroids initially were eventually able to&#xD;
      cease steroid use. The good response may well be due to the fact that methotrexate, with its&#xD;
      T-cell inhibiting effect, succeeded in halting the disease process especially when used&#xD;
      together with corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment for those with progressively worse moderate or severe disease is&#xD;
      medical decompression with either corticosteroid with or without cyclosporin or&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or azathioprine as adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy. The use of these latter agents are not well studied. When the soft tissue&#xD;
      inflammation and orbital congestion is relieved, surgical redress of mechanical problems&#xD;
      follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of radiotherapy remains unclear 15. Gorman et al conducted a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of orbital radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy&#xD;
      which failed to demonstrate any beneficial therapeutic effect 16. However, the study was&#xD;
      flawed by the broad patient inclusion criteria and initiation of radiotherapy at different&#xD;
      stages of the disease. Other studies have reported effective use of radiotherapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Mourits conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      which showed that external beam irradiation produced improvement in ocular motility in&#xD;
      patients with mild or moderate disease 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that active moderate and severe thyroid orbitopathy can be treated more&#xD;
      aggressively with intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone and oral methotrexate in order to&#xD;
      better stabilise the disease process and prevent cicatricial or compressive events. The&#xD;
      question that this study aims to answer is whether this is a better treatment option compared&#xD;
      to the current treatment in terms of efficacy and safety. Assessing the antibody and urinary&#xD;
      GAG levels will yield information on serum and urinary profiles during treatment. We&#xD;
      previously reported associations between thyroid autoantibodies and ophthalmopathy 18. The&#xD;
      study will also use a 3-Tesla MRI to obtain normative values (MDI and PVR) for the Asian&#xD;
      population and to evaluate quantitative changes in thyroid-related orbitopathy. This will&#xD;
      provide a framework to study other multimodality therapy, including T-cell suppression,&#xD;
      specific immunoglobulins and antifibroblastic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of combined&#xD;
      intravenous steroid and oral methotrexate in the treatment of patients with active moderate&#xD;
      or severe thyroid orbitopathy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial designed with this aim will provide useful information to aid future&#xD;
      multimodality trials. This concept is based on the trend in managing rheumatologic disorders&#xD;
      where early aggressive targeted multimodality therapy has improved treatment. The results of&#xD;
      this study will also complement a planned radiotherapy study at the University of British&#xD;
      Columbia&#xD;
