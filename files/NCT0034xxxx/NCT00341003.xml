      This study, conducted by the National Center for Malaria Control of Cambodia's Ministry of&#xD;
      Health, the Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the People's Republic of&#xD;
      China, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, will explore why some people with mild&#xD;
      malaria progress to a severe form of the disease and why some malaria parasites are resistant&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite. It can&#xD;
      cause fever, aches, and weakness. Left untreated, it can cause severe illness and even death.&#xD;
      Malaria can be cured when it is treated with effective medicine, but some malaria parasites&#xD;
      are resistant to medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults with malaria symptoms and parasites in their blood will be recruited for&#xD;
      this study from the Pursat Regional Health Center in Cambodia and the Thai-Cambodian border&#xD;
      area within Pursat Province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are hospitalized for 4 to 6 days at the Pursat Regional Health Center. A small&#xD;
      blood sample is collected for genetic study and to look for substances in the blood, such as&#xD;
      certain proteins, that may help protect against severe malaria. Patients are then treated&#xD;
      with two doses of Artequick(Registered Trademark) (artemisinin-piperaquine), the first dose&#xD;
      upon arrival at the hospital and the second the next day. (Participants who are pregnant will&#xD;
      be treated with either quinine or artesunate-mefloquine instead of Artequick.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo fingersticks several times during their hospital stay to collect a small&#xD;
      drop of blood to monitor parasite counts. They are discharged from the hospital when their&#xD;
      symptoms resolve and parasites can no longer be detected in their blood. After discharge,&#xD;
      patients return to the clinic once a week for 3 weeks for a blood test to monitor for&#xD;
      parasites, as some parasites may be slightly resistant to the medication. Patients in whom&#xD;
      symptoms or parasites reappear undergo treatment with artesunate and mefloquine.&#xD;

      Hemoglobin E (HbE) is distinguished from normal HbA by a single amino acid mutation (beta26:&#xD;
      Glu to Lys). High allele frequencies in some areas of Cambodia are believed to have been&#xD;
      naturally selected by life-threatening manifestations of malaria. Few epidemiological studies&#xD;
      support this hypothesis, however, and in vitro studies have not clearly defined a mechanism&#xD;
      of protection. The prevalence of drug-resistant malaria is alarmingly high along the&#xD;
      Thai-Cambodian border, such that chloroquine, quinine, or mefloquine can no longer effect&#xD;
      acceptable cure rates. Recently, prolonged parasite clearance times after artemisinin&#xD;
      treatment have been documented in Battambang and Pailin provinces in Cambodia. Combinations&#xD;
      of artemisinins and other drugs (e.g., mefioquine, piperaquine) are now used as standard&#xD;
      first-line treatments for P. falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia. Further decreases in the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these drugs would constitute a disaster, making some cases of malaria&#xD;
      essentially untreatable. The molecular basis for parasite resistance to these antimalarials&#xD;
      has not been firmly established. The main aims of this study are to (1) determine whether HbE&#xD;
      protects against severe P. falciparum malaria, (2) identify genetic determinants associated&#xD;
      with parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs, and (3) determine whether HbE and other&#xD;
      erythrocyte polymorphisms influence parasite clearance times after artemisinin treatment. To&#xD;
      meet these aims, we are conducting an unmatched case-control study comparing the prevalence&#xD;
      of HbE in patients with severe and uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Cambodians who&#xD;
      complain of fever and/or symptoms of malaria are recruited from Pursat Regional Health Center&#xD;
      and surrounding districts within Pursat Province. Patients with uncomplicated malaria are&#xD;
      treated with weight-based doses of artesunate given orally each day for 3 days, followed by&#xD;
      weight-based doses of mefloquine given orally each day for 2 days. Patients with severe&#xD;
      malaria will be treated with artemisinin compounds given parenterally for 5 consecutive days,&#xD;
      followed by artesunate plus mefioquine treatment, as above. We will also collect parasitized&#xD;
      blood samples from malaria patients prior to antimalarial drug administration. These&#xD;
      parasites will be tested in short-term in vitro culture experiments to determine their&#xD;
      susceptibility to antimalarial drugs. Genome-wide typing of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant&#xD;
      P. falciparum isolates (using microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism markers) and&#xD;
      genetic association studies will be used to identify genes that determine parasite responses&#xD;
      to various antimalarial drugs.&#xD;
