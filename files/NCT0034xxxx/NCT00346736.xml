  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a behaviorally defined, lifelong disorder of the brain, affecting at least 1-2 per&#xD;
      1000 children. There is an increasing trend of autism worldwide. However, to date, there is&#xD;
      still no cure for this devastating childhood disease. Autism is characterized by deficit in&#xD;
      language, social communication and repetitive behavior. It is estimated that the annual cost&#xD;
      of care for autism is $13 billion in USA alone. Children with autism usually have associated&#xD;
      behavioral problems such as aggressiveness, stereotypes, hyperactivity, emotional lability,&#xD;
      and short attention span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development and National Institute of Deafness&#xD;
      &amp; Communication Disorders have jointly founded the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in&#xD;
      Autism. One of the long-term NIH goals is to develop or refine interim treatment strategy and&#xD;
      to develop effective biological, behavioral or alternative treatment strategy for autism.&#xD;
      There is a dire need for early identification and treatment of children with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture has been practised in China for 2 millennia. The legal status of acupuncture as a&#xD;
      treatment technique was approved by Food &amp; Drugs Administration in USA (1997). The&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of acupuncture is based on stimulation at specific acupoints resulting in&#xD;
      both local and distant effect via improving signal or modulation of electromagnetic energy.&#xD;
      There had lack of studies of acupuncture in autism. We hope that we can study the efficacy of&#xD;
      acupuncture in autism using clinical measurement. We hope to identify the role of acupuncture&#xD;
      as an adjunctive treatment for autism.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to assess whether alternative treatment strategy such as traditional&#xD;
      Chinese acupuncture can improve the following parameters in children with Autism (or Autistic&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder): cognition, communication, function and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized double-blind controlled cross-over trial in Autism: Real electro-acupuncture (R)&#xD;
      versus Sham electroacupuncture (S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject Recruitment Parents will be informed with regard to the nature of the study,&#xD;
           potential risks and benefits. Consent forms for enrolment, photographs/Videos taking&#xD;
           will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A semi-structured diagnostic interview with the parents and neurological examination&#xD;
           will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of outcomes will be performed by trained research assistant, being blinded to&#xD;
           the treatment or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      R will consist of a total course of 12 sessions, with 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acupuncture (AC) will be applied to specific body and scalp acupoints using sterile&#xD;
           disposable 0.3 x 4-cm acupuncture needle (Made in China -HwaTo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EA instrument (Model SDZ-II Electronic Acupuncture Treatment Instrument, Suzhou China)&#xD;
           will be connected to the handles of acupuncture needles to provide electrical&#xD;
           stimulation for 25 minutes. No sedation is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S will consist of a total course of 12 sessions, with 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * AC will insert into points that 5 to 10 mm away from the correct acupoint locations and&#xD;
      maintained at a superficial level of insertion to minimize stimulation, and with the same EA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both R and S, electrical stimulation was monitored by an indicator light throughout the&#xD;
      treatment period. To ensure the integrity of blinding, the acupuncturist will not discuss the&#xD;
      acupuncture procedure with the parents or patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arm (AC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Treatment AC for 4 weeks (3 times per week), then wash out for 2 weeks; then Sham&#xD;
      acupuncture 3 times per week for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Sham acupuncture for 4 weeks (3 times per week), then wash out for 2 weeks; then Real&#xD;
      acupuncture 3 times per week for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children will be assessed before (Week 0), washout period (Week 6) and after Treatment&#xD;
           (Week 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group will undergo same assessment and reassessment procedures during the same&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
