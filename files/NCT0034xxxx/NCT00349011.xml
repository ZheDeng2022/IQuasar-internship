  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a personalized menopausal therapy&#xD;
      risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention on knowledge, risk perception, and&#xD;
      decision-making in healthy women at increased risk for breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with a family history of breast cancer have several menopausal therapy options,&#xD;
      including tamoxifen, hormone therapy, alternative medications, or no treatment. This complex&#xD;
      decision should be based on each woman's risk to develop breast cancer, menopausal symptoms,&#xD;
      preferences, and risks for other conditions. Current models in use for menopausal therapy&#xD;
      counseling do not include pedigree analysis, personalized risk assessment or genetic testing&#xD;
      in this process. The purpose of this multi-center study is to determine the effects of a&#xD;
      personalized risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention on knowledge, risk&#xD;
      perception, and decision-making in a group of healthy women who had a first-degree relative&#xD;
      with breast cancer. Intervention participants will be given a personalized risk assessment&#xD;
      for breast cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, and uterine cancer based on family history&#xD;
      and personal health data.&#xD;
