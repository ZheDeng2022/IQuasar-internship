      This study, done in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in&#xD;
      Baltimore, Maryland, will examine the role of genes in the development of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients undergoing kidney dialysis. The rate of illness and&#xD;
      death from CVD among patients on dialysis is extraordinarily high, accounting for about 50&#xD;
      percent of deaths. Blood levels of inflammatory markers are elevated in these patients,&#xD;
      strongly predicting illness and death from CVD. The discovery of gene variants related to the&#xD;
      inflammatory process in atherosclerotic CVD may lead to better medical treatments and&#xD;
      improved survival in patients with end-stage kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of John's Hopkins University's CHOICE (Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring&#xD;
      for End-Stage Renal Disease) program are included in this study. Blood samples previously&#xD;
      collected from these patients will be analyzed in the laboratory for genes that might be&#xD;
      associated with the inflammatory process and atherogenesis.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHOICE (Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for End stage renal disease) study is a&#xD;
      national prospective cohort study of 1,041 incident dialysis patients aged 19 to 95 recruited&#xD;
      in 81 dialysis clinics between October 1995 and June 1998, and is overseen by the Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins University School of Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of genetic associations offers the potential to direct clinical management in&#xD;
      order to prevent ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) and improve survival in&#xD;
      patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Collaboration with investigators of the CHOICE cohort, we propose to assess the role of&#xD;
      variants in genes related to the inflammatory process on atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (ASCVD) incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility is independent of age, race, ethnicity, and gender. However, no participants in&#xD;
      this cohort are less than 19 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen buffy coats from 871 patients will be sent to the LGD, and DNA will be extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Singles nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within coding regions, upstream or downstream&#xD;
      regulatory regions or in intronic regions of candidates genes will be genotyped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first candidate genes under study include IL6, IL10, TGFB1, Beta Fibrinogen, LTA, and&#xD;
      STAT3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and relevant clinical data will be provided by Johns Hopkins University School&#xD;
      of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology with only numerical code which links samples and&#xD;
      clinical data. While Johns Hopkins University will retain patient identifier information, the&#xD;
      LGD will have no way of identifying the person from whom the blood, subsequent DNA, and&#xD;
      clinical data are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples are maintained in our repository and curated through our central Laboratory&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Destruction or loss of clinical samples or data will be recorded in our database and cannot&#xD;
      impact the study participants in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of this protocol, we will retain the samples for future use. We understand&#xD;
      that studies subsequent to the completion of this protocol will require additional OHSR/IRB&#xD;
      approval prior to commencement.&#xD;
