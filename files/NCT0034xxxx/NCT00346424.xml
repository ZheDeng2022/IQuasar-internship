  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of alfimeprase to a&#xD;
      placebo in restoring function of occluded central catheters.&#xD;

      Primary Outcomes: The ability to withdraw at least 3 ml of blood and infuse more at least 5&#xD;
      mL of sterile saline through the occluded catheter lumen at 15 minutes after receiving&#xD;
      initial instillation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to withdraw at least 3 mL of blood and infuse at least 5 mL of sterile saline&#xD;
      through the occluded catheter lumen at 30 minutes following a single instillation of study&#xD;
      drug and at 30 minutes following a second instillation of study drug if patency is not&#xD;
      restored within 30 minutes of the first instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major bleeding events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in laboratory values.&#xD;
