    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania s Newborn Nursery, the Children s&#xD;
      Hospital of Philadelphia, and the Exton Specialty Care Center, will examine how different&#xD;
      infant diets may affect estrogen activity in babies. During pregnancy, babies are exposed to&#xD;
      the female hormone estrogen from their mother. Estrogen plays a key role in the development&#xD;
      of breasts and milk production, as well as the development of the uterus. The effects of&#xD;
      these hormones can be seen when babies are examined. Between 6 and 12 months of age, the&#xD;
      effects are reduced. Breast milk and some infant formulas may contain compounds that can act&#xD;
      like female hormones in the body and may prolong the estrogen effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two parts. Part 1 studies the physical development of babies fed different&#xD;
      ways. Part 2 studies how hormone levels in babies differ depending on what they are being&#xD;
      fed. Babies may participate in one or both parts. Part 1 includes babies 0 to 6 months of&#xD;
      age; part 2 includes babies 0 to 12 months of age. In each part of the study, parents may&#xD;
      choose to have their babies evaluated from one to four times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-term infants (age 37 to 41 weeks gestational age) from birth to 12 months of age who&#xD;
      weigh from 2501 to 4499 grams (about 5.5 to 10 pounds) at birth and who have no chromosomal&#xD;
      abnormalities, major malformations, or endocrine problems may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Male infants must have palpable testes. Infants being fed a diet of breast milk, soy milk, or&#xD;
      cow s milk will be included. Study procedures include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeding history: the parent provides information about the baby s dietary intake since&#xD;
           birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length, weight, and head circumference: the baby s measurements are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination: the baby s physical maturity is assessed by examination of the&#xD;
           skin, breasts, and external sex organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast secretions: the baby s breast buds are gently pressed during the physical&#xD;
           examination to look for a milky-white substance that some babies produce during the&#xD;
           first year of life. If the substance appears, a specimen will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal cells: for baby girls, the opening of the vaginal area is gently swabbed with a&#xD;
           sterile Q-tip to assess the maturity of the vaginal lining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeding history and length, weight and head circumference measurements as described&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine: a urine sample is collected in a cotton diaper or a urine collection bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aliva: a saliva sample is collected by gently swabbing the inside of the baby s mouth 1&#xD;
           hour after a morning feeding to remove any left over milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hair: a lock of hair, 1/2-inch wide and 1 to 2 inches long is taken from 12-month old&#xD;
           babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood: some infants have a small blood sample collected by a heel-stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as a basis for a later study about how infant formulas affect infant&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Term newborns have anatomic and sonographic evidence of in utero estrogen exposure. Over the&#xD;
      first six months to a year of life, as the influence of maternal hormone wanes, these&#xD;
      findings recede. Soy infant formula contains large amounts of isoflavones (diadzein and&#xD;
      genistein) that can occupy estrogen receptors and act as estrogens in the laboratory. A food&#xD;
      substance with estrogen activity might prolong the effect of maternal hormones, or interfere&#xD;
      with hormonal homeostasis the child. Two cross-sectional pilot study (SEAD 2 and SEAD 3) will&#xD;
      be undertaken in order to establish the methods for a future, multi-center study designed to&#xD;
      assess the potential effects of soy formula on estrogen activity in infants. Another&#xD;
      cross-sectional pilot study (SEAD 1) will be undertaken to evaluate anatomical evidence&#xD;
      detected by ultrasound and will be conducted at The Children's Hospital in Boston. Details of&#xD;
      the SEAD 1 study will not be presented in this protocol. In the first pilot study (SEAD 2),&#xD;
      84 examinations of full-term infants, ages 0-6 months and on one of three feeding regimens&#xD;
      (soy formula, breast milk or cow's milk formula) will be conducted. This study will establish&#xD;
      a protocol for examining and sampling methods to be used for a later trial investigating&#xD;
      whether exposure to soy estrogen compared to breast milk and non-soy formulas prolongs&#xD;
      anatomical evidence of estrogen exposure and response. In addition to the physical&#xD;
      examination, vaginal cells will be collected for cytology analysis. Breast nipple secretions,&#xD;
      if present, will also be collected and analyzed for protein and sugar levels. In the second&#xD;
      pilot study (SEAD 3), 372 evaluations on full-term infants will be conducted in parallel with&#xD;
      the first study. SEAD 3 will assess the hormonal and biochemical status of full-term infants&#xD;
      age 0-12 months. This study will establish a protocol for sampling methods to be used for&#xD;
      collecting urine, saliva, serum, and hair samples. Endogenous hormone levels such as&#xD;
      testosterone, estradiol, and isoflavone levels (genestein and diadzein) will be measured in&#xD;
      serum and the results will be compared against the non-serum tests (urine, saliva and hair).&#xD;
      The purpose of these two pilot studies is twofold. The first is to develop and finalize&#xD;
      recruitment and collections procedures in preparation for a larger, comprehensive trial of&#xD;
      biological response in children to soy formula with and without the estrogenic isoflavones.&#xD;
      The second is to study the natural history of estrogen activity in infants on a variety of&#xD;
      feeding regimens.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        SEAD 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Full term infants defined as age 37-41 weeks gestational age at birth. Ultrasound&#xD;
             evidence or reliable reporting of last menstrual period (LMP) by infant's mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Can be categorized into one of the feeding definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Birth weight between 2501-4499 grams.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age 0-6 months for SEAD 2, age 0-12 months for SEAD 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For SEAD 3, for 12-months age interval, subjects must not have had first haircut.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        SEAD 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Chromosomal aberrations&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Major malformation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. SEAD 2: Non-palpable testis (males only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of an endocrinopathy (i.e., ambiguous genitalia, congenital hypothyroidism)&#xD;
&#xD;
        This is a natural history study and children must be healthy in order to participate in&#xD;
        this study. Therefore, children will be excluded from the study if they are known to have&#xD;
        chromosomal aberrations, or any major malformations or an endocrinopathy. Testicular&#xD;
        development is an important endpoint in this study and therefore males will be excluded&#xD;
        from SEAD 2 if the testes are not palpable.&#xD;
