      This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare appetite-related brain&#xD;
      activity in women with anorexia nervosa before and after receiving treatment for the&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder that is characterized by an extreme loss&#xD;
      of appetite. People with AN view themselves as overweight and cannot bring themselves to eat,&#xD;
      even though most are dangerously thin. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a&#xD;
      technique that can be used to determine which parts of the brain are activated by physical&#xD;
      stimuli. When a certain stimulus is introduced, blood flow to the corresponding area of the&#xD;
      brain increases. This increase in blood flow is depicted on the fMRI scan. A person with AN&#xD;
      may have different responses to food when evaluated prior to treatment versus after&#xD;
      treatment. This study will use fMRI to compare appetite-related brain activity in women with&#xD;
      AN before and after receiving treatment for the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo two fMRI scans. Participants with AN will have one&#xD;
      scan before entering the &quot;weight gain phase&quot; of treatment for AN and another scan upon&#xD;
      completion of treatment. Healthy volunteers will undergo scans during a similar time frame.&#xD;
      Participants will not be allowed to eat from midnight on the night before the scan until&#xD;
      after the fMRI procedure, but they may drink water. During the scan, participants will be&#xD;
      shown various objects and real foods; they will also be asked to touch the objects and food&#xD;
      with their eyes closed. Each visit will last approximately 45 minutes. Ear protectors will be&#xD;
      provided to reduce scanner noise.&#xD;
