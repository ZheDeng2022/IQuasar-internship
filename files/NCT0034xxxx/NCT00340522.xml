      This study will construct tissue microarrays (TMAs) pertaining to childhood cancer. TMA&#xD;
      technology is a recently developed one that allows for evaluating hundreds of tissue samples&#xD;
      simultaneously on the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. The goal is to identify a potential&#xD;
      molecular signature. Cancer drug discovery is currently focused on identifying drugs targeted&#xD;
      at the molecular level. Such drugs would be more selective and specific for proteins and&#xD;
      signaling pathways that are directly involved in the origin of tumors. However, the origin of&#xD;
      cancer among adults differs from that of cancer diagnosed in children. The overall approach&#xD;
      by the pharmaceutical industry in developing drugs is not likely to be aimed at low-incidence&#xD;
      cancers, such as childhood cancers. Thus, the researchers in this study propose to create a&#xD;
      childhood cancer TMA that include specimens from a wide range of solid tumors that present a&#xD;
      poor prognosis for patients. This TMA would in turn be used to identify antibodies and lead&#xD;
      to developing molecularly targeted drugs that would reach clinical trials in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMAs are created robotically. Small tissue cores are taken from paraffin-embedded tissue&#xD;
      blocks and are implanted into new paraffin blocks. The recipient blocks are then processed to&#xD;
      produce several hundred specimens that can be evaluated on a single glass slide. Specimens&#xD;
      representing 17 distinct kinds of pediatric solid tumors will be used in this study. Also&#xD;
      included will be samples of plexiform neurofibroma-that is, benign growths of nervous and&#xD;
      connective tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue specimens will come from patients who were age 25 or younger at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
      of their cancer or plexiform neurofibroma. No procedures will be performed for the sole&#xD;
      purpose of obtaining tissue for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMA developed in this study will not be commercialized. The results for individuals whose&#xD;
      tumor specimens are used in the array will not be sent to patients or their treating&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;

      Background: Cancer drug discovery is now focused on identifying molecularly targeted drugs&#xD;
      that are more selective and specific for proteins and signaling pathways that are directly&#xD;
      involved in tumorigenesis. This new paradigm alters the approach to clinical drug development&#xD;
      for childhood cancers because the emphasis is on therapeutic targets present in common&#xD;
      epithelially-derived adult cancers, which have a different pathogenesis. The pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry is unlikely to undertake target discovery programs for low incidence cancers, such&#xD;
      as childhood cancers. Therefore, a more pragmatic approach to the development of molecularly&#xD;
      targeted drugs in children is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Construct a childhood cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) for screening and selecting&#xD;
      the most appropriate molecularly targeted agents for clinical development in childhood&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Ten to twenty representative specimens (paraffin blocks) for each of 25&#xD;
      histologically distinct pediatric solid tumors or plexiform neurofibromas will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Using a robotic arrayer, three 0.6 mm cores from each tissue block will be donated&#xD;
      into one of 3 recipient paraffin TMA blocks (CNS tumors, sarcomas, embryonal tumors).&#xD;
      Standard immunohistochemical techniques will be applied to 5 micro m sections from the TMA&#xD;
      block using validated antibodies directed against specific protein targets of interest. If&#xD;
      greater than 8 to 20 tumors from each specific histological type of cancer are positive,&#xD;
      there is a 95% probability that the true proportion of positive specimens exceeds 20%. The&#xD;
      results of the TMA target assessment will guide in the selection of molecularly targeted&#xD;
      drugs for pediatric phase I clinical trials in the POB and Pediatric Phase I/Pilot Consortium&#xD;
      and the selection of candidate tumors for activity testing in phase II clinical trials. If&#xD;
      clinical responses are observed in phase I or II trials in tumor types that express the&#xD;
      target on the TMA, we will return to the original paraffin blocks and perform Laser Capture&#xD;
      Microdissection and produce reverse-phase lysate protein microarrays to assess the activation&#xD;
      state of targeted signaling pathways and investigate the role of the target protein in&#xD;
      tumorigenesis of the responsive childhood cancers.&#xD;
