    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Uncorrected Visual Acuity (UCVA) of 20/40 or Better at 12 Months and 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With a Postoperative Subjective Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) Within ± 1.00 Diopter (D) and ± 0.50 D of Emmetropia.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Manifest refractions (eyeglass prescriptions) have three components: sphere, cylinder, and axis. Sphere and cylinder are both expressed in diopters, which is a continuous measure of the focusing power needed to make the image sharp on the retina. Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) is equal to sphere + ½ x cylinder. It is expressed in diopters (D).</description>

    <description>Percentage of eyes with a change of ≤ 1.00 Diopter in manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) between postoperative refractions, performed at 1 months and 3 months after surgery.

    <measure>Induced Astigmatism</measure>

    <description>Percentage of eyes which had &gt;2.00 Diopter of induced refractive cylinder for those eyes treated for spherical hyperopia only.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Loss of Best Spectacle-corrected Visual Acuity (BSCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of eyes with loss of best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of &gt;2 lines. Mean change in best-corrected high contrast distance visual acuity. Corrected means spectacle corrected. Visual acuity (VA) was reported as letters read correctly, and the letters read were converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) acuity. The participant read rows of letters on a standard LogMAR chart until the participant misses 3 letters on a row with 5 letters. The total number of correct letters were recorded. A decrease in the number of correct letters indicates a decrease in visual acuity. Acuity was averaged across visits.</description>
