      This study will look at gene expression (whether particular sets of genes are activated&#xD;
      [&quot;turned on&quot;] or deactivated [&quot;turned off&quot;]) in overweight people as compared to&#xD;
      non-overweight individuals. It will also investigate the potential role of inflammatory and&#xD;
      protective substances that are produced naturally by the body within fat tissue. Findings&#xD;
      from the study may lead to the development of ways to predict who will respond best to diet&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy individuals between 25 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Overweight&#xD;
      subjects must have a BMI of 25 to 40, and non-overweight control subjects a BMI of 19 to&#xD;
      24.9. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG). They are instructed to record their dietary intake for a 3-day&#xD;
      period and to collect their urine for a 24-hour interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have their food records reviewed a week after the screening visit. They are then&#xD;
      scheduled for an overnight admission to the Clinical Center. Non-overweight subjects have one&#xD;
      or two inpatient stays; overweight subjects have six inpatient stays plus frequent nutrition&#xD;
      counseling sessions. During the 2-day hospital admissions, the following studies are&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to determine the percentage of body fat tissue. The subject lies on a table&#xD;
           for about 15 to 60 minutes while the body composition is measured with very low-dose&#xD;
           x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single-slice CT scan to compare the amount of fat tissue under the skin with that in the&#xD;
           abdomen. The subject lies on a table for about 5 to 10 minutes while the CT scanner&#xD;
           measures body composition with very low-dose x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subcutaneous fat microdialysis to investigate how weight loss affects the activity of&#xD;
           fat tissue. A small tube (catheter) is placed into the fat tissue under the skin of the&#xD;
           abdomen after numbing the skin with a local anesthetic. Fluid samples are collected&#xD;
           through the tube. The procedure lasts overnight. In five non-overweight controls, a&#xD;
           small amount of a substance called leukotriene B4 is put into their fat tissue to help&#xD;
           adjust the instruments used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Air-displacement plethysmography to measure body composition. Subjects wear&#xD;
           close-fitting clothing and enter a small capsule called a Bod-Pod. They breathe normally&#xD;
           in the capsule while their body fat composition is studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests. Blood samples are drawn to analyze thyroid hormones, lipids, glucose,&#xD;
           electrolytes, clotting factors, kidney function, red cells and DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to measure the effects of insulin in the body and to&#xD;
           derive an index of insulin-sensitivity. Catheters are placed in a vein in an arm and in&#xD;
           a vein in the hand on the other side of the body. Insulin and glucose are infused&#xD;
           through the catheter in the arm, and blood samples are drawn from the catheter in the&#xD;
           hand every 5 minutes to measure glucose levels. The test lasts about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subcutaneous fat biopsy to find out how weight loss affects fat tissue characteristics,&#xD;
           gene regulation and the ability to store glucose. A small sample of fat tissue is&#xD;
           obtained from the skin of the abdomen after numbing the area with an anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition counseling for overweight subjects. A nutritionist reviews the food record and&#xD;
           designs a personalized diet for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight loss intervention for overweight subjects. In addition to individual nutritional&#xD;
           counseling, group sessions are provided every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of the&#xD;
           study and then every month.&#xD;

      Obesity is a global public health problem of epidemic proportions. It is the source of&#xD;
      considerable morbidity and early mortality in the U.S. and is associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, new and evolving concepts have emerged regarding obesity as a chronic&#xD;
      endocrine disorder of inflammation. Moreover, a growing body of evidence indicates that&#xD;
      obesity alters the profile of a constellation of genes and that some changes in biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation and gene expression can be reversed by weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical protocol, we propose to test the idea that a particular set of genes is&#xD;
      activated (or deactivated) in Overweight Subjects using standard microarray techniques on&#xD;
      samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue derived from biopsies. In addition, we will study the&#xD;
      local adipose tissue microenvironment by means of microdialysis. The role of a number of&#xD;
      adipokines, inflammatory mediators/cytokines, and novel lipid products will be analyzed using&#xD;
      sensitive Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and ELISA methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design incorporates two basic objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of Non-Overweight Controls vs. Overweight Subjects at Baseline and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation of changes in Overweight patients over time as they lose weight through a&#xD;
           calorie-restricted diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To these ends, 30 Non-Overweight Controls (BMI 19.0 24.9) and 80 Overweight Subjects (BMI&#xD;
      25.0 45.0) will be enrolled. Baseline studies, to be obtained on all participants include:&#xD;
      blood tests, anthropometric indices, body composition by air-displacement plethysmography,&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry, intravenous glucose tolerance test as an index of insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue microdialysis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy. These&#xD;
      procedures will require an overnight hospital admission to the Clinical Center. Overweight&#xD;
      Subjects will then be prescribed a calorie-restricted diet and followed for one year. They&#xD;
      will undergo repeat studies at regular, 3-month intervals to assess serial changes in the&#xD;
      various parameters and to provide correlative data with the degree and rate of weight loss&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these studies should shed light and provide fundamental insights into the&#xD;
      nature of the altered gene expression and release of inflammatory cytokines and other&#xD;
      mediators that characterize the overweight state and the dynamic series of events that take&#xD;
      place when dietary intervention leads to weight loss. It is anticipated that a number of&#xD;
      these changes will relate to macrophages and known inflammatory markers though doubtless&#xD;
      there are other important leads yet to be discovered. Thus, our hope is that such studies&#xD;
      will ultimately lead to the identification of novel genes that underlie the important&#xD;
      metabolic derangements associated with obesity and their response to different treatment&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;
