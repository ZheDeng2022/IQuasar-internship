      The primary objective of this study is to compare subjective ocular symptoms and corneal&#xD;
      staining over time in a group of individuals who wear soft contact lenses on a daily wear&#xD;
      basis, whilst they sequentially use two different contact lens care regimens.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Agrees to wear the study lenses on a daily wear basis without the use of ocular&#xD;
             lubricants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has an up to date pair of glasses and is willing to wear these glasses at different&#xD;
             times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is correctable to a visual acuity of 6/6 or better with their habitual correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is willing and able to follow product usage instructions and maintain the visit&#xD;
             schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is at least 18 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Can be successfully fitted with study lens type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has read, understood and signed an Information Consent Letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a distance contact lens prescription is between -0.50 D and -9.00 D&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has astigmatism of ≤ 1.00 D Cyl&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has normal binocular vision, i.e. no strabismus, no amblyopia, and anisometropia of ≤&#xD;
             1.00D&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has no systemic disease affecting ocular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Is not using any systemic or topical medications that will affect ocular health,&#xD;
             accommodative function, or the ocular physiological response to the contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has no known ocular or systemic allergies, which could interfere with contact lens&#xD;
             wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has no lid or conjunctival abnormalities, neovascularization, limbal injection, bulbar&#xD;
             injection or corneal staining, which in the investigator's opinion is clinically&#xD;
             significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has not worn rigid contact lenses in the last 30 days or has corneal distortion&#xD;
             resulting from rigid lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has not worn extended wear contact lenses in the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has had an oculo-visual examination in the last two years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has any active ocular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has any lid or conjunctival abnormalities that may, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, interfere with the wear of contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has edema, staining, clinically significant corneal opacity, dystrophy,&#xD;
             vascularization or iritis as viewed by slit lamp. (Trace or grade 1 equivalent limbal&#xD;
             and bulbar injection or corneal staining is permissible at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is using ocular lubricants or contact lens rewetting drops on a regular basis (at&#xD;
             least once per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is using topical ocular prescription or any topical over-the-counter medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is actively involved in any other research/clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has worn rigid lenses or soft lenses on an extended wear basis within the last 30&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
