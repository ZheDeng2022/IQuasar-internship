      This is a pilot study to assess the effectiveness of Neurovision treatment in the improvement&#xD;
      of vision in children being under-corrected and to assess the effectiveness of Neurovision&#xD;
      treatment in slowing down myopia progression in children.&#xD;

      NeuroVision's NVC vision correction technology is a non-invasive, patient-specific&#xD;
      computerized treatment based on visual stimulation and facilitation of neural connections&#xD;
      responsible for vision. NeuroVision's Neural Vision Correction TM (NVC) technology has been&#xD;
      developed through research focused solely on optimizing performance of the neural or &quot;back&#xD;
      end&quot; of the visual system, and is based on two decades of visual neuroscience research by the&#xD;
      founder, Dr Uri Polat, whose work, which has been published in leading scientific journals,&#xD;
      relates to understanding how the brain processes visual information, how neural activity is&#xD;
      related to visual perception, and how visual processing interacts with other neural systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology has been clinically proven in the treatment of adult amblyopia, which until&#xD;
      now has been considered untreatable, with a RCT in which follow-up of up to 2 years shows&#xD;
      good retention of visual improvement. The company has received FDA 510(k) marketing clearance&#xD;
      indicating NVC for the treatment of adult amblyopia in patients 9 years or older in the US.&#xD;
      The company also received a Medical CE-Mark to market its Amblyopia and Low-Myopia products&#xD;
      in the European Union. Company products are also approved for use in Israel by the Israeli&#xD;
      Ministry of Health - Device License Authority. Additional proof-of-concept studies have been&#xD;
      performed in Israel and Singapore indicating the technology's potential to improve vision of&#xD;
      subjects having low myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, NeuroVision commercially offers the Low Myopia treatment in Singapore. Initial results&#xD;
      of the commercial treatment are even better than the proof-of-concept studies, emphasizing&#xD;
      the importance of patient motivation and compliance in this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the promising results of the Low Myopia treatment in adults, this study intends to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of NVC treatment in myopic children, by improving their quality of&#xD;
      vision and reducing the progress rate of their Myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement of visual acuity in children&#xD;
      being under-corrected. As the myopia increases rapidly in many children, their habitual&#xD;
      eyewear cannot match their exact degree of myopia on a day by day basis. As a result, many&#xD;
      children suffer from reduced quality of vision (as shown also in data from the Singapore&#xD;
      Cohort Study of the Risk Factors of Myopia [SCORM] study). Therefore, the first goal of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of NeuroVision treatment in the improvement of the&#xD;
      under-corrected visual acuity of these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of NeuroVision treatment in the&#xD;
      reduction of the myopia progression rate in children. As detailed later on in this document,&#xD;
      studies on animals showed that under-correcting myopia can reduce its progression rate (or&#xD;
      even result in emmetropization). Therefore, the second goal of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      possibility of significantly under-correcting myopia in children that had undergone&#xD;
      NeuroVision treatment, and check how it affects the progression of their myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the above objectives, a large scale (few hundred subjects) clinical study on&#xD;
      school children, is required. This pilot study is designed to examine the feasibility of such&#xD;
      a large scale study, from clinical, administrative and logistic points of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment flow and process&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment flow is composed of the following phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening and Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Screening Evaluation phase includes the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Demographic details&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. General medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Baseline Examination I. Manifest Subjective and Objective refraction II.&#xD;
                Accommodation amplitude, PRA and NRA III. Distance visual acuity (Monocular and&#xD;
                binocular Under-corrected Visual Acuity, and Best Corrected Visual Acuity - BCVA)&#xD;
                IV. Cycloplegic Objective and Subjective refraction V. Distance cycloplegic&#xD;
                under-corrected visual acuity. VI. Ocular axial length measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
           For detailed description of the above examinations, refer to Appendices A-B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the completion of all the required examinations, subject's data will be reviewed&#xD;
           and study investigators make a final enrolment decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before starting the computerized evaluations, subjects will undergo an additional&#xD;
           Distance Visual Acuity and Contrast Sensitivity examinations at the school.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results of these additional examinations will be used as a baseline reference for&#xD;
           the periodic examinations that will be done during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enrolled Subjects will be requested to complete a QOV/QOL Questionnaire 1 (Annex E)&#xD;
           before the treatment starts&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NVC Computerized Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Computerized Evaluation sessions are conducted in order to allow the NVC system to&#xD;
           identify the visual abilities and inefficiencies and to thereby define individual&#xD;
           parameters that will affect the subject's treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This phase is comprised of two (2) to three (3) sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training Glasses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           NeuroVision will determine the power of the training eyeglasses the subject will need&#xD;
           for the NVC treatment start. The possible training glasses are 0.5DS, 1.0DS or 1.5DS&#xD;
           less than the subject's full prescription. In some cases, there will be no training&#xD;
           glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In some cases a subject might be instructed to train one eye only for a part of the&#xD;
           treatment sessions. The other eye will be then covered by a semi-translucent lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The decisions are made by NeuroVision based on the subject's best refractive correction,&#xD;
           his/her under-corrected VA and the computerized evaluation, and will be reported to the&#xD;
           study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. NVC Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The total number of sessions to complete the treatment course is not defined in advance.&#xD;
           It is determined by the NVC system during the course of treatment according to each&#xD;
           subject's visual abilities and performance. Typically patient should undergo 30 sessions&#xD;
           during this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject should perform on average three (3) sessions per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During this phase no visit interruptions longer than two (2) weeks on aggregate are&#xD;
           permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Periodic visual acuity and contrast sensitivity examinations should be performed after&#xD;
           every 5 treatment sessions in the school&#xD;
&#xD;
           As progress is made, the training glasses previously provided to the subject may be&#xD;
           replaced by other training glasses with less power, or entirely removed. The clinician&#xD;
           and the subject will be informed about the training glass replacement in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completing 15 treatment sessions (mid-term), subjects will be requested to&#xD;
           complete a QOV/QOL Questionnaire 2 (Annex F) before commencing Treatment Session 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
           NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
           WHEN VA TEST AND THE TREATMENT SESSION ARE TO BE PERFORMED AT THE SAME VISIT, PERIODIC&#xD;
           VA TESTS SHOULD BE ALWAYS CONDUCTED BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE OF A TREATMENT SESSION!&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. End of Treatment Decision&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject will terminate the treatment sequence according to the end of treatment criteria&#xD;
           (see summary of study design)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following the end of Treatment decision, the subject should be scheduled for Post&#xD;
           Treatment Examinations (PTE) within 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For follow up visits, visit range allowed is within +/- two weeks of the expected dates&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post Treatment Examination (PTE)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Post Treatment Examination at SERI will include visual acuity tests, amplitude of&#xD;
           accommodation, relative accommodation, cover test, cycloplegic refraction and distance&#xD;
           under-corrected visual acuity and axial length measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be requested to complete a QOV/QOL Questionnaire 2 (Annex F)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prescription of under-corrected eyewear&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the end of the treatment, subjects should be prescribed with under-corrected&#xD;
           eyewear.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The under-corrected eyewear should be the lowest possible refractive correction in which&#xD;
           that subject has at least 6/12 (0.3 LogMAR) binocular VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject should be instructed to use the new eyewear instead of the current one (if&#xD;
           any) for at least the 12 months monitoring period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-Up Examinations at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Examinations at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 post treatment at SERI will include visual&#xD;
      acuity tests, amplitude of accommodation, relative accommodation, cover test, cycloplegic&#xD;
      refraction and distance under-corrected visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case that the subject's binocular VA with the under-corrected eyewear is worse than 6/12&#xD;
      (0.3 LogMAR) for 2 consecutive follow-up visits, new eyewear should be prescribed to allow at&#xD;
      least 6/12 binocular VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Follow up Month 6 and 12, subjects will be requested to complete a QOV/QOL Questionnaire 2&#xD;
      (Annex F).&quot;&#xD;
