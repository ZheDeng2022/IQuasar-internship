  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no specific trials addressing the benefit of water provision and health education&#xD;
      on prevalence of trachoma and infection with ocular Chlamydia trachomatis over time, despite&#xD;
      considerable effort to provide water resources in trachoma endemic areas. Such information is&#xD;
      sorely needed, to advance the Global Alliance agenda for the Elimination of Blinding&#xD;
      Trachoma. This community-based clinical trial will randomize ten communities in Maradi Niger,&#xD;
      half to receive delivery of water and health education services, and half for delivery of&#xD;
      services at a later date. We hypothesize that the intervention communities will have lower&#xD;
      rates of trachoma and C. trachomatis one and two years after delivery of services compared to&#xD;
      communities without such services. This trial will provide, for the first time, solid&#xD;
      evidence of the effect of such services on trachoma, as well as the added benefit following&#xD;
      antibiotic provision by the Ministry of Health on sustaining reductions in trachoma and&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect on clinical trachoma in a cohort of children from baseline to&#xD;
           one, two, and three years post-intervention with a village-based water and health&#xD;
           education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect on ocular C. trachomatis infection in a cohort of children from&#xD;
           baseline to one, two, and three years post-intervention with a village-based water and&#xD;
           health education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A secondary outcome is the measure of under five years mortality in intervention&#xD;
           compared to control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: We are proposing to evaluate trachoma over time in a sample of children age 1-5&#xD;
      years at baseline in villages in Niger where World Vision is planning immediate water and&#xD;
      health education services delivery, compared to a sample of children in villages where&#xD;
      services will be implemented after two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Services: World Vision plans water wells to serve a population of about 300, in villages of&#xD;
      about 300-5,000 persons. Thus each village has around 1-17 wells. The goal is to provide&#xD;
      water within 500 meters with a wait time of less than 15 minutes. Health education on use of&#xD;
      water and hygiene practices is also part of services delivery. A World Vision Area&#xD;
      Development Program officer establishes and trains a water and sanitation committee to&#xD;
      provide health education for their village. Villages who are randomly selected to be part of&#xD;
      these services will be classified as &quot;intervention&quot; villages. In addition, there are other&#xD;
      villages where the planning process has just started and wells would not be drilled for over&#xD;
      two years. Villages who are randomly selected to be in the group where services will not be&#xD;
      available immediately, will be classified as &quot;control&quot; villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview The design is a three-year longitudinal study of trachoma and infection with ocular&#xD;
      Chlamydia trachomatis in a cohort of children age 1-5 at baseline. From a list of villages in&#xD;
      Maradi region that are intended to have a water program within the next three years, we will&#xD;
      randomly select six villages to be the &quot;intervention&quot; villages and six villages to be the&#xD;
      &quot;control&quot; villages. We will aim to include 360 children, randomly selected from the 6&#xD;
      &quot;intervention&quot; villages (one per mother for a total of up to 60 in each village) and 360&#xD;
      children randomly selected from 6 &quot;control&quot; villages. Surveys for trachoma and infection will&#xD;
      be carried out at baseline, one, two, and three years from baseline. Details are described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Villages The 1995 census of Maradi was the basis for selecting villages in the Kornaka West&#xD;
      district of Maradi, Niger, where World Vision is planning their intervention. The villages in&#xD;
      the study should be of comparable size (between 900-2,100 [estimated] persons), as village&#xD;
      size may be an important predictor of trachoma status at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The villages were selected as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A list of all villages with an estimated population between 900 and 2,100 in the&#xD;
           district of Kornaka West was generated. The total number of villages was 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Area Development Program (ADP) geographic area was stratified so that control&#xD;
           villages would not be within 5 KM of villages where there was a village with a well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Each village was assigned a sequential number from a table of random numbers. The six&#xD;
           villages with the lowest numbers assigned in the &quot;left&quot; strata were selected as the&#xD;
           &quot;intervention&quot; villages, and the six villages with the lowest numbers in the &quot;right&quot;&#xD;
           strata were selected as the &quot;control&quot; villages. Four additional villages with the next&#xD;
           lowest numbers were selected as reserve villages, in case they are needed because a&#xD;
           village refuses to have the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This selection process means that World Vision will plan to work first in the six villages&#xD;
      designated as &quot;intervention villages&quot;, so they have wells and health education programs&#xD;
      within the first year. World Vision will not implement water and health education programs in&#xD;
      the &quot;control&quot; villages until after two years. The rest of the villages not selected as either&#xD;
      intervention or controls can have programs implemented as decided by World Vision to suit&#xD;
      their needs with the understanding that wells will not be implemented in villages within 5 KM&#xD;
      of control villages until after two years. The reserve villages will be released if not&#xD;
      needed as soon as the census is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Census&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the villages have been selected, a team of trained census-takers will do three things:&#xD;
      gather minimal data on the village, minimal data on each compound or &quot;concession&quot;, and do a&#xD;
      complete census of everyone in the concession. Every concession must have a census to provide&#xD;
      an accurate count of the number of persons and number of children age 1-5 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The senior census taker will do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explain the study to the village leadership so that they understand what is being asked&#xD;
           of the village residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explain that children in the survey sample found to have trachoma will be treated with&#xD;
           topical tetracycline during the surveys. However, not every child in every household is&#xD;
           part of the survey and antibiotics are restricted to just these survey children.&#xD;
           However, mass treatment for these communities where everyone is treated is planned by&#xD;
           the government at the end of two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secure permission of the village leadership to conduct the village survey, concession&#xD;
           survey, and trachoma survey on a sample of children age 1-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect the village information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify persons in the village who can lead the census team to all concessions in the&#xD;
           village for the information on the concession and the census.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supervise the team of census takers to carry out the census of the village.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Certify that all households/concessions in the village have a census form at the end of&#xD;
           the village census&#xD;
&#xD;
      The census takers will be responsible for collecting the concession information and the&#xD;
      complete census on every concession/household in the village.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect the data on each concession from the chef of the concession, and by observation,&#xD;
           on the &quot;Questionniare Chef du Concession&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect information on everyone in the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Sample of Children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the census of all concessions is completed, the random sample of up to 60 children age 1&#xD;
      to 5 years and 5 months in each village can be selected. A stratified random sampling&#xD;
      strategy will be developed that limits the selection to no more than one children per mother,&#xD;
      with preference for 0 to 1 child age 1 to 5 and 5/12 months for a total of 60 per village.&#xD;
      This strategy minimizes clustering of children within households, which is possible if a&#xD;
      simple random sample is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey for Trachoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline surveys for trachoma in the sample of children age 1-5 5/12 years will take place&#xD;
      prior to any water or health education intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surveys will consist of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the survey in the village, a member of the team will alert the village&#xD;
           leadership that the survey team is coming, which households are in the survey, and to&#xD;
           make sure that the sample children stay in the village for the days of the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The day of the survey, the mothers will be asked to bring their sample children to a&#xD;
           survey site close by, for the examination. As they come, consent will be obtained by the&#xD;
           senior trachoma grader, and the name will be checked on the list, and a form and a&#xD;
           single specimen label filled out for the examiner and the laboratory technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The trachoma grader will be everting the eyelids. He must change gloves between each&#xD;
           child, even children in the same house, and even if the child does not appear to have&#xD;
           trachoma. The trachoma grader, wearing 2.5X loupes, will assess the trachoma status of&#xD;
           the tarsal plate, using the WHO Simplified grading scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. While the left eyelid is still everted, the laboratory technician, following careful&#xD;
           procedures described in the training manual, will roll the swab three times across the&#xD;
           tarsal plate to obtain a specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If the child has TF or TI, the mother is given a tube of tetracycline and instructions&#xD;
           on proper use for that child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At the end of each day in the field, all specimens are transferred to a freezer in World&#xD;
           Vision in Maradi, awaiting return to the freezer in Niamey. During the drive to Niamey,&#xD;
           specimens must be kept frozen as well, with ice packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By 6 months into the first year, the water and health education program in the &quot;intervention&quot;&#xD;
      villages should be underway, and the well completed. This assures at least 6 months exposure&#xD;
      to the intervention before the next survey at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same sample of children will be surveyed for trachoma at one, two, and three years. No&#xD;
      additional children will be added to the sample to replace any who have died or moved away.&#xD;
      The procedures for the follow up surveys are exactly the same as for the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mass Treatment will be provided by the Ministry of health after the Second Year Survey;&#xD;
      control villages will receive water and sanitation programs at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;intervention villages&quot; continue with water and sanitation, and undergo mass treatment&#xD;
      after two year survey. The &quot;control villages, where implementation of water and health&#xD;
      education are planned for implementation after the second year survey, also receive mass&#xD;
      treatment of azithromycin. For the third year, we can compare the prevalence of trachoma&#xD;
      after three years of water and health education plus mass treatment, to mass treatment plus&#xD;
      shorter exposure to water and health education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time as the other surveys, the complete census list of all children age five and&#xD;
      under will be updated for new children added , and children who were deceased in the previous&#xD;
      year. These data will be used to determine the under five mortality for the villages in the&#xD;
      previous year. A comparison of under five years mortality for the intervention and control&#xD;
      villages will be done at the end of the three year surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of trachoma and ocular C. trachomatis infection in sentinel children resident in&#xD;
      intervention villages compared to sentinel children resident in control villages at one and&#xD;
      two years post baseline will be done. A secondary comparison is to determine the under five&#xD;
      years mortality at two and three years post baseline in intervention versus control villages.&#xD;
