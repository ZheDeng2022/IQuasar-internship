      Mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube is a lifesaving procedure for acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure. However endotracheal intubation increases patient's discomfort and&#xD;
      stress, and represents one of the most important predisposing factors for developing&#xD;
      nosocomial bacterial pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conscious and cooperative patients non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is a&#xD;
      safe and effective mean for treating patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), improving&#xD;
      gas exchanges and reducing the rate of complication related to mechanical ventilation. Facial&#xD;
      mask, that is the conventional interface for NIV, may induce intolerance because of pain,&#xD;
      discomfort or claustrophobia leading to discontinuation of noninvasive ventilation and&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation. Thus the improvement of the interface between patient and ventilator&#xD;
      seems crucial to achieve a good tolerance allowing the prolonged application of noninvasive&#xD;
      ventilation. Attempting to improve tolerability of patients we used a new interface&#xD;
      consisting in Helmet made in latex-free PVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective randomized controlled study has been published on the comparison between&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airways pressure (CPAP), delivered by an helmet and the medical treatment&#xD;
      with Oxygen supplementation to treat early acute respiratory failure and acute lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present protocol is to compare the efficacy of CPAP delivered with helmet and&#xD;
      conventional medical treatment with oxygen supplementation via Venturi mask, to prevent ETI&#xD;
      in patients with early hypoxemic ARF ( paO2 /FiO2 below 300).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prevention of Endotracheal Intubation by NIV and CPAP Mechanical ventilation through an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube is a lifesaving procedure for acute respiratory failure. However&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation increases patient's discomfort and stress, often requiring sedation,&#xD;
      may cause injuries of the tracheal mucosa and tracheal stenosis (1), and represents one of&#xD;
      the most important predisposing factors for developing nosocomial bacterial pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conscious and cooperative patients non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is a&#xD;
      safe and effective mean for treating patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), improving&#xD;
      gas exchanges and reducing the rate of complication related to mechanical ventilation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive ventilation and CPAP can be performed by of full face mask. Facial mask may&#xD;
      induce intolerance because of pain, discomfort or claustrophobia leading to discontinuation&#xD;
      of noninvasive ventilation and endotracheal intubation. During the early phases of hypoxemic&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure if disconnection from mechanical ventilation occurs, patients can&#xD;
      rapidly deteriorate gas exchanges with potential life threatening consequences. Despite&#xD;
      improvements in facial masks characteristics, skin necrosis may occur in 7% of patients&#xD;
      treated with NPPV for periods exceeding 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempting to improve tolerability of patients we used a new interface consisting in Helmet&#xD;
      made in latex-free PVC that allows patients to see, read and speech as during noninvasive&#xD;
      pressure support ventilation (NPSV) and CPAP ( Continuos Positive Airways Pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of a helmet was recently tested and successfully applied to deliver CPAP as out&#xD;
      of hospital treatment for patients with pulmonary edema. Recently in a matched controlled&#xD;
      study we reported the efficacy of NPPV using the helmet to treat adult patients with&#xD;
      hypoxemic ARF in comparison to NPSV using standard facial mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective randomized controlled study has been published on the comparison between&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airways pressure (CPAP), delivered by an helmet and the medical treatment&#xD;
      with Oxygen supplementation to treat early acute respiratory failure and acute lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present protocol is to compare the efficacy of CPAP delivered with helmet and&#xD;
      conventional medical treatment with oxygen supplementation via Venturi mask, to prevent ETI&#xD;
      in patients with early hypoxemic ARF ( paO2 /FiO2 less than 300).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled will be randomly assigned to receive either standard treatment with oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation delivered by Venturi mask or CPAP through the Helmet. Computer-generated&#xD;
      random assignments will be concealed in sealed envelopes The ethic committee of the Catholic&#xD;
      University in Rome approved the protocol, and all patients or the next-of-kin will give&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helmet CPAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      During CPAP, the helmet is connected by conventional tubing to a free flow CPAP generator&#xD;
      (CaStar Flow generator, Starmed, Italy) with an inspiratory flow more than 45 l/min&#xD;
      (Patroniti Intensive Care Med (2003) 29:1680.1687), to avoid the need of a reservoir bag and&#xD;
      the risk of rebreathing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Helmet (CaStar Flow, Starmed, Italy) is made of transparent latex-free PVC that allows&#xD;
      patient to see, read and interact with the environment. The helmet is secured by two arm-pit&#xD;
      braces at two hooks of the metallic ring that joins the helmet with a seal connection soft&#xD;
      collar around the neck. The helmet is available in three different sizes in order to&#xD;
      ameliorate comfort and a specific seal connector placed in the metallic ring can be used to&#xD;
      allow the passage of a nasogastric tube avoiding air leakage. This connector can be also used&#xD;
      to allow patient drinking through a straw. A multiple value PEEP valve ( range 0-20 cm&#xD;
      H2O)(Starmed PEEP valve Mirandola Italy) is connected to the expiratory port of the Helmet,&#xD;
      where the PEEP value can be confirmed by an anaeroid manometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary the helmet can be easily removed and endotracheal intubation can be performed&#xD;
      rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be not sedated. CPAP will be initiated with a FiO2 equal to or greater than&#xD;
      0.5. PEEP levels will start from 5 cmH2O and augmented by 2 cmH2O stepwise if clinically&#xD;
      needed to assure a level of arterial oxygen saturation equal to or greater than 92%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP level will be reduced progressively on clinical improvement and discontinued if the&#xD;
      patient have a PaO2 / FiO2 above 300 and a RR lower than 30 breaths/min, without PEEP and&#xD;
      activation of the accessory muscles of respiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venturi Mask group Patients assigned to the standard treatment group will receive oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation via a Venturi mask starting with a fraction of inspired oxygen equal to or&#xD;
      greater than 0.5, and adjusted to achieve an initial level of arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
      equal to or greater than 92%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen cessation criteria: the patient with a PaO2 / FiO2 above 300 and a RR lower than 30&#xD;
      breaths/min, without activation of the accessory muscles of respiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for endotracheal intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients failing CPAP or standard treatment will be intubated orotracheally with cuffed&#xD;
      endotracheal tubes (internal diameter of 7.5 to 8.5 mm) and mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
      Predetermined criteria for endotracheal intubation will be identical for all groups and will&#xD;
      include one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the inability of the patient to tolerate the helmet, including discomfort, claustrophobia or&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PaO2 below 150 and at least, one of the Following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of alertness or agitation needing sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of exhaustion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of cough, inability to maintain airway with head in felxion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic instability (MAP below 65 mmHg.) frequent recurrent non perfusing&#xD;
           dysarrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of patient distress with accessory muscle recruitment and paradoxical abdominal&#xD;
           motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RR above 35 RR/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory acidosis (pH below 7.3 and PaCO2 above 50 mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional ventilation after the treatment failure Intravenous benzodiazepines (Midazolam)&#xD;
      or propofol will be used for sedation at the moment of intubation, and if possible none of&#xD;
      the patients will receive paralyzing agents. The initial ventilator setting will be&#xD;
      assist-controlled ventilation mode with a delivered tidal volume of 6-7 ml/kilogram IBW and a&#xD;
      initial respiratory rate of 18-25 breaths/min, a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and a FiO2 of 0.8.&#xD;
      Subsequent changes of the ventilator setting will be done according to the NIH protocol. (N&#xD;
      Engl J Med 2000;342:1301-8.) All patients will be weaned from the ventilator by reducing the&#xD;
      level of pressure support by 4 cmH2O twice and then at 2 hour intervals as tolerated up to 8&#xD;
      cmH2O of pressure support. If the patient will tolerate a pressure support level of 8 cmH2O&#xD;
      and an FiO2 of equal to or less than 0.5, a 2 hour T-piece trial will be initiated(11). These&#xD;
      patients will be extubated if they maintain a respiratory rate less than 30 breaths/min and a&#xD;
      PaO2 greater than 75 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of experiment Multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial. Enrolled patients will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either standard treatment with oxygen supplementation&#xD;
      delivered by Venturi mask or CPAP through a Helmet. Each patient will be observed for the&#xD;
      following days until discontinuation or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood gas levels will be determined at baseline, while breathing through Venturi&#xD;
      mask, at 1 hour during CPAP, and at 6-12 hours intervals for the first 24 hours. ABG will be&#xD;
      daily determined for the following days until discontinuation or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Points and Definitions The primary outcome variable will be the evaluation of the need&#xD;
      for endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points will include the improvement of gas exchanges, complications not present&#xD;
      on admission (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or extra-pulmonary sepsis), duration of&#xD;
      ventilatory assistance, length of the hospital stay, and ICU mortality. For each patient the&#xD;
      number of days free of mechanical ventilation will be recorded during the first 28 days after&#xD;
      the admission or until hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in gas exchange are defined as the ability to increase PaO2:FiO2 ratio above 300&#xD;
      or an increase in this ratio of more than 100 from base line.(4-5) Improvement in gas&#xD;
      exchange will be evaluated within 1 hour (initial improvement) after study entry and over&#xD;
      time (sustained improvement). Sustained improvement in gas exchange will be defined as&#xD;
      ability to maintain the defined improvement in PaO2/FiO2 until mechanical ventilation was&#xD;
      discontinued, as confirmed by serial blood gas measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of the study Experimental Center This trial is multicenter and involves four&#xD;
      different intensive care units in Italy (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Università&#xD;
      dell'Insubria-Varese, Università di Torino, Ospedale S. Gerardo di Monza Power of the study&#xD;
      Under the assumptions that the actual difference within the treatment is about 20% (20 vs.&#xD;
      40% intubation rate) with an type 1 error level of 0.05 and with a desired power of 90%,&#xD;
      between Helmet and Venturi group, the sample size is computed like 80 in the Helmet group and&#xD;
      80 in the Venturi group. Keeping into account a 20% attrition rate about 190 patient should&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point will be the proportion of endotracheal intubation in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End-points Secondary end points will be the improvement of gas exchange,&#xD;
      complications not present on admission (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or&#xD;
      extra-pulmonary sepsis), complications directly related to noninvasive CPAP as skin&#xD;
      breakdown, gastric distension or conjuctivitis, duration of ventilatory assistance, length of&#xD;
      the ICU and hospital stay, ICU and 28 days mortality.&#xD;
