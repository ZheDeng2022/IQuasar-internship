  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to&#xD;
      report the efficacy and safety of diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsule plus&#xD;
      high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed primary immune&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (ITP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate to undertaking a parallel group, randomised controlled trial of&#xD;
      106 ITP patients. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive diammonium&#xD;
      glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsule orally at a dose of 150mg tid for 3 months), combining&#xD;
      with dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg qd for 4 days). The others are selected&#xD;
      to receive high-dose of dexamethasone alone. Patients who do not respond to the treatment may&#xD;
      receive another cycle of high-dose dexamethasone therapy with an interval of 10 days.&#xD;
      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.&#xD;
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. The purpose of this study is to report&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsule combining with&#xD;
      high-dose dexamethasone therapy for the treatment of ITP.&#xD;

    <description>Complete response was defined as a platelet count of 100×10⁹ cells per L or higher and an absence of bleeding.

Platelet counts were confirmed on two separate occasions at least 7 days apart when defining complete response or partial response.
