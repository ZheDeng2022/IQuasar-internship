  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study will be to determine whether rapid remote limb ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning (RIPC) combined with acetazolamide can further reduce the incidence of acute&#xD;
      mountain sickness (AMS) during the 6-hour hypoxic chamber.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current measures to prevent acute mountain sickness (AMS) mainly include drug prevention&#xD;
      and non-drug prevention. Acetazolamide is a drug approved by the U.S. FDA for the prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of AMS. Remote limb ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) can also reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of AMS as a non-durg method, with a strategy of 2 times/day training for 1 week&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of AMS in 6 hours from 40% to 30%. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether rapid RIPC training combined with acetazolamide can further reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of AMS. In this study, subjects will be divided into 5 groups: medicine group&#xD;
      (acetazolamid 125mg bid, 2 days before entering the hypoxic room), RIPC group (RIPC training&#xD;
      twice daily, 6 days before entering the hypoxic room), rapid RIPC group (RIPC training forth&#xD;
      daily, 3 days before entering the hypoxic room), combined group (rapid RIPC training plus&#xD;
      acetazolamide) and controlled group. RIPC training, completed by Renqiao Remote Ischemic&#xD;
      Conditioning Device (Doctormate®), will be comprised of 5 cycles of bilateral upper limb&#xD;
      ischemia and reperfusion, which will be induced by 2 cuffs placed around the upper arms&#xD;
      respectively and inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by&#xD;
      cuff deflation. After the intervention, subjects will be exposed to 4500m altitude in a&#xD;
      normobaric hypoxic chamber for 6 hours. The incidence of AMS and other data will be compared&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
