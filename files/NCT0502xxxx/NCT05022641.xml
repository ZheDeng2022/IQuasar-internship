  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see if the use of near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) detection with an&#xD;
      FDA-cleared device 'Parathyroid Eye (PTeye)' for identifying parathyroid glands (PGs) during&#xD;
      parathyroidectomy (PTx) procedures is better than a surgeon's detection alone. It compares&#xD;
      risk-benefits and outcomes in PTx patients where NIRAF detection with PTeye for parathyroid&#xD;
      identification is either used or not used.&#xD;
