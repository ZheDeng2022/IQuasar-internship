    <textblock>
      For HCC patients with combined PVTT, systemic therapy can be used as a basic approach&#xD;
      throughout the treatment and in combination with hepatectomy, TACE, HAIC, radiotherapy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our center proposes to conduct a clinical study of radiotherapy combined with donafinil for&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment of HCC patients with portal vein carcinoma thrombosis to observe the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of donafinib combined with radiotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;

      In the pre-enrollment screening phase, investigators are required to record all screened&#xD;
      patients uniformly on a subject screening and enrollment form that focuses on basic patient&#xD;
      information (name, date of birth, and gender), date of screening received, and outcome (e.g.,&#xD;
      included in the study, not included in the study, and their reasons). The screening items in&#xD;
      this phase are all part of the routine clinical treatment process, and the results of the&#xD;
      tests performed before the patient signs the informed consent form can be used for&#xD;
      evaluation. Patients who subsequently meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria are required&#xD;
      to sign the informed consent form before they can be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who meet the inclusion criteria are fully evaluated&#xD;
      during the screening phase to see if they meet the enrollment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete the following items within 28 days prior to treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain a written signed ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information: including date of birth, gender, ethnicity/race.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of alcohol consumption, history of smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past medical and treatment history: take all past medical and treatment histories other&#xD;
           than this indication that began prior to signing the ICF and that are considered&#xD;
           relevant to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination: including head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, heart, chest&#xD;
           (including lungs), abdomen, extremities, skin, lymph nodes, nervous system, and general&#xD;
           condition of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs: temperature, respiration, blood pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG score: it is recommended that the ECOG evaluation be performed by the same&#xD;
           investigator throughout the study period, as detailed in Appendix 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child-Pugh score (Appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CNLC staging and Barcelona liver cancer staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virological testing: hepatitis B two-for-half [including hepatitis B virus surface&#xD;
           antibody (HBsAb), HBsAg, hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B virus e&#xD;
           antibody (HBeAb), and HBcAb], HCV antibody, and HIV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess the eligibility of subjects for&#xD;
           inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AE collection: for AEs after signing the ICF and before the first dose, they should be&#xD;
           recorded on the past medical history page of the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete the following items within 14 days prior to treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests including: red blood cell count, hemoglobin, red blood cell&#xD;
           pressure, white blood cell count and classification (neutrophils, lymphocytes,&#xD;
           eosinophils, monocytes, basophils), and platelet count; obtain baseline values within 14&#xD;
           days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood biochemical tests including: total protein, albumin, creatinine, ALP, lactate&#xD;
           dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, AST, ALT, calcium, phosphorus,&#xD;
           potassium, sodium, and chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine urine examination including: specific gravity, pH, urine sugar, protein,&#xD;
           tubular, ketone bodies, blood cells; 24-hour urine protein quantification is required if&#xD;

           to be abnormal and clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fecal occult blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coagulation tests including: aPTT, PT, TT, INR&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Tumor assessment: screening tumor assessment must be performed within 14 days prior to&#xD;
           enrollment and should include a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis; if&#xD;
           clinically indicated, any other known or suspected disease site may be examined using&#xD;
           appropriate methods, such as a cranial MRI, bone scan, or CT scan of the neck; imaging&#xD;
           of tumors done for routine visits before the subject signs up for ICF need not be&#xD;
           repeated if done within 3 weeks prior to enrollment and at this study center; baseline&#xD;
           and follow-up assessments should be performed using the same imaging methods and&#xD;
           assessed by the same investigator whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined medication/combined treatment collection: all medication received by the&#xD;
           subject from 14 days prior to enrollment must be recorded in the CRF, including the&#xD;
           generic name and daily dose of the medication, the reason for the use of that&#xD;
           medication, the start date and the end date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assign enrollment number.&#xD;
