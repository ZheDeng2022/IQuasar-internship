      Background: Currently the dietary intake patterns of children do not meet the prescribed&#xD;
      dietary guidelines. Consequently childhood obesity is one of the most serious health&#xD;
      concerns. Therefore, innovative methods need to be developed and tested in order to&#xD;
      effectively improve the dietary intake of children. Learning children how to cope with the&#xD;
      overwhelming number of unhealthy food cues could be conducted effectively by serious health&#xD;
      games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main aim of this study was to examine the effect of a serious health computer&#xD;
      game on young children's eating behavior and attitudes towards healthy and unhealthy foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial with a between-subject design was conducted&#xD;
      (N=157; 8-12 years), whereby children played a game that promoted a healthy lifestyle or were&#xD;
      in the control condition. Children in the control condition attended regular classes and did&#xD;
      not play a game. The game was designed in collaboration with researchers and pilot-tested&#xD;
      before conducting the experiment among a group of children repeatedly. After one week of&#xD;
      playing, attitudes towards food snacks and actual intake was assessed, whereby children could&#xD;
      eat at libitum from fruits or energy-dense snacks.&#xD;
