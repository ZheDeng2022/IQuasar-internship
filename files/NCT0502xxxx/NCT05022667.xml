    <textblock>
      This study will see if the use of near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) detection with a&#xD;
      'Parathyroid Eye (PTeye)' for identifying parathyroid glands (PGs) during total thyroidectomy&#xD;
      (TTx) is better than surgeon's detection alone. It compares risk, benefits and outcomes in&#xD;
      TTx patients where NIRAF detection with PTeye for parathyroid identification is either used&#xD;
      or not used.&#xD;
