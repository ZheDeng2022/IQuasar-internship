  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory disc disease or Modic 1 disc disease is a radiological entity first described by&#xD;
      Modic in 1988 and corresponds to an inflammatory signal on MRI defined by the presence of a&#xD;
      T2-weighted hypersignal and a T1-weighted hyposignal of the vertebral endplates adjacent to a&#xD;
      pathological disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of these radiological abnormalities are significantly associated with chronic&#xD;
      low back pain, the therapeutic management of which may include lumbar rehabilitation, rigid&#xD;
      corset, spinal infiltrations and surgical treatment. Corticosteroid infiltration of the&#xD;
      pathological intervertebral disc (intradiscal infiltration) has been evaluated in low back&#xD;
      pain due to Modic 1 disc disease with short-term efficacy. The clinical response to this&#xD;
      infiltration is not always optimal and to date in the literature, no predictive factor of&#xD;
      response has been identified.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon: mechanical, genetic, infectious or&#xD;
      inflammatory. One of the mechanical hypotheses would be the presence of an instability of the&#xD;
      spinal segment (hypermobility of the spinal segment) and disorders of the sagittal statics of&#xD;
      the spine with angles of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis weak and a weak sacral slope&#xD;
      supporting a hyperpressure passing by the discs and the genesis of discopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, the investigators will evaluate the different parameters of the spinal statics&#xD;
      in the sagittal plane and in the frontal plane (sacral slope, pelvic version, Roussouly&#xD;
      classification, cobb angle...) by EOS imaging as well as the parameters of the Modic 1&#xD;
      anomaly on lumbar MRI (spinal stage, Pfirmann classification, laterality of the inflammatory&#xD;
      signal) in a population of patients who received intradiscal corticosteroid infiltration for&#xD;
      low back pain in the context of Modic 1 disc disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the different radiological parameters could enrich the investigator's&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology and evaluate radiological factors predictive of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of intradiscal infiltration in this population. This could allow us to adapt&#xD;
      the management of low back pain patients with Modic 1 disc disease.&#xD;
