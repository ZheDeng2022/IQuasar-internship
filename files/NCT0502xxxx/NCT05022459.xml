  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A (HA) is a genetic bleeding disorder resulting from a deficiency or absence of&#xD;
      factor VIII (FVIII), which is necessary in the clotting process. This disorder occurs mostly&#xD;
      in males and in severe cases causes frequent bleeding episodes in joints and muscles which&#xD;
      can lead to progressive damage that affects mobility and quality of life. Prophylactic FVIII&#xD;
      administered intravenously every other day has been the standard of care treatment for HA for&#xD;
      the past few decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports and physical activity are generally encouraged in patients with hemophilia on&#xD;
      appropriate prophylactic treatment to increase strength, prevent or decrease obesity, accrue&#xD;
      and maintain bone density and encourage normal socialization. To ensure safety with&#xD;
      participation in sports in persons with hemophilia A (PWHA), timing of FVIII administration&#xD;
      is often adjusted to maximize FVIII at the time of sports. The exact factor level that is&#xD;
      needed to safely participate in sports and minimize bleeding risk is not yet known. Based on&#xD;
      clinical practice, infusion of FVIII to near the lower limit of normal right before&#xD;
      participation in sports generally works to prevent bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is looking at how well the newly approved medication Emicizumab works compared to&#xD;
      Factor VIII to prevent bleeding in patients with Hemophilia A who play sports. The study will&#xD;
      enroll children and adolescents who are already on Emicizumab or Factor VIII who are&#xD;
      currently playing sports.&#xD;

      Hemophilia A (HA) is a genetic bleeding disorder resulting from a deficiency or absence of&#xD;
      factor VIII (FVIII) which is necessary in the clotting process. This disorder occurs mostly&#xD;
      in males and in severe cases causes frequent bleeding episodes in joints and muscles which&#xD;
      can lead to progressive damage that affects mobility and quality of life. Intravenous&#xD;
      prophylactic (preventative) treatment is the standard of care used in minimizing bleeding&#xD;
      events and complications. Since the 1990s recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) concentrates have been&#xD;
      standard of care treatment options for patients with hemophilia A. Prophylactic treatment is&#xD;
      burdensome because it requires self-administered intravenous infusions several (3-4) times a&#xD;
      week and prophylactic FVIII does not completely prevent bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports and physical activity are generally encouraged in patients with hemophilia on&#xD;
      appropriate prophylactic treatment to increase strength, prevent or decrease obesity, accrue&#xD;
      and maintain bone density and encourage normal socialization. To ensure safety with&#xD;
      participation in sports in persons with hemophilia A (PWHA), timing of FVIII administration&#xD;
      is frequently adjusted to maximize FVIII at the time of sports. The exact factor level that&#xD;
      is needed to safely participate in sports and minimize bleeding risk is not yet known. Based&#xD;
      on clinical practice, infusion of FVIII to near the lower limit of normal right before&#xD;
      participation in sports generally works to prevent bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emicizumab is an engineered antibody that mimics what activated factor VIII does in the blood&#xD;
      to help it clot. Emicizumab is an antibody and is present in the blood for a long time and&#xD;
      approximately 50% of an injected dose is still circulating in the blood 4 weeks later; this&#xD;
      permits less frequent dosing (Anywhere from once a week to once every 4 weeks). Emicizumab&#xD;
      can be injected under the skin (subcutaneous) instead of having to be injected into a vein&#xD;
      (intravenous). Emicizumab's convenience compared to FVIII, reduced bleeding rate, and in many&#xD;
      cases decreased annual cost, have led to its adoption by many patients with HA. Emicizumab&#xD;
      does not completely normalize hemostasis (the physiological process that stops bleeding) and&#xD;
      although the exact comparison of hemostatic correction on maintenance doses of Emicizumab to&#xD;
      that with FVIII replacement cannot be determined with existing assays, it has been clinically&#xD;
      demonstrated that Emicizumab changes the bleeding characteristics of a patient with severe&#xD;
      hemophilia A to a milder profile. While this may provide sufficient protection to prevent&#xD;
      spontaneous bleeding into the joints, it remains unknown if this is sufficient to prevent&#xD;
      activity/sports related joint bleeds (especially activities with moderate to high risk of&#xD;
      bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A disadvantage of Emicizumab prophylaxis is that the steady state produced with Emicizumab&#xD;
      prophylaxis does not allow dosing at the time of sports participation. One major question is&#xD;
      whether the &quot;steady state&quot; levels of hemostasis achieved with Emicizumab are enough to&#xD;
      prevent joint damage with sports participation, and whether there is a threshold of&#xD;
      participant age or size or activity intensity above which Emicizumab is not generally&#xD;
      adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emicizumab use permits maintenance of &quot;steady state&quot; hemostasis in the range of mild&#xD;
      hemophilia without frequent infusions. Studying patients taking Emicizumab while engaging in&#xD;
      sports permits us to study the effects of participation in physical activity with steady&#xD;
      state hemostasis levels in the range of mild hemophilia compared to peak hemostatic levels&#xD;
      from factor infusions given immediately before engaging in activity/sports. This is a crucial&#xD;
      factor in the decision-making process for physicians making treatment recommendations to&#xD;
      optimize preventive therapy for physically active people with hemophilia A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to better understand the safety of sports&#xD;
      in people with Hemophilia A, the breakthrough bleed rates, and the types of bleeds related to&#xD;
      sports activities in patients on Emicizumab vs traditional FVIII prophylaxis. This&#xD;
      information will help in the decision-making process for physicians making treatment&#xD;
      recommendations for physically active people with hemophilia A.&#xD;
