  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental hormone (environmental hormone), also known as &quot;endocrine disrupting chemicals&quot;&#xD;
      (EDCS), is a pollutant that affects the endocrine system and causes diseases and dysfunction&#xD;
      throughout the life cycle. Many daily products are ubiquitous, and the most common are&#xD;
      phthalates (plasticizers); in recent years, many scientific research reports have determined&#xD;
      the adverse health effects of phthalates, including: Infertility (Den Hond et al. al., 2015),&#xD;
      testicular hypoplasia (Fisher, 2004), obesity (Dirtu et al., 2013), diabetes (Fénichel &amp;&#xD;
      Chevalier, 2017), hyperglycemia (Williams et al., 2016), asthma (Wang et al., 2016) al.,&#xD;
      2015), endometriosis and high abortion rate (Roy et al., 2015), polycystic ovary syndrome&#xD;
      (Vagi et al., 2014), prostate cancer (Chuang et al., 2020), and Breast cancer (Chen et al.,&#xD;
      2020; Fu et al., 2017; Holmes et al., 2014; López-Carrillo et al., 2010), etc. In 2011, the&#xD;
      Taiwan Food and Drug Administration detected di（2-ethylhexyl）phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl&#xD;
      phthalate (DBP) in foods, food supplements, and beverages, and determined that the Taiwanese&#xD;
      population has a high content of phthalates (Yang et al., 2013). It pointed out that exposure&#xD;
      to plasticizers in the uterus will have lifelong effects and even endanger the health of the&#xD;
      next generation, indicating that there is a significant positive correlation between the&#xD;
      concentration of metabolites in the urine of pregnant women and the urine of their children&#xD;
      (Lin et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013), even related to children's autism (Carter &amp; Blizard,&#xD;
      2016; Rossignol et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, so far there is still a lack of research on environmental hormone-plasticizers to&#xD;
      improve health literacy or develop interventional research. Therefore, this study hopes to&#xD;
      track the health literacy of their plasticizers and provide nursing education interventions&#xD;
      (including e-health platform assistance) for women. Randomized controlled trials (English:&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, RCT) will be used to test nursing education interventions using&#xD;
      a double-blind trial system. (Including e-health platform assistance) Effectiveness, in order&#xD;
      to provide simple and fast self-health monitoring and management for the people, and it is&#xD;
      expected that the case can early prevent the occurrence of related diseases and ensure the&#xD;
      safety of the living environment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Health literacy is an important factor in determining public and personal health, and is&#xD;
      regarded as the core of patient-centered care. Relevant studies have indicated that a lack of&#xD;
      health literacy has the following results: higher mortality, poor self-management skills,&#xD;
      lower satisfaction with medical and disease communication, poor awareness of diseases, higher&#xD;
      hospitalization and emergency medical use rates, easier incorrect medication, low utilization&#xD;
      of preventive health care services (such as screening), high prevalence of chronic diseases&#xD;
      (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, etc.), and high health care costs&#xD;
      (Berkman, Sheridan, Donahue, Halpern, &amp; Crotty, 2011; Berkman, Sheridan, Donahue, Halpern,&#xD;
      Viera, et al., 2011; DeWalt et al., 2004). However, so far there is still a lack of research&#xD;
      on environmental hormone-plasticizers to improve health literacy or develop interventional&#xD;

    <time_frame>six month after intervention(T2)] for Experimental arm</time_frame>
    <description>System Usability Scale ( SUS) has ten items, created by John Brooke in 1986 (Brooke, 1986), and is widely used to quickly test standardized questionnaires (objectivity, universality, Repeatable and quantifiable) (Brooke, 2013). Using Likert's five-point scale, questions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are positive questions, and questions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are negative questions. After calculating the scores for each question, multiply all the scores by 2.5 to get the total score.</description>
