  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effect of three different stress reduction intervention&#xD;
      techniques compared to a non-intervention control group on the psychological and relationship&#xD;
      functioning in 40 romantic couples. The current study will serve two purposes. Results will&#xD;
      inform future efforts to develop effective brief stress reduction interventions for&#xD;
      physically healthy couples and will inform future iterations of stress reduction-based&#xD;
      intervention for cancer patients and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that couples in the three stress-reduction interventions will&#xD;
      report greater relationship health and greater mindfulness after the intervention than&#xD;
      couples in the non-intervention control group. The investigators also hypothesize that the&#xD;
      stress-reduction groups will be most beneficial for individuals who report higher distress,&#xD;
      indifferent relationship style, and insecure attachment at baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions, each of which involve&#xD;
      participating in two 45-minute sessions (via Zoom) with a study interventionist. Sam Houston&#xD;
      State University (SHSU) clinical psychology master's or doctoral students or graduates of the&#xD;
      SHSU clinical psychology master's program will implement the mind-body intervention, under&#xD;
      the supervision of Dr. Chelsea Ratcliff, who is a licensed psychologist. Dr. Ratcliff will&#xD;
      provide weekly group supervision to all students implementing the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last a total of 6 weeks (+/- 1 week). The T1 survey will&#xD;
      last approximately 45 minutes. Within 1 week of both partners completing baseline, eligible&#xD;
      dyads will be scheduled for Session 1. For the intervention, all participants will be emailed&#xD;
      a PDF of the appropriate workbook prior to Session 1. Participants will also be informed that&#xD;
      they may pick up a hard copy (printed version).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the stress-reduction groups, after each session the interventionist will&#xD;
      send each participant an email with: 1) the audio recording of the appropriate guided&#xD;
      stress-reduction activity (transcript provided in workbook), 2) a fillable PDF document with&#xD;
      instructions regarding completing and documenting home-practice, and 3) a link to a Qualtrics&#xD;
      survey that asks them to evaluate their experience in the session. The instructor will also&#xD;
      inform participants that they may pick up hard copies of all session materials if it is&#xD;
      convenient/preferable. For participants in the non-intervention control group, the&#xD;
      interventionist will email each participant a link to a Qualtrics survey that asks them to&#xD;
      evaluate their experience in the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 will take place approximately 1 week after Session 1. After completing session 2,&#xD;
      the interventionist will send a link to another Qualtrics survey that asks them to evaluate&#xD;
      their experience in the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 1 week of completing Session 2, both members of the dyad will be emailed the link to&#xD;
      the second Qualtrics survey (T2), which will last approximately 30 minutes. Finally, within 1&#xD;
      month (+/- 1 week) of completing Session 2, both members of the dyad will be emailed the&#xD;
      third Qualtrics survey (T3), which will last approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>For participants randomized to the MC condition will focus on compassion and creating positive emotions. This session will include techniques such as guided visualizations and a loving kindness meditation that are intended to facilitate connection with their partners. During this session, couples will also learn the ground rules of mindful and compassionate listening and sharing, as they will be asked to engage in an emotional disclosure task. The instructor will go over the homework assignment. The interventionist will review the tools the couples had learned over the course of this program and help them proactively identify strategies to continue to implement them into their lives. Couples will receive instructions on how to continue with this program when no longer meeting with the interventionist.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Session 2 for participants randomized to group MG will focus on gratitude. Participants will be taught to reflect on things, events, and people which they are grateful for via a gratitude meditation. Couples will share their experiences of practicing gratitude. The instructor will remind the couple of ground rules prior to the emotional disclosure exercise and facilitate if necessary during the sharing. Each member of the couple will take turn in sharing with and listening to their partner. The instructor will go over the homework assignment. The interventionist will review the tools the couples had learned over the course of this program and help them proactively identify strategies to continue to implement them into their lives. Couples will receive instructions on how to continue with this program when no longer meeting with the interventionist.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Mindfulness + Value-Based Living (MV)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Session 2 for participants randomized to group MV will focus on learning strategies to live life according to their values. They will first engage in a reflection exercise to help identify their values, and then complete a worksheet. Couples will brain storm together strategies to ensure that their lives reflect their self-identified values. The instructor will go over the homework assignment. The interventionist will review the tools the couples had learned over the course of this program and help them proactively identify strategies to continue to implement them into their lives. Couples will receive instructions on how to continue with this program when no longer meeting with the interventionist.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Attention Control (AC)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>For participants randomized to the AC condition, both sessions will focus on discussing issues and themes that emerge for couples, such as communication and perceived supportiveness. Utilizing a reflective listening approach, the interventionist will focus on encouraging participants to share concerns related to their daily experiences. Unlike in the MC, MG, and MV groups, the interventionist will not offer advice, support (other than reflective listening) or any other tools to participants. Additionally, the interventionist will not probe for deep emotional disclosure. Please see the appendix for the session outline. We believe a control group that discusses daily relationship-related concerns serves as an excellent comparison condition in this study since it is viewed as credible by participants and equates for time and attention as well as nonspecific treatment effects such as those provided through social interactions.</description>
