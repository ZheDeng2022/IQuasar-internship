      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most symptoms of human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection, do not cause serious health&#xD;
      problems, but some do. As HPV can cause uncontrolled growth of infected cells, some people&#xD;
      can develop benign skin lesions, larger warts, genital lesions, tumors or cysts that do not&#xD;
      respond to treatment. Researchers want to learn why.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand why some people are more likely than others to get sick from HPV&#xD;
      infection, and why medicine or surgery is not always effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 3 years and older who have had multiple outbreaks of HPV-related warts and/or&#xD;
      lesions that do not respond to treatment. Healthy relatives are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have study visits as an outpatient or an inpatient (admitted overnight to&#xD;
      the NIH hospital) and be followed over several years by our doctors and researchers at the&#xD;
      NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a cervical and/or anal Pap test. They may give samples of semen,&#xD;
      cervicovaginal secretions, urine, saliva, or stool. Small pieces of skin, the inside of the&#xD;
      cheek, and/or the gums may be collected with a punch or scrape biopsy to understand how HPV&#xD;
      affect the growth of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucus and skin may be collected by rubbing the area with a cotton swab. Collection areas may&#xD;
      include the inside the mouth, nostrils, skin, genitals, and/or in or around the anus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies may be collected. If participants need to have a biopsy as part of medical care,&#xD;
      then we may ask if extra samples can be collected for research. Biopsies we may collect are&#xD;
      bone marrow, lymph node, genitals, or in or around the anus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have leukapheresis. Blood is taken from a needle placed in one arm. A&#xD;
      machine separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a&#xD;
      needle in their other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples may be used for genetic tests and/or to make special cells called induced pluripotent&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have follow-up visits once a year for 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are not testing new HPV treatments in this study and you might not benefit from&#xD;
      participating. However, we may learn new information about your condition that we will share&#xD;
      with you and your doctor. We may make recommendations for your medical care based on current&#xD;
      accepted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What we learn from you and other participants in this study might help other people. We hope&#xD;
      we can use this information to develop new treatments and therapies in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify clinical and immunologic correlates of increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, HPV related dysplasia/cancer, or any&#xD;
      other HPV-related clinical manifestations. We will enroll patients with disseminated,&#xD;
      multifocal or recurrent HPV-related diseases refractory to standard-of-care medical or&#xD;
      surgical interventions. Healthy family members will also be enrolled as comparators. This&#xD;
      protocol will allow long-term follow-up of patients with primary or acquired immunologic&#xD;
      abnormalities associated to such increased susceptibility to HPV-related diseases. It will&#xD;
      also allow periodic clinical and laboratory evaluation with collection of blood, biological&#xD;
      fluids, tissue and mucosal swabs, and tissue biopsies for medically indicated purposes.&#xD;
      Additional research studies on these samples will be aimed to identify genetic and&#xD;
      immunologic bases of their HPV related diseases and inform the development of specific and&#xD;
      effective treatment interventions.&#xD;
