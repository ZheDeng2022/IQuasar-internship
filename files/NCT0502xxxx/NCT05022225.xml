  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who start home dialysis take on an added responsibility and that can be challenging.&#xD;
      The investigators are interested in studying the patient and care partner perspective on the&#xD;
      challenges that the participants faced on home dialysis and what interventions could help&#xD;
      support them better by holding focus group discussions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home dialysis has many advantages compared to in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) including better&#xD;
      quality of life and lower healthcare costs. Transfer from home dialysis to ICHD is disruptive&#xD;
      to the patients' lives and in some cases may be preventible. Patients do not infrequently&#xD;
      transfer to ICHD due to psychosocial reasons, which may be multi-factorial and hard to&#xD;
      capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore patients' and care partners' perspectives and experiences&#xD;
      of the psychosocial factors that make home dialysis challenging and that ultimately&#xD;
      contribute to transfer to ICHD during focus group discussions. The investigators will ask&#xD;
      them to describe issues that may compound patient and care partner burnout; for those who&#xD;
      have already transferred to hemodialysis, the investigators will specifically ask what&#xD;
      factors contributed to their transfer off of home dialysis. the investigators will also ask&#xD;
      for feedback on what interventions may have helped to prevent the transfer and/or burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding patient's perspectives and experiences will help the investigators improve&#xD;
           patient experience and identify the gaps in health care delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help plan interventions and scale-out a solution to identify patients experiencing&#xD;
           challenges that put them at risk of transfer to ICHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lay the groundwork to develop surveys that can be used in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enable a truly patient-centered care model, understanding the issues in more detail&#xD;
           is critical.&#xD;
