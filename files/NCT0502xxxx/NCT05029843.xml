      The Pearson Syndrome Natural History Study (PS-NHS) aims to collect data on standardized&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, store data on the Champ Foundation Registry (CFR) and make this data&#xD;
      available to researchers, clinicians, and industry partners who are studying SLSMDS to answer&#xD;
      questions regarding the disease, including its causes, potential treatments, and other&#xD;
      topics. A secondary aim is to analyze the data to understand research questions relating to&#xD;
      the natural history of Pearson syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, observational, and longitudinal study intended to track the&#xD;
      course of Pearson syndrome and single large scale mitochondrial DNA deletion syndromes&#xD;
      (SLSMDS) to identify demographic, genetic, environmental, and other variables that correlate&#xD;
      with the diseases development and outcomes. If available, retrospective clinical data may be&#xD;
      accessed and used in analyses as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PS-NHS will be conducted at two Center of Excellence sites: the Cleveland Clinic and&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All PS-NHS data will be entered and stored on the CFR. The CFR exists entirely online.&#xD;

    <measure>Columbia Neurological Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Neurological Scale is a neurological assessment that includes a general medical exam and a general neurological exam. It will take approximately 30 minutes to complete, and that includes evaluation of nerves, muscles and movement. Columbia Neurological Scale ranges from 0 (abnormal exam) to 76 (normal exam).</description>

    <measure>International Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The International Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale is designed to monitor general disease progression associated with mitochondrial disease in children 0 to 18 years old. It includes a physical examination and evaluation of symptoms and functioning. The International Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale will include a clinician-administered assessment that involves asking participants questions and evaluating participants' movements and responses, as well as a patient survey. The score is expressed as the percentage of items which were feasible to perform. Asterixes (*) can be scored as well, the total score will change accordingly. E.g. if the parents are not able to indicate the presence of headache, the maximum score of the first domain changes from 103 to 73. If the child is not cooperative during the execution of domain 2 and 3, these items are omitted from the total score.</description>
