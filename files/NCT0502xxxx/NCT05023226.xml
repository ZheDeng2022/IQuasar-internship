  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to comparison the effectiveness of recruitment maneuvers(RM) and lung&#xD;
      protective ventilation strategy(LPVS) for patients with moderate to severe ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARDS patients were randomly divided into two groups, the experimental group (LPVS+RM group)&#xD;
      and the control group (LPVS group). The method of RM refers to that under FiO2=100% oxygen&#xD;
      concentration and fixed inspiratory pressure (15cmH2O), the PEEP starts from 10 cmH2O and&#xD;
      increases at a pressure of 5 cmH2O every minute until the Peak inspiratory Pressure(PIP)&#xD;
      reaches 55cmH2O, and the arterial blood oxygen is monitored at the same time. The pressure&#xD;
      point when the partial pressure of arterial oxygen PaO2+PaCO2≧400mmHg is the best PEEP. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint indicators were oxygenation index(OI), extravascular lung water index&#xD;
      (EVLWI) and lung ultrasound score(LUS) from day 1 to day 7. The secondary outcome indicators&#xD;
      were the ventilator days, length of stay in the ICU (days), and ICU mortality.&#xD;

    <description>RM refers to that under FiO2=100% oxygen concentration and fixed inspiratory pressure (15cmH2O), the PEEP starts from 10 cmH2O and increases at a pressure of 5 cmH2O every minute until the Peak inspiratory Pressure(PIP) reaches 55cmH2O, and the level was fixed to 40 seconds in each increment. Then, the ventilator was transferred to PEEP-titration phase, the PEEP was adjusted to 25 cm H2O, and it was reduced by increments of 5 cm H2O each time. The each increment was fixed to 5 minutes till the end-maneuver PEEP.</description>

    <intervention_name>LPVS</intervention_name>
    <description>LPVS was used by the pressure-controlled mode and the PEEP was titrated by the level of FiO2 to keep the saturation of oxygen (SaO2) more than 90%. The level of pressure control was adjusted to maintain low tidal volume (6-8 mL/kg predicted body weight [PBW]) strategy. The respiratory rate and tidal volume were setting to avoid unstable hemodynamic data and adjusted by blood gas data and lung mechanics.</description>
