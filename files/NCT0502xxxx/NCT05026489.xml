  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral infarction brings heavy burden to patients and families with high morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, disability and recurrence rate. Anti-platelet aggregation therapy plays important&#xD;
      role for secondary prevention of cerebral infarction. G6PD deficiency is a rare genetic&#xD;
      disorder, patients with this disorder could suffer hemolysis after eating broad beans.&#xD;
      Professor Zeng Jinsheng et al found that the hemolysis risk of G6PD deficiency patients was&#xD;
      significantly increased when aspirin was applied in Guangdong Province. However, the&#xD;
      prevalence of G6PD deficiency in northern China remains unknown, as well as the safety of&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy. To this end, 1000 patients with acute cerebral infarction will be&#xD;
      continuously included in 30 second-level and above hospitals in 10 prefectures and cities of&#xD;
      Shaanxi Province for observation and follow-up for 12 months, to explore the prevalence of&#xD;
      G6PD deficiency in cerebral infarction patients in Shaanxi Province, and to analyze the&#xD;
      relationship between G6PD deficiency and the clinical characteristics and prognosis of&#xD;
      cerebral infarction. To clarify the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet therapy for G6PD&#xD;
      patients with cerebral infarction is of great significance for guiding the individualized&#xD;
      treatment of cerebral infarction.&#xD;
