      The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the effects and the implementation process of&#xD;
      the Family Talk Intervention (FTI) in clinical practice when a child has a&#xD;
      life-threatening/life-limiting illness and is cared for at a children's hospital (cancer,&#xD;
      neurological diseases, etc.). During 2021, FTI will be implemented in several different care&#xD;
      contexts including a children's hospital in Sweden. Social workers will be educated in using&#xD;
      the FTI in their clinical work. This study has a pre-post effectiveness-implementation hybrid&#xD;
      design using mixed method. Data collection will be made using web-based questionnaires and&#xD;
      interviews with families and social workers, and observations will be performed throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Family Talk Intervention (FTI), also called Beardslee's Family Intervention is a&#xD;
      manual-based complex intervention and involves families who have children aged 6-18 years.&#xD;
      The core elements are to support the families in talking about illness-related subjects,&#xD;
      support the parents in understanding the needs of their children and how to support them, and&#xD;
      support the families in identifying their strengths and how best to use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this trial is to evaluate the effects and the implementation process of&#xD;
      FTI in clinical practice when a child has a life-threatening/life-limiting illness and is&#xD;
      cared for at a children's hospital (cancer, neurological diseases, etc.). More specifically,&#xD;
      to examine the effects of FTI regarding family communication and psychosocial health among&#xD;
      family members (Aim 1) and describe facilitating factors and barriers for implementing FTI in&#xD;
      everyday clinical practice (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FTI has previously been pilot-tested in the context of specialized palliative home care&#xD;
      with promising results. In pilot-tests, an assigned interventionist was used for intervention&#xD;
      delivery, while in this continued trial, social workers will deliver the intervention as a&#xD;
      part of their clinical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has a pre-post effectiveness-implementation hybrid design using mixed method. It&#xD;
      will be placed at a children's hospital, at a university hospital in Sweden and conducted by&#xD;
      all social workers working there (n=25). Education of social workers in working with FTI will&#xD;
      take place during 2021 and families will be invited to the project from January 2022 and&#xD;
      until power has been reached. Data will be collected using web-based questionnaires and&#xD;
      interviews with families and social workers, and observations will be performed throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <description>FTI entails six meetings, with intervals of 1-2 weeks between meetings. Meetings 1-2 include only the parent(s) and focus on their experiences of the situation, as well as the consequences of the diagnosis for each family member. The parent(s) will formulate the goal of the intervention. Meeting 3: Interviews will be held with each child and includes the child's life situation. Meeting 4 includes the parent(s) and focuses on planning the family meeting. The children's thoughts and questions serve as a guide for the upcoming family meeting. Meeting 5 is a family meeting and consists of questions and issues raised earlier by the family members. Meeting 6 is a follow-up with all family members. The meeting is guided by the family members' needs, e.g., regarding communication and parenting. If the intervention is interrupted unexpectedly and cannot be finished as scheduled due to extraordinary circumstances, extra meetings are available (Meetings 7-11).</description>
