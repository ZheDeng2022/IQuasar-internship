  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of&#xD;
      CNTX-6970 for the treatment of pain related to OA of the knee compared to placebo. CNTX-6970&#xD;
      is being developed as a new treatment for chronic pain, including painful osteoarthritis of&#xD;
      the knee.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a randomized, allocation-concealed, multicenter, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      multi-period crossover design (Schmid et al, 2018). This multi-period crossover randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial allows comparability and assessment of efficacy through repeated exposures&#xD;
      within each subject to the active treatment and a control (placebo) in randomized sequence.&#xD;
      Such multi-period crossover designs are ideal for treatments with rapid onset of action and&#xD;
      short half-life such as the asset under study here. We have strived to minimize the&#xD;
      complexity of this powerful design by using only 2 blocks with 2 periods each. The modest&#xD;
      additional complexity of the proposed multi-period crossover design, compared to a&#xD;
      parallel-groups design, is justified by the marked improvement in efficiency. The gains in&#xD;
      efficiency afforded by the multi-period crossover design allow a substantial reduction in&#xD;
      sample size without sacrificing statistical power. For example, our simulation experiments&#xD;
      (with sample sizes ranging from 30 to 50, carryover effects ranging from 0 to 0.2, and an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.4) indicated that the parallel design yields statistical power ranging from&#xD;
      0.20-0.25, whereas our proposed 2-block multi-period crossover design yields power ranging&#xD;
      from 0.9-1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will compare an active treatment vs. placebo. Each arm of the study will employ a&#xD;
      multi-period crossover design with two blocks. Each block will consist of two treatment&#xD;
      periods with each period lasting 6 weeks. Treatment assignments (active drug versus placebo)&#xD;
      will be randomized for each patient to the two periods within each block. The period length&#xD;
      of 6 weeks was chosen based on several considerations: (i) Most efficacious analgesic drugs&#xD;
      demonstrate separation from placebo by 6 weeks; (ii) The decision to move CNTX-6970 forward&#xD;
      to Phase 3 will require a clinically meaningful separation from placebo by 6 weeks; (iii) In&#xD;
      this Phase 2 study, implementing a treatment block longer than 6 weeks would make the overall&#xD;
      design more challenging and burdensome by extending the duration of overall testing beyond 6&#xD;
      months; (iv) Recent meta-analyses suggest that anti-inflammatory treatments such as NSAIDs&#xD;
      reach peak effects on pain within a 4-week timeframe in patients with knee osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      and multiple RCTs have specifically demonstrated efficacy for celecoxib at 2-6 weeks (Osani&#xD;
      et al, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison with celecoxib is used to evaluate &quot;assay sensitivity,&quot; i.e., to assess the&#xD;
      study protocol's ability to demonstrate superiority of an established efficacious treatment&#xD;
      (celecoxib 100mg BID). In this study, the placebo will consist of inactive tablets identical&#xD;
      to the active treatment tablets. Treatment assignments (active drug versus placebo) will be&#xD;
      randomized for each patient to the two treatment periods within each block&#xD;

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure used to assess efficacy will be patient-reported knee pain using the WOMAC Part A (Bellamy, et al., 1988).We will use the numerical rating scale version of the WOMAC, with the subject assessing each of 5 questions using an 11-point (0 to 10) scale; the total score is the sum of the individual item scores (range 0-50). A higher WOMAC score represents worse symptom severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), reported between the administration of study drug on Day 1 and the completion of the study at week 24 or early termination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily Knee Pain Intensity on a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Pain intensity is reported by patients with chronic pain as one of the most important targets of treatment, and daily pain intensity ratings are a recommended core outcome measure for clinical trials of treatments for chronic pain. Daily ratings are preferable to ratings of recalled pain over longer time periods such as a week, as daily ratings minimize the influence of recall biases (Dworkin et al., 2005). Participants provide one-daily reports (at the end of the day) of their average knee pain intensity on a 0-10 pain intensity NRS over the course of a week, and those daily ratings are averaged to compute a mean knee pain intensity score. Participants will record their Daily Pain Intensity NRS 0-10 each day for one week prior to each clinic visit using NEForm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC-C (Function subscale) (Bellamy et al, 1988). The WOMAC-physical function subscale contains 17 items assessing daily functioning, each using an 11-point (0 to 10) numerical rating scale. The total index score (0-170) is the sum of the items. A higher WOMAC function score represents worse functioning and less ability to engage in daily activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in those with medical illness (Norton et al, 2013). This scale has 14 items, 7 related to anxiety and 7 to depression, rated on 4 points (0 to 3) in domains of intensity or frequency. Scoring is done separately for depression and for anxiety and each domain is interpreted as normal for scores of 0-7, borderline abnormal (borderline case) for scores of 8-10 and abnormal (case) for scores of 11-21. This scale is used to assess depression and anxiety in addition to HEAL/EPPIC-Net core data elements (CDEs) because of its higher sensitivity to change especially in patients with medical illnesses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale - 6A</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale - 6A (Yu et al, 2011). Sleep disruption has a bi-directional relationship with chronic pain and is an important secondary outcome to measure in pain trials (Edwards et al, 2016). The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance short form is a convenient 6-item scale that correlates strongly with the longer forms. It shows greater measurement precision for assessing sleep disturbance than other commonly-used (and much longer) questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale; its brevity and convenience are a major advantage for both research and clinical settings (Yu et al, 2011). The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale is expressed as a T-score, with a population mean of 50 and SD of 10. Possible T scores in this distribution range from 31.7 to 76.1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is a single-item measure of patient-reported improvement that is widely used as a general outcome measure in studies of chronic pain patients, including OA patients (Salaff et al, 2004). It is often used as an index of treatment-associated change, and patient-reported improvements in the form of PGIC scores correlate robustly with significant improvement in pain intensity, pain interference with activities of daily living, mood, and quality of life (Perrot and Lanteri-Minet, 2019).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Staircase-evoked pain assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This procedure consists of stepping fully up and down onto an 8in (20.32cm) high platform with both feet a total of 24 times. The lead leg is alternated between each up/down cycle. Subjects are instructed to use their normal gait for completing this task and are encouraged to complete the task despite increasing pain, without stopping if possible. The procedure is timed, and current knee pain intensity on a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is assessed immediately before and following the procedure while the subject is in a seated, resting position.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The actigraphy device will be worn for a week before each study visit through week 24 (weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24). Before the baseline visit, the actigraphy device will be worn for 1 week. Mean daily step counts will be used as an index of physical activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal assessment of OA pain will be assessed via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), available on the same device where patients will input their weekly other measures (e.g., WOMAC-A). The EMA protocol calls for responding to simple questions related to the patient's pain at several randomly selected times during the day. The EMA protocol will be activated during one of the two study blocks (in randomized fashion), and patients will be asked to complete the EMA measures daily.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bedside Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bedside Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) measures of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, and temporal summation. These will be assessed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period (weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24). Four representative measures will be obtained: Mechanical hyperalgesia from 0-10 (higher is worse), heat hyperalgesia from 0-10 (higher is worse), cold hyperalgesia from 0-10 (higher is worse), and temporal summation from 0-10 (higher is worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Serum levels of cytokines and chemokines</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>These will be assessed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period (weeks 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24).Serum levels are measured in Picograms per millilitre (pg/mL). Serum analysis will include cytokines and chemokines as a part of establishing biomarker for treatment of OA pain with CNTX-6970.</description>

&#xD;
          6. Radiography of both knees with a posterior-anterior, fixed-flexion view taken during&#xD;
             the Screening visit. The Index knee must show evidence of chronic OA with a K-L&#xD;
             Grading Scale of 2 or 3. Such evidence will be provided by a central reading of the&#xD;
             radiography of both knees from an expert radiologist of the CCC of EPPIC-Net.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Moderate to severe pain in the Index knee associated with OA and stable for a minimum&#xD;

                    -  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including topical), opioids,&#xD;
                       duloxetine, other systemic therapy, IA corticosteroids, IA viscosupplements&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  physical therapy or bracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A mid-to-high level summed pain score (0-50) for the Index knee on the WOMAC-A pain&#xD;
             subscale, which will be completed by the subject every 3 days (+/-1 day window) during&#xD;
             the 14-day Screening period (5 times - screening days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12). An independent&#xD;
             interview by an MGH CTNI rater must confirm that the WOMAC-A pain subscale score meets&#xD;
             this criterion.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Females not of childbearing potential - defined as post-menopausal for at least 1&#xD;
             year, or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
             hysterectomy) - or practicing at least one of the following medically acceptable&#xD;
             methods of birth control throughout the study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hormonal methods such as oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal&#xD;
                  contraceptives for a minimum of 1 full cycle (based on the subject's usual&#xD;
                  menstrual cycle period) before study drug administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Total abstinence from sexual intercourse since the last menses before study drug&#xD;
                  administration;&#xD;

                  cream).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Male subjects capable of fathering a child must be willing to use barrier methods to&#xD;
             avoid a pregnancy during the study. Male condoms with or without a spermicide coating&#xD;
             are acceptable, as some women are allergic to spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Willing and able to understand the study requirements, abide by the study&#xD;
             restrictions, complete the study procedures, independently record responses on the&#xD;

             independently communicate meaningfully with study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Willing to refrain from illicit drug use during the study, and to have illicit drug&#xD;
             testing at screening and at later time points, if illicit drug use is suspected during&#xD;
             the study. Illicit drug use is defined as the use of any medication or substance that&#xD;
             is outside the prescribed use of a medical professional, including medications that&#xD;
             are prescribed but are not being used as prescribed. Cannabinoid use is exclusionary&#xD;
             for this trial, regardless of reason for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects must stop taking any current analgesic medications at the time of initial&#xD;
             Screening and agree to take only the allowed rescue medication for OA knee pain&#xD;
             (acetaminophen; 325mg x 2 tablets PO, QID, PRN) from the time of screening through&#xD;
             study completion, and agree to use no topical medications for OA knee pain during the&#xD;
             trial. Subjects must also stop taking any medication known to impact pain, even if&#xD;
             taken for other indications, e.g. duloxetine for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Complete the SAFER (State, Assessibility, Face and Ecological Validity and the Rule of&#xD;
             the 3 Ps [persistent, pervasive, pathological]) interview and receive a passing score&#xD;
             which will be administered by a remote telephone rater to confirm pain history with&#xD;
             knee OA, eligibility per study pain intensity requirements, screening EMA score, and&#xD;
             medication history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any form of joint replacement surgery of the index knee at any time, or open surgery&#xD;
             of the index knee/knee joint in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The EPPIC-Net DCC's NYU Center for Biospecimen Research and Development (CBRD) will store and manage biological samples (biosamples) collected in this clinical trial. The samples will be used for the present study and also for potential future research as permitted by the study-specific informed consent form. Biosamples stored for this study may include, but are not limited to: whole blood, plasma, stool, synovial fluid, and/or derivatives of these specimens. The samples will be stored only for the period defined in the informed consent form, which may be indefinite. Biospecimens may be shared in accordance with the protocol-defined data and sample sharing plan and the informed consent form.&#xD;
Biosamples will be documented in LabVantage, a secure network linking biospecimens to corresponding clinical and pathological data. LabVantage does not include any identifying personal health information (PHI). The CBRD and LabVantage meet all General Lab Protocol (GLP) and FDA guidelines.</ipd_description>
