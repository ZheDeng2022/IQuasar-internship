      To determine whether a heterologous vaccination regimen in individuals with no known previous&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 disease caused by the SARS-COV 2 virus has caused a pandemic with more than 180&#xD;
      million cases worldwide and more than 4 million deaths. In Argentina, this pandemic has had a&#xD;
      significant impact, with about 4.5 million cases and about 95,000 deaths. In no more than&#xD;
      nine months, medical science developed different vaccines to prevent new cases and mitigate&#xD;
      this pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the presentation of this research protocol, there are four vaccines for the&#xD;
      prevention of COVID-19 approved for emergency use by the National Administration of&#xD;
      Medicines, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT). Argentina recently received a donation of 3.2&#xD;
      million doses of Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine from the US government. This vaccine was&#xD;
      approved for emergency use in the context of the pandemic. All require the administration of&#xD;
      two doses with an administration interval of at least 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these vaccines were designed to be used with a homologous two-dose regimen. However, for&#xD;
      both logistical and biomedical reasons, the need to use vaccines in heterologous regimens&#xD;
      (one dose of one vaccine and a second dose of another vaccine) is emerging worldwide. The&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of this type of regimen has not yet been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Argentina, there are a large number of people who currently have one dose of Gam-COVID-Vac&#xD;
      vaccine and who - even after a period of ≥21 days - have not received the second component.&#xD;
      At the same time, the provision of the second component of the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine is&#xD;
      delayed due to production and distribution logistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of 08/02/2021, among the universe of people vaccinated with Gam-COVID, residents of CABA,&#xD;
      vaccinated in establishments in the City of Buenos Aires - and excluding deceased and&#xD;
      infected people - there were a total of 332,291 people with one dose and ≥22 days since the&#xD;
      first dose was administered. In a context of high viral circulation, it is desirable to try&#xD;
      to vaccinate as much of the population as possible with a full schedule in the shortest&#xD;
      possible time. In addition, new variants of SARS-COV2 virus possessing the E384K genomic&#xD;
      variant such as the gamma strain (formerly Manaus), the beta strain (known as South African)&#xD;
      and the Delta strain (also known as Indian) have the ability to evade the immune system and&#xD;
      therefore most laboratories that have developed vaccines recognise that the efficacy of the&#xD;
      vaccines requires two doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to determine whether administration of a heterologous regimen&#xD;
      combining a first dose of Gam-COVID-Vac the repetition of the first component of the&#xD;
      Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine (rAd26) or the administration of an RNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) resulted in&#xD;
      a non inferiority result that the classic and recomended protocol based on two dosis of&#xD;
      Gam-COVID-Vac (rAd26-rAd5) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol is therefore oriented to respond to a practical management need and to&#xD;
      guarantee the best possible protection to the population through two doses, which is what is&#xD;
      considered worldwide as &quot;complete vaccination&quot; according to WHO for the vaccines used by&#xD;
      Argentina. The proposed protocol is a pragmatic and public health oriented clinical trial,&#xD;
      whose primary objective is to establish whether there are indicators that allow the&#xD;
      implementation of a heterologous vaccination scheme. For this, a surrogate endpoint will be&#xD;
      used, which is immunogenicity measured by the presence of antibodies against protein S. In&#xD;
      addition, the safety of the combination will be evaluated in terms of monitoring&#xD;
      self-reported and non-self-reported clinical events by patients.&#xD;

The assessment of the antibody concentration in each of the study arms will be measured by measuring the IgG antibody concentration using ELISA expressed in IU/ml. Additionally, geometric mean concentration ratio will be measured comparing the ratio between Sputnik vaccination and that obtained in each study arm.</description>
