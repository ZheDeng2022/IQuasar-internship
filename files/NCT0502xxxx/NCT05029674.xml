  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reliably achieving peak performance requires balancing the strain of the prior day with&#xD;
      sufficient recovery to be ready for the next day. Surgery has a long standing tradition long&#xD;
      hours of hard work often at the expense of adequate sleep. Decreased sleep and recovery has&#xD;
      physiologic consequences which can be measured using biometric data. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to quantify surgeon performance and biometric data to understand how modifiable behaviors&#xD;
      can maximize recovery and performance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to wear a biometric sensor for six months. The biometric sensor,&#xD;
      namely, 'The Whoop strap' collects heart rate and heart rate variability data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data gathered will be in the form of surveys and comments from subjects on wellness,&#xD;
      burnout, modifiable activities including sleep, nutrition, exercise and mindfulness, and&#xD;
      surgical performance as well as video and audio recordings during a simulated surgical task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys will be individually numbered and a master list of subject number and video, audio,&#xD;
      and sensor ID will be kept in a separate location. This practice will enable us to better&#xD;
      understand survey feedback by reviewing relevant videos, images, and sensor recordings.&#xD;
      Images and data associated with a subject will be labeled with the subject number only.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Strain</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Strain scores are calculated using the WHOOP algorithm which uses heart rate, activity, and duration of activity. The Clinical Strain will refer to the Strain calculated by the WHOOP strap that occurs during clinical activities including overnight call and operative cases.</description>
