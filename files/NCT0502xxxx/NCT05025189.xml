  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the ability of daily consumption of one dose (2 servings) of&#xD;
      freeze-dried whole table grape powder, made from conventionally grown grapes to alter the&#xD;
      composition of the bacteria that live in the intestines in healthy subjects. The grape powder&#xD;
      contains 46g of individually quick frozen (IQF) grapes, which is equivalent to 252g fresh&#xD;
      fruit. 20 subjects will will consume the beige diet for 4 weeks followed by one dose (two&#xD;
      servings) of standardized Freeze-Dried Whole Table Grape Powder (46g) daily for 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this pilot study is to determine changes in the gut microbiome. Stool&#xD;
      samples will be collected at 4 and 8 weeks for bacterial DNA to determine changes in the&#xD;
      bacteria that live in the intestines. You will be asked to avoid foods rich in polyphenols&#xD;
      including dark chocolate and cocoa products, dried herbs, berries, coffee, tea, flaxseeds,&#xD;
      nuts (chestnut, hazelnut), olive and artichoke for the duration of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiome has been linked to the development of&#xD;
      chronic diseases including obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and heart disease.&#xD;
      Grapes provide a rich source of polyphenols and fiber. It has been demonstrated in animal&#xD;
      studies that fruits with high polyphenol content and fiber exhibit prebiotic effects leading&#xD;
      to changes in the gut microbiome, decrease in symptoms of metabolic syndrome, improvement in&#xD;
      insulin resistance and decrease in intestinal and systemic inflammation. Several human&#xD;
      intervention studies have also been performed that demonstrated beneficial effects of high&#xD;
      polyphenol fruits on the intestinal microbiome. No information is available about the effect&#xD;
      of grape consumption on the gut microbiome. This proposed pilot study will assess the ability&#xD;
      of consumption of two servings of grapes daily to alter the gut microbiome composition,&#xD;
      leading to increased bile secretion, increased fecal cholesterol degradation/excretion,&#xD;
      decreased plasma cholesterol and improved intestinal wellbeing in a free-living population.&#xD;
      20 subjects will consume the beige diet for 4 weeks followed by one dose (two servings) of&#xD;
      standardized Freeze-Dried Whole Table Grape Powder (46g) daily for 4 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this pilot study is to determine changes in the gut microbiome. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be fecal bile and cholesterol and their metabolites, plasma cholesterol and&#xD;
      intestinal wellbeing questionnaire at 4 and 8 weeks Stool samples will be collected at 4 and&#xD;
      8 weeks for sequencing of bacterial DNA to determine changes in the microbiota. Changes in&#xD;
      fecal bile, cholesterol, and cholesterol metabolites will be analyzed by gas chromatography.&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed pilot study is to determine whether intake of 2 servings of&#xD;
      grapes per day will alter the intestinal microflora leading to an increase in intestinal&#xD;
      cholesterol degradation, decreased plasma cholesterol and increased intestinal wellbeing.&#xD;
      This project will provide novel preliminary data for future research studies and to develop&#xD;
      new consumer messages on the gut health benefits of grapes. New consumer information about&#xD;
      the health benefit of grapes will enhance the The California Table Grape industry domestic&#xD;
      and export marketing programs and increase consumption of grapes.&#xD;

          -  Is unable or unwilling to comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Using prebiotics, probiotics, yogurt, and/or any fiber supplements regularly&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy or sensitivity to grapes. Subjects will be excluded if there is a prior&#xD;
             history of such sensitivity. Since these foods are commonly eaten and allergies are&#xD;
             rare, subjects should be aware of this sensitivity prior to entering the study. To&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Allergy or sensitivity to grapes. Subjects will be excluded if there is a prior&#xD;
             history of such sensitivity. Since these foods are commonly eaten and allergies are&#xD;
             rare, subjects should be aware of this sensitivity prior to entering the study. To&#xD;
             determine this, a positive history of grape ingestion without incident will be&#xD;
             requested. In addition, any subject with a history of allergy or anaphylaxis of any&#xD;
             kind will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known allergy to food coloring dyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the study investigator, any subject who demonstrate a risk of&#xD;
             non-compliance with study procedure, or one who cannot read, understand or complete&#xD;
             study - related materials.&#xD;
