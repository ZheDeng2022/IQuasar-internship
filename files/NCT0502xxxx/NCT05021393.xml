  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the impact of clinical pharmacist intervention as a part of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team to improve clinical outcomes of cancer patients with pain in&#xD;
      comparison to standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the intervention group, medication review, patient education, counseling, and&#xD;
      recommendation will be performed by clinical pharmacists for all randomized patients. Patient&#xD;
      education and counseling include giving education regarding drugs used in pain management,&#xD;
      their adverse drug reactions. Medication review includes assessing the appropriateness of&#xD;
      each of the regular medications based on laboratory findings, medication lists, consultation&#xD;
      and discharge notes, procedures, and test results. Face-to-face interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with patients prior to the follow-up. Clinical pharmacists will assess drug use history used&#xD;
      for pain management, identify drug-related problems, identify ADRs and provide drug therapy&#xD;
      interventions through written pharmacist notes to physicians during the follow-up, based on&#xD;
      the medication chart review and the above pharmaceutical assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the follow-up, the clinical pharmacist will educate on drug-related problems identified&#xD;
      before the visit, reinforce physician's instruction, and encourage drug compliance using&#xD;
      written patient educational leaflets. Telephone follow follow-up will be conducted 4 weeks&#xD;
      after the visit. Patients randomized to the control group will attend the medical follow-up&#xD;
      as usual and receive usual care. All patients will be followed up for 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention visits. Data collection will be conducted at baseline and 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      pharmacist visit. The primary outcome of the study is pain intensity which will be measured&#xD;
      at baseline (prior to physician visit), and at 4 weeks post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be encouraged to keep in touch with the clinical pharmacist through various&#xD;
      communication tools (including short messages, mobile phone contact, or Viber or WhatsApp).&#xD;
      They will be also encouraged to request a consultation for any pain control issue at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the cancer hospitals of&#xD;
      Nepal.&#xD;

    <description>The mean severity score, the pain interference mean score were measured with Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-short form). BPI is one of the most widely used measurement tools for assessing clinical pain. It contains two domains that measure pain intensity (severity) and the impact of pain on functioning (interference). In the current study, BPI was used to evaluate the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily function in the previous 24 h. The responses were given using an eleven-point numeric rating scale (NRS) scored 0-10, where 0 = best outcome/does not interfere/no pain/complete pain relief and 10 = worst outcome/completely interferes/most pain/no pain relief.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for questions 1 to 28 a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;), 2 (&quot;A little&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 3. For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, the raw score has to be calculated with mean values. An afterward linear transformation is performed to be comparable. More points are considered to have a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (revised version)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS-r) is designed to assess 10 common symptoms: pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety, well-being, and constipation.&#xD;
The patient circles the most appropriate number to indicate where the symptom is between &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot;. &quot;0&quot; is the minimum value, which means there is no change and it is a better outcome for the patient. &quot;10&quot; is the maximum value, which means that the symptom level is the highest, which is a worse outcome for the patient.</description>
