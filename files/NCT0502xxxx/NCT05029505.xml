    <textblock>
      Recurrent patellofemoral instability is a multifactorial pathology based on limb alignment,&#xD;
      soft tissue constraints as well as patella and trochlear groove abnormal anatomy. For a&#xD;
      correct and effective surgical approach, an accurate radiological evaluation is essential,&#xD;
      which consists of the evaluation of three main factors of instability: trochlear dysplasia,&#xD;
      abnormal height of the patella and pathological distance of the anterior tibial apophysis and&#xD;
      trochlear throat (TA-GT). Concerning patellar height, one of the most used methods is the&#xD;
      calculation of the Caton-Deschamps radiographic index. However, to date there is no study&#xD;
      that certifies its reproducibility and reliability from a pre-operative assessment and&#xD;
      planning perspective.&#xD;

      The patellofemoral joint (PFJ) consists of two bony components, the patella and the femoral&#xD;
      trochlea, sharing the same joint surface (1). It may be prone to instability, that is when&#xD;
      the patella dislocates, usually on the lateral side of the knee. The incidence of primary&#xD;
      patellar dislocation has been reported to be 5.8 cases per 100,000 in the general population,&#xD;
      with the highest incidence occurring in the 2nd decade of life (29 per 100,000) (2). Patellar&#xD;
      instability can be classified as traumatic, when the dislocation is caused by an external&#xD;
      force, or nontraumatic, when native anatomy of the knee predisposes to instability.&#xD;
      Non-operative treatment is usually taken into account for first episode of lateral patellar&#xD;
      dislocation, unless the presence of loose bodies is verified, and consists of knee&#xD;
      immobilization, physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      administration (3). Recurrence rate after conservative management can be up to 15-44% and&#xD;
      patients with a clinical history of two or more dislocations have a 50% chance of recurrent&#xD;
      dislocation episodes (4). Recurrent instability is a multifactorial problem that rely on limb&#xD;
      alignment, bone anatomy of the patella and the trochlear groove, soft-tissue constraints,&#xD;
      especially the medial patello-femoral ligament (MPFL). The management of recurrent patellar&#xD;
      instability is difficult for many reasons, including heterogeneous patient population,&#xD;
      skeletal maturity, challenging surgical approach and lack of long-term and robust clinical&#xD;
      outcome studies (5,6). Radiologic evaluation should study the three principal factors of&#xD;
      instability: trochlear dysplasia, abnormal patellar height, pathological tibial&#xD;
      tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance (7). Patellar height can be easily assessed,&#xD;
      through standard lateral view radiographs. Several indexes for studying and calculating&#xD;
      patellar height have been described in the literature (8-10). In patellar instability, the&#xD;
      use of Caton-Deschamps index CDI to measure patellar height one of the most employed.&#xD;
      Specifically, CDI relies upon the length of the articular surface of the patella and its&#xD;
      distance from the tibia. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the reliability and&#xD;
      reproducibility of CDI in measuring patellar height for planning patella stabilization&#xD;
      surgery. The secondary target is to hypothesize a quantitative method of preoperative&#xD;
      planning for anterior tibial apophysis transposition surgery, by calculating CDI.&#xD;
