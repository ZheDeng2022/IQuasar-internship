  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in pediatric,&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors (hereafter referred to as AYA-CS). Exercise&#xD;
      is a cornerstone of CVD prevention and treatment; yet, exercise has not been adopted as a&#xD;
      standard of care in AYA-CS at high CVD risk. The HIMALAYAS trial is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program on cardiovascular (CV) and&#xD;
      psychosocial health, as well as CVD risk, in AYA-CS with mild heart dysfunction (stage B&#xD;
      heart failure (SBHF)). The primary objective of the HIMALAYAS study is to determine whether&#xD;
      supervised Cardio-oncology Rehabilitation [CORE; Group 1A], consisting of moderate to&#xD;
      high-intensity aerobic exercise training, CVD risk factor modification and enhanced online&#xD;
      behavioural support, improves cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak; primary outcome), cardiac&#xD;
      function, CVD risk factors and biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 6, 12, and&#xD;
      24 months compared to standard of care [CON1; Group 1B] in AYA-CS with SBHF. Additionally,&#xD;
      AYA-CS with and without SBHF will participate in a secondary randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) to assess the independent effects of two passive behavioural support strategies based&#xD;
      on the attainment of the personal activity intelligence (PAI) score [PAI; Group 2A] or the&#xD;
      exercise guidelines for cancer survivors [ExGL; Group 2B] on cardiorespiratory fitness,&#xD;
      cardiac function, CVD risk factors and biomarkers, and PROs at 24 months compared to standard&#xD;
      of care [CON2; Group 2C].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 90,000 North Americans are diagnosed with cancer before the age of 40. Improved cancer&#xD;
      therapies have led to an exponential growth in the number of pediatric, adolescent, and young&#xD;
      adult cancer survivors (AYA-CS) who are expected to live 50-60 years beyond diagnosis.&#xD;
      However, AYA-CS are at increased risk of developing multiple cancer- and treatment-related&#xD;
      morbidities including poor fitness (e.g., low VO2peak), hypertension (HTN), diabetes, and&#xD;
      poor mental health, which all contribute to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). The&#xD;
      prevalence of CVD events (e.g. heart failure, heart attack, stroke) is up to 23.8% in adult&#xD;
      survivors of pediatric cancers with long term follow-up after treatment. The incidence of&#xD;
      subclinical CVD, which is a precursor to CVD events, is even higher in AYA-CS; up to 40%,&#xD;
      11%, and 5% experience subclinical cardiomyopathy measured by abnormal global longitudinal&#xD;
      strain (GLS), diastolic dysfunction (DD) or mild reduction in left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction (LVEF), respectively, and 18% experience reduced aerobic fitness. The treatment of&#xD;
      modifiable CVD risk factors must be considered a fundamental target for improving CVD&#xD;
      health-related outcomes in AYA-CS. To this end, exercise and best-practices for CVD risk&#xD;
      factor modification are integral to a cardiac rehabilitation model. Traditional cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation models for patients with CVD (consisting of exercise, CVD risk factor&#xD;
      treatment, and patient education) are safe and effective in improving HRQoL, morbidity, and&#xD;
      mortality risk. However, by virtue of their age and low short-term CVD risk, AYA-CS do not&#xD;
      meet traditional criteria for initiating cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and are less likely to&#xD;
      receive treatments to reduce CVD risk. AYA-CS with stage B heart failure (SBHF): (1) are at&#xD;
      high risk for subsequent HF/CVD death; (2) have lower cardiopulmonary fitness; and (3) are&#xD;
      more likely to benefit from CVD risk factor management. Considering that AYA-CS have an&#xD;
      estimated 33% prevalence of SBHF, this vulnerable cohort of cancer survivors represent an&#xD;
      opportunity for intervention that is highly feasible and potentially impactful. Exercise is a&#xD;
      preferred method for optimizing health and survival in PAYA-CS. However, we need models that&#xD;
      safely and effectively deliver exercise interventions that meet the unique needs of this&#xD;
      population. The cardio-oncology rehabilitation (CORE) model is an intervention that would&#xD;
      provide AYA-CS with SBHF a supervised and home-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT)&#xD;
      and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) exercise therapy, CVD risk factor&#xD;
      modification, and behavioural support to reduce the risk of CVD. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      HIMALAYAS study is to determine whether supervised CORE (Group 1A) improves cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness (VO2peak; primary outcome), cardiac function, CVD risk factors and biomarkers, and&#xD;
      PROs at 6 months (primary timepoint) as well as 12 and 24 months compared to standard of care&#xD;
      group (CON1; Group 1B) in AYA-CS with SBHF. The secondary objective of the study is to assess&#xD;
      the independent effects of two passive behavioural support strategies based on the attainment&#xD;
      of a weekly PAI score ≥100 [PAI; Group 2A] or the exercise guidelines for cancer survivors&#xD;
      (i.e. 90 to 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week; [ExGL; Group 2B]) on VO2peak,&#xD;
      cardiac function, CVD risk factors and biomarkers, and PROs at 24 months compared to standard&#xD;
      of care [CON2; Group 2C] in AYA-CS with and without SBHF. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CORE&#xD;
      intervention will involve a facility-based HIIT session and home-based HIIT session&#xD;
      (described as &quot;HIIT at Home&quot;) per week. The study will include a pre-trial pilot and a&#xD;
      substudy within the Primary RCT to develop and validate &quot;HIIT at Home&quot; methods.&#xD;

This is to limit bias associated with participants' awareness of their group allocation.

    <description>Participants in the CORE group will have (1) 2 HIIT sessions (1 facility- and 1 home-based) and 1 home-based MICT session, (2) CV risk factor management, and (3) behavioural support for the first 6 months. The behavioural support will continue for CORE participants from months 7-24. Behavioural support includes professionally guided and peer-enhanced exercise behavioural support based on behaviour change stage theories. CORE participants will be provided a wrist-worn heart and physical activity monitor to use throughout the 24-month observation period. After the supervised 6 month exercise period, participants will be asked to maintain a PAI Score of ≥100 for the remainder of the study period via the PAI Health App.</description>
