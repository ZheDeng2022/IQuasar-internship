  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized anxiety disorder affects about 6.8 million adults in the United States, therefore&#xD;
      its treatment is of major public health interest. Cannabidiol (CBD) has shown promise as an&#xD;
      effective treatment for anxiety-related symptoms while lacking the severity of adverse&#xD;
      effects seen with other medications. Given the wide availability of products containing CBD&#xD;
      on the market today, from tinctures to coffee additives, and the undetermined potential for&#xD;
      drug-to-drug interactions, medical supervision of CBD intake and formulation-specific&#xD;
      clinical research is necessary. Therefore this study aimed to observe the effects of a&#xD;
      specific hemp-derived full spectrum CBD formula on anxiety-related symptoms in a group of&#xD;
      volunteers. The investigators will examine the self-reported anxiety symptoms in relation to&#xD;
      use of a specific CBD formulation (25mg solvent-free full spectrum CBD capsules) in a cohort&#xD;
      of adults diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. This open-label, cohort study will be&#xD;
      conducted at six clinic sites in the United States (including Puerto Rico) from June 2020&#xD;
      through October 2020. The six physicians recruited to participate in the study were each&#xD;
      actively prescribing CBD in their practices and were actively caring for patients with&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms. Anxiety levels will be measured in enrolled participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder each week for a period of eight weeks using the Generalized&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD7). Participants will also be instructed to take a daily&#xD;
      25mg capsule of CBD. The investigators hypothesize that this formula, when carefully&#xD;
      developed and administered by a healthcare professional, will significantly reduce anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Measured at 8 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD7) score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions.&#xD;
The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 21, with scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.</description>
