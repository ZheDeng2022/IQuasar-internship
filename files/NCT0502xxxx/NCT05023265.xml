  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm phase II study of stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) for patients with medically inoperable primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignancy in Canada. The current standard of&#xD;
      care for fit patients with localized RCC is surgical resection of the kidney (nephrectomy).&#xD;
      RCC, however, affects predominately an older population with a median age at diagnosis of 65&#xD;
      years. Surgery is often not an option for these patients due to existing co-morbidities, and&#xD;
      in an increasing environment of shared decision making in healthcare, some patients decline&#xD;
      surgical resection and seek less invasive alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a treatment approach that offers precise delivery of&#xD;
      highly conformal radiotherapy to the tumour with minimal exposure to the surrounding normal&#xD;
      tissues. SBRT is non-invasive and not limited by the size or location of kidney tumors like&#xD;
      other ablative strategies. The worldwide experience of treating RCC with SBRT is growing and&#xD;
      the results to date are promising. There is broader enthusiasm from both the radiation&#xD;
      oncology and urology community to increase utilization of SBRT for RCC in non-surgical&#xD;
      patients within the context of a well-designed prospective trial in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will prospectively assess the efficacy, toxicity and impact on quality of life (QoL) of&#xD;
      SBRT in the treatment of inoperable RCC.&#xD;
