  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phoenix Trial is a randomized double blind placebo controlled Phase III trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of AMX0035 for treatment of ALS&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMX0035 is a combination therapy designed to reduce neuronal death through blockade of key&#xD;
      cellular death pathways originating in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This&#xD;
      clinical trial is designed to demonstrate that treatment is safe, tolerable, and able to slow&#xD;
      decline in function as measured by the ALSFRS-R and survival over 48 week. The trial will&#xD;
      also assess the effects of AMX0035 on slow vital capacity, quality of life and plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers of ALS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in slope of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) over treatment duration. The ALSFRS-R consists of 12 items across 4 subdomains of function (bulbar, fine motor, gross motor, and breathing) with each item scored on a scale from 0 (total loss of function) to 4 (no loss of function). Total scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>
