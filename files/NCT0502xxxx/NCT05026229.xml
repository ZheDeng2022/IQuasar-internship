    <textblock>
      This project is a key clinical research project approved by the Clinical Research Center of&#xD;
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)&#xD;
      combined with intensive chemotherapy has markedly improved the outcomes of&#xD;
      philadelpha-positive lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). However, a considerable proportion of&#xD;
      patients failed to complete the intended chemotherapy and some even died early. The optimal&#xD;
      balance between the intensity of chemotherapy and safety should be explored. In this study,&#xD;
      Ph+ ALL patients who achieve complete remission (CR) after VP regimen (vincristine and&#xD;
      prednisone) plus dasatinib as induction are enrolled and then the participants will receive&#xD;
      different consolidation chemotherapy. Patients in the group A will continue to use VP regimen&#xD;
      plus dasatinib, while the group B receives hyper-CVAD/methotrexate-cytarabine regimen plus&#xD;
      dasatinib. The measurable residual disease (MRD), CR, adverse effects (AE), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) will be observed to determine the proper consolidation&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 25% of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are associated with t (9;&#xD;
      22), positive philadelphia chromosome (Ph+ ALL), in whom BCR/ABL fusion gene can be detected&#xD;
      in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) plus&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy has markedly improved the outcomes of Ph+ ALL. However, it's reported&#xD;
      that 74% pf patients failed to complete the intended chemotherapy, and early death occured in&#xD;
      a considerable proportion of patients during induction. The optimal balance between the&#xD;
      intensity of chemotherapy and safety need to be explored. In this study, Ph+ ALL patients are&#xD;
      enrolled. The participants will receive dasatinib and induction chemotherapy using VP regimen&#xD;
      (vincristine and prednisone) to achieve complete remission (CR). Then the participants will&#xD;
      be randomly divided into two groups. The subjects inthe group A will continue to use VP&#xD;
      regimen plus dasatinib as consolidation, while the patients in the group B receive&#xD;
      hyper-CVAD/methotrexate-cytarabine regimen plus dasatinib. The measurable residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD), CR, adverse effects (AE), overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) will&#xD;
      be observed to determine the proper consolidation chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
