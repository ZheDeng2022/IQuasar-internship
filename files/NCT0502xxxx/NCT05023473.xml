      The pericapsular nerve group block (PENG) is a regional anaesthetic technique that was&#xD;
      developed in 2018, primarily for total hip arthroplasties (THA) as a postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      modality with motor sparing benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;

      anaesthetic within the myofascial plane of the psoas muscle and superior pubic ramus.&#xD;

      block on pain control in patients with proximal femur fracture in the emergency department.&#xD;

      The pericapsular nerve group block (PENG) is a regional anaesthetic technique that was&#xD;
      developed in 2018, primarily for total hip arthroplasties (THA) as a postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      modality with motor sparing benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block is thought to provide more complete analgesia to the hip by depositing local&#xD;
      anaesthetic within the myofascial plane of the psoas muscle and superior pubic ramus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indications for THA often include degenerative hip disease and traumatic hip fractures.&#xD;
      These indications for surgery are relatively common in the elderly population and are&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative intervention, such as THA, has also been associated with significant pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, the most commonly performed peripheral nerve blocks include a lumbar plexus&#xD;
      block, a femoral nerve block, or a fascia iliaca compartment block to manage post-operative&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the understanding that additional articular branches (i.e., from the sciatic nerve)&#xD;
      these blocks will provide incomplete analgesia to the hip and may also predispose the patient&#xD;
      to fall due to weakness of the quadriceps muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the ideal block technique should provide complete analgesia of the hip joint and&#xD;
      without muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PENG has been described for postoperative pain control for surgery at the hip joint or&#xD;
      the management of post-traumatic pain associated with fractures of the proximal femur/&#xD;
      femoral head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no unique contraindications that are specific to the PENG block.&#xD;
      Therefore, similar guidelines applicable to most peripheral nerve blocks would apply and&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of patient consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin infection at the site of injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic bacteremia or sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticoagulation and antithrombotic medications precautions as detailed by the American&#xD;
           society of regional anaesthesia for peripheral nerve blocks The hip joint has a complex&#xD;
           innervation, and the pain following hip fractures or total hip arthroplasties is&#xD;
           particularly severe. An appropriate plan for perioperative analgesia is challenging, but&#xD;
           a multimodal approach including acetaminophen, cox-2 selective NSAIDs, regional&#xD;
           anaesthesia, and periarticular infiltration techniques improves patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound-guided PENG block allows for coverage of the hip joint, targeting the proximal&#xD;
      articular branches that innervate the joint capsule. This proximal approach via ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance can confer several advantages over a femoral nerve block by providing more complete&#xD;
      analgesia to the hip joint. Additionally, the motor function of the involved extremity should&#xD;
      be spared. The PENG block can be used alone as a primary analgesic or in conjunction with&#xD;
      other forms of anaesthesia during surgery or in the perioperative period. For lateral&#xD;
      surgical incisions, a supplemental lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block provides additional&#xD;
      coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the patient in the supine position, the ultrasound probe is placed on a transverse plane&#xD;
      over the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). Once the ASIS is identified, the transducer is&#xD;
      aligned with the pubic ramus and rotated at approximately 45 degrees, parallel to the&#xD;
      inguinal crease. The transducer is then slid medially along this axis until the anterior&#xD;
      inferior iliac spine (AIIS), iliopubic eminence (IPE), and the psoas tendon is identified,&#xD;
      serving as anatomic landmarks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sliding the probe distally or gently tilting the caudal will expose the head of the femur.&#xD;
      Returning to the initial starting position, a standard 20-22 gauge 100mm needle is inserted&#xD;
      in-plane, from lateral to medial, in the plane between the psoas tendon and the pubic ramus.&#xD;
      15-20ml of a long-lasting local anaesthetic ((i.e., 0.5% ropivacaine) is then deposited in&#xD;
      this plane, lifting the psoas tendon. Care should be taken to avoid puncturing the psoas&#xD;
      tendon. In this study, the investigators will assess the effect of pericapsular nerve group&#xD;
      (PENG) block on pain control in patients with proximal femur fracture in the emergency&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control group will receive morphine as regular patient control analgesia (PCA) The&#xD;
      interventional group will receive PENG block before being attached to regular morphine PCA&#xD;
