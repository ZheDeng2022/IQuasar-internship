    <textblock>
      This qualitative study aims to explore lived experiences of older adults living with HIV in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. Twenty older Chinese adults of age 50 or above will be recruited from an HIV&#xD;
      specialist clinic providing HIV care in the public service. Qualitative, semi-structured&#xD;
      interview will be conducted to explore risk factors contributing to life stress and&#xD;
      adversity, and protective factors associated with resilience. The qualitative data will be&#xD;
      delineated to propose a typology of older adults living with HIV as characterized by their&#xD;
      unmet needs, barriers and facilitators of resilience-building.&#xD;

      Objectives: The intersection of HIV and ageing has important implications for health and&#xD;
      psychosocial wellbeing, which are complex in nature. In a setting with growing number of&#xD;
      older adults living with HIV in Hong Kong, as in many other regions in the world, addressing&#xD;
      their unmet healthcare needs is paramount. Failure to understand and recognise their needs&#xD;
      will impede healthy ageing. This study aims to explore lived experiences of older adults&#xD;
      living with HIV in regards their complex needs and resilience-building, with the specific&#xD;
      objectives of examining associated factors of resilience development at individual-social-&#xD;
      and structural level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A qualitative study targeting 20 older Chinese adults of age 50 or above who are&#xD;
      living with HIV who are divided under the following groups: Group A: Chinese men who have sex&#xD;
      with men and Group B: Chinese heterosexual males and females&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings: Clinic providing HIV care in the public service&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling based on their age (50-64;&#xD;
      65 and above of age), gender and sexual orientation. Qualitative, semi-structured interview&#xD;
      will be conducted to explore: (1) risk factors contributing to life stress and adversity, and&#xD;
      (2) protective factors associated with resilience. Interviews will be digitally recorded,&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim and managed using &quot;NVivo&quot; software. Themes will be developed, constantly&#xD;
      compared within and between targeted groups, using Grounded Theory approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data will be delineated to propose a typology of older adults living with HIV&#xD;
      as characterized by their (1) unmet needs, (2) barriers of resilience-building, and (3)&#xD;
      facilitators of resilience-building.&#xD;
