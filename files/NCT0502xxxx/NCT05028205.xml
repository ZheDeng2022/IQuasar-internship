    <textblock>
      Efficacious primary care-based childhood overweight/obesity interventions for children from&#xD;
      low-income homes are needed to address health disparities. The University of Tennessee (UT)&#xD;
      and Cherokee Health Systems (CHS), a federally qualified health center, has piloted a 6-month&#xD;
      childhood overweight/obesity intervention for underserved children (R34DK109504). The&#xD;
      intervention was based upon Prevention Plus, the recommended primary care-based treatment for&#xD;
      childhood overweight/obesity, which includes targeting fruit and vegetable (FV) and&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverage intake, physical activity, and screen time; incorporates behavior&#xD;
      modification techniques, and uses a family-based approach. The intervention structure was&#xD;
      designed to reduce family costs related to time, thus monthly contact alternated between&#xD;
      in-person sessions and phone calls, and in-person sessions could occur using &quot;warm hand-offs&quot;&#xD;
      between providers (allowed piggybacking of appointments). The pilot demonstrated CHS' ability&#xD;
      to implement the intervention using their electronic health record (EHR). The intervention&#xD;
      significantly reduced child standardized BMI (ZBMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the intervention reduced ZBMI, the degree of reduction was below what is recommended to&#xD;
      achieve cardiometabolic improvements in children (-0.25 ZBMI). Families (58.9% with a&#xD;
      household income of &lt; $20,000/yr, 32.9% with household food insecurity, 50.7% receiving SNAP&#xD;
      benefits, and 94.5% receiving free or reduced-price school meals) reported problems with&#xD;
      having enough food, particularly FVs, which was a barrier for intervention participation.&#xD;
      Thus, increasing the affordability of FVs may enhance the achievement of intervention dietary&#xD;
      goals, which should increase diet quality and enhance ZBMI reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One method to increase FV affordability is a prescription incentive program. In these&#xD;
      programs, a &quot;prescription,&quot; often for FVs, from a health care provider is given to the&#xD;
      participant, and the prescription includes tokens/vouchers for getting FVs at participating&#xD;
      outlets. Adult FV prescription studies have reported increases in FV intake and decreases in&#xD;
      BMI. In children, three uncontrolled studies reported that an FV prescription program&#xD;
      increased FV intake, with the influence on child weight status not reported. Thus, to enhance&#xD;
      the efficacy of our 6-month Prevention Plus intervention in addressing health disparities in&#xD;
      childhood overweight/obesity, investigators will pilot test Prevention Plus, our tested&#xD;
      intervention, with the addition of an FV prescription incentive program (Prevention&#xD;
      Plus+FVx). For Prevention Plus+FVx, to assist families in achieving FV goals (FV&#xD;
      prescription), they will receive $60/month ($1/day for each child and parent) in vouchers.&#xD;
      The vouchers can be spent on FVs at a local retail partner (Food City). Thirty families&#xD;
      receiving their primary care from CHS, with an adult caregiver and a child aged 4 to 10 years&#xD;
      with a BMI &gt; 85th percentile, will participate in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHS families eligible for the trial will be patients at the CHS Knox County Pediatric Clinic.&#xD;
      Additional eligibility criteria include families with a child who is aged 4 to 10 years, with&#xD;
      a BMI &gt; 85 percentile, who have an adult (&gt; 18 years) caregiver living in the household&#xD;
      willing to participate in the program. The adult caregiver needs to be able to read and speak&#xD;
      English; and be willing to shop for fresh fruits and vegetables at the Western Ave Food City&#xD;
      store (1950 Western Ave., Knoxville, TN, 37921).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      For recruitment, the EHR, via the client dashboard, will alert if a family is eligible when&#xD;
      the EHR is opened by any primary care provider. This alert will prompt the provider to&#xD;
      conduct a &quot;warm hand-off&quot; of the family to the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) in the&#xD;
      clinic to start the enrollment process. The BHC will discuss the study with the family and&#xD;
      will ask interested families to write their name and phone number at the bottom of an&#xD;
      eligibility form, which will indicate that the family would like to be contacted by the&#xD;
      research team. BHCs will provide families with a flyer about the program. After BHCs discuss&#xD;
      the program with families, they will complete a template in the EHR indicating the enrollment&#xD;
      status of the family. This will allow the EHR to give an appropriate alert (or not) to&#xD;
      physicians in the future about the need (or not) of the &quot;warm hand-off&quot; of the family to the&#xD;
      BHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completed eligibility forms will be sent to the lead BHC at CHS, who will securely send&#xD;
      scanned copies of the documents to Dr. Raynor's research team using Vault, UT's secure file&#xD;
      transmission service. Once scanned/sent the original copies will be destroyed/shredded by the&#xD;
      lead BHC at CHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested potential families will be contacted by the research team and phone screened for&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligible families will be invited to an orientation. These orientations will be&#xD;
      at UT or at the family's home, depending on the family's preference following health safety&#xD;
      procedures. The orientations sessions will occur one-on-one between a family and a research&#xD;
      team member. Families will be mailed/emailed the consent forms prior to the orientation. For&#xD;
      potential families who are interested, the research team will review the consent form at the&#xD;
      end of the orientation and adult caregivers will sign consent forms and children will provide&#xD;
      assent (verbal or written). Families that are engaging in the orientation online via Zoom&#xD;
      will sign the consent/assent form on Qualtrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the signing of the consent form, the complete baseline assessment will occur. This&#xD;
      will include the completion of all questionnaires and measures of anthropometrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For orientations occurring online due to health safety reasons, following the signing of the&#xD;
      consent form, questionnaires will be completed by verbally reviewing the questionnaires with&#xD;
      families and collecting responses. An appointment will be set up to collect height and weight&#xD;
      (anthropometrics) measures at the participant's home, following health safety procedures. All&#xD;
      materials and equipment needed for the measures will be packed into a container, which will&#xD;
      include a signed copy of the consent form. All equipment will be cleaned and disinfected,&#xD;
      using CDC recommendations (wearing disposable gloves, using approved cleaning and&#xD;
      disinfection of products, disposing of gloves after cleaning and disinfecting, washing hands&#xD;
      after glove removal). Containers will be delivered to families by placing the container on&#xD;
      the participant's porch with no physical contact made with families. Research staff will then&#xD;
      contact families by phone to assist families with collecting height and weight measures.&#xD;
      After completion, participants will be asked to pack all materials in the provided container.&#xD;
      The container will be placed on the porch for research staff to retrieve, and a gift card&#xD;
      will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study/Project Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline assessment, families will begin the intervention. Children will continue&#xD;
      to receive standard care at CHS. After attendance to the first intervention session (the&#xD;
      30-minute session in month 1 delivered by the BHC), families will receive a monthly&#xD;
      newsletter on general nutrition topics (such as MyPlate or the Dietary Guidelines for&#xD;
      Americans). Additionally, each family will receive a scale; a BMI-for-age growth chart; a&#xD;
      binder for intervention materials; a self-monitoring diary to record the child's monthly&#xD;
      height, weight, BMI, and BMI percentile; and picture-based diaries to monitor daily energy&#xD;
      balance behaviors. Additional family materials will be included in the EHR template for each&#xD;
      session. Family materials provided at each session will outline a process to measure growth&#xD;
      and include information about how children grow, as well as cover behavioral parenting&#xD;
      strategies to assist with changing child behavior (self-monitoring, modeling [caretakers will&#xD;
      be asked to make and monitor the same energy balance behavior changes as their child],&#xD;
      stimulus control, and positive reinforcement) for energy balance behaviors. These behavioral&#xD;
      parenting strategies are based upon Social Cognitive Theory. Sessions will be written at the&#xD;
      fifth-grade reading level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will meet in person or via telehealth appointment (depending on the current standard&#xD;
      of care at CHS, and University of Tennessee policy-- meaning that when CHS or UT has a policy&#xD;
      place that does not allow in-person contact, investigators will hold these appointments via&#xD;
      telehealth, when these policies are not in effect, the family can choose to attend the&#xD;
      appointment in-person or via telehealth) with a BHC at the CHS clinic in which they receive&#xD;
      care for 30 minutes during months 1, 3, and 5. In these sessions, child height and weight&#xD;
      will be taken, and BMI will be plotted on the BMI-for-age growth chart. Families will receive&#xD;
      feedback about growth and the weight status of their child. Additionally, the session&#xD;
      materials will be reviewed and behavioral parenting strategies will be encouraged to aid with&#xD;
      changing two dietaryy and two leisure-time activity (energy balance) behaviors of the child.&#xD;
      As is traditional in a family-based approach, the caregiver will also change the same energy&#xD;
      balance behaviors as the child, as adult caregivers can then model healthy behaviors for the&#xD;
      child, assisting the child in learning the new weight-related behaviors. Thus, both the&#xD;
      caregiver and child will be encouraged to change and self-monitor energy balance behaviors&#xD;
      with the use of the picture-based diaries. Achievement of energy balance behavior goals of&#xD;
      both the child and the caregiver will be reviewed (via the picture-based diaries) and BHCs&#xD;
      will problem-solve areas to assist families with achieving goals, suggesting the use of the&#xD;
      behavioral parenting strategies as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During months 2, 4, and 6, BHCs will complete a 20-minute phone call with the caregiver.&#xD;
      Caregivers will be asked to measure the height and weight of their child, calculate BMI and&#xD;
      plot it on the BMI-for-age growth chart prior to the call. During the call, the BHC will&#xD;
      provide feedback on the changes in child growth since the previous contact. Additionally, the&#xD;
      BHC will discuss the family's progress on achieving child and caregiver energy balance&#xD;
      behavior goals and implementation of behavioral parenting strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child's energy balance behavioral goals will be to consume &lt; 3 sugar-sweetened beverages&#xD;
      (e.g., regular carbonated soft drinks, sports drinks, lemonades, ice teas, flavored milk,&#xD;
      juice drinks &lt; 100% juice, and punches) servings /wk, ≥1 1 2 cups/day of whole vegetables and&#xD;
      ≥ 1 cup/day of whole fruit, engage in ≥ 60 minutes/day of moderate- to vigorous-intensity&#xD;
      physical activity, and reduce TV viewing to &lt; 2 hours/day. The caregiver's energy balance&#xD;
      behavioral goals will be to consume &lt; 3 sugar-sweetened beverage servings/wk, ≥ 2 1 2&#xD;
      cups/day of whole vegetables and ≥ 1 1 2 cups/day of whole fruit, engage in ≥ 150 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per week and reduce TV viewing to &lt; 10&#xD;
      hours/wk. To increase self-efficacy, the goals will be incrementally increased, with families&#xD;
      implementing the full program goals at month four. Additionally, children and caregivers will&#xD;
      be asked to achieve at least three of the five goals each day (child) or week (adult&#xD;
      caregiver). The cost will be considered in all sessions, with BHC's providing low-cost&#xD;
      options for achieving goals (purchasing canned or frozen fruits and vegetables to eat instead&#xD;
      of fresh fruits and vegetables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help children and families meet their goals-particularly their dietary goals related to&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable consumption-- families will receive a fruit and vegetable prescription&#xD;
      (FVx) in addition to the standard Prevention Plus family-based behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      treatment. The FVx will be a voucher that can be used to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables&#xD;
      at our retail grocery partner (Food City). The voucher can be used at the Western Ave Food&#xD;
      City location (1950 Western Ave., Knoxville, TN, 37921) to purchase fresh fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables. This store is the closest Food City store to the CHS clinic. Families will&#xD;
      receive the vouchers for each of the 6 monthly sessions they attend/complete, however, they&#xD;
      will not receive the voucher if they do not attend/complete a monthly session. The vouchers&#xD;
      can be used for one month and then will expire. Families will receive two text messages per&#xD;
      month about using the vouchers.&#xD;
