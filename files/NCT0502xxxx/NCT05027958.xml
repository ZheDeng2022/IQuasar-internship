      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a lung disease. It is caused by inhaling a type of airborne bacterium.&#xD;
      Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) is used to test for TB exposure. It is usually&#xD;
      injected under a person s skin. In this study, it will be applied in the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how the cells within the lung react (immune response) when exposed to PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-64 who (1) have been exposed to TB but do not have active disease or symptoms&#xD;
      or (2) have never been exposed to TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They&#xD;
      will have a TB skin test. They will also have an electrocardiogram to examine heart rhythm.&#xD;
      For this, sticky patches will be placed on their chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated at study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 FDG PET-CT scans. They will lie in a machine that creates pictures&#xD;
      of the inside of their body. They will get a radioactive substance injected into their arm&#xD;
      called 18FDG. It helps make the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 bronchoscopies. Their mouth and nasal airways will be numbed. They&#xD;
      will get drugs to relax. A tube will be inserted through their nose or mouth into a lung.&#xD;
      Fluid will be delivered into the lung and suctioned back out to collect cells. They will get&#xD;
      PPD during the first bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for about 30 days. Participants will visit the clinic up to 8 times.&#xD;
      They will go home after each procedure. No hospital stays are needed....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We propose a pilot study in which we employ directed bronchoscopic instillation of&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-derived Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) to evaluate local&#xD;
      airway immune response in adults with or without latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to understand the pulmonary immune&#xD;
      response to mycobacterial antigens by determining the longevity of antigen-specific immune&#xD;
      cells in the airways versus circulation after local bronchoscopic instillation of Tuberculin&#xD;
      Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) into the lungs of adults with or without LTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: The secondary objective is to characterize the location and longevity of&#xD;
      immune cell activity in the pulmonary parenchyma and thoracic lymph nodes with positron&#xD;
      emission tomography combined with chest computed tomography (PET-CT) after bronchoscopic&#xD;
      Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) instillation in adults with or without LTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives: (a) An exploratory objective will be to perform phenotypic and&#xD;
      functional analysis of immune cell populations in the airways vs circulation following&#xD;
      bronchoscopic instillation of Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) into the lungs of&#xD;
      individuals with or without LTBI. (b) An additional exploratory objective will be to&#xD;
      characterize the production of soluble mediators (including but not limited to: cytokines,&#xD;
      lipid mediators, and defensins) in BAL fluid vs blood within the same context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint will be the enumeration of Mtb antigen-specific CD4+&#xD;
      and CD8+ T cell populations in the airway and peripheral blood at early and late time points&#xD;
      after bronchoscopic Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: The secondary endpoint will be the quantification of&#xD;
      [18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in adjacent pulmonary parenchyma and draining thoracic&#xD;
      lymph nodes via PET-CT at early and late time points after Tuberculin Purified Protein&#xD;
      Derivative (PPD) instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints: (a) An exploratory endpoint will be the quantification of frequencies&#xD;
      of cell surface molecules, intracellular cytokines and transcription factors among immune&#xD;
      cell populations in the airways vs circulation following bronchoscopic instillation of&#xD;
      Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) into the lungs of individuals with or without&#xD;
      LTBI. (b) An exploratory endpoint will involve the identification and quantification of&#xD;
      soluble mediators in the airway and peripheral blood after Tuberculin Purified Protein&#xD;
      Derivative (PPD) instillation in the lungs within the same context.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults 18-64 years old will be recruited for the two groups (non-LTBI controls vs confirmed&#xD;
        LTBI). The lower limit of this age range is based on the need for invasive bronchoscopic&#xD;
        procedures and exposure to radiation, both of which carry more risk at younger ages. In&#xD;
        addition, most adults present with post-primary or reactivation TB that most often occurs&#xD;
        radiographically in the upper lobes of the lungs, often with cavitation. Conversely,&#xD;
        children and rare adults with primary TB have non-cavitary disease in the lower lobes. The&#xD;
        higher limit of this age range is based on the known property of immune senescence, i.e.,&#xD;
        the waning of the strength of immune responses with advancing age.&#xD;
&#xD;

        following criteria:&#xD;
