  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of heart failure are increasing and represent a large portion of&#xD;
      hospitalizations in Brazil, are also associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality and&#xD;
      costs for the service of health. Such data, added to the current scenario of the pandemic&#xD;
      caused by COVID-19, reveal the need for changes in clinical practice, so that health care is&#xD;
      more effective and cost-effective and reaches patients without exposing them to risks. Thus,&#xD;
      the application of nursing interventions through of telephone technology, which has strong&#xD;
      evidence of effectiveness found in the literature, has become an alternative for the&#xD;
      implementation of clinical interventions. Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of nursing&#xD;
      consultations performed remotely in improving quality of life and adherence to therapy of&#xD;
      patients with HF due to cardiomyopathy of different etiologies. Method: The study will have&#xD;
      as methodological framework the randomized clinical trial, with the recruitment of 60&#xD;
      volunteers with a diagnosis of chagasic HF, Hypertensive or Idiopathic, who are monitored at&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic of Clinical Unit of Cardiomyopathies and Aortic Diseases or Clinical&#xD;
      Unit of Hypertension, InCor-HCFMUSP, included by drawing lots into two groups. group A (n=30)&#xD;
      will be monitored in biweekly nursing consultations by a period of three months added to the&#xD;
      outpatient follow-up, and group B (n = 30) will follow the usual outpatient follow-up.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients HF carriers who periodically make telephone consultations of nursing&#xD;
      have better quality of life and better therapeutic adherence when compared to patients who&#xD;
      only have regular follow-up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After filtering this patient database, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be performed randomization in two groups of 30 participants, randomization will be stratified by two variables, Age and Ejection Fraction, using the Jamovi statistical software. Group A will be composed of the participants who will have intervention, that is, the patients will receive fortnightly follow-up in nursing telephone consultation concurrently with follow-up usual outpatient clinic and group B (control) will be composed of the participants who will have no intervention and will continue to monitor according to the institution's routine.</intervention_model_description>
