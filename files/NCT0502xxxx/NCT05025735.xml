  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single arm, open label pilot to test the combination of dapagliflozin, a&#xD;
      commercially available SGLT-2 inhibitor, in combination with alpelisib + fulvestrant in&#xD;
      patients with HR+/HER2- mBC. The objective of this study is to determine if the addition of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin to the combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant leads to significant reduction&#xD;
      in all-grade hyperglycemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpelisib is a p110α specific PI3K inhibitor that has shown significant clinical benefit in&#xD;
      patients with HR+/HER2 negative mBC harboring activating PIK3CA mutations. The SOLAR-1 study&#xD;
      randomized patients with MBC progressing after aromatase inhibitor therapy patients had a PFS&#xD;
      of 11 months with fulvestrant plus alpelisib versus 5.7 months with fulvestrant alone.&#xD;
      Alpelisib was associated with a 65% incidence of hyperglycemia, including 37% Grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia is an expected effect of PI3K inhibitors given the pivotal role of PI3K in&#xD;
      mediating the response to insulin in multiple tissues. Blocking insulin signaling by p110α&#xD;
      inhibitors leads to glycogen breakdown in the liver along with decreased glucose uptake in&#xD;
      peripheral tissues. The resulting hyperglycemia causes a compensatory response of increase&#xD;
      insulin secretion by the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cantley and colleagues have shown in animal models that treatment with BYL-719(alpelisib)&#xD;
      results in rapid increase in plasma glucose level and a compensatory increase in insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They went on to show that this rebound hyperinsulinemia was able to rescue KPC tumor&#xD;
      allografts from BYL-719 inhibition as evidenced by increasing phosphorylation of downstream&#xD;
      effectors in the PI3K pathway, pAKT and PS6. Pretreatment of the mice with an SGLT-2&#xD;
      inhibitor decreased the hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia following treatment with BYL-719.&#xD;
      Importantly, the response of the KPC tumor allografts to treatment was concordant with&#xD;
      reduction in insulin levels.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      This provides a rationale for combining dapagliflozin with alpelisib in the treatment of HR+,&#xD;
      PIK3CA mutant MBC. If concurrent treatment with dapagliflozin can abrogate the alpelisib&#xD;
      induced hyperglycemia and subsequent rebound hyperinsulinemia it may significantly improve&#xD;
      the therapeutic efficacy of alpelisib.&#xD;
