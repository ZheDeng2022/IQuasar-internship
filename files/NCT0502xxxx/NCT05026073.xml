  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of vibrational spectroscopic&#xD;
      techniques, Raman spectroscopy and Attenuated Total Reflection - Fourier Transform Infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), to accurately differentiate endometrial tissue, lymph nodes and&#xD;
      blood samples with womb cancer or endometrial hyperplasia from healthy controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Womb cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women, with rising incidence worldwide.&#xD;
      Current diagnostic strategies are time consuming, invasive and have limited accuracy,&#xD;
      furthermore there is no population-wide screening. Treatment depends on patients' health,&#xD;
      type of disease and spread at the time of diagnosis. Most women will be offered surgery,&#xD;
      however the role of lymph node dissection in early stage disease remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is therefore a need for an objective, accurate test, able to detect pre-cancer and&#xD;
      cancer early and able to identify metastatic node involvement, so that lymph node excision is&#xD;
      performed only when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attenuated Total Reflection - Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman&#xD;
      spectroscopy are non-invasive, objective techniques that use the interaction of light within&#xD;
      tissues to gain detailed information about the chemical composition of biological samples.&#xD;
      These methods have shown tremendous potential for improving diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to use Vibrational Spectroscopy to examine blood plasma and serum,&#xD;
      endometrial biopsies via Pipelle device and pelvic/para-aortic lymph nodes for the presence&#xD;
      of endometrial pre-cancer and cancer changes. The analyses will be performed on fresh (wet)&#xD;
      as well as dried samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal is to develop a point-of-care test and an intra-operative tool for&#xD;
      endometrial cancer screening and diagnosis. Such a test could speed up endometrial cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, reduce treatment delays and individualise patients care.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of the study will be to evaluate the correct classification of cases of endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia and controls by Raman and ATR-FTIR spectral analysis, compared to histopathology as the standard of reference. The outcome will be measured with sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values and likelihood ratios.&#xD;
The diagnostic accuracy will be documented for pipelle samples, endometrial samples from hysterectomy specimens, pelvic/para-aortic lymph nodes, blood serum and plasma.</description>

    <description>All women will undergo planned hysterectomy.&#xD;
Venous blood sample will be collected prior to surgery.&#xD;
Endometrial sampling via Pipelle device will be performed immediately prior to hysterectomy&#xD;
Endometrial biopsy from the hysterectomy specimen will be obtained under direct vision&#xD;
The plasma and serum obtained from the blood samples will be analysed with ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopes. Spectra from both wet and dry specimens will be recorded.&#xD;
All tissue samples retrieved will be placed in Phosphate Buffered Solution for transfer to the histopathology laboratory. Spectra will be collected from the fresh samples with ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopes. Spectral analyses will subsequently be repeated on dry samples post fixation and processing.&#xD;
All tissue samples will undergo haematoxylin and eosin staining after spectral analysis for standard histopathological confirmation.</description>
