  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the effects on atrial rhythm control between SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor and other oral hypoglycemic agents in patients with atrial fibrillation and&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. We are to compare efficacy and safety between these two groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective open blinded-endpoint design, 1:1 randomized, and&#xD;
      controlled study, with total of 716 patients enrolled from 4-5 centers. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation within a year, when recurrence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is defined as at least one significant atrial fibrillation documented on 24-hour&#xD;
      Holter ECG. Secondary outcomes are atrial fibrillation free survival, atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      burden at various time points, ablation rate within a year, atrial fibrillation recurrence&#xD;
      rate after ablation within a year, volume of left atrium, NT-ProBNP, Symptom score and&#xD;
      Quality of Life.&#xD;
