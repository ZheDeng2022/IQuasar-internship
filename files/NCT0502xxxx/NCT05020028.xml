  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if cannabidiol (CBD) orally dissolving tablets (ODTs) can&#xD;
      lessen pain, improve function, and improve patient satisfaction in cases of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. CBD comes from the cannabis plant and is non-psychoactive (i.e. does not&#xD;
      produce a 'high' or altered mental state) as compared to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), another&#xD;
      compound found in cannabis. Researchers are studying different forms of CBD for potential use&#xD;
      in treating pain, inflammation, and illnesses.&#xD;

      This will be a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The study&#xD;
      is comparing pain, outcomes, and patient satisfaction in two cohorts: patients with knee OA&#xD;
      undergoing physiotherapy/home exercises who receive CBD and a placebo group with PT/home&#xD;
      exercise program. Patients will be asked on treatment Day 1, 2, 7, and 14, 28, and 42 to rate&#xD;
      their pain according to the VAS scale. Additionally, patient satisfaction and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured.&#xD;

    <description>The differences in pain between patients receiving CBD with knee OA undergoing physiotherapy compared to patients who do not receive it will be measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). To compare primary outcomes (VAS score), a T-Test test will be performed, with a p-value of 0.05 set to determine statistical significance. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>In order to measure differences in patient satisfaction, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will be used. A T-Test will be performed, with a p-value of 0.05 set to determine statistical significance. The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems</description>
