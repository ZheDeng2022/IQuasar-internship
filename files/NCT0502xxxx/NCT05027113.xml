  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, people of color (POC) are disproportionally affected by stressors&#xD;
      related to race/ethnicity compared with their non-Latinx White (NLW). Considering POC exposed&#xD;
      to race-related stress are at high risk of developing a mental health disorder, there is a&#xD;
      clear need for treatments that allow individuals to cope effectively with these stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among many evidence-based treatments available, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may be&#xD;
      particularly well suited to help POC cope. MBIs are hypothesized to be effective via&#xD;
      increases in mindfulness and self-compassion, as well as reductions in experiential&#xD;
      avoidance, rumination, and emotion suppression. Despite their effectiveness, MBIs rarely&#xD;
      reach POC. As such, innovative strategies such as self-directed app-based intervention may&#xD;
      reduce the treatment gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the lack of research examining the effectiveness of MBIs among POC, especially&#xD;
      those who experience elevated levels of race-related stress, this study will employ a&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) approach to examine whether receiving an app-based MBI engages&#xD;
      the hypothesized mechanisms of change (i.e., mindfulness, self-compassion, experiential&#xD;
      avoidance, rumination, emotion suppression) among POC. Similarly, the study will test whether&#xD;
      the intervention leads to decreases in the negative mental health outcomes more often&#xD;
      associated with exposure to race-related stress (i.e., stress, anxiety, depression).&#xD;
      Acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction also will be analyzed to explore whether a&#xD;
      non-culturally adapted MBI is still relevant for POC who face race-related stress. Results&#xD;
      from this trial will contribute to the nascent data on MBI acceptability and effectiveness&#xD;
      with POC. To the investigators' knowledge, this study will also be the first to include a&#xD;
      sample of POC recruited based on elevated levels of race-related stress, a high-risk&#xD;
      population that is not commonly targeted in MBI research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, people of color (POC) are disproportionally affected by stressors&#xD;
      related to race/ethnicity compared with their non-Latinx White (NLW) counterparts, with&#xD;
      approximately 70% of POC reporting having experienced some form of discrimination in their&#xD;
      lives and 60% reporting facing day-to-day discriminatory treatment. Race-related stress is&#xD;
      the psychological distress associated with appraising a situation as disturbing or burdensome&#xD;
      because of negative racial bias. Race-related stressors have multiple forms, such as direct&#xD;
      interpersonal discrimination (i.e., perceived differential and unfair treatment among&#xD;
      individuals), vicarious discrimination (i.e., observing members of one's race/ethnicity being&#xD;
      victimized), institutional practices (i.e., laws and policies that limit access to services&#xD;
      and opportunities), and cultural traditions (i.e., beliefs and practices that reinforce the&#xD;
      idea of NLW's superiority over POC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When differential or unfair treatment is perceived, it triggers physiological (e.g.,&#xD;
      cardiovascular reactivity, dysregulated HPA axis activity), cognitive-affective (e.g.,&#xD;
      rumination, emotion suppression), and behavioral (e.g., avoidance, aggression) responses that&#xD;
      prepare the individual to confront the situation. Although this acute stress response may be&#xD;
      beneficial in the short term, the chronic and unpredictable nature of race-related stressors&#xD;
      often depletes an individual's psychological resources and increases their vulnerability to&#xD;
      developing mental health disorders. Metanalytic work supports this stress-response model&#xD;
      among POC, showing that exposure to race-related stress is a consistent predictor of&#xD;
      increases in mental health problems, including overall stress, anxiety, and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among many EBTs available, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may be particularly well&#xD;
      suited to achieve these goals. Mindfulness is a psychological trait associated with staying&#xD;
      in the present moment with one's experience (i.e., physical sensations, thoughts, emotions,&#xD;
      behaviors), endorsing a nonjudgmental and curious attitude, and cultivating acceptance and&#xD;
      self-compassion. Self-compassion refers to an attitude of openness to one's own suffering&#xD;
      without avoiding it, cultivating the desire to alleviate it without self-judgment. In MBIs,&#xD;
      participants cultivate these two qualities through meditations -exercises aimed to gain&#xD;
      awareness of one's experience with an accepting and compassionate attitude. Metanalyses show&#xD;
      participants in MBIs exhibit increases in both mindfulness and self-compassion traits.&#xD;
      Multiple metanalyses have also shown that increases in mindfulness and self-compassion are&#xD;
      two of the mechanisms by which MBIs lead to decreases in overall stress, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, mindfulness meditation could be particularly effective to help POC cope with&#xD;
      race-related stress by reducing experiential avoidance. Experiential avoidance is the&#xD;
      inability to remain in contact with distressing physical sensations, thoughts, and emotions,&#xD;
      even when doing so causes harm in the long term. POC exposed to race-related stressors often&#xD;
      develop emotional (e.g., unwillingness to experience sadness after being discriminated&#xD;
      against) and behavioral avoidance (e.g., avoiding places where discrimination is likely to&#xD;
      occur) that maintain mental health symptoms. As such, mindfulness meditation with its&#xD;
      emphasis on bringing awareness to all experiences regardless of their negative valance may&#xD;
      serve as an &quot;exposure&quot; strategy that reduces avoidance, leading to decreases in psychological&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that rumination (i.e., the passive and repetitive focus on the causes and&#xD;
      consequences of one's distress) and emotion suppression (i.e., the active reduction of&#xD;
      emotionally expressive behavior when emotionally aroused) are maladaptive emotion regulation&#xD;
      strategies often used by POC exposed to race-related stressors, researchers and clinicians&#xD;
      have hypothesized that MBIs may be particularly well suited for this population. Research&#xD;
      suggests that by cultivating acceptance of and nonjudgmental engagement with thoughts,&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation disrupts ruminative tendencies. This hypothesis is consistent with&#xD;
      multiple metanalyses showing that the reduction in rumination is a mediator leading to&#xD;
      decreases in mental health problems, including stress, anxiety, and depression in MBI&#xD;
      programs. In the case of emotion suppression, mindfulness meditation may help individuals&#xD;
      identify, describe, and healthy engage with emotions triggered by race-related stressors&#xD;
      rather than suppress them, leading to decreases in mental health symptoms. At least one MBI&#xD;
      trial has shown that emotion suppression is a significant mediator behind decreases in&#xD;
      anxiety and depression among POC. Targeting emotion suppression may be particularly relevant,&#xD;
      considering cultural norms and practices among some POC groups (e.g., Asian, Latinx) that&#xD;
      encourage down-regulating emotion expression to promote group harmony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the significant mental health need among individuals who experience discrimination&#xD;
      and the existence of promising interventions such as MBIs, POC face numerous barriers to&#xD;
      care, including limited access to providers, financial and transportation constraints, as&#xD;
      well as stigma. As such, it is not surprising that POC are less likely to seek or receive&#xD;
      mental health services compared with their NLW counterparts. Although no single approach will&#xD;
      eliminate all barriers driving mental health disparities, the use of technology to provide&#xD;
      care could reduce this treatment gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital interventions have the potential to address the shortage of mental health&#xD;
      professionals, mitigate logistic barriers to service utilization, decrease costs associated&#xD;
      with EBT implementation, and engage individuals in care who may not seek services otherwise.&#xD;
      Among many technological resources available, smartphones represent a promising vehicle for&#xD;
      the provision of mental health services. The feasibility of this approach is supported by&#xD;
      extensive ownership of mobile devices in the United States. For instance, approximately 81%&#xD;
      of Americans have a smartphone, with POC having similar ownership rates as NLW. Compared with&#xD;
      NLW, POC are also more likely to be &quot;smartphone dependent&quot; -meaning they rely on these&#xD;
      devices to access the internet in the absence of broadband connection at home. Furthermore,&#xD;
      POC are also more likely to use their smartphones to seek information about their health than&#xD;
      their NLW counterparts. As such, app-based interventions using smartphones may be&#xD;
      well-positioned to reach those affected by the digital divide observed in low-income&#xD;
      households as these interventions capitalize on already available technology owned by POC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to their feasibility, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy&#xD;
      of app-based mental health interventions. Although somewhat limited, existing data with POC&#xD;
      samples are promising. In the case of app-based MBI, multiple metanalyses show that these&#xD;
      interventions are effective in reducing overall stress, anxiety, and depression as well as&#xD;
      increasing mindfulness and self-compassion. To the investigators' knowledge, experiential&#xD;
      avoidance, rumination, and emotion suppression have not been examined as potential clinical&#xD;
      targets in app-based MBIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 The purpose of this study is to examine whether this MBI engages relevant mechanisms of&#xD;
      change for POC exposed to race-related stress. Based on previous metanalytic studies on&#xD;
      mindfulness and self-compassion, the investigators hypothesize that POC who receive the&#xD;
      intervention will experience significant increases in both variables compared with POC in the&#xD;
      control group. Considering previous studies showing the crucial role of experiential&#xD;
      avoidance and emotion suppression, the investigators hypothesize that POC who receive the&#xD;
      intervention will experience significant decreases in these three variables compared with POC&#xD;
      in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 An additional goal of this study is to test whether POC who receive this MBI experience&#xD;
      reductions in mental health symptoms often associated with experiencing race-related stress.&#xD;
      Based on previous metanalytic studies, the investigators hypothesize that POC who receive the&#xD;
      intervention will experience significant decreases in overall stress, anxiety, and depression&#xD;
      compared with POC in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 Related to previous aims, this study will examine whether decreases in the main&#xD;
      outcomes of interest (i.e., stress, anxiety, depression) occur via hypothesized mechanisms of&#xD;
      change (i.e., mindfulness, self-compassion, experiential avoidance, rumination, emotion&#xD;
      suppression). Based on previous metanalytic studies, the investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      five mechanisms of change examined will be significant mediators leading to decreases in the&#xD;
      main outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4 This study will also examine app-based MBI acceptability (i.e., extent to which the&#xD;
      intervention is agreeable or satisfactory), adherence (i.e., actual use of the intervention),&#xD;
      and satisfaction (i.e., positive attitude toward the intervention received) in this high-risk&#xD;
      POC population. Considering researchers' and clinicians' concerns regarding potential&#xD;
      cultural mismatches between POC's backgrounds and MBIs, the investigators will use both&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative data sources to examine treatment acceptability descriptively.&#xD;
      Based on previous studies showing poor treatment engagement in self-directed app-based&#xD;
      interventions, the investigators will describe treatment adherence with both behavioral&#xD;
      markers and qualitative data. Finally, treatment satisfaction will also be measured using&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative methods. Given that these analyses are descriptive, the&#xD;
      investigators do not have specific hypotheses.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals interested in participating in this study will complete an online screening&#xD;
        questionnaire using Qualtrics, a platform that is smartphone compatible. For study&#xD;
        inclusion, participants are required to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Identify as a member of a people of color (POC) group&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Report experiencing elevated levels of race-related stress (i.e., a score of 55 in the&#xD;
             IRRS-B or a score of 12 in the MDM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Speak and read English,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Not receive psychological services currently&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Not have practiced mindfulness meditation for more than two hours in the month prior&#xD;
             to study commencement&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Own a smartphone with access to the internet&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be willing to install the MBI app and accept daily notifications and text reminders&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Be at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        Screening Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Race-Related Stress. The 22-item Index of Race-Related Stress-Brief (IRRS-B) measures&#xD;
        multiple sources of race-related stress, including Individual, Institutional, and Cultural.&#xD;
        Participants rate items on a scale ranging from 0 (This Never Happened to Me) to 4 (This&#xD;
        Event Happened and I was Extremely Upset), with higher scores indicating more race-related&#xD;
        stress. The IRRS-B was developed with a POC sample (i.e., Blacks), showing adequate&#xD;
        reliability (α = .78) for both Cultural and Individual subscales and acceptable reliability&#xD;
        (α = .69) for the Institutional subscale. For study inclusion, participants need to obtain&#xD;
        a score of 55, which represents elevated race-related stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Perceived Discrimination. The 8-item Multicultural Discrimination Module (MDM) measures&#xD;
        perceived discrimination. Participants rate items on a scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 4&#xD;
        (Often) with higher scores indicating more levels of perceived discrimination. The MDM was&#xD;
        developed using a U.S. population-based sample (approximately 40% POC) and has shown good&#xD;
        internal consistency (α = .81 - .88) in a previous study. For study inclusion, participants&#xD;
        need to obtain a score of 12, which represents the 75th percentile of the population&#xD;
        distribution.&#xD;
