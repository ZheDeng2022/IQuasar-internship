      The specific study aim is to determine whether a 12-week digitally delivered behavior change&#xD;
      intervention for patients with peripheral artery disease increases walking ability, reduces&#xD;
      smoking, improves quality of life and improves medication adherence. The primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints will primarily be captured at a 12 weeks follow-up visit, but a follow-up&#xD;
      visit after 12 months is also planned; to assess longer term effect on outcomes and&#xD;
      healthcare cost.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent atherosclerotic syndrome with an&#xD;
      estimated global population burden of ~200 million people. PAD patients are at heightened&#xD;
      risk for adverse cardiovascular- and limb events and impaired quality of life. Cigarette&#xD;
      smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor. Patients with PAD who smoke have higher&#xD;
      disease progression rates, greater risk of complications, poor post-procedural outcomes,&#xD;
      compromised functional status, and increased hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant goal of PAD treatment includes risk factor modification and prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Guideline-directed therapy includes cardioprotective&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies, and lifestyle modification. Nevertheless, adherence to pharmacologic and&#xD;
      lifestyle recommendations in PAD is uncertain. Effective non-pharmacologic therapies for PAD&#xD;
      also exist, including smoking cessation, exercise support, and diet counseling. However,&#xD;
      limited data is available on mobile applications offering digitally delivered lifestyle&#xD;
      change support, including a structured exercise program and smoking cessation support. This&#xD;
      study aims to digitally provide lifestyle change support, including a structured and&#xD;
      PAD-focused lifestyle program and smoking cessation support via a mobile platform (Sidekick&#xD;
      Health) with the primary aim to increase patients' walking ability and secondary aims to&#xD;
      reduce smoking and improve medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the end of the 12 weeks, the interventional arm will reach a clinically meaningful&#xD;
           change in walking ability, as compared to controls, measured by a change in the 6-MWT at&#xD;
           twelve-week, and 12 months; the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is&#xD;
           defined as +12m.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the end of the 12 weeks, ≥15% interventional treatment arm participants will give up&#xD;
           smoking or have significantly reduced their daily smoking compared to less than &lt;10% in&#xD;
           the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of the 12 weeks, ≥50% of interventional treatment arm participants will&#xD;
           improve their medication adherence from pre- until post-intervention as compared to &lt;30%&#xD;
           in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Healthcare cost will be reduced at 12 month follow-up in the intervention arm.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be instructed to download a life-style-changing mobile app to which they will have access for 12 weeks. After the first week of the program, participants who smoke will be offered to incorporate smoking cessation support into their PAD program. These changes are minor and not intended to divide the intervention group in two but instead to personalize the study experience. The program aims to empower positive lifestyle change by gamification, altruistic rewards, and engaging content with relevant tasks or missions to be completed. Beyond this, all patients in the interventional arm will also receive standard of care as defined below for the control arm.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Standard of care - control group.</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>All patients in the control arm will receive best medical therapy including start or optimization of secondary preventive pharmacotherapy, smoking cessation advise and advise on modifiable risk factors. The control arm will also receive an information leaflet about relevant lifestyle modifications for PAD. After the baseline measurements and data collection, there will be no scheduled visits to a health care provider until week 12.</description>
