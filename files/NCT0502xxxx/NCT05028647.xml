    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are gaining importance in the rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs for learning disabilities. The project will test tolerability and efficacy of a&#xD;
      VR/AR specially developed tool to improve reading abilities of adolescents with dyslexia aged&#xD;
      10-16&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyslexia is the most common form of learning difficulty, with a prevalence of at least 10&#xD;
      percent, putting more than 700 million children and adults worldwide at risk of life-long&#xD;
      illiteracy and social exclusion (Springer-Charolles, Siegel, Jim√©nez &amp; Ziegler, 2011). In the&#xD;
      EU context 2,500,000 dyslexic school children in the EU have a specific disorder in learning&#xD;
      to read and spell (dyslexia). Dyslexia is one of the development disorders that has been most&#xD;
      discussed and researched, however, intervention through technology is relatively recent. The&#xD;
      wide repertoire of manifestations and problems associated with dyslexia can be an obstacle to&#xD;
      access to a standardized curriculum. It can also make it difficult to access the training or&#xD;
      mobility programs provided by the European Union.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FORDYS-VAR main objective is to provide an opportunity to improve the learning of people&#xD;
      with dyslexia through technology, specifically Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality&#xD;
      (AR). Introducing these technologies in the process of evaluation and intervention can become&#xD;
      a key element to improve the effectiveness of learning and the improvement of their training&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working with the AR and the VR provides people with dyslexia a safe and controlled&#xD;
      environment, improves their motivation, contributes to generate high levels of interaction.&#xD;
      Another advantage that we must emphasize is that you get an immediate feedback through&#xD;
      technology, which contributes to improve visual skills and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transnationally approach of this project is needed because dyslexia occurs in all&#xD;
      languages. Also we must consider that depending on the language, dyslexia will manifest&#xD;
      itself in different ways. Target groups: (1) Children with dyslexia that will be the&#xD;
      end-users of the materials developed; (2) Professionals involving in providing formal and&#xD;
      non-formal treatment of dyslexia: Therapist, educators; (3) Families of dyslexic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FORDYS-VAR project aims to be a reference in the definitive treatment of dyslexia, The&#xD;
      creation of VR and AR materials for improvement the treatment of dyslexia in school children&#xD;
      will be the final goal of the project. As mentioned before, &quot;the definitive treatment&quot; has&#xD;
      not yet been found, but what is known is that the best treatments or the most effective&#xD;
      include aspects such as intensive sessions, explicit instructions, individual or small group&#xD;
      work and special attention must be paid to the phonological awareness and compensation&#xD;
      strategies. It has also been seen that in many cases the adherence to treatments is not very&#xD;
      high since they tend to be very repetitive and not very stimulating (children end up being&#xD;
      bored). Currently, the applied treatments are multisensory structured language education&#xD;
      (MSLE). They are usually multisensory, highly structured and sequential. For this reason, VR&#xD;
      and AR fit perfectly into improving the efficacy of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VR and AR will be immersive and interactive. That is, not only glasses will be used to&#xD;
           see, but also proposed tools will promote the interaction with gestural recognition so&#xD;
           that the experience is more immersive and, therefore, more active (this will impact in&#xD;
           the interaction with gestural recognition so that the experience is more immersive and,&#xD;
           therefore, more active (child engagement). Furthermore, a classroom (or a more playful&#xD;
           environment) will be simulated in which there will be different objects with which the&#xD;
           school children can interact, for example a blackboard, and a desk with a notebook.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the creation of the catalog of objects to work with AR, it will be directed above&#xD;
           all to work in the classroom and at home with the parents aimed at the building&#xD;
           students' phonological awareness and increasing their level of vocabulary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participatory design (co-design) for the development of VR materials from the experiences /&#xD;
      needs of the users will be employed in building the programs to be run on VR (Oculos) or AR&#xD;
      (tablets) apparatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A social impact assessment of the activities and results implemented by the project which&#xD;
      will take into account gender issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 dyslexic boys and girls will be recruited in each country (60 total). Half of them will be&#xD;
      in the age group of 10-12y and half 13-16y.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited subjects will complete the PIRLS questionnaire at admission. 5 subjects for&#xD;
      each age group will be randomly allocated to the intervention arm by a PC generated&#xD;
      randomization list and will be exposed to the VR (subjects aged 13-16) or AR (subjects aged&#xD;
      10-12) treatment. The treatment will last one week and imply 1 hour each day of supervised&#xD;
      use of the devices loaded with the specially developed software. At the end of the training&#xD;
      week the participants will repeat the PIRLS questionnaire and will complete the Technology&#xD;
      acceptance questionnaire and the Technical aspects questionnaire (both validated tools) to&#xD;
      assess the tolerability of the treatment. The group of subjects not exposed to treatment will&#xD;
      repeat the PIRLS questionnaire after one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the tolerability questionnaires will be analysed to assess safety and&#xD;
      acceptance of the tools, while the possible difference in the PIRLS score pre/post treatment&#xD;
      will give information on efficacy.&#xD;
