      An observational study on dose optimization of fruquintinib in elderly metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer patients refractory to standard treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, observational study. In this study, the&#xD;
      low-dose initial dose incremental optimization scheme was used in the first cycle in patients&#xD;
      ≥65 years old who need to receive fruquintinib. The aim is to observe the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of fruquintinib in elderly patients with mCRC refractory to&#xD;
      standard treatment. The correlation between the efficacy, toxicity and geriatric evaluation&#xD;
      of fruquintinib will also be analysed.&#xD;
