  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. The subjects were&#xD;
      patients who developed ARDS within the preceding 72h. They were divided into 2 groups based&#xD;
      on the use of sivelestat sodium which was determined by the physician in charge based on the&#xD;
      condition of the patients: sivelestat sodium group and conventional treatment group. 560&#xD;
      patients were planned to be enrolled, with 280 patients in each group. In the sivelestat&#xD;
      sodium group, patients were treated with sivelestat sodium within 72h of the diagnosis of&#xD;
      ARDS. After 5 days of sivelestat treatment, sivelestat treatment should be stopped if the&#xD;
      oxygenation index is greater than 300mmHg for at least 3 consecutive times; otherwise,&#xD;
      sivelestat treatment should be continued until the oxygenation index is greater than 300mmHg&#xD;
      for at least 3 consecutive times; if sivelestat treatment is continued until the 14th day,&#xD;
      the drug should be stopped regardless of the oxygenation situation. Baseline data and Murray&#xD;
      lung injury score, inflammatory markers, routine test results, duration of ECMO use/length of&#xD;
      hospital stay/length of ICU stay were recorded at 1, 3,5, and 7 days after patients were&#xD;
      enrolled, and patients were followed up on the 28th and 90th days.&#xD;
