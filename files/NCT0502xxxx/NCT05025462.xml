  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to verify the safety of 15g of salmon peptide fraction&#xD;
      (SPF), and to test the effects on metabolic syndrome risk factors of two doses of SPF (7.5g&#xD;
      and 15g) in overweight-obese men and women. Transcriptomic, metabolomic and metagenomic&#xD;
      approaches will be used to study the physiological effects of SPF and to discover the&#xD;
      potential mechanism underlying these effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Increased fish consumption has been suggested to improve the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in obese&#xD;
      subjects. While it is well documented that marine long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3&#xD;
      PUFA) decrease CVD risk by improving the plasma lipid profile and reducing inflammation, the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in humans&#xD;
      remains highly controversial. Animal and human studies carried out by the group of&#xD;
      investigators over the past 20 years have shown that fish proteins can improve the plasma&#xD;
      lipid profile, enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce obesity-linked inflammation. The&#xD;
      investigators also reported that a salmon protein hydrolysate reduces body fat and increases&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity via its calcitonin content and they observed that protein hydrolysates&#xD;
      from salmon and other fish sources reduced inflammation in visceral adipose tissue in&#xD;
      rodents. The investigators therefore decided a few years ago to focus on the identification&#xD;
      of bioactive peptides from fish proteins to explore the potential of increasing the efficacy&#xD;
      of fish muscle protein hydrolysates to prevent/treat the MetS. The investigators hypothesized&#xD;
      that it was the peptides produced from gastrointestinal digestion that were responsible for&#xD;
      the remarkable bioactive effects of fish proteins on the MetS. The investigators have also&#xD;
      confirmed that a small peptides fraction (SPF) from salmon protein markedly reduces the&#xD;
      development of T2D and inflammation in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced, obese,&#xD;
      atherosclerosis-prone mouse LDLr knockout (KO). These findings are very promising and suggest&#xD;
      that fish protein-derived peptides or amino acids may also explain the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      dietary fish intake on the MetS, T2D and CVD. Additional studies are required to validate&#xD;
      these observations, delineate the mechanisms, and assess their direct impact in human&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take an oral dose of 15 g of SPF or comparator per day (powder mixed with&#xD;
      water) in the first intervention phase (6 weeks), then 7.5 g of SPF or comparator per day&#xD;
      (powder mixed with water) in the second intervention phase (6 weeks).&#xD;
