  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is defined as the pain experienced from the base of the skull or occiput to the&#xD;
      upper part of the back and extending laterally to the outer and superior bounds of the&#xD;
      shoulder blade. Office work is a kind of job that demands sitting for prolonged time&#xD;
      requiring the use of computer. These two factors are mainly responsible for overloading of&#xD;
      the spine. Neck pain and computer users are clearly connected due to extended periods of&#xD;
      sitting in a certain position with no breaks to stretch the neck muscles. Prolonged computer&#xD;
      use with neck bent forward will cause the anterior neck muscles to gradually get shorter and&#xD;
      tighter, while the muscles in the back of neck will grow longer and weaker. These changes&#xD;
      will lead to development of neck pain. Neck problem also accounts for a large proportion of&#xD;
      occupational illness and disability. Neck pain is common among computer workers in our&#xD;
      country and contributes importantly to the demand for medical services and the economic&#xD;
      burden of absence from work due to sickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this randomized clinical trial will be to find out the effects of&#xD;
      Isometric exercises with and without Pressure Biofeedback Unit on Cervical pain and Muscle&#xD;
      strength in Computer users with cervical spine overload. Patients will be recruited in the&#xD;
      study by convenient sampling technique after that will be allocated to groups by simple&#xD;
      random assignment with an inclusion criteria having chronic neck pain for more than 3 months,&#xD;
      current pain level ranging greater than 3 on NPRS, patient with minimum and moderate&#xD;
      disability and male and female computer users with age 25 to 40 years with cervical pain.&#xD;
      Patients with history of cervical trauma, postural deformity, spinal cord deformity, current&#xD;
      pregnancy and significant neurological deficits were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Neck Disability Index (NDI) will be used to measure&#xD;
      before and after treatment session. Treatment will be given to both groups for 4 weeks and&#xD;
      each group will receive 3 sessions per week. After collecting the data it will entered and&#xD;
      analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Data will be&#xD;
      assessed by using parametric/ non parametric test after completion of the study.&#xD;
