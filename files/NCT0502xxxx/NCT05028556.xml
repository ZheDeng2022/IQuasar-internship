    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      PD, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of Y101D in patients with metastatic or locally&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of two parts: dose escalation part and cohort expansion part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dose escalation part, up to 5 dose-escalation cohorts will be sequentially enrolled in&#xD;
      this study. The five dose levels are 1, 3, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg. DLTs will be evaluated during&#xD;
      the first treatment cycle, which is 28 days. The study consists of a 4-week screening period,&#xD;
      a 4-week core treatment period for DLT evaluation, a treatment extension period, a safety&#xD;
      follow-up visit for approximately 30 days following the last dose of Y101D, and survival&#xD;
      follow-ups every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cohort expansion part, To further characterize safety and efficacy of Y101D, cohort&#xD;
      expansion will be allowed in the following two circumstances: MTD cohort expansion if the MTD&#xD;
      could be identified; Benefited dose cohort if it could be determined by Investigator.&#xD;
