  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phaseⅡstudy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GP&#xD;
      (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) in combination with Tislelizumab and Ociperlimab as first-line&#xD;
      treatment in participants with unresectable advanced Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC) has an insidious onset, invasiveness, high malignancy, and no&#xD;
      specific symptoms in the early stage, and most of them are in the middle and advanced stages&#xD;
      at the time of diagnosis and have lost the chance of surgery. For patients with advanced BTC,&#xD;
      systemic therapy is currently the main choice, and gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) is currently&#xD;
      the &quot;gold standard&quot; for first-line treatment of advanced BTC, but the efficacy is still&#xD;
      unsatisfactory, and more and more clinical practice has found that GP-based combination&#xD;
      therapy may have better efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that chemotherapy can improve the immunotherapy microenvironment&#xD;
      and may have a synergistic anti-tumor effect in combination with immunotherapy. This study is&#xD;
      to explore the efficacy and safety of GP in combination with anti-PD1 antibody (Tislelizumab)&#xD;
      and anti-TIGIT antibody (Ociperlimab) as first-line treatment in participants with&#xD;
      unresectable advanced BTC.&#xD;
