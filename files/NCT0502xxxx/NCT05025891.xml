  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel group study of 3 arms, among patients&#xD;
      followed for chronic HIV infection at Cayenne hospital. The main objective of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of follow-up of these patients by teleconsultation associated or&#xD;
      not with health mediation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has strained health systems, and chronic disease monitoring has&#xD;
      often been put on hold, without yet really measuring the resulting health impact. In this&#xD;
      context, e-Health has benefited from considerable momentum to overcome the shortcomings that&#xD;
      have arisen, to allow remote monitoring of patients infected with COVID 19, to protect&#xD;
      patients and caregivers and avoid nosocomial infections. Telemedicine is all the more&#xD;
      relevant in Guyana as there are issues of geographic isolation, lack of specialists and&#xD;
      critical mass of health professionals. In French Guiana, faced with the arrival of&#xD;
      teleconsultation tools, a fear of professionals is their applicability for the most&#xD;
      vulnerable populations, not knowing how to read or speak French and having restricted access&#xD;
      to digital technology. Moreover HIV infection is an ever stigmatizing infection affecting&#xD;
      populations that are often extremely precarious, requiring specialist monitoring and lifelong&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team propose to carry out a randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel group&#xD;
      study of 3 arms, among patients followed for chronic HIV infection at Cayenne hospital : 1/&#xD;
      Control group with classic follow-up at Cayenne hospital. 2/Teleconsultation only group:&#xD;
      patients referred to the remote monitoring platform without specific support.&#xD;
      3/Teleconsulation group + mediator: patients referred to the remote monitoring platform with&#xD;
      support from a health mediator Patients will be followed every 3 months or 6 months depending&#xD;
      on the judgment of the investigating physician for 12 months in the study (primary endpoint&#xD;
      evaluated at 1 year). Number of patients to be included: 450 patients.&#xD;
