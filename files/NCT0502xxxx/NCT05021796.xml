    <textblock>
      In the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, on-the-job training for asthma counseling becomes more&#xD;
      difficult. Telecounseling as a training platform becomes a mainstream of training during the&#xD;
      pandemic. This study is designed to fill the knowledge gap for telecounseling as a training&#xD;
      platform for asthma counseling among nurses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma education is essential in improving outcomes in asthma management. Patients with&#xD;
      asthma exacerbation frequently present to the urgent care centre or emergency department for&#xD;
      emergency treatment. Nurse-led asthma education was considered as beneficial to asthma&#xD;
      management. However, not all nursing staff in the urgent care centre and emergency department&#xD;
      are equipped with skills to counsel patients regarding their asthma control and inhaler use.&#xD;
      It is important to empower the nursing staff with these skills such that the care of patients&#xD;
      with asthma is not compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, on-the-job training for asthma counseling becomes more&#xD;
      difficult. Asthma counseling trainers were usually in the clean zones but recipients of&#xD;
      asthma counseling training were usually in the dirty zones. Telecounseling as a training&#xD;
      platform becomes a mainstream of training during the pandemic. Telehealthcare interventions&#xD;
      on patients with asthma was proven to reduce hospitalization over a 12-month period in a&#xD;
      previous meta-analysis. However, there was no study investigating the efficacy of&#xD;
      telecounseling to replace on-the-job training for asthma counseling. This study is designed&#xD;
      to fill the knowledge gap for telecounseling as a training platform for asthma counseling&#xD;
      among nurses.&#xD;
