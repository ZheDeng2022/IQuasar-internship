  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effects of a transtheoretical model-based walking exercise&#xD;
      training and disease management and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. This&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial will be conducted as a pre-test and post-test experiment with 30&#xD;
      intervention and 30 control individuals. The intervention group will receive the&#xD;
      transtheoretical model-based exercise training. The intervention group will be followed-up&#xD;
      for 6 months (from 0 to 6 months) to determine the patients' behavioral changes after the&#xD;
      training will be completed.&#xD;

    <measure>Exercise Stages of Change Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in 6 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Prochaska et al. (1992) studied how people change. Marcus et al. developed a structured questionnaire to measure the stages of exercise changes. Ay and Temel (2015) adapted the questionnaire to Turkish society. The scale consists of five questions about the patient's stage of change (prethinking, thinking, preparation, taking action, and maintenance). In the pre-thinking stage, the patients do not plan to start exercise now or during the next 6 months. The patients in the thinking stage do not make an effort to exercise actively, but intend to start in the next 6 months. The patients in the preparation stage intend to start exercising regularly in the next 30 days. The patients in the taking action stage have started exercising within the last 6 months. The patients in the maintenance stage continue to change over the course of the action, exercise more than 6 months and are confident and determined not to return to previous behavior.</description>

    <measure>Exercise Processes of Change Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in 6 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The exercise processes of change scale was developed by Marcus et al. and adapted to Turkish society by Ay and Temel. Exercise processes of change is based on a 5-point Likert type scale and consists of 28 items. The maximum score that a patient can obtain on the scale is 140, the minimum score is 28. The scale consists of 10 sub-dimensions and two main processes (behavioral and cognitive). Behavioral processes are opposition, helping relationships, empowerment management, self-emancipation and stimulus control. Cognitive processes are increased awareness, dramatic help, environmental reassessment, self reassessment, social independence. The higher the scale score is indicates a higher success of the change. In this study, the general Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was determined as 0.96 (behavioral process = 0.94 and cognitive process = 0.93).</description>

    <measure>Patient Compliance in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in 6 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of 30 questions and a five-point Likert type rating is used. There are 13 positive and 17 negative items in the scale. Scoring ranges from 1 to 5 for positive items, and reverse scoring ranges from 5 to 1 for negative items. The highest score obtained from the scale is 150, the lowest score is 30. 30-54 points from the scale indicates &quot;good adherence to treatment&quot;, 55-125 points &quot;medium adherence to treatment&quot;, and 126-150 points indicate that the patient's adherence to treatment is poor. The scale was developed by Demirtaş and Albayrak for use in Turkish society. Cronbach's alpha value was found to be 0.77.</description>

    <measure>Pedometer</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in 6 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A pedometer is a portable, small, inexpensive, and objective tool used to measure the number of steps. The pedometer includes a mechanical motion sensitive sensor that detects movements during walking. To prevent diseases and encourage healthy lifestyles, 150 minutes exercise and 10,000 steps per day are recommended. The researcher will provide participants with Omron brand HJ-320-E model pedometers to record 7days of activity data. These records were used to calculate the average number of steps per day.</description>

    <description>After the initial assessment, patients in this group will be educated by the researcher on walking exercise by using the transtheoritical model. The data will be collected from the patients in the experimental group at baseline, 1st, 3rd, and 6th months of the programme.&#xD;
The data will be collected by using Exercise Stages of Change Questionnaire, Exercise Processes of Change Scale, Pedometer, Patient Compliance in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Scale, and patient identification that includes five domain. These domains include questions about the patients' sociodemographic characteristics, habits, knowledge of diabetes and its treatment, exercise status, and the evaluation of the metabolic control variables.</description>
