      The study is expected to be conducted between 2021.08 and 2023.12.120 subjects with&#xD;
      early-onset ovarian insufficiency will be randomly assigned to trial, control, or combination&#xD;
      groups using a computer-generated randomization table.By comparing the data of primary&#xD;
      efficacy indexes, secondary efficacy indexes and safety indexes before and after medication,&#xD;
      The principal investigator will write and publish the paper.&#xD;
