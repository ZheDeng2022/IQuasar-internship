    <intervention_name>Motor-cognitive exercise therapy in the home</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants engage in a progressive 10-week exercise program targeted at improving motor and cognitive function. Motor exercises target functional strength, gait and physical activity level. Training sessions occur 3 times weekly and supported by a digital application which has been adapted for people with Parkinson's disease. Weeks 1-2 focus solely on motor exercises. Dual-task (Motor-cognitive) exercises are introduced at week 3 and progressed until week 10. Participants are also encouraged to increase the physical activity levels during the 10 week period.&#xD;
Weekly contact is made using the video function/ telephone with clinical specialists/ researchers. Two home visits will occur, the first one week prior to the intervention and at the 5-week period. Participants receive motivational messaging and reminders via the app during the intervention period.</description>
