  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the VA's best efforts to treat the psychosocial impact of war, many combat Veterans&#xD;
      report lingering difficulty reintegrating into meaningful post-deployment lives. War is among&#xD;
      the most extreme forms of human experience but, for many, wartime trauma was treated using&#xD;
      models transported from civilian single-incident trauma contexts. Veterans have unique needs&#xD;
      and experiences that require culturally responsive and sensitive conceptualizations and&#xD;
      treatments. Patient-centered care is improved by providing multiple effective treatment&#xD;
      options and this project, if successful, could have a significant impact on VA care. This&#xD;
      CDA-2 project has the potential to offer innovative treatment for traumatized combat Veterans&#xD;
      who otherwise may not find full relief from PTSD. Clinical research practice will be advanced&#xD;
      by employing state-of-the-art user-centered design methods combined with expert clinical&#xD;
      feedback to develop an effective and usable group treatment manual that will meet VA needs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 25% of combat Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) seek treatment&#xD;
      for traumas that involve potentially morally injurious events (PMIE) rather than danger-based&#xD;
      traumas. PMIEs are more strongly associated with functional and psychiatric impairment than&#xD;
      life-threat-based combat. Veterans report that PMIEs disrupt their sense of identity and&#xD;
      meaning, ability to connect with and trust others, and engender disturbing guilt, shame,&#xD;
      rage, and disgust. The sequelae of exposure to PMIEs, otherwise known as moral injury, may&#xD;
      explain variance in post-deployment recovery and is a potential unaddressed treatment target.&#xD;
      Existing first-line treatments may be limited because they were derived from civilian&#xD;
      contexts, poorly fit the war zone context, and do not allow Veterans to discuss the details&#xD;
      of the PMIEs with other Veterans. This project will develop a relational dynamic-based group&#xD;
      therapy treatment manual that will target functioning and quality of life among Veterans who&#xD;
      are impacted by high magnitude PMIEs. The goal of this relational dynamic trauma therapy is&#xD;
      to help Veterans identify connections between their current symptoms and their experiences in&#xD;
      combat/PMIEs, their current life stressors and relationships, and the historical factors that&#xD;
      carry person-specific meaning to their trauma/PMIE. These explorations take place in the&#xD;
      presence of attuned and sympathetic others who can resonate to the experience and the affect&#xD;
      being expressed. Symptom reduction occurs through increasing the Veteran's capacity to&#xD;
      consciously reflect on their experiences and develop an integrated self-awareness of the&#xD;
      various factors that affect their mental states. The result is greater self-reflection, less&#xD;
      avoidance, and greater adaptive incorporation of life experiences and their aftermath and&#xD;
      meanings into one's inner world. This CDA-2 will employ innovative user-centered design&#xD;
      methods that continuously gather user experiences during treatment development, with the goal&#xD;
      of increased effectiveness and usability. User feedback will be synthesized with formative&#xD;
      feedback from a clinical expert panel. This objective will be accomplished by pursuing these&#xD;
      specific aims: Aim 1: Discover user needs and preferences as well as treatment-engagement&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators from the perspectives of PMIE-impacted Veterans and VA trauma&#xD;
      clinicians. Aim 2: Design a treatment manual and refine it using feedback from Veterans,&#xD;
      trauma clinicians, and an expert clinical advisory board. Aim 3: Conduct two rapid&#xD;
      prototyping open trials (i.e., tangibly testing treatment approaches using a prototype&#xD;
      manual) with PMIE-impacted Veterans (N = ~12), and iteratively revise the manual based on&#xD;
      Veteran, provider, and clinical expert panel feedback, with the following hypothesis: The&#xD;
      treatment manual will meet usability, feasibility, learnability, and acceptability criteria.&#xD;
