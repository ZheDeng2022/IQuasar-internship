    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in subjects&#xD;
      with CUP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 45 subjects with CUP will be enrolled. Subjects will be treated with sintilimab at 200&#xD;
      mg via intravenous (IV) administration on Cycle 1 Day 1. The treatment will repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks until progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicity, initiation of new anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, completion of therapy, or any other&#xD;
      investigator-determined reasons for treatment discontinuation (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
      Treatment will continue for a maximum period of 24 months (starting from the first dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, tumor imaging evaluation will be initially performed once every 9 weeks (±&#xD;
      7 days) and will be based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. After&#xD;
      the completion or discontinuation of the study treatment, safety follow-up and survival&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the rareness of the disease, the patient accrual rate is expected to be&#xD;
      approximately 2 patients per month. The total study duration is expected to be between 24-27&#xD;
      months with 6-month follow up.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab in subjects with CUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall objective response rate (ORR) (investigator assessed), disease&#xD;
           control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall&#xD;
           survival (OS) and Quality of Life (QOL) on sintilimab in subjects with CUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation between biomarkers in tumor tissue and efficacy, including&#xD;
           but not restricted to PD-L1 expression level, transcriptome sequencing, single-cell&#xD;
           sequencing, and multicolor immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation between biomarkers in peripheral blood and drug efficacy,&#xD;
           including but not restricted to soluble PD-L1, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and&#xD;
           cytokine analyses.&#xD;
