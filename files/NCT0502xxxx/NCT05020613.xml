  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was aimed to investigate the need for urinary retention and recatheterization in the&#xD;
      postoperative period by removing the urinary catheter in patients undergoing low anterior&#xD;
      resection, in the early or late period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary catheter is placed before abdominal surgery to increase visualization during the&#xD;
      operation, prevent bladder injury and provide perioperative urine output monitoring. It is&#xD;
      especially useful in patients who will undergo low anterior resection, with a high risk of&#xD;
      nerve damage and consequent urinary retention and bladder dysfunction. Urinary catheter&#xD;
      removal time differs between operations. Traditionally, the urinary catheter is kept in place&#xD;
      for 7 days because urinary retention occurs in some patients whose urinary catheter is&#xD;
      displaced in the early period. As the urinary catheter retention time increases, the risk of&#xD;
      urinary tract infection also increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the current ERAS protocol, it is recommended to remove the urinary catheter 48&#xD;
      hours after the surgery in patients who have undergone colorectal surgery and are treated&#xD;
      with epidural pain management. However, the ERAS protocol is not specific to patients who&#xD;
      have undergone low anterior resection, which is the main point of our study and includes all&#xD;
      patients who have undergone colorectal surgery. Most authors still believe that prolonged&#xD;
      retention of the urinary catheter will prevent urinary retention and long-term bladder&#xD;
      dysfunction. In a randomized controlled study (published in 1999) that we encountered during&#xD;
      our own literature search, early removal of the urinary catheter was associated with&#xD;
      increased urinary retention [2]. In recent studies, some authors have associated the early&#xD;
      removal of the urinary catheter with increased urinary retention [3], while others claimed&#xD;
      the opposite and reported contradictory results [4]. Advances in laparoscopic techniques have&#xD;
      made it possible to visualize the hypogastric and pelvic nerves (nerves associated with&#xD;
      urinary functions) during surgery. In addition to these developments, dissections on&#xD;
      embryonic planes and tumor reduction with neoadjuvant chemotherapy protect these nerves&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
