  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the experiment is to analyze the impact of the behavior of the accompanying parent&#xD;
      on the behavior of the child during a first dental session according to the age group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      I will receive the children for consultation at the CHU Saint Pierre - César de Paepe site,&#xD;
      to assess the impact of parents' behavior on the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, I will make a first contact with the child in the waiting room using the CORAH scale&#xD;
      (self-assessment based on diagrams) which will allow him to assess his temperament in the&#xD;
      face of dental care. . Then, I will have the parents / caregiver sign informed consent and&#xD;
      authorization to film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the child enters the practice, the video recording will be initiated: the installation&#xD;
      on the seat, the confidence building and the care provided will be filmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These videos will then be analyzed by several practitioners from different categories&#xD;
      (experts in pedodontics, general dentists, dental students, etc.) using the Venham&#xD;
      hetero-assessment scale modified for the behavior of the child and of a scale of parental&#xD;
      cooperation. These practitioners will be selected via the ADUB (association of dentists of&#xD;
      Université Libre de Bruxelles) and some of them could be external to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this study, the results obtained will be described and statistically analyzed.&#xD;

        60 patients presenting for the first time to the pediatric dentistry consultation at the&#xD;
        CHU Saint-Pierre - César de Paepe site were selected for this study between. 3 groups of 20&#xD;
        children, respectively aged 4 and under, 5 to 6 years old and over 7 years old, were&#xD;
        formed.67 children participated in this study. They were divided into 3 groups according to&#xD;
        their age (4 years and under, 5 to 6 years and 7 years and over). During the search, 7&#xD;
        patients were excluded: due to the image rights not granted. The data were collected and&#xD;
        analyzed by 2 observers. Then a randomization took place thus creating a sample of 15&#xD;
        children divided into 3 same groups. The data were collected and analyzed by 20&#xD;
        practitioner observers&#xD;
