      This retrospective study was conducted on patients with frontal sinus leaks came to ENT&#xD;
      departments of Al-Azhar University Hospital, New Damietta, Egypt, for a period of five years.&#xD;

      All patients in this study were evaluated during the follow-up period. Patients' age, sex,&#xD;
      occupation, residence, and telephone number were recorded for each participant for&#xD;
      demographic purposes. General and local examinations were also performed preoperatively as&#xD;
      usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history, surgical approach, leakage site, complications, reconstruction technique,&#xD;
      and follow-up were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases were treated by endonasal endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete sphenoethmoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Draf type IIa, IIb, and III according to defect location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defect less than 3 mm closed by a plug of fat and facia lata or middle turbinate mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defect more than 3 mm closed by underlying facia lata, underlying cartilage, and overlay&#xD;
           facia lata.&#xD;
