    <textblock>
      The identification of transnosographic dimensions constituted by cognitive disorders&#xD;
      constitutes a particularly promising avenue for classifying psychiatric disorders in a more&#xD;
      precise and personalized manner. However, despite interesting preliminary data, there is no&#xD;
      exhaustive phenotyping of the different cognitive disorders in large samples where all severe&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders are represented. Moreover, the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive&#xD;
      disorders remain poorly understood, whereas their identification would allow a better&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders as well as the identification of&#xD;
      potential therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators will compare cognitive-behavioral performance in patients with&#xD;
      different types of severe psychiatric disorders (psychotic disorders, depressive disorders,&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders and eating disorders) and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers to identify specific and shared cognitive alterations between the&#xD;
      different severe psychiatric disorders. In addition, the investigators will compare&#xD;
      neurophysiological cognitive data in to identify alterations in neurophysiological cognitive&#xD;
      mechanisms that are specific to and shared between the different severe psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include 180 patients suffering from a severe psychiatric disorder&#xD;
      (psychotic disorder, mood disorder (depressive and bipolar disorders), anxiety disorder,&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder and eating disorder) and benefiting from cognitive phenotyping&#xD;
      (neuropsychological assessment and possibly EEG) as part of the initial assessment for a&#xD;
      severe psychiatric disorder. In parallel, the investigators will include 180 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers The different variables corresponding to the judgment criteria will be compared&#xD;
      between the groups by being included as dependent variables in mixed linear regression models&#xD;
      (ANOVA; or KRUSKAL-WALLIS if non-parametric) with the group as independent factor, time&#xD;
      (before, after treatment) and type of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow the constitution of a transnosographic atlas of neuro-cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in different psychiatric pathologies.&#xD;

      -  Context : The identification of transnosographic dimensions constituted by cognitive&#xD;
           disorders constitutes a particularly promising avenue for classifying psychiatric&#xD;
           disorders in a more precise and personalized manner. However, despite interesting&#xD;
           preliminary data, there is no exhaustive phenotyping of the different cognitive&#xD;
           disorders in large samples where all severe psychiatric disorders are represented.&#xD;
           Moreover, the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive disorders remain poorly understood,&#xD;
           whereas their identification would allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology&#xD;
           of these disorders as well as the identification of potential therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method: Research involving the human being, prospective observational, monocentric (CHU&#xD;
           Grenoble Alpes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main objective : to compare cognitive-behavioral performance in patients with different&#xD;
           types of severe psychiatric disorders (psychotic disorders, depressive disorders,&#xD;
           bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders and eating disorders) and&#xD;
           healthy volunteers to identify specific and shared cognitive alterations between the&#xD;
           different severe psychiatric disorders. The primary outcome is the comparison of&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioral performance composite scores corresponding to response rates (in %)&#xD;
           for each cognitive dimension between the different severe psychiatric disorder groups&#xD;
           and the healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective 1: The first secondary objective of PSYCOG is to compare&#xD;
           neurophysiological cognitive data in patients with different types of severe psychiatric&#xD;
           disorders (psychotic disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, anxiety&#xD;
           disorders, autism spectrum disorders and eating disorders) and healthy volunteers to&#xD;
           identify alterations in neurophysiological cognitive mechanisms that are specific to and&#xD;
           shared between the different severe psychiatric disorders. Outcome will be the&#xD;
           comparison of neurophysiological data from EEG recordings (evoked potentials, spectral&#xD;
           dynamics, and brain source) recorded simultaneously with the performance of behavioral&#xD;
           tasks for each cognitive dimension between the different severe psychiatric disorder&#xD;
           groups and healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective 2: The second secondary objective of PSYCOG is to compare cognitive&#xD;
           behavioral performance before and after treatments recommended and routinely prescribed&#xD;
           to patients evaluated for a severe psychiatric disorder (psychotropic drug treatment,&#xD;
           non-invasive neurostimulation, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, depending on the case)&#xD;
           within the different groups of patients with severe psychiatric disorders. Outcome will&#xD;
           be the comparison of behavioral data (response rates, reaction times, modeling&#xD;
           parameters) from neuropsychological tests before and after treatment (up to + 6 months)&#xD;
           in the different groups of patients with severe psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective 3: The third secondary objective of PSYCOG is to compare the&#xD;
           neurophysiological cognitive data associated with cognitive behavioral tests before and&#xD;
           after treatments recommended and routinely practiced in patients evaluated for a severe&#xD;
           psychiatric disorder (psychotropic drug treatment, non-invasive neurostimulation,&#xD;
           psychotherapy, psychoeducation as the case may be) within the different groups of&#xD;
           patients with severe psychiatric disorder. Outcome will be the comparison of&#xD;
           neurophysiological data obtained from EEG recordings (evoked potentials, spectral&#xD;
           dynamics and brain source) associated with behavioral tests before and after treatment&#xD;
           (up to + 6 months) in the different groups of patients with severe psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Procedure: After the patient / healthy volunteer has been informed about the study and&#xD;
           has not objected to participating during a routine consultation, the patient / healthy&#xD;
           volunteer will be included in the study. Cognitive tests will be collected as part of&#xD;
           the patient's usual follow-up according to the pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistics: The different variables corresponding to the judgment criteria will be&#xD;
           compared between the groups by being included as dependent variables in mixed linear&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive disorders are attested at the behavioral level by the psychologist specialized in neuropsychology who makes the patient take a standardized battery of specific psychometric tests. This assessment thus makes it possible to obtain behavioral data such as reaction time, error rates and modeling parameters.&#xD;
The electroencephalogram (EEG) consists of collecting the signal of the brain's bioelectrical activity by means of electrodes placed on the scalp. The EEG is used to determine the cerebral functioning underlying cognitive functions by performing it simultaneously with the behavioral tasks of the neuropsychological assessment, thus obtaining a neurophysiological phenotyping of cognitive disorders.</description>
