  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is stratified cluster randomized trial (Phase 1) and prospective cohort study and&#xD;
      NASH registry (Phase 2). The study population will include adults with T2D and presumed&#xD;
      advanced NASH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-centered, stratified cluster randomized controlled, open-labeled&#xD;
      two-phase study. Clusters will be independent LMC clinic sites with patients as participants.&#xD;
      The use of the stratified cluster randomization design will help prevent the potential for&#xD;
      cross-contamination of screening methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two phases. For Phase 1, study participants who meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria undergo NASH screening. Everything, other than routineness of screening, is&#xD;
      maintained the same in both the groups. The screening intervention received is determined by&#xD;
      the site of the participant's provider. All participants enrolled undergo biochemical&#xD;
      screening. In Phase 2, all participants, regardless of randomization, meeting biochemical&#xD;
      cut-offs (FIB-4 index &gt;2.67 or NFS &gt;0.675) will undergo FibroScans at Phase 2 initiation and&#xD;
      at the 36-month follow-up visit. Clinical data and a health-related quality of life&#xD;
      assessment are collected at baseline and 36 months. A prospective NASH registry will be&#xD;
      created from the participant data collected in Phase 2.&#xD;

    <description>Change in health-related quality of life determined by the chronic liver disease questionnaire for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (CLDQ-NASH) calculated as total CLDQ-NASH score at 36 months minus CLDQ-NASH score at baseline among participants with stage F3-F4 compared to stage F0-F2. The CLDQ-NASH instrument includes 36 items grouped into six domains: abdominal symptoms; activity/energy; emotional health; fatigue; systemic symptoms; and worry. The average of the domain scores (min: 1, max: 7) yields the total CLDQ-NASH score. The minimum possible total score is 1 and the maximum possible total score is 7, with a higher total score indicating a better outcome. A greater change in CLDQ-NASH score at 36-months from baseline would indicate a greater improvement in health-related quality of life.</description>
