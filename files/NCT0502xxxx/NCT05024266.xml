  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy has shown good efficacy and safety in clinical&#xD;
      studies of lung adenocarcinoma (RATIONALE 304) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (RATIONALE&#xD;
      307), thus has been approved as the first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) in China. However, there is no data in the field of neoadjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      NSCLC. This single-arm, single-center phase II clinical study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and major pathological response (MPR) of Tislelizumab combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with stage IIIA-IIIB (N2) lung squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Biomarkers correlated with efficacy outcomes will also be explored.&#xD;

      Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy has shown good efficacy and safety in clinical&#xD;
      studies of lung adenocarcinoma (RATIONALE 304) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (RATIONALE&#xD;
      307), thus has been approved as the first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) in China. However, there is no data in the field of neoadjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      NSCLC. This single-arm, single-center phase II clinical study intends to enroll about 30&#xD;
      patients with potentially operable lung squamous cell carcinoma with clinical stages&#xD;
      IIIA-IIIB (N2). Participants will intravenously receive tislelizumab (BeiGene, 200mg d1) +&#xD;
      albumin paclitaxel 260mg/m2 d1 + carboplatin AUC 5 d1, Q3W, Imaging evaluation is performed&#xD;
      after 2 cycles of medication, and the feasibility of surgery is discussed in multiple&#xD;
      disciplines. If the evaluation is operable, the lesion will be surgically removed 22-40 days&#xD;
      after the last treatment. If it is assessed to be reduced but still inoperable, the original&#xD;
      plan will be continued for another cycle. Imaging examinations, tissue NGS (whole-exome&#xD;
      sequencing), gene expression profiling (GEP), and PD-L1 expression will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, preoperative and postoperative respectively.&#xD;
