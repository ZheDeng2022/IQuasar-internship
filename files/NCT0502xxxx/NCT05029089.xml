      Regeneration of periodontal tissues is the primary goal of periodontal surgery regenerative&#xD;
      procedures. Both resorbable and nonresorbable barrier membranes have been widely used to&#xD;
      receive periodontal regeneration, as well as different types of biomaterial have been&#xD;
      investigated. Enamel matrix derivative (EMD, Emdogain, Straumann) become popular for&#xD;
      periodontal regeneration, especially that membrane exposure due to bacterial contamination&#xD;
      may deteriorate periodontal regeneration and wound healing especially in the interproximal&#xD;
      areas. Hence different surgical procedures have been proposed to preserve interdental&#xD;
      papilla. Most techniques include an incision of the interdental papilla associated with&#xD;
      defect. That may impair the volume and integrity of interdental tissues. Azzi et al. proposed&#xD;
      a novel technique (Entire Papilla Preservation Technique, EPPT) for bone regeneration to&#xD;
      secure the integrity of interdental papillae by providing a tunnel- like undermining&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completely preserved papillae improve wound healing process, stabilize the blood clot and&#xD;
      the volume of interdental tissue. EMD and bone substitutes (allograft) are applied in the&#xD;
      defect to promote periodontal regeneration. By using subepithelial connective tissue graft&#xD;
      (sCTG) better quality (thickness) of soft tissue can be achieved. This clinical report&#xD;
      describes surgical approach using modified papilla preservation technique for regenerative&#xD;
      periodontal therapy. This study will search for differences in regeneration therapy of&#xD;
      isolated interdental intrabony between Modified Entire Papilla Preservation Technique (MEPPT)&#xD;
      alone and combined with EMD, demineralised freeze- dried bone allograft and sCTG. Moreover&#xD;
      the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical applicability and one- year outcomes in&#xD;
      the regenerative treatment of isolated deep intrabony defects.&#xD;

    <description>Procedure: The surgical site was anesthetized with articaine-epinephrine. After buccal intracervicular incision on vestibular aspects of two teeth surrounding the intrabony defect, a beveled vertical releasing incision was made in the buccal gingiva of the tooth affected by the intrabony defect, on the opposite site to the intrabony defect and extended beyond the mucogingival line to provide access to the intrabony defect. A buccal full thickness mucoperiosteal flap extending from the vertical incision to the defect-associated papilla and neigboring tooth was elevated (subperiosteal tunnel). Interdental tunnel under the papillary tissue was elevated to the lingual bone crest. Granulation tissue and calculus from the inner aspect of interdental papilla was removed. Microsurgical suturing technique with 7-0 materials was performed. Vertical incision was closed with simple single sutures, whereas due to modification of the original technique additional sling suture was applied.</description>
