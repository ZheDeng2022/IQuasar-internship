  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the clinical study is to study the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity&#xD;
      indicators of the EpiVacCorona vaccine, with the involvement of volunteers aged 60 years and&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research tasks are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the safety of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice&#xD;
           intramuscularly, with the participation of volunteers aged 60 years and older;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the reactogenicity of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice&#xD;
           intramuscularly, with the participation of volunteers aged 60 years and older;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify any adverse effects to the administration of the vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the humoral and cellular immune responses response following two doses of the&#xD;
           EpiVacCorona vaccine, with the participation of volunteers aged 60 and older.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will screen a maximum of 180 volunteers, of which it is proposed to include and&#xD;
      randomize 150 men and women aged 60 years and older who meet the inclusion criteria and who&#xD;
      do not have the exclusion criteria whose data will be used for subsequent safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 150 volunteers will be vaccinated with the EpiVacCorona vaccine with two doses spaced 21&#xD;
      days apart, intramuscularly, at a dose of 0.5 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be administered in procedure room settings only by a highly qualified&#xD;
      specialist (vaccinator).&#xD;
