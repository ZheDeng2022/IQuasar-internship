    <textblock>
      Initially, it was suspected that Covid-19 would primarily affect the airways, but several&#xD;
      studies have now shown that it is a disease with multisystem manifestations. Covid-19 has the&#xD;
      potential to affect physical, cognitive, and psychological functions in multiple ways. It has&#xD;
      been clear that a significant proportion of patients with Covid-19 develop long-term&#xD;
      symptoms. The term post-acute Covid-19 syndrome (PACS) is now used to describe the wide range&#xD;
      of prolonged symptoms following the infection. Patients who have been in hospital for&#xD;
      Covid-19 for a long time may need specialized rehabilitation, however, also non-hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with mild symptoms may need specific rehabilitation to be able to meet the complex&#xD;
      symptoms and problems that may arise. Previous studies on the recovery and rehabilitation&#xD;
      after other coronavirus shows the importance to develop tailored interventions so that these&#xD;
      patients receive appropriate rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training on adult&#xD;
      patients with PACS and decreased respiratory muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial will be used. A total of 90 adult patients with PACS and 80 %&#xD;
      or less of predicted value in inspiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory pressure) will&#xD;
      be eligible for enrollment. Patients will be randomized either to an intervention group or a&#xD;
      control group. The intervention will consist of inspiratory muscle training performed twice&#xD;
      daily for 8 weeks. This will be combined with an 8-week physical exercise training program.&#xD;
      The control group will perform the same physical exercise training according to standard&#xD;
      care. All measurements will be performed at baseline and after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is maximal inspiratory pressure. Secondary outcomes are: Maximal expiratory&#xD;
      pressure, pulmonary function, physical capacity, physical activity, respiratory status and&#xD;
      symptoms, health-related quality of life, work ability, fatigue, self-reported outcome&#xD;
      measure of physical function and voice function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 has the potential to affect physical, cognitive, and psychological functions in&#xD;
      multiple ways and lead to a negative impact on quality of life in the long-term perspective.&#xD;
      Therefore, development of a rehabilitation program with specific tailored interventions will&#xD;
      be necessary to improve physical and psychological function, as well as health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and work ability.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
      So far (August 2021), there are over 1 100 000 confirmed cases and over 14 000 deaths in&#xD;
      Sweden. Initially, it was suspected that Covid-19 would primarily affect the airways, but&#xD;
      several studies have now shown that it is a disease with multisystem manifestations. The&#xD;
      impact of the virus ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe and life-threatening&#xD;
      disease that can affect the cardiac, renal gastrointestinal, nervous, endocrine, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal systems. Therefore, Covid-19 has the potential to affect physical, cognitive,&#xD;
      and psychological functions in multiple ways. It has been clear that a significant proportion&#xD;
      of patients with Covid-19 develop long-term symptoms. Signs and symptoms may arise from any&#xD;
      system in the body, often with significant overlap, and may develop over time. The term post-&#xD;
      acute Covid-19 syndrome (PACS) is now used to describe the wide range of prolonged symptoms&#xD;
      following the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue, decreased physical and psychological function have been reported in the initial&#xD;
      recovery phase, but still little is known on the long-term consequences. Patients who have&#xD;
      been in hospital for Covid-19 for a long time may need specialized rehabilitation, however,&#xD;
      also non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms may need specific rehabilitation to be able&#xD;
      to meet the complex symptoms and problems that may arise. Previous studies on the recovery&#xD;
      and rehabilitation after other coronavirus shows the importance to develop tailored&#xD;
      interventions so that these patients receive appropriate rehabilitation with a&#xD;
      multi-professional approach throughout the whole care chain. Some studies suggest that the&#xD;
      rehabilitation should be similar to pulmonary rehabilitation, but since a lot of patients&#xD;
      often have symptoms from different organ systems this is not yet fully investigated and needs&#xD;
      to be addressed from different perspectives. A study by Liu et al (2020), showed that 6 weeks&#xD;
      of physical exercise and respiratory muscle training improved lung function and physical&#xD;
      capacity compared to a control group in elderly patients after Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Karolinska University Hospital there is a specialized multidisciplinary and&#xD;
      multi-professional approach aiming to follow up patients who have been hospitalized. However,&#xD;
      from mid-2020 and onwards, referrals from primary care have significantly increased. This&#xD;
      includes patients who have never been hospitalized but with varying symptoms from several&#xD;
      organs that have lasted for more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a bigger research project (ReCoV) and is integrated with the clinical&#xD;
      follow-up and linked research project of patients who have been hospitalized or referred from&#xD;
      primary care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The overall hypothesis of the hole research project is that physical and&#xD;
      physiological function, work ability and HRQoL are important factors for recovery after&#xD;
      Covid-19 which can be improved by individual tailored rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on&#xD;
      physical and psychological function, work ability and HRQoL in patients with decreased&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength after Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of IMT, a randomized controlled trial design will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PACS above 18 years old (N=90) with 80% or less of predicted value in maximal&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) are eligible for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment before the intervention period will be performed at an outpatient visit&#xD;
      at Karolinska university hospital. After baseline assessment participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to either an intervention group or to an active control group using random permuted blocks.&#xD;
      The intervention will take place at the physiotherapy outpatient clinic at the hospital or at&#xD;
      a primary care facility and in the participants' homes. The intervention group will perform&#xD;
      IMT twice daily (two sets of 30 receptions) at home during 8 weeks with a resistance of 20-50&#xD;
      % of MIP using an inspiratory muscle trainer (Threshold or digital advice). Follow-up of&#xD;
      execution and increase in intensity during IMT will be conducted weekly by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist. This will be combined with an 8-week physical exercise program including&#xD;
      aerobic, strength and mobility exercises which will be performed at the care facility and at&#xD;
      home at least two times a week. The active control group will perform the same physical&#xD;
      exercise program according to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will be performed at baseline and after the intervention period (8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and secondary outcomes are: maximal&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (MEP), lung function, physical capacity (6-min walk test), Chair stand&#xD;
      test, physical activity, respiratory status and symptoms, health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      work ability, fatigue, self-reported outcome measure of physical function and voice function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be described with mean (standard deviation), median (inter-quartile range) and&#xD;
      proportion and analyzed with parametric and non-parametric methods depending on data level.&#xD;
      All voice recordings will be assessed by a group of speech and language pathologists all&#xD;
      experts on voice disorders. The longitudinal group variations will be analyzed using Linear&#xD;
      Mixed Models that in addition to studying change at the group level also can model change on&#xD;
      the individual level. In addition, the method can handle dependency for repeated observations&#xD;
      and provide correct estimates with missing data. To detect differences of 10% in the MIP a&#xD;
      calculation of 36 patients in each group plus 25% drop-out in the power analyses, which lead&#xD;
      to 45 participants in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 has the potential to affect physical, cognitive, and psychological functions in&#xD;
      multiple ways and lead to a negative impact on quality of life in the long-term perspective.&#xD;
      Therefore, development of a rehabilitation program with specific tailored interventions will&#xD;
      be necessary to improve physical and psychological function, as well as health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and work ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 is a new disease and large knowledge gaps need to be filled. Previous studies&#xD;
      indicate that the patients are affected at several levels and a rehabilitation period is&#xD;
      necessary. It is of great importance that data is collected systematically and standardized.&#xD;
      If significant effects occur, the possibility to generalize the results to other individuals&#xD;
      with Covid-19, are promising. The physical interventions may thus improve the ability to&#xD;
      adjust to the implications of Covid-19, which can potentially have significant health&#xD;
      economic effects. For example, the interventions may prolong patients' meaningful activities&#xD;
      of daily living and their ability to return to their previous workplaces (conduct their&#xD;
      professions). This project will deepen the knowledge about the effects of specialized&#xD;
      rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has been approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. The participants will&#xD;
      receive verbal and written information about the study and informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from all participants.&#xD;
