  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of LACTIN-V, a vaginally administered live&#xD;
      biotherapeutic product (LBP) that contains the human L. crispatus CTV-05 strain, on the&#xD;
      vaginal microbiome of Lactobacillus-deficient young women in the South African FRESH study&#xD;
      who are at high risk for HIV acquisition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the vaginal live biotherapeutic&#xD;
      product LACTIN-V in 60 young South African women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all participants giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be enrolled if they meet eligibility criteria. At enrollment on Day 1,&#xD;
      they will start a 7-day course of standard oral metronidazole treatment for bacterial&#xD;
      vaginosis. Women who completed their metronidazole treatment will be randomized 2:1 to&#xD;
      LACTIN-V vs. placebo. Within 8-48 hours of the final metronidazole dose, women will receive&#xD;
      the study product for five consecutive days, followed by twice weekly for three additional&#xD;
      weeks. Women will be followed during the dosing (4 weeks) and post-dosing phase (4 weeks) for&#xD;
      a total of 64 days.&#xD;
