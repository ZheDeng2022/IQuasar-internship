  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is to discover the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab combined&#xD;
      with pyrotinib in treating advanced breast cancer with HER2 positive, which is detected by&#xD;
      digital PCR. It is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the Response rate (RR) and progression-free survival(PFS) and safety of&#xD;
           patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer who received trastuzumab combined with&#xD;
           pyrotinib in positive plasma HER2 amplification detected by digital PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the potential using of digital PCR in recurrent and metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
