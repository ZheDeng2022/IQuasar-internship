      The investigators wish to set up a pharmaco-epidemiological cohort within the Hospital&#xD;
      Territorial Groups of the Cévennes-Gard Camargue, East-Hérault and Haute-Garonne and West&#xD;
      Tarn on a specific population, patients undergoing immunotherapy for cancer, as currently&#xD;
      there is no data available under &quot;real life&quot; conditions following anti-COVID vaccination19.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients undergoing immunotherapy will not develop more&#xD;
      vaccine-related adverse events than those observed in the efficacy and safety validation&#xD;
      studies of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19, mRNA-1273 SARS CoV-2, Oxford/AstraZeneca and&#xD;
      Ad26COV2.S, JMJ Vaccine or J &amp; J COVID-19 Vaccine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recent outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new zoonotic coronavirus&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 poses a major public health threat, with at least 100,000,000 people infected&#xD;
      worldwide by the end of January 2021 and over 2 million deaths. Given the scale of the&#xD;
      pandemic, it has become imperative to quickly develop a vaccine and over 30 vaccine&#xD;
      candidates have entered clinical evaluation. The first vaccine to receive marketing&#xD;
      authorization in Europe and France was an mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty® (Bnt162b2;&#xD;
      Pfizer/BioNtech). In a Phase III study of 43,448 participants, after a median follow-up of 2&#xD;
      months, the number of cases of COVID-19 was 8 in the vaccine arm vs. versus 162 in the&#xD;
      placebo arm, respectively, with 1 versus 9 serious cases (Polack et al. 2020). Adverse events&#xD;
      occurred in more than 50% of vaccinated participants and included local reactions as well as&#xD;
      frequent systemic reactogenicity such as fatigue and headache. Fever occurred in about 15% of&#xD;
      the participants who received the vaccine. The second vaccine to be licensed was also an mRNA&#xD;
      vaccine: the Moderna COVID-19 mRNA (nucleoside modified) vaccine (mRNA-1273, Moderna). A&#xD;
      Phase III trial involving 30,420 volunteers reported efficacy and safety comparable to the&#xD;
      Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine. A severe form of COVID-19 occurred in 30 subjects, with one death;&#xD;
      all 30 cases were in the placebo group. Moderate and transient reactogenicity after&#xD;
      vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events were rare and the incidence was similar in both groups. Within the&#xD;
      vaccination strategy implemented on a national level, the Comirnaty® vaccine&#xD;
      (Pfizer/BioNtech) and the Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) may be used&#xD;
      interchangeably, depending on logistical constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several weeks now, the Oxford-AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine ChAdOx1&#xD;
      nCoV-19 (AZD1222) has been available in France and its efficacy and safety of use have been&#xD;
      evaluated. Also the non-replicating viral vector (adenovirus) vaccine for CVD 19 from Janssen&#xD;
      Laboratories (a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson; other names: Ad26COV2.S; JMJ Vaccine or J &amp;&#xD;
      J COVID-19 Vaccine) was launched in France a few weeks ago. Its efficacy and safety have been&#xD;
      validated in a phase III trial. A number of other candidate vaccines using various techniques&#xD;
      such as mRNA, protein subunit, viral vector or inactivated vaccines are currently under&#xD;
      investigation and will be available soon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients are particularly at risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19. Patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors appear to be at a greater risk, particularly in the first year after&#xD;
      diagnosis. Severity and mortality rates in the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19)&#xD;
      registry and other cohorts range from 5% to 61% (a meta-analysis showed 26%), which is well&#xD;
      above the general population. Although data on vaccination in cancer patients are limited,&#xD;
      there is sufficient evidence to support anti-infective vaccination in general, even in cancer&#xD;
      patients on immunosuppressive therapy. In its notice dated January 25th, 2021, the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute defined its recommendations for prioritizing cancer patients for vaccination&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-2. This report stresses that the data acquired from science is limited in&#xD;
      quantity and quality concerning the emerging field of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and even&#xD;
      more so in sub-populations including cancer patients. It reminds us that the challenge&#xD;
      remains to vaccinate the entire population of patients who have or have had cancer, i.e.&#xD;
      approximately 3.8 million people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of efficacy can be expected to be generally reduced in certain cancer patient&#xD;
      populations with intense immunosuppression, such as haematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      recipients. However, based on extrapolation of data from other vaccines and the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of COVID-19 (non-live) vaccines, it is conceivable that the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination could be estimated to be similar to that of non-cancer patients,&#xD;
      although data from clinical trials are lacking. The efficacy and duration of immunity in&#xD;
      cancer patients is still unknown and unexplored. It is therefore legitimate to propose&#xD;
      surveillance through dedicated registries and clinical trials. Furthermore, close monitoring&#xD;
      and follow-up of cancer patients is required after COVID-19 vaccination to assess potential&#xD;
      adverse events and measure clinical outcomes, e.g. infection, severity and mortality from&#xD;
      COVID-19, cancer complications etc… The investigators wish to set up a&#xD;
      pharmaco-epidemiological cohort within the Hospital Territorial Groups of the Cévennes-Gard&#xD;
      Camargue, East-Hérault and Haute-Garonne and West Tarn on a specific population, patients&#xD;
      undergoing immunotherapy for cancer, as currently there is no data available under &quot;real&#xD;
      life&quot; conditions following anti-COVID vaccination19. Our hypothesis is that patients&#xD;
      undergoing immunotherapy will not develop more vaccine-related adverse events than those&#xD;
      observed in the efficacy and safety validation studies of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19,&#xD;
      mRNA-1273 SARS CoV-2, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Ad26COV2.S, JMJ Vaccine or J &amp; J COVID-19&#xD;
      Vaccine.&#xD;
