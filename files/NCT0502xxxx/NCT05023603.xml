  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compressive peripheral neuropathy, characterized by pain,&#xD;
      tingling sensation and paresthesia in the territory of the median nerve, symptoms modulated&#xD;
      by psychosocial factors (eg, catastrophic thinking, depression, anxiety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine those psychological and social components that&#xD;
      influence the symptoms and function of patients with CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational cross-sectional design will be performed in patients with CTS. The patients&#xD;
      will be selected consecutively in two hospitals of the South East Metropolitan Health Service&#xD;
      (Santiago, Chile). The study variables will include: Perception of pain using the Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS), the extent of symptoms will be evaluated using the Katz diagram;&#xD;
      Functional assessment using the abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder&#xD;
      and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH); Catastrophic thinking as a response to pain using the&#xD;
      Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), fear of movement using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia&#xD;
      (TSK-11), and emotional state was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
      (HADS). Both are valid and reliable measures used to evaluate the influence of psychosocial&#xD;
      factors in patients with CTS. Individual subject factors including duration of symptoms, type&#xD;
      of work (desk / non-desk), BMI, age, gender, educational level and economic income will be&#xD;
      collected through an interview process.&#xD;
