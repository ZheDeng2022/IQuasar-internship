  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterised by long standing difficulty in&#xD;
      managing emotional responses, personal relationships, impulse control and self-image. Many&#xD;
      adolescents and young people with complex needs and high suicide risk are left&#xD;
      under-diagnosed and untreated. The overall aim of the study is to assess the possibility of&#xD;
      providing a treatment programme for young people with BPD symptoms in the general population,&#xD;
      who may or may not be accessing any mental health services.&#xD;

      This project is the first step in testing a new intervention programme, called BRIDGE (Brief,&#xD;
      Intensive Assessment and Integrated Formulation), for young people early in the course of&#xD;
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The BRIDGE Project will help the investigators find&#xD;
      out whether they can do a much bigger study in the future that will tell them whether BRIDGE&#xD;
      works well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPD is characterised by long standing difficulty in managing emotional responses, personal&#xD;
      relationships, impulse control and self-image. Research shows that individuals with BPD may&#xD;
      experience discrimination and resulting stigmatisation by both the public and health care&#xD;
      professionals. Many adolescents and young people with complex needs and high suicide risk are&#xD;
      left under-diagnosed and untreated. As a result, young people with BPD are frequently not in&#xD;
      education or training and experience challenging relationships with friends and families. The&#xD;
      overall aim of the study is to assess the possibility of providing a treatment programme for&#xD;
      young people with BPD symptoms in the general population, who may or may not be accessing any&#xD;
      mental health services. First, the investigators need to see whether young people are&#xD;
      comfortable with random allocation to BRIDGE (AND service as usual) or Service-as-usual&#xD;
      (ALONE) (a bit like tossing a coin). Second, the investigators need to find out whether&#xD;
      enough young people want to be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, whether the investigators can find out the information they need about them and can&#xD;
      follow up enough young people later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will try to find these things out, so that the investigators can design a&#xD;
      future, bigger, study to find out whether BRIDGE is good value for young people with BPD.&#xD;

    <description>The brief, intensive assessment and integrated formulation (BRIDGE) intervention is delivered over 3-6 months and has a three-fold focus: Firstly, an intensive (post-randomisation) assessment, taking up to two sessions, including BPD symptoms, co-presenting difficulties, neurodevelopmental profile, life events history and psychosocial functional impact. Secondly, up to 16 sessions of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT). Thirdly, development of a shared formulation with a multi-agency group; further development of the shared formulation with the young person, using CAT principles (Reformulation, Recognition and Revision) and, where clinically applicable, their family and service-providers.</description>

    <description>For participants randomised to Service-As-Usual (SAU), a routine letter of their participation will be shared with their service provider(s), including the GP. SAU, likely to range from social services, mentalhealth services, forensic services to no intervention will be mapped and described for each participant. Treatment fidelity to SAU will therefore not be assessed, but the nature and intensity of SAU in different contexts will be described in detail through the qualitative process evaluation.</description>
