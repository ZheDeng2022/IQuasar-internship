  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diseases are a challenging process that affects human life physiologically and&#xD;
      psychologically. Chronic Renal Failure, which shows a significant increase in the world and&#xD;
      in our country, also affects human life in every aspect. Hemodialysis treatment is used with&#xD;
      a high rate in the treatment of patients diagnosed with End Stage Renal Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis patients experience loneliness and hopelessness during their difficult and&#xD;
      compulsory treatmet. Fear of being alone is an important problem affecting the patient's&#xD;
      compliance with treatment. In addition, the other problem these patients experience is&#xD;
      hopelessness. Hopelessness is an important factor that affects the patient's expectations for&#xD;
      the future and the process of solving problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic touch is a complementary and alternative treatment method. It is stated that this&#xD;
      treatment method, which is successfully used by nurses, is good for loneliness and&#xD;
      hopelessness. This method, which will be used on hemodialysis patients, is aimed to get away&#xD;
      from the problems of loneliness and hopelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, two scales will be used to measure the loneliness and hopelessness levels of&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. Patients will fill in UCLA Loneliness Scale and BECK Hopelessness&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses should not ignore the problems of loneliness and hopelessness in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. Therapeutic touch treatment method wil lprovide nurses the holistic caregiver role&#xD;
      for the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness experienced by the patients. When the&#xD;
      literature is scanned, this study is unique because it has not been done before on&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Scales are filled after 3 days of application.</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by Russell et al. in 1980, the UCLA Loneliness Scale consists of 20 items, 10 of which are straight and 10 of which are reversed. Each item is scored between 1-4. While calculating the loneliness score, the calculation is made by taking the reverse of the scores given to the items used adversely. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 80, and the lowest score is 20. Higher scores indicate that individuals experience more loneliness.</description>
