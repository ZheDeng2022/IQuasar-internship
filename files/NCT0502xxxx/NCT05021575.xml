      Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) affected the health care systems all around the world.&#xD;
      The collateral damage of the pandemic on the cardiovascular (CV) care and CV mortality has&#xD;
      been noticed and reported early. In Lithuania, first quarantine measurements were introduced&#xD;
      on 16th March and lifted on 16th June of 2020, limiting contact appointments to urgent care&#xD;
      only. This led to a substantial proportion of routine cardiovascular appointments, diagnostic&#xD;
      and therapeutic procedures being cancelled and greatly limited the availability of&#xD;
      cardiovascular care. The prognostic impact of this has not been appropriately analysed. Also,&#xD;
      comprehensive analyses of the changes in national CV services, including outpatient care and&#xD;
      hospitalisations and CV mortality, during different periods of the pandemic (during first and&#xD;
      second waves and in between) are scarce. The objectives of this population-based study were:&#xD;
      (1) to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CV care (2) to compare rates of&#xD;
      outpatient care visits and hospitalisations of cardiovascular patients in different periods&#xD;
      of 2019 and 2020 (3) to compare the rates of CV mortality in Lithuania in different periods&#xD;
      of 2019 and 2020 (4) to investigate sex and age differences in CV care and CV mortality&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the world and changed health care in almost every&#xD;
      country. During the spring of 2020, first pandemic wave was of different scale in different&#xD;
      countries. In countries affected by the virus the most, a majority of the studies focused on&#xD;
      the direct impact of COVID-19 on community health. It was noticed promptly that the novel&#xD;
      virus is especially high-risk for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the collateral damage of COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of cardiovascular (CV) care and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality was also reported early in several nationwide and selected cohort&#xD;
      studies. The research was mostly focused on acute cardiovascular conditions; changes in&#xD;
      hospital admissions and early mortality after myocardial infarction were also often analysed.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, a substantial proportion of routine appointments, diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures was cancelled. Data on the changes in total national CV services, including out-&#xD;
      and in-patient health care facilities, acute and chronic conditions, during the outbreak,&#xD;
      between the two pandemic waves and onwards are scarce. First case of COVID-19 in Lithuania&#xD;
      was confirmed on 28th February 2020. First nationwide quarantine was introduced by Lithuanian&#xD;
      government on 16th March and ended on 16th June. In that period, although Lithuania was&#xD;
      reported among the least affected countries according to World Health Organization - 1 773&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases were recorded and 86 patients (of whom 10 patients died from other causes&#xD;
      after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2) had died before the end of quarantine, Lithuanian&#xD;
      government limited contact appointments to urgent conditions only. The utmost efforts to&#xD;
      provide triage, follow-up care by telephone call and e-prescriptions were recommended. This&#xD;
      greatly affected availability of cardiovascular care. The second pandemic wave in Lithuania&#xD;
      was substantially more severe. Consequently, the second nationwide quarantine was implemented&#xD;
      on 7th November, 2020. Contact appointments were not limited by the government; however, the&#xD;
      scope of CV care was again negatively affected, mostly by the strained health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We analysed the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country, which was hit by two&#xD;
      very different pandemic waves. The objectives of this population-based study were: (1) to&#xD;
      assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CV care (2) to compare rates of outpatient care&#xD;
      visits and hospitalisations of cardiovascular patients in different periods of 2019 and 2020&#xD;
      (3) to compare the rates of CV mortality in Lithuania in different periods of 2019 and 2020&#xD;
      (4) to investigate sex and age differences in CV care and CV mortality&#xD;
