    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab combined&#xD;
      with concurrent radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in high-risk patients with HNSCC not&#xD;
      suitable for cisplatin after surgery. The subjects were randomly divided into study group&#xD;
      (nimotuzumab combined with concurrent radiotherapy) and control group (radiotherapy alone) by&#xD;
      1∶1 stratified random method.&#xD;

      control group by 1∶1 stratified random method. The study group received nimotuzumab (200mg,&#xD;
      weekly, for 6 weeks) combined with concurrent radiotherapy, while the control group received&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone. The main endpoint is 2 year disease free survival (DFS) rate.&#xD;
