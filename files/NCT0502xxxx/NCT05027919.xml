  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate individual differences in the expression of opioid withdrawal symptoms in persons&#xD;
      with opioid use disorder while they are completing a clinically-indicated medication taper.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who have opioid use disorder and are interested in being tapered off of opioids&#xD;
      will be admitted to a residential research unit for an 11-day period. All participants will&#xD;
      be maintained on morphine for 5 days. During this period participants will complete 2&#xD;
      sessions (on two different days) wherein participants will receive an intramuscular injection&#xD;
      of naloxone to precipitate a short withdrawal syndrome. Participants will take a capsule&#xD;
      prior to both sessions that will contain either placebo or the opioid withdrawal medication&#xD;
      lofexidine. Beginning on day 6 participants will be tapered off of morphine using lofexidine&#xD;
      (as clinically indicated). At the end of the study all participants will be able to&#xD;
      transition to buprenorphine maintenance or receive oral naltrexone and an injection of&#xD;
      Vivitrol (extended release naltrexone), consistent with standard of care practices.&#xD;
      Investigators will collect a variety of biological samples and questionnaire ratings during&#xD;
      the study and primary outcomes will be measures of withdrawal collected throughout the study.&#xD;
      Investigators will use these data to learn more about why individuals express opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms differently, which will help inform how to change our current treatment&#xD;
      practices to be more effective for persons with OUD.&#xD;
