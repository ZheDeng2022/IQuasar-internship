  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trail is to evaluate the performance of Genetron lung cancer panel in&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer patients using semiconductor sequencing method.&#xD;

      This trial follows the principle of synchronous blinding. The enrolled cases are coded, and&#xD;
      the enrolled samples are detected with Genetron lung cancer panel and comparison methods. The&#xD;
      detection results are compared, and the samples that are inconsistent with the detection&#xD;
      results of similar products on the market are reviewed by the the Sanger sequencing method,&#xD;
      when the site detection results compared with Sanger sequencing method are inconsistent,&#xD;
      Sanger's detection results are recognized. The safety and effectiveness of this panel are&#xD;
      confirmed and evaluated. Meanwhile, the accuracy of this panel for the following drug&#xD;
      companion diagnostic tests: EGFR gene 19 exon deletion and L858R point mutation in gefitinib&#xD;
      tablets, erlotinib hydrochloride and icotinib hydrochloride tablets, T790M point mutation in&#xD;
      methanesulfonate acid osimertinib tablets, ALK gene fusion in crizotinib capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were determined independently according to the cutoff values or interpretation&#xD;
      requirements provided by each method, and relevant statistics were used to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      application performance of Genetron lung cancer panel.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cancer samClinically diagnosed as non-small cell lung samples (mainly lung&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma and some lung squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, etc.), and a small number of other cancer types are enrolled as&#xD;
             interference samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Collect some samples of relevant medical information before and after the use of&#xD;
             targeted drugs. This part of the samples should have relevant previous molecular&#xD;
             diagnosis results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to provide samples in time according to the requirements of the plan: samples for&#xD;
             DNA/RNA extraction: 10 pieces of 10 µm thickness for each sample or 10 pieces of&#xD;
             paraffin rolls. Samples for FISH experiment: 5 slices of 3-4µm thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The pathological examination conforms to the types of tissue samples listed in the&#xD;
             above table. The HE staining results show that the tumor content is not less than 50%,&#xD;
             and the paraffin slice damage should be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The sample should have corresponding basic clinical information, including: patient&#xD;
             visiting number/medical record number/specimen number, age, gender, pathological&#xD;
             diagnosis result, molecular diagnosis result (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who do not meet any of the above conditions are excluded. Reason: The included&#xD;
             non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma samples and normal samples should have statistical&#xD;
             significance, and the conclusions obtained should be scientific and valid. The&#xD;
             selection of subjects for this study, while excluding research-related influencing&#xD;
             factors, has no adverse effect on the health of the subjects.&#xD;
