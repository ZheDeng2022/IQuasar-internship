      This study forms part of Entia's clinical evidence for regulatory submission. This study&#xD;
      evaluates Entia Liberty's validation of the device. Participants will be trained to take an&#xD;
      Entia Liberty test in a simulated home environment and a trained healthcare professional will&#xD;
      perform another test from the same participant (different finger) on a separate device. The&#xD;
      results will be compared. Usability data will be observed and the participants will complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire after the tests have been performed.&#xD;
