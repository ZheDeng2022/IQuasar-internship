    <textblock>
      Electromagnetic stimulation is a new modality and alternative in women with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UI). However, there was not much evidence that compares the use of&#xD;
      electromagnetic stimulation to Kegel Exercises in post-partum stress urinary incontinence&#xD;
      (SUI). We evaluate the compliance rate, effectiveness (UDI-6 and 1-hour pad test), and pelvic&#xD;
      muscle strength of electromagnetic stimulation on stress urinary incontinence compared with&#xD;
      Kegel pelvic floor muscle exercises in post-partum women as conservative therapy. This study&#xD;
      was a single-blind randomized trial in postpartum women diagnosed with stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence who came to YPK Mandiri Hospital. We recruited 40 Patients and were randomized&#xD;
      into two groups, the electromagnetic stimulation (n=20) and Kegel exercises (n=20). The&#xD;
      electromagnetic stimulation procedure was done three times a week for five weeks, and the&#xD;
      Kegel exercises group will be instructed to do the exercises every day for eight weeks. Our&#xD;
      primary objective is to measure compliance, symptom reduction (using the UDI-6 questionnaire&#xD;
      and the 1-hour pad test), and pelvic floor muscle strength.&#xD;

      We evaluate the compliance rate, effectiveness (UDI-6 and 1-hour pad test), and pelvic muscle&#xD;
      strength of electromagnetic stimulation on stress urinary incontinence compared with Kegel&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle exercises in post-partum women as conservative therapy. This was a&#xD;
      Single-blind randomized clinical trial in 40 post-partum women diagnosed with stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence from at least three months post-partum from March 2020 to February 2021 at YPK&#xD;
      Mandiri Jakarta Hospital. We recruited consecutively for 40 patients divided into two groups&#xD;
      based on type I error of 5% and type II error of 10%. The study population included all&#xD;
      post-partum patients diagnosed with SUI over three months. Subjects that are included were&#xD;
      signed an informed consent form, post-partum women aged 20 years or over with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence since three months post-partum, found a urine leakage when&#xD;
      coughing when the bladder volume was 200 to 250 ml, and was able to perform a pad test 1&#xD;
      hour. The study subjects were excluded if the subject complained of mixed incontinence,&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, grade 3 and 4 pelvic organ prolapse, chronic degenerative&#xD;
      disease/trauma that affected muscle and nerve function, previous history of pelvic surgery,&#xD;
      or a pacemaker. Then, the patients were randomly selected using a computer, namely simple&#xD;
      randomization for treatment (Kegel muscle exercises or electromagnetic stimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kegel exercises had to be done every day for eight weeks. The kegel exercise consisted of two&#xD;
      types of training. The first one is contracting and relaxing the fast-twitch muscle. Subjects&#xD;
      contracted their muscle for two seconds and followed by four seconds of resting. The next&#xD;
      part of the training was for slow-twitch muscles. Subjects needed to contract their pelvic&#xD;
      muscle for five seconds and followed by ten seconds rest. All of the training was done alone,&#xD;
      five times/set and five sets/day. The time took for a session is approximately two minutes,&#xD;
      and it took ten minutes to complete the exercise. To evaluate the patient's compliance, a&#xD;
      self-written control card and interview were used, with follow-up every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, for those who received an electromagnetic stimulation chair, the patient sat on a&#xD;
      magnetic chair with their perineum on the center allow the maximum effect of the magnetic&#xD;
      field on the pelvic floor and sphincter muscles. We used NOVAMAG NT-60 chair (NOVAMedtek,&#xD;
      Turkey) for our electromagnetic stimulation regiment. The Electromagnetic stimulation&#xD;
      consists of 15 sessions with 20 minutes duration and three times a week for five weeks. At&#xD;
      the end of each session, subjects were also asked to fill out a control card as proof of&#xD;
      attendance. Subjects that were unable to complete 80% of the intended therapy regiment would&#xD;
      be classified as not compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' pelvic floor muscle strength was measured using Peritron by an obstetrician before&#xD;
      and after the intervention. To measure their pelvic floor muscle, the patient was asked to&#xD;
      contract the pelvic floor muscles and tightly hold for 2 to 3 seconds. Three experiments will&#xD;
      be conducted with a break of 10 seconds between contractions, and the value taken is the&#xD;
      highest measurement value. Physicians that evaluated the pelvic floor muscle strength will be&#xD;
      blinded for the group allocation to reduce bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UDI-6 questionnaire had been translated back and forth and validated. A reduction in the&#xD;
      UDI-6 score is treated as a positive result or an improvement of symptoms. 1-hour pad test&#xD;
      was used to evaluate their symptoms objectively. Based on the Committee International&#xD;
      Continence Society (ICS), an increase of pad weight by 2-10 grams classified as light SUI,&#xD;
      10-50 grams as medium SUI, ≥50 grams as severe SUI. We evaluate all the subjects' symptoms&#xD;
      before and after the therapy sessions. Physicians that evaluated the UDI-6 and 1-hour pad&#xD;
      test will be blinded for the group allocation to reduce bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dropout criteria of both groups are subjects who do not fill out the control card for at&#xD;
      least one week consecutively. Patients are compliant when they attend or done 80% of the&#xD;
      intended regimens of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Parametric or&#xD;
      Non-parametric tests were done appropriately to the normality test of the sample. We used&#xD;
      SPSS statistics 21.0 for data analysis and the cut-off for statistical significance of 0.05.&#xD;
