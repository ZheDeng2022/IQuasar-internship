  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic strokes are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In 20% of cases they&#xD;
      are caused by the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries. Risk estimation of&#xD;
      plaque rupture is currently suboptimal. Although pathology studies have shown that plaque&#xD;
      composition provides a better risk assessment (lipid-rich core with thin fibrous cap = high&#xD;
      risk (unstable plaque); fibrous core and a thick fibrous cap = low risk (stable plaque)),&#xD;
      plaque composition cannot be determined using imaging techniques, and can therefore not be&#xD;
      assessed non-invasively. Ultrasound, which is already widely used in clinical practice to&#xD;
      determine plaque geometry could be an optimal technique to determine plaque composition and&#xD;
      monitor plaques in a large population, due to its low patient burden, relatively low cost and&#xD;
      speed of measurement. However, using conventional ultrasound it is not possible to reliably&#xD;
      determine plaque composition. However, this might be possible using newly developed&#xD;
      ultrasound functionalities(shear wave and strain elastography) enabling tissue stiffness&#xD;
      estimation. It is known that recurrence risk is greatest in the first week after a stroke or&#xD;
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) and decreases afterwards, probably due to a stabilization of&#xD;
      the plaque due to a change in composition. Additionally, lipid-lowering medication is known&#xD;
      to further reduce the recurrence risk after such an event, probably due to an acceleration of&#xD;
      the stabilization process of the plaque. In this study, the investigators want to investigate&#xD;
      whether Ultra-COMPASS ultrasound measurements (a combination of shear wave and strain&#xD;
      elastography and ultrafast compounding (a fast variant of standard anatomical ultrasound to&#xD;
      determine plaque geometry)) could be used to determine changes in plaque composition after a&#xD;
      stroke / TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate whether it is possible to detect plaque stabilization, determined by plaque&#xD;
      stiffness, after a brain infarction or transient ischemic attack with Ultra-COMPASS&#xD;
      ultrasound measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the association between (changes in) Ultra-COMPASS measurements and the&#xD;
           lipid-lowering drugs used 6 and 12 weeks after ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the association between Ultra-COMPASS measurements and recurrent&#xD;
           cardiovascular events (TIA / cerebral infarction / myocardial infarction/death) 6 and 12&#xD;
           weeks after ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the association between Ultra-COMPASS measurements and (changes in)&#xD;
           low-density lipoprotein levels 6 and 12 weeks after ischemic stroke (if known).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, single-center cohort study in patients&#xD;
      after a cerebral infarction or TIA with stenosis of one / both carotid arteries of 30-70%&#xD;
      that receive or start withcholesterol-lowering medication. Ultra-COMPASS measurements will be&#xD;
      taken within 7 days after brain infarction/TIA and at 6 ± 1 and after 12 ± 1 weeks in both&#xD;
      carotid arteries to see if plaques stabilize overtime and to what extent medication&#xD;
      stimulates a beneficial change in plaque composition.&#xD;
