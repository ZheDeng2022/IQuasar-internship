  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy, its prognosis remaining poor despite the&#xD;
      current advances in treatment. Systemic inflammatory reaction has been recently recognized as&#xD;
      an important factor in the progression of cancer. The immune-inflammatory response has been&#xD;
      measured through different scores or ratios, that combine the values of circulating immune&#xD;
      cells, like neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR),&#xD;
      lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), prognostic&#xD;
      nutritional index (PNI). The utility of these scores in different types of cancer has been&#xD;
      more and more discussed. In pancreatic cancer, there has been no definite conclusion&#xD;
      regarding the role of systemic immune-inflammatory factors; since controversies still exist,&#xD;
      a deeper exploration of this subject, through more studies is welcomed. Our study intends to&#xD;
      analyze the utility of systemic immune-inflammatory markers in resectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is an observational cohort study, with retrospective data collection; it is a&#xD;
      single-center study, that takes place in a hospital with experience in&#xD;
      hepato-bilio-pancreatic surgery. We intended to evaluate the role of the circulating immune&#xD;
      cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) and different immune-inflammatory scores (NLR,&#xD;
      LMR, PLR, SII, PNI) in predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with pancreatic&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma, that undergo curative surgical treatment. We intended to assess the&#xD;
      prognosis power of these factors in both preoperative and postoperative settings, as well as&#xD;
      their dynamic after surgery. Through this study, we hope to identify easy-to determine and&#xD;
      easy-to-use markers that can be incorporated in clinical practice and that can effectively&#xD;
      predict survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Nonetheless, we want to explore the dynamic&#xD;
      of the immune-inflammatory markers after curative surgery.&#xD;
