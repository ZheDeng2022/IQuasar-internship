  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gallium-68 prostate-specific-membrane-antigen (Ga-68 PSMA) PET/CT is being used in Prostate&#xD;
      cancer imaging. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of robotic&#xD;
      arm-assisted Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT-guided transgluteal prostatic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-eight participants with a clinical suspicion of PCa were recruited from January 2019&#xD;
      to September 2020. All the patients underwent whole-body Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT. The patients with&#xD;
      PSMA-avid lesion in the prostate underwent robotic arm-assisted PET-guided transgluteal&#xD;
      biopsies. The degree of pain during the procedure, procedure-related complications and&#xD;
      histopathology were evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT imaging is now routinely done in patients with prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence, response evaluation and even in patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. In the present study, we aim to plan robotic arm-assisted Ga-68 PSMA guided transgluteal prostatic biopsies.</description>

    <description>The patients were positioned prone on PET/CT table. The regional PET/CT image of the lower pelvic region were acquired for the procedure. The images were transferred to the ROBIO™ EX workstation. The ARA workstation determined the needle trajectory, depth of the lesion and angulations. The planned trajectory was appraised for its relationship with the vital organs. Strict surgical aseptic approach was followed for the procedure under local anesthesia. An 18G x 20cm coaxial system was manually introduced through the bush and pushed with the help of robotic arm through the gluteal skin entry site to the predetermined depth in the prostate. The real-time placement of the needle was confirmed with low dose CT and the biopsy specimens were retrieved. After the procedure, patient vitals and any difficulty in micturition were observed for two hours in the recovery area. The specimens were sent for histopathological examination.</description>
