      It has been described in obese individuals in which decreased basal metabolism as well as&#xD;
      dopaminergic changes in the prefrontal cortex and striatum parallels the increased activation&#xD;
      of reward brain regions in response to delicious food cues. Our aim is to explore different&#xD;
      neurobehavioral dimensions of food choices and motivational processes in the light of this&#xD;
      information, and to reveal whether these behaviors can be changed by operant conditioning&#xD;
      with neuroimaging methods for phenotypes at risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of eating disorders in society is increasing day by day and is becoming an&#xD;
      increasingly serious problem. Overweight people are suggested to exhibit eating behavior to&#xD;
      cope with anxiety, depressed mood, anger and other negative emotions. Studies in humans and&#xD;
      animals have shown that obesity is associated with changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission.&#xD;
      Changes in brain locations associated with satiety and hunger centers (hypothalamus,&#xD;
      hippocampal gyrus, amygdala, insula, cerebellum and midbrain) of obese patients have been&#xD;
      shown. It has been reported that cognitive control strategies that can lead to more effective&#xD;
      impulse control behaviors should be applied for obesity treatment, which is considered as an&#xD;
      addiction in which food is perceived as a reward nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first week of fixed orthodontic treatment, all the patients have pain and various&#xD;
      discomforts with food, and after each appointment, the pain occurs while chewing. Patients&#xD;
      declare having prolonged eating times due to difficulty in chewing, food impaction under the&#xD;
      brackets and complains about not being able to consume sugar-containing foods due to maintain&#xD;
      oral hygen. It is known that individuals who have eating disorders have a disturbance in&#xD;
      their food rewarding properties and eating behavior. They eat in response to emotions rather&#xD;
      than to meet energy needs. Pharmacological and bariatric surgical interventions are more&#xD;
      successful than dietary lifestyle interventions because these interventions reduced not only&#xD;
      the hunger but also the reward value of the homeostatic and hedonic brain regions of the&#xD;
      foods. However, there is no study of whether enjoying from the food, perceiving food as a&#xD;
      reward or individuals eating habits can be changed. The hypothesis of this study is that as a&#xD;
      result of orthodontic treatment in which individuals experience negative emotions during each&#xD;
      meal for two years there will be a change in the way of individuals' interpretation of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate this hypothesis, eating attitudes and eating habit questionnaires&#xD;
      will be applied to healthy volunteers with a body mass index of 25 and above chosen from&#xD;
      patients who applied to our clinic for fixed orthodontic treatment. Thus, individuals with&#xD;
      emotional eating, externally induced eating, restrained eating disorders and eating habits of&#xD;
      these individuals will be identified. Magnetic resonance images will be taken from 20&#xD;
      individuals with eating disorders before fixed orthodontic treatment, 12 months of&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment and 6 months after orthodontic treatment finished. By means of magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTG), the microstructural changes in&#xD;
      axonal and myelin structures in the tracts of the selected appetite and satiety centers in&#xD;
      the brain will be defined. The presence of changes by the orthodontic treatment in&#xD;
      nutritional perceptions will be measured.&#xD;

             in the future, the patient will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Before the patients start orthodontic treatment, a consultation will be requested from&#xD;

             study by the initiative of the dietician who examines the patient without asking a&#xD;
             reason for the doctor-patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Before the patients start orthodontic treatment, a consultation will be requested from&#xD;
             the internal medicine doctor if there is any doubt that there may be an organic basis&#xD;
             for patients to have a high BMI. The patients who are not found suitable will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study by the initiative of the internal medicine doctor who examines&#xD;
             the patient without asking a reason for the doctor-patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients using medical treatment due to a known disease before orthodontic treatment&#xD;
             will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
