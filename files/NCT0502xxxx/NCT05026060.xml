  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MR sequence called MR-ASL is used to measure cerebral perfusion in children. This ASL&#xD;
      sequence is used with a unique post-labeling delay (PLD) due to the technical impossibility&#xD;
      of setting different post-labeling delays. The use of a single post-labeling, chosen by the&#xD;
      pediatric radiology department of the Necker hospital, optimal in children without&#xD;
      arteriopathy, may not be suitable for the lengthened arterial transit time of the spins&#xD;
      marked in the pathological carotid network of a child with arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, ASL sequences with multiple delays (multi-PLD, called eASL) have been developed to&#xD;
      overcome this limitation in arterial disease. To date, their use in the pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment evaluation of a child with acute or chronic arterial disease has not been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that this eASL sequence is more efficient than single-delay ASL in&#xD;
      measuring cerebral perfusion. The study will be performed in a population of children with&#xD;
      acute or chronic arterial disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For 9 years, the pediatric radiology department of the Necker Enfants Malades hospital has&#xD;
      routinely used an MR sequence called MR-ASL, which has made it possible to measure cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion in children. The service was a pioneer in using this sequence in children and it&#xD;
      made it possible to detect areas of cerebral hypo-perfusion (or even pathological&#xD;
      hyper-perfusion) and also to monitor post-surgical or spontaneous revascularizations. But&#xD;
      this technique suffers from some limitations. Indeed, this ASL sequence is used with a unique&#xD;
      post-labeling delay (PLD) of 1025 ms due to the technical impossibility of setting different&#xD;
      post-labeling delays. This PLD corresponds to the arterial transit time of the spins marked&#xD;
      to have a satisfactory cerebral perfusion. The use of a single post-labeling, chosen short&#xD;
      (1025 ms) by the pediatric radiology department of the Necker hospital, optimal in children&#xD;
      without arterial disease, may not be suitable for arterial transit time elongated spins&#xD;
      marked in the pathological carotid network of a child with arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, ASL sequences with multiple delays (multi-PLD, called eASL) have been developed to&#xD;
      overcome this limitation in arterial disease. To date, their use in the pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment evaluation of a child with acute or chronic arterial disease has not been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eASL is a sequence that lasts 4 minutes without injection of contrast product that the&#xD;
      pediatric radiology department at Necker Hospital intends to add to the standard clinical&#xD;
      sequences, as part of this study. This sequence will have no post-labeling delay a priori and&#xD;
      will make it possible to test several post-labeling delays in one go. Thus, no a priori&#xD;
      hypothesis on the transit time of the spins will be made and the eASL sequence will be able&#xD;
      to show, after its reconstruction, what is the optimal post-labeling delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in a population of children with acute or chronic arterial&#xD;
      disease. The study hypothesis is that this eASL sequence is more efficient than single-delay&#xD;
      ASL in measuring cerebral perfusion.&#xD;
