  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effects of school-based, comprehensive water, sanitation, and&#xD;
      hygiene improvements on child health and educational outcomes in schools in Addis Ababa,&#xD;
      Ethiopia. Eligible schools will be randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. Data&#xD;
      on pupil absence and illness will be collected longitudinally from students in selected&#xD;
      classrooms in each school over the course of one academic year (2021/2022). This study will&#xD;
      also assess the effects of the intervention on kindergarten students through parent&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a cluster-randomised controlled trial design to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      WASH in Schools for Everyone (WISE) programme. Project WISE, implemented by Splash, aims to&#xD;
      improve child health and attendance by 1) improving WASH infrastructure, 2) promoting WASH&#xD;
      behaviour change and 3) strengthening menstrual hygiene management (MHM) services targeting&#xD;
      girls aged 10 and above, in public schools across Addis Ababa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 public schools from planned implementation groups that will receive the WISE intervention&#xD;
      will be randomised: 30 schools will be allocated to the intervention group (to receive the&#xD;
      WISE intervention during the 2021/2022 academic year) and 30 schools will be allocated to the&#xD;
      control group (on a waitlist to receive the WISE intervention after study completion).&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by school size (number of students) and presence of a&#xD;
      kindergarten. In each selected school, four classes will be randomly selected from grades 2-8&#xD;
      - approximately 100 students in total per school. Students in the selected classes will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the start of the academic year (September 2021) and followed up with unannounced&#xD;
      visits every 4-6 weeks until the end of the academic year (May 2022). Primary outcomes of&#xD;
      pupil-reported illness and absence will be assessed during enrolment and at each follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Secondary outcomes are restricted to subsets of students by age and gender, and will&#xD;
      be assessed during the final follow-up visit. Students joining the class mid-way through the&#xD;
      year will be enrolled in the study, and students who leave the class will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key outcomes of interest are longitudinal prevalence of absence and illness (diarrhoea and&#xD;
      respiratory infection) over the course of the academic year, measured as cumulative number of&#xD;
      days absent/with illness per 100 school days after adjustment for child- and school-specific&#xD;
      covariates. Data collected in intervention schools prior to and/or during the active Splash&#xD;
      intervention will not be included in the primary impact evaluation analysis. Sub-population&#xD;
      analysis of evaluation outcomes in girls post-menarche will allow assessment of the gendered&#xD;
      effects of the intervention. We will also monitor intervention fidelity and compliance, as&#xD;
      well as cost-effectiveness of the intervention, through routine data collection with students&#xD;
      and school staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 public schools with a kindergarten will be enrolled to assess the impacts of the&#xD;
      intervention among kindergarten students (20 intervention, 20 control). Schools enrolled in&#xD;
      the intervention and control arms of the main study among older children that have a&#xD;
      kindergarten will be also enrolled in the kindergarten evaluation. If there are fewer than 20&#xD;
      such schools in each arm, additional kindergarten schools will be randomised (estimated 10&#xD;
      additional schools per arm). In each selected school, 20 kindergarten students will be&#xD;
      randomly selected for participation. Parents of selected students will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in weekly telephone surveys over a four-week period in February/March 2022 in&#xD;
      order to assess the longitudinal prevalence of illness and absence among kindergarteners.&#xD;
