      The study is designed as a proof of concept, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of CHI-202 (cannabinoids and other&#xD;
      ingredients) compared to placebo in the treatment of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS).&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-65 years who are exercise-trained (self-report exercising at least 3&#xD;
      times per week for at least 30 minutes per session for the past year) will be recruited from&#xD;
      existing panels of participants from past studies, local advertisements, and social media&#xD;
      targeted advertisements. Those who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study, scheduled for the Exercise Visit (Study Visit 1; Day 0) within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      screening, and randomized to active vs. placebo IP condition in a 1:1 ratio. One repetition&#xD;
      maximum (1RM) method, the maximum amount of weight one can lift in a single repetition for a&#xD;
      given exercise, will be used in order to induce DOMS. Following the completion of the&#xD;
      Exercise Visit, participants will be scheduled for 3 follow-up visits that will occur 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3 days post-Exercise Visit. Participants will consume 7 scheduled doses of the study IP&#xD;
      to which they have been randomly assigned (i.e., active or placebo) with instruction to&#xD;
      consume the study IP prior to the exercise at Study Visit 1, at 8PM (±1 hour) that night, and&#xD;
      then at 8AM and 8PM (±1 hour) every day until their final study visit. The last dose will&#xD;
      occur at 8AM (±1 hour) on Day 4, i.e., immediately prior to Study Visit 4.&#xD;
