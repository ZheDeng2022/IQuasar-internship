  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to test if a smoking cessation&#xD;
      program called Quit for Life (QFL) which was developed by the investigators is effective for&#xD;
      patients in China with HIV who smoke. This program is designed to suit the needs of people&#xD;
      with HIV who smoke in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants who provide consent will be randomized into either the QFL or the&#xD;
      Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QFL group will receive a quit smoking program that lasts for 8 weeks with two parts-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 4 sessions with a trained counselor who will discuss the participants' smoking habits&#xD;
           and strategies to help them quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Messages sent to the participants' cell phone using WeChat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control group will not have sessions with a trained counselor or receive messages sent to&#xD;
      their cell phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be offered nicotine replacement therapy and a self-help guide with&#xD;
      information about quitting smoking.&#xD;
