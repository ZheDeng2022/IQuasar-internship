    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza (flu) is a virus that infects people of all ages. Some people may have mild flu&#xD;
      symptoms. Others may get very sick and even die from the flu. Flu vaccines help protect&#xD;
      people against the flu, but if the flu strains in the vaccine are not a good match with the&#xD;
      strains circulating in the community, the vaccine is not as effective. Researchers want to&#xD;
      make flu vaccines that protect against changing flu strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if a new flu vaccine is safe and if it creates an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-55 who do not smoke and have not received a flu vaccine in the 8 weeks&#xD;
      prior or a COVID-19 vaccine in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened on a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 11 visits over 7 months. They will get a combination of study vaccine&#xD;
      and/or placebo, both as a shot in the arm and as a spray into the nose, at 2 visits. For 7&#xD;
      days after getting the vaccines, they will take their temperature and complete online surveys&#xD;
      at home to record any symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will give&#xD;
      blood and urine samples. They will have nasal testing. For this, a thin absorptive strip will&#xD;
      be inserted into their nostril for 1 minute to collect mucus. At some visits, the inside of&#xD;
      their nose will be wiped with a small brush to collect cells. For this, their nostril will be&#xD;
      numbed to make it more comfortable. Some blood and nasal samples will be used for genetic&#xD;
      testing. Participants who get flu-like symptoms during the study will be asked to collect&#xD;
      nasal samples at home and send these samples back to NIH to test if they actually have the&#xD;
      flu.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, single center, phase 1 clinical&#xD;
      trial of Beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated quadruple influenza virus cocktail vaccine&#xD;
      (BPL-1357) administered intramuscularly (IM) or intranasally (IN) in 2 doses 28 days apart.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of three groups for treatment assignment. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that IN and IM BPL-1357 will be well tolerated.&#xD;
