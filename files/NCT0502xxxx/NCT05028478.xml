      The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, Phase I/II study in adult subjects with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic solid tumor or hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three parts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ia: Dose Escalation: This is a dose escalation for assessment of dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLT) at approximately four dose levels in subjects with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumor or hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib: Dose Expansion: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of CN202, prior to determination of Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To further evaluate the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of CN202 in subjects with select tumors. All subjects will receive the&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose of CN202.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 13 to 24 subjects enrolled in phase Ia, 12 to 40 subjects in phase Ib and 15 to&#xD;
      100 subjects in phase II&#xD;
