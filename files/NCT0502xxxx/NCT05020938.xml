    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reveal the effectiveness and satisfaction of integrative&#xD;
      Korean medicine for Meniscus Tear by observation patients treated with integrative Korean&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective observational study. The subjects for study are patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with Meniscus Tear and who have been admitted to Gangnam Jaseng Hospital of Korean&#xD;
      medicine, Bucheon Jaseng Hospital of Korean medicine, Daejeon Jaseng Hospital of Korean&#xD;
      medicine and Haeundae Jaseng Hospital of Korean medicine for 2015.06-2020.06.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records of selected patients will be analyzed, and telephone surveys will be&#xD;
      conducted for each patient. The survey questions are Numeric rating scale (NRS), Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMasters Universities(WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index, quality of life, and Patient&#xD;
      Global Impression of Change (PGIC), etc.&#xD;
