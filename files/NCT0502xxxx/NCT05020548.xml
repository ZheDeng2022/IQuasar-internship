  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents is one of the leading causes of general&#xD;
      anesthesia-related mortality. Gastric insufflation during positive pressure mask ventilation&#xD;
      increases the gastric volume, and consequently the risk of regurgitation. Thus, positive&#xD;
      pressure mask ventilation should be avoided during rapid sequence induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      when full-stomach is suspected (e.g. inadequate fasting hours, gastrointestinal obstruction,&#xD;
      delayed gastric emptying, and lower esophageal disease) Although avoidance of positive&#xD;
      pressure mask ventilation during induction would potentially minimize the risk of aspiration,&#xD;
      this would lead to rapid hypoxia . Hence, finding a proper regimen for mask ventilation would&#xD;
      avoid hypoxia which might be serious in high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure-controlled face mask ventilation previously proved to be the least regimen to cause&#xD;
      gastric insufflation in comparison to manual, and volume-controlled mask ventilation during&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia. Later, a pressure of 15 cmH2O during face mask ventilation had been&#xD;
      reported optimum to achieve the balance between adequate ventilation and reduced gastric&#xD;
      insufflation in non-paralyzed patients. This finding was not yet replicated in paralyzed&#xD;
      patients who represent the majority of population who receive mask ventilation during&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia. We hypothesize that in paralyzed patient, the optimum pressure&#xD;
      during face mask ventilation might be lower than the pressure which was previously reported&#xD;
      in non-paralyzed patients. However, no studies to the best of our knowledge had confirmed&#xD;
      this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric insufflation was previously evaluated using auscultation with stethoscope, microphone&#xD;
      placed in the epigastric area, or esophageal manometry. Recently, gastric antrum ultrasound&#xD;
      was used successfully to gastric insufflation in real time by measuring the cross sectional&#xD;
      area of gastric antrum before and after face mask ventilation. This newly developed method is&#xD;
      more sensitive than the auscultatory method and less invasive than esophageal manometry&#xD;
      method.&#xD;

      Upon arrival to the operating room, routine monitors (ECG, pulse oximetry, and non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure monitor) will be applied, intravenous line will be secured, and routine&#xD;
      pre-medications (ranitidine 50 mg and midazolam 3-5 mg) will be administrated. End-tidal CO2&#xD;
      monitoring will be initiated after induction of general anesthesia and starting face-mask&#xD;
      ventilation. Induction of anesthesia will be achieved using fentanyl (2 mcg/Kg), propofol (2&#xD;
      mg/Kg), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/Kg). After loss of verbal response, mask ventilation will be&#xD;
      achieved by appropriate size face mask and oropharyngeal airway with 100% oxygen and double&#xD;
      hand jaw thrust head tilt maneuver. The included patients will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      receive the assigned pressure-controlled mask ventilation. The 3 study groups will receive&#xD;
      the planned inspiratory pressure, without positive end-expiratory pressure, with a&#xD;
      respiratory rate of 15, and inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:2 for 180 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment gastric insufflation during mask ventilation will be achieved by ultrasound&#xD;
      assessment of gastric antrum (in the sagittal plane between left lobe of the liver and&#xD;
      pancreas at level of the aorta) and auscultation by two blinded investigators to the assigned&#xD;
      pressure. The ultrasound screen will be positioned to be not visible to the investigator&#xD;
      responsible for auscultation. Gastric insufflation will be identified by comet-tail sign by&#xD;
      gastric ultrasound and gurgling sound by auscultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric antrum cross sectional area [ D1(longitudinal diameter) X D2 (anteroposterior&#xD;
      diameter) X π /4] in between contractions in supine position before face mask ventilation and&#xD;
      after insertion of endotracheal tube will be recorded. gastric insufflation will be&#xD;
      identified if gastric antrum cross sectional area increased by &gt; 30% after endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation in relation to the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During mask ventilation, the following parameter will be recorded at 30, 60, 90,120, 150 and&#xD;
      180 seconds; peripheral oxygen saturation, the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration , peak&#xD;
      airway measured pressure, and tidal volume Demographic data (age, sex, weight, height, BMI,&#xD;
      comorbidities) will be recorded.&#xD;
