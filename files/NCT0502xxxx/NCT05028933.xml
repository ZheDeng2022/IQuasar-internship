  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open-label, single and multiple infusion, dose escalation/cohort expansion&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety, cell pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of EPCAM CAR-T,&#xD;
      infused intravenously in subjects who have been diagnosed with advanced malignant tumors of&#xD;
      the digestive system (including advanced gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer) and refractory or intolerant to current standard systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To evaluate the safety and tolerability of EPCAM CAR-T infused intravenously at escalating&#xD;
      doses in patients with advanced malignant tumors of the digestive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The treatment of EpCAM CAR-T for patients with advanced digestive system malignancies,&#xD;
           according to the dose-limiting toxicity and clinical response, including Possible side&#xD;
           effects, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), extended recommended dose (RDE)&#xD;
           and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the correlation between the pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers of IMC001 and&#xD;
           clinical efficacy; EpCAM CAR-T expands and persists in vivo Correlation between sexual&#xD;
           and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of EpCAM CAR-T in patients with advanced&#xD;
           digestive system malignancies. According to the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of&#xD;
           solid tumors (RECIST) Version V.1.1, Evaluation Criteria for Efficacy of Immunotherapy&#xD;
           for Solid Tumors (iRECIST), using objective response rate(ORR), duration of remission&#xD;
           (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) description&#xD;
           preliminary Anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess changes in immune status of EPCAM CAR-T treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the change of CTC in the peripheral blood of patients and the clearance effect of&#xD;
           CAR-T cell treatment on CTC.&#xD;
