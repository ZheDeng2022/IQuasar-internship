  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the feasibility of whether the addition of key prebiotics administered orally&#xD;
      can mitigate some of the most problematic side-effects of the most common psychiatric&#xD;
      medications - weight gain and metabolic abnormalities caused by some antidepressants, mood&#xD;
      stabilizers and antipsychotics. In the initial part of the study, we aim to determine&#xD;
      feasibility of the study and evaluate participant compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical trial will encourage the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila (AM) through&#xD;
      enteric-coated orally-administered acetate (apple cider vinegar powder in capsules) in&#xD;
      16-to-28 year-old patients who have already experienced weight gain while on stable doses of&#xD;
      psychiatric medication, with the hypothesis that the addition of this prebiotic will result&#xD;
      in alterations in gut microbiota and measurable weight loss, as well as improvement in&#xD;
      metabolic measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate feasibility of using acetate in a large-scale clinical trial, including&#xD;
           considerations for protocol, study agent, recruitment, retention, adverse events,&#xD;
           budget, staff, facility, and patient experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate effect size of change in AM relative abundance by measuring pre- and&#xD;
           post-intervention levels for use in designing future large-scale clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether acetate administered orally shows an observable effect on weight&#xD;
           gain as a side effect from antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and/or antipsychotics in a&#xD;
           sample of participants already on stable doses of at least one of these medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine changes in metabolic syndrome profile, as indicated by blood pressure and&#xD;
           high-density lipoprotein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct preliminary analyses on any possible changes in mood/anxiety symptoms pre-&#xD;
           versus post-intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and define other potential confounders or effect modifiers of our primary&#xD;
           and secondary objectives that should be considered in future study designs&#xD;
