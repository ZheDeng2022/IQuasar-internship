      Summary Rationale: The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle which separates the thoracic cavity&#xD;
      from the abdomen. In patients with diaphragm paralysis the treatment (surgery versus&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation) is based on physician preference, not sound scientific evidence.&#xD;
      Clearly studies are needed to guide a scientific decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: In this pilot study the investigators will evaluate if participants are willing&#xD;
      and able to participate in a randomized trial. Secondly this pilot study is also needed to&#xD;
      know the clinical relevant effect of both therapies on EQ-5D_5L, the latter being the primary&#xD;
      outcome. Finally, it will show the investigators the costs of both therapies form a societal&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: open-label, multi center randomized controlled trial / pilot Study population:&#xD;
      20 participants &gt;18 year and diagnosed with a unilateral of bilateral diaphragm paralysis&#xD;
      resulting from phrenic nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 10 participants for surgical plication and 10 participants for nocturnal&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary question is whether the intended cost&#xD;
      effectiveness / cost utility study is feasible. In the investigators opinion the intended&#xD;
      study is feasible if at least 50% of the participants fulfilling the inclusions criteria are&#xD;
      randomized in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goal of the preparatory study is to describe the effect of both plication and NIV&#xD;
      on the endpoints of the intended efficiency study. The intended primary endpoint is quality&#xD;
      of life as measured by the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Secondary endpoints are; the Medical&#xD;
      Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, the Diaphragmatic Paralysis Questionnaire, Borg&#xD;
      dyspnoea score, Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT), spirometry in both sitting and supine&#xD;
      position, a polysomnography and transcutaneous measurement of carbon dioxide an oxygen&#xD;
      saturation at night.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle which separates the thoracic cavity from the abdomen.&#xD;
      It is the most important muscle of respiration innervated by the phrenic nerves. While many&#xD;
      diseases might interfere with its function (1), in the intended study the investigators will&#xD;
      focus on diaphragm paralysis due to phrenic nerve injury. Two types of diaphragm paralysis&#xD;
      can be distinguished: unilateral and bilateral. Patients with unilateral paralysis perceive&#xD;
      exertional dyspnea, have an impaired exercise capacity and orthopnea.(2) Patients with a&#xD;
      bilateral paralysis usually have more symptoms and might even develop respiratory failure.&#xD;
      (3) In addition, all patients with a diaphragm paralysis may have poor sleep quality, as the&#xD;
      diaphragm is the only active respiratory muscle during REM sleep. (4) Currently, two&#xD;
      treatment approaches for patients with diaphragm paralysis are used in clinical practice:&#xD;
      surgical diaphragm plication and nocturnal non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Plication is a&#xD;
      minimal invasive surgical procedure that aims to stiffen the diaphragm and such limits&#xD;
      dysfunctional (paradoxical movement) excursions of the paralytic diaphragm. The procedure is&#xD;
      performed in Â±70 patients per year in the Netherlands. NIV is a non-invasive mode of positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilatory assistance; through a facial mask the ventilator supports patient&#xD;
      breathing effort. Patients with diaphragm paralysis use their ventilator mainly during night&#xD;
      time, to improve quality of sleep and such to reduce day time symptoms. In the Netherlands,&#xD;
      home mechanical ventilation is very well organized, as care is delivered by only 4&#xD;
      specialized centers. NIV for diaphragm paralysis is started in around 50 patients yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, both plication and nocturnal NIV appear beneficial and both options are covered by&#xD;
      health care insurance. However, it is unknown which intervention is most beneficial from a&#xD;
      patient perspective. For instance, comparison on patient relevant outcome measures and&#xD;
      complications between these treatment approaches is unknown. In addition, patients with&#xD;
      diaphragm paralysis may develop severe symptoms, limiting daily activities including ability&#xD;
      to perform their professional work. To assess the overall impact of this a detailed cost&#xD;
      analysis is necessary to compare both treatments from a societal perspective. A solid cost&#xD;
      effectiveness / cost utility study will reveal which therapy is the best option from a&#xD;
      societal perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preparatory study will be set up as a randomized pilot study to evaluate if patients are&#xD;
      willing and able to participate in this trial. Question is, are participants willing to&#xD;
      participate, are they willing to travel to the other institute and are they able to comply&#xD;
      with the follow-up measurements. Participants referred to either one of the therapies might&#xD;
      be biased towards that therapy and the questions is whether well informed about both&#xD;
      therapies, they are willing to participate. To know what clinical effect of both therapies is&#xD;
      relevant the EQ-5D-5L is used. It is unknown whether there is a significant difference on the&#xD;
      outcome between both therapies. A search in trial registries did not reveal any study with&#xD;
      similar research questions. Based on the outcomes of this preparatory study a power analysis&#xD;
      can be performed for the seminal study. Due to the acute origin of a diaphragm paralysis&#xD;
      patients get suddenly severely impaired which is interfering enormously with their lives. As&#xD;
      this is often happening in middle aged patients they often have to discontinue professional&#xD;
      activities. This means that the potential impact of this disorder is huge from patient and&#xD;
      societal perspective and needs to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As both therapies are completely different for invasiveness, the investigators need to&#xD;
      compare the side effects and possible complications. Possible complications of the surgery&#xD;
      are infection, bleeding and abdominal pain while the well know side effects of ventilatory&#xD;
      support are leakage of the mask, aerophagia and a-synchrony between breathing pattern of the&#xD;
      patient and the ventilator. As this is also an important outcome of this pilot study&#xD;
      participants will be closely monitored from the start of therapy and there will be a&#xD;
      telephone call after 2 months&#xD;
