    <textblock>
      This clinical trial examines the effects of simulated solar radiation on human skin in&#xD;
      preventing skin cancer. Testing whether new drugs affect biomarkers in the skin is a good&#xD;
      first test of whether the drug might prevent skin cancer. Some biomarkers in skin, and even&#xD;
      in moles, are affected after a person is exposed to sunlight. This study may help doctors&#xD;
      learn more about what happens to the skin and moles when the participants are exposed to the&#xD;
      sun.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify biomarkers of simulated solar radiation (SSR) treatment in human skin that can&#xD;
      be used as surrogate endpoints in chemoprevention trials in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure Langerhans cell (LC) and sunburn cell density in the epidermis, as well as&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE I. To perform gene expression analysis on tissue frozen after biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients undergo total body exam. The minimum dose of simulated sunlight required to&#xD;
      cause mild sunburn is determined. One of the patient's moles is exposed to 3 times that&#xD;
      minimum dose of simulated sunlight. One day later, that mole, and an untreated mole, are&#xD;
      removed by punch biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients undergo total body exam. The minimum dose of simulated sunlight required&#xD;
      to cause mild sunburn is determined. One of the patient's moles is exposed to 4 times that&#xD;
      minimum dose of simulated sunlight. One day later, that mole, and an untreated mole, are&#xD;
      removed by punch biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients undergo total body exam. The minimum dose of simulated sunlight required&#xD;
      to cause mild sunburn is determined. One of the patient's moles is exposed to 6 times that&#xD;
      minimum dose of simulated sunlight. One day later, that mole, and an untreated mole, are&#xD;
      removed by punch biopsy.&#xD;

    <description>Will use immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of biopsies to determine the difference between the percentage of pixels classified as positive or strong positive for p53 in irradiated nevi (moles) and unirradiated control nevi from each participant.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 18-100 years. The investigators anticipate recruiting few if any patients over&#xD;
             age 80 as nevi tend to disappear as people age. Both men and women of all races and&#xD;
             ethnic groups will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have 2 clinically benign melanocytic nevi 3-5 mm in diameter&#xD;
             confirmed by clinical dermatoscopic examination by a medically-qualified study team&#xD;
             member and suitable for biopsy (i.e. not at a site that would be functionally or&#xD;
             cosmetically damaged by the biopsy). The minimum size restriction arises from the need&#xD;
             for collection of tissue sufficient for single nucleus ribonucleic acid sequencing&#xD;
             (RNAseq) analysis. The maximum size is dictated by the requirement that the entire&#xD;
             nevus be removed with a 6 mm punch biopsy, thereby eliminating any concerns that might&#xD;
             arise from regrowth of the nevus that can happen after incomplete removal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing systemic therapy for melanoma or any other cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to anesthetic agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Photosensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking supplements such as nicotinamide or antioxidants that might protect&#xD;
             from skin cancer or alter the response of their skin to simulated solar radiation&#xD;
             (SSR)&#xD;
