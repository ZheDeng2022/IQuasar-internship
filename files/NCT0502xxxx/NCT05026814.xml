  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical interventions to reconstruct the vulva together with psychosexual care have been&#xD;
      proposed as a multidisciplinary care concept for women who have undergone female genital&#xD;
      mutilation/cutting (FGM/C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional study is to assess the experiences of multidisciplinary care of women&#xD;
      who request CR at Geneva University Hospital (HUG) in order to analyze the expectations and&#xD;
      motivations for clitoral reconstruction, to study the reasons for deciding against or in&#xD;
      favor of CR and to study the outcome of the care received (CR+ psychosexual care versus&#xD;
      psychosexual care alone) in sexual response, eventual dyspareunia, genital self-image and&#xD;
      overall satisfaction through questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The FGSIS is a measurement instrument consisting of seven items to assess female genital self-image. The questions relate to women's feelings and beliefs about their own genitals.
