  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental Insightfulness (PI), promotes the development of the child's socio-emotional&#xD;
      competence and her ability to have productive and sustaining relationships. PI is even more&#xD;
      central in the case of young children with ASD, who struggle to socially communicate their&#xD;
      needs and their mental and emotional states. PI's effects on the child's peer-interaction&#xD;
      have not been tested and Since parents play a central role in intervention programs for their&#xD;
      children with ASD, examining modifiable parent factors as mediators and moderators of&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness could contribute to this line of research. The proposed study aims to&#xD;
      test how pre intervention PI and intervention-related changes in PI affect parents' ability&#xD;
      to support their children in the acquisition of peer-interaction skills. Using the PEERS for&#xD;
      Preschoolers (P4P) program, the study will examine the effect of PI and parental involvement&#xD;
      in a social skills intervention on children's acquisition and maintenance of social skills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parental Insightfulness (PI), the ability to see things from the child's point of view and to&#xD;
      think about the motives that underlie the child's behavior, promotes the development of the&#xD;
      child's socio-emotional competence and her ability to have productive and sustaining&#xD;
      relationships. PI may be even more central in the case of young children with Autism Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder (ASD), who struggle to socially communicate their needs and their mental and&#xD;
      emotional states. Previous research showed PI predicts adaptive child functioning and&#xD;
      demonstrated the merit of PI both as a moderator and as a mediator of treatment outcomes in&#xD;
      interventions that aim to promote PI and parent-child interaction. However, PI's effects on&#xD;
      the child's peer-interaction have not been tested. Intervention research in ASD has evolved&#xD;
      from the examination of treatment effectiveness to the pursuit of treatment mediators and&#xD;
      moderators, that could be utilized for treatment individualization. Since parents play a&#xD;
      central role in intervention programs for their children with ASD, examining modifiable&#xD;
      parent factors as mediators and moderators of treatment effectiveness could contribute to&#xD;
      this line of research. The proposed study aims to test how pre intervention PI and&#xD;
      intervention-related changes in PI affect parents' ability to support their children in the&#xD;
      acquisition of peer-interaction skills. Using the PEERS for Preschoolers (P4P) program, a&#xD;
      parent assisted social skills training program for young children with ASD, the study will&#xD;
      examine the effect of PI and parental involvement in a social skills intervention on&#xD;
      children's acquisition and maintenance of social skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims will be tested in the following ways: 1) A randomized controlled trial will&#xD;
      compare the effects of the parent-mediated P4P program to those of a P4P program with minimal&#xD;
      parent involvement (P4P-mpi) on the outcome and the maintenance of gains in child social&#xD;
      skills and on PI. 2) an examination of the role of pretreatment PI as a moderator of&#xD;
      children's intervention-related social skills gains and their maintenance, and 3) an&#xD;
      examination of the role of treatment related change in PI as a mediator of children's&#xD;
      intervention-related social skills gains and their maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include 80 young children with ASD, aged 4-7, and their parents, who will be&#xD;
      randomized into a P4P treatment group and a P4P-mpi control group. Participants will be&#xD;
      tested pre- and post- a 16-week intervention period, as well as 10 weeks later, for follow&#xD;
      up. Measures will include a behavioral microanalytic assessment of a peer play interaction&#xD;
      and parental insightfulness assessment, a parental reflective functioning questionnaire, and&#xD;
      social skills questionnaires filled out by parents and teachers. This study may promote the&#xD;
      yet limited research on parent-mediated social skills interventions in young children with&#xD;
      ASD and shed light on the role of parental insightfulness in children's treatment-related&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
