  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wider research context: Since the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019, there are now&#xD;
      over 126 million COVID-19 cases worldwide with more than 2.7 million deaths. Reports on&#xD;
      neurological manifestations vary in prevalence rates (6-84%) and range from mild (headache,&#xD;
      hyposmia, myalgia) to severe (encephalopathy, strokes, seizures). Little is known about&#xD;
      long-term neurological outcomes of COVID-19 patients. The investigators propose a structured&#xD;
      protocol to capture persistent and delayed neurological manifestations, neurocognitive&#xD;
      deficits and quality of life (QoL) 3 and 12 months after COVID-19. Objectives: The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that neurological manifestations and neuropsychological/cognitive&#xD;
      deficits can be detected after COVID-19, substantially impact on patients' QoL and can be&#xD;
      correlated with structural neuroimaging findings. Main objectives are to assess firstly&#xD;
      long-term prevalence rates and natural history of neurological manifestations, secondly&#xD;
      neuropsychological/cognitive deficits after COVID-19, thirdly the impact of COVID-19 on&#xD;
      measures of mental health, QoL and functional outcome, fourthly to correlate neurological&#xD;
      manifestations and distinct neurocognitive deficits with structural MRI abnormalities, and&#xD;
      Fifthly to compare these results to age- and sex matched controls hospitalized with pneumonia&#xD;
      (Cpneum) and to healthy controls for MRI-data (Chealthy). Approach: The investigators aim to&#xD;
      enrol at least 225 patients with COVID-19, in addition to 50 Cpneum and 80 Chealthy. COVID-19&#xD;
      patients will include (group Oóne) outpatients presenting to the hospital, (group two)&#xD;
      in-patients not requiring ICU admission, and (group three) patients admitted to the ICU. The&#xD;
      investigators will not include asymptomatic patients, patients not presenting to the&#xD;
      hospital, and those who do not consent to participate. The standardized protocol includes a&#xD;
      firstly a structured neurological examination, secondly olfactory testing, thirdly assessment&#xD;
      of QoL, mental health and functional outcome at 3 and 12 months, and fourthly screening for&#xD;
      cognitive deficits (at 3 months) and a structured neuropsychological testing (at 12 months)&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients and controls. In a subset of at least 120 COVID-19 patients and 50&#xD;
      controls (Cpneum) high field MRI will be performed at 3 and 12 months. Innovation: The&#xD;
      investigators aim to quantify COVID-19 related and specific neurological manifestations and&#xD;
      their impact on the individual health condition. The novelty lies in the prospective design,&#xD;
      the longitudinal follow-up including and the inclusion of a control group which allows us to&#xD;
      explore the natural history of COVID-19 related neurological manifestations. Preliminary&#xD;
      analysis of our ongoing 3-month follow-up suggests persistent neurological manifestations and&#xD;
      a significant impact of COVID-19 on mental health, cognition and QoL. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that our study results likely influence the long-term care of COVID-19 patients and&#xD;
      help to identify those, who need further neuro-rehabilitative support&#xD;

        We aim to include a full dataset of at least 180 patients undergoing 3- and 12-month&#xD;
        follow-up. Due to an estimated dropout rate of ~20%, approximately 225 patients are planned&#xD;
        to be included in 3-month follow-up. Out of these, we estimate to include a minimum of 50&#xD;
        patients in each of the 3 pre-defined groups, which is feasible based on the preliminary&#xD;
        analysis of patient distribution: severe patients: 25%, moderate patients: 50% and mild&#xD;
        patients: 25%. In addition, we aim to include at least 120 patients in the MRI sub-study.&#xD;
        For the control group, we plan to include 50 age- and sex matched patients (n=25 normal&#xD;
        ward, n=25 ICU admission) who undergo the same 3- and 12-month study protocol including MR&#xD;
        imaging and neurocognitive testing as COVID-19 patients. Out of these, we expect an&#xD;
        estimated dropout rate of ~10% at the 12-month follow-up resulting in 40 patients who will&#xD;
        completely finish the study protocol.&#xD;
