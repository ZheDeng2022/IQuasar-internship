  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attachment theory models the emotional bonding that is activated in situations of danger, via&#xD;
      mental representations of self and others. Four types of attachment (TA) exist in adults: 3&#xD;
      insecure (Preoccupied, Detached, Fearful) and 1 secure. Attachment type is a major factor in&#xD;
      the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a frequent and disabling mental&#xD;
      disorder that occurs after a traumatic event. A meta-analysis based on Anglo-Saxon studies&#xD;
      including various populations (general, military or clinical) (n=9268 patients) suggested an&#xD;
      association between Fearful BP and high level of PTSD symptoms (r=0.44). Nevertheless, these&#xD;
      results did not allow the identification of variations related to the individual risk factors&#xD;
      (RDFs) of the subject and his environment, especially in the French socio-cultural context.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study the association between LDs and the risk of PTSD in the&#xD;
      days following exposure, their mutual influence in the months following, and their associated&#xD;
      factors. Thus, a prospective cohort study among French adult victims of a traumatic event&#xD;
      could objectify the link between BP - as close as possible to the event - and the risk of&#xD;
      PTSD.&#xD;

    <description>The IES-R consists of a list of 22 symptoms of PTSD. The person indicates the intensity with which each symptom has manifested itself over the past 7 days, by self-reporting their response on a 5-point Lykert-type scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 ( &quot;Extremely&quot;). The total IES-R score is calculated by adding the values obtained for the 22 items (scores 0-88).</description>

    <description>The questionnaires (attachement type, PTSD symptoms) are administered face to face at the inclusion visit (at D0-D3). Validated self-questionnaires in French will be sent to the patients, either electronically or by post, according to their choice at D30 and D90. To describe the characteristics of the subjects, socio-demographic data, lifestyle, and medical history will be collected. The questionnaires will be administered three times to study the evolution of the parameters over time.</description>
