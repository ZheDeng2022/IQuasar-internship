  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DCR-AUD is being developed for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adults using an&#xD;
      RNA interference (RNAi) technology platform. This is a 24-week, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single-ascending&#xD;
      doses (SAD) of DCR-AUD administered to adult HVs. The single doses of DCR-AUD will be&#xD;
      administered to adult HVs across 4 sequential cohorts (3 planned [80 mg, 240 mg, 480 mg] and&#xD;
      one optional [960 mg]). Each cohort will comprise a sentinel group of 3 participants (2&#xD;
      active, 1 placebo) and an expanded group of 6 participants (4 active, 2 placebo). The&#xD;
      sentinel group will be followed for the assessment of safety and tolerability and&#xD;
      characterization of PK but who will not undergo any EIAs. Participants will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of study intervention on Day 1 and will be followed for 24 weeks. Participants who have&#xD;
      positive ethanol reaction symptoms at the Day 169 EIA (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or substantial&#xD;
      flushing) will return every 28 (±7) days for follow-up EIAs until the positive ethanol&#xD;
      reaction symptoms abate. These conditional follow-up (CFU) EIAs will not require overnight&#xD;
      admission to the clinic, but all other aspects of the EIA will be conducted (see Table 3).&#xD;
      Participants will be observed for not less than 6 hours after ethanol administration and will&#xD;
      not be discharged until the Investigator deems it medically safe to do so.&#xD;
