    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      characterized by irreversible airway limitation. In recent studies with musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system disorders in chronic respiratory patients, it has been reported that postural control&#xD;
      is affected in COPD patients.It has been observed that balance systems, functional balance&#xD;
      tests, posturography, posture assessment systems, force platform and inclinometer&#xD;
      measurements are used in studies on postural control assessment in COPD patients.There are a&#xD;
      limited number of studies in which devices that objectively present the degree of deviation&#xD;
      in spinal curves are used in patients with COPD, and posture and lung volume and capacities&#xD;
      are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the changes in spine structure and&#xD;
      mobility in COPD patients and to reveal their relationship with static and dynamic lung&#xD;
      volumes and capacities.&#xD;

    <description>The respiratory functions of the participants will be measured in accordance with the ATS-ERS criteria. After measurement; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), inspiratory capacity (IC), vital capacity (VC) parameters will be recorded.&#xD;
Spinal structure and mobility will be evaluated with the Spinal Mouse device in the sagittal and frontal planes in standing and sitting positions. For the sagittal plane, the measurements were first in the neutral, then in the maximum flexion and extension positions, for the frontal plane; neutral, right and left lateral flexions will be performed.&#xD;
Patients will be asked to mark the level of activity that causes dyspnea on the Medical Council Research Scale (MMRC) Dyspnea Score.</description>
