  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which data collected from the past of patients with&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NVAF is a condition in which patients suffer from irregular and often rapid heartbeats which&#xD;
      are not caused by a heart valve problem. NVAF can lead to thromboembolism, a condition that&#xD;
      happens when a blood clot forms in the body and travels through the blood stream to plug&#xD;
      another vessel. To prevent thromboembolism doctors often prescribe a blood thinner&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with NVAF that receive a blood thinner, it is common that the kidneys' ability to&#xD;
      work properly, also called the kidney function, decreases. This may increase the risk of&#xD;
      stroke, a condition which occurs when a vessel supplying blood to the brain is blocked and&#xD;
      the risk of bleeding. It is therefore important to maintain the kidneys' ability to work&#xD;
      properly in these patients who are treated with blood thinners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the beginning, only one blood thinner that could be given as a tablet by mouth was&#xD;
      available. This blood thinner was called warfarin. Over the years, further medications have&#xD;
      become available, for example dabigatran or rivaroxaban. There is some evidence that a&#xD;
      decrease of the kidney function is more common with warfarin than with dabigatran or&#xD;
      rivaroxaban. For other similar new treatments however, evidence is missing or conflicting.&#xD;
      There also could be other relevant factors such as the kidney function before the start of&#xD;
      treatment or the patient's genes/origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers want to collect more data to compare two different blood thinner&#xD;
      medications, rivaroxaban and warfarin. The main goal is to see whether there is a difference&#xD;
      between the two treatments regarding the kidneys' ability to work properly. To find this out,&#xD;
      the researchers will compare the number of patients in each group who developed chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease stage 5 (close to or corresponding to chronic kidney failure), had a kidney&#xD;
      transplant or needed to undergo long term dialysis. In addition, data is collected and&#xD;
      compared about the patients' age, gender, weight, height and whether they had other related&#xD;
      medical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect information from the health records from the Korean National Health&#xD;
      Insurance Corporation (NHIC) database. Besides this data collection, no further tests or&#xD;
      examinations are planned in this study. Researchers will look at the health information from&#xD;
      adult men and women in Korea who were diagnosed with NVAF between January 2013 and December&#xD;
      2017. They will study data of the patients who did not receive any medication with blood&#xD;
      thinners in past 24 months before starting rivaroxaban and warfarin treatment between January&#xD;
      2015 and December 2017. They will follow up all the participants until December 2018.&#xD;
