    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine whether the administration of the TQL block cause motor&#xD;
      block of the lumbar plexus and thereby quadriceps muscle weakness. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesise that the administration of a unilateral TQL block does not cause quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle weakness compared to a placebo block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ideal postoperative analgesic regimen following major abdominal and retroperitoneal&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery still lacks consensus and the discussion is ongoing. The epidural&#xD;
      blockade has been the gold standard for postoperative pain management for major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery for years, but with the conversion to minimal invasive surgery the procedure can&#xD;
      rarely be justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a multimodal analgesic regimen with opioids can cause severe side effects. These&#xD;
      side effects can delay mobilisation after surgery, increase the risk of complications and&#xD;
      worst of all be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus on an opioid sparing regimen, in the enhanced recovery setting, has been a&#xD;
      significant motivator for the addition of ultrasound-guided nerve blocks to the perioperative&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Department of Anaesthesiology, Zealand University Hospital, the ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum (TQL) block is part of the perioperative pain regimen for&#xD;
      major laparoscopic abdominal and retroperitoneal surgeries, as well as for elective caesarean&#xD;
      sections. Using the visual guidance of ultrasound, the injectate of local anaesthetic is&#xD;
      administered in the fascial interspace between the quadratus lumborum muscle and the psoas&#xD;
      major muscle posterior to the transversalis fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will anaesthetise the abdominal wall including both somatic and visceral nerves. No&#xD;
      involvement of lumbar plexus i.e. the femoral nerve, obturator nerve or the lumbar part of&#xD;
      the sympathetic trunk was observed. The lack of lumbar plexus involvement means no motor&#xD;
      block of the lower extremities should be observed. Previous clinical studies reported no&#xD;
      adverse events. However, the investigators did not specifically register lower limb weakness&#xD;
      or hypotension, but on the other hand did not find any difference in ambulation or even&#xD;
      faster ambulation compared to the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few case reports have reported complications related to the various quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      blocks. Ueshima et al. reported that 90% (65/81 cases) experienced quadriceps muscle weakness&#xD;
      following a TQL block. The incidence was 19% for posterior QL block and 1% for lateral QL&#xD;
      block. Lower limb weakness was also reported by Wikner et al. following a bilateral lateral&#xD;
      QL block. A case of continuous hypotension after administration of a lateral QL block has&#xD;
      been described. One case of unilateral upper limb weakness and Horners Syndrome after a&#xD;
      bilateral posterior QL block has also been reported. Urinary retention was reported following&#xD;
      a continuous TQL-block. All side effects were temporary, no one reported permanent injuries.&#xD;
      Complications have not been reported systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, the investigators have administrated more than 1000&#xD;
      TQL blocks, and more than 300 patients have been included in various clinical trials. From&#xD;
      clinical experience and cadaveric studies, the investigators find no evidence that the TQL&#xD;
      block spread to the epidural space, and therefore does not cause sympathetic symptoms.&#xD;
      Neither does the TQL block spread to the lumbar plexus, and therefore does not cause motor&#xD;
      weakness of the lower extremities. However these notions have never been properly&#xD;
      investigated in a controlled clinical setting, meaning that the investigators cannot entirely&#xD;
      rule out the possibility of a spread to the lumbar plexus and thus ensuing quadriceps muscle&#xD;
      weakness. This calls for a more in-depth investigation of this potential phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether the administration of the TQL block&#xD;
      cause motor block of the lumbar plexus and thereby quadriceps muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to block administration all participants are tested using the same motor tests as after&#xD;
      the block administration(baseline tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive two TQL blocks. To keep participants and outcome assessors&#xD;
      blinded the study drug for each side will be randomised i.e. active treatment on one side and&#xD;
      placebo on the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the administration of a unilateral TQL block does not&#xD;
      cause quadriceps muscle weakness compared to a placebo block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fascial plane nerve blocks demand a great volume of local anaesthetic to achieve the right&#xD;
      spread of local anaesthetic and thus a sufficient analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correct concentration and volume of local anaesthetic is still debated. Studies measuring&#xD;
      serum concentrations of local anaesthetic are rare due to time consumption and high costs.&#xD;
      When administering a unilateral TQL block a volume of 30 ml local anaesthetic is used often&#xD;
      equal to the maximum single-shot dose of ropivacaine; i.e. 225 milligrams. In previous&#xD;
      studies and in the usual clinical setting the investigators have never experienced any signs&#xD;
      of systemic toxicity, however the maximum serum concentration of local anaesthetic following&#xD;
      TQL block administration has never been investigated. The maximum serum ropivacaine&#xD;
      concentration following administration of a TQL block will therefore be investigated for all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
