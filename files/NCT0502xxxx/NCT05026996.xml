             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to dosing of study&#xD;

             on ≥ 5 days/month) or heavy drinking (≥ 8 drinks/week in females or &gt; 15 drinks/week&#xD;
             in males). A &quot;drink&quot; definition includes: 12 ounces of 5% beer, 8 ounces of 7% malt&#xD;
