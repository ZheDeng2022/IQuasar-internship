  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A parallel-group treatment, five-centre, participant and investigator masked, three-arm study&#xD;
      to assess the safety and effectiveness of dexmedetomidine or clonidine infusion compared to&#xD;
      placebo for the prevention of delirium and cognitive decline in male and female participants&#xD;
      aged 70+ scheduled for open heart surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a major public health concern without therapeutic options. It is an acute&#xD;
      disturbance of attention and cognition, precipitated by an acute somatic condition. Delirious&#xD;
      patients are often subject to off-label treatment with psychotropic drugs that have dubious&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intravenous alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine, attenuating sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system activity, shows promise as treatment for delirium, but its use is limited to&#xD;
      intensive care units (ICU). Its long-term cognitive effects are unknown. Clonidine is a&#xD;
      pharmacodynamically similar drug that can be given orally and has been used for decades as an&#xD;
      antihypertensive agent, but is else sparsely studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALPHA2PREVENT will be a three-armed randomised controlled trial to study 1) whether&#xD;
      repurposing of clonidine can represent a novel treatment option for delirium, and 2) the&#xD;
      possible effects of both dexmedetomidine and clonidine on long-term cognitive trajectories,&#xD;
      motor activity patterns, patient rated outcome measures and biomarkers of neuronal injury.&#xD;
