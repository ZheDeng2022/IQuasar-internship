  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The estimated prevalence of hip joint pain is 7% in men and 10% in women over the age of 45&#xD;
      years.Although physical therapy and weight loss, use of walking aids (such as walking sticks)&#xD;
      and analgesic agents are used as conservative treatment methods, these methods usually&#xD;
      provide short-term and partial benefits.The anterior sensory innervation of the hip joint is&#xD;
      provided by the articular branches of the femoral and obturatory nerve. Denervation of the&#xD;
      articular branches of the femoral and obturator nerves with the radiofrequency&#xD;
      thermocoagulation (RFT) method is a method used in chronic hip pain. In this study, we aimed&#xD;
      to show the decrease in pain levels and the effect on quality of life of patients who&#xD;
      underwent hip RFT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip pain is a common medical condition with increasing age.The effectiveness of conservative&#xD;
      methods used in hip pain is limited.Since the lifespan of prostheses used in hip surgery is&#xD;
      limited, new methods are needed in the treatment of pain.The anterior sensory innervation of&#xD;
      the hip joint is provided by the articular branches of the femoral and obturatory nerve.&#xD;
      Denervation of the articular branches of the femoral and obturator nerves with the&#xD;
      radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFT) method is a method used in chronic hip pain.In&#xD;
      previous studies with small groups, it was shown that radiofrequency thermocoagulation&#xD;
      procedure caused 50% reduction in hip pain between 1-11 months.Hip joint radiofrequency&#xD;
      thermocoagulation is a procedure applied in our clinic. In this study, we aimed to show the&#xD;
      decrease in pain levels and the effect on quality of life of patients who underwent hip RFT.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Radiofrequency thermal coagulation of articular branches of femoral and obturator nerves</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients are operated under sedation in the operating room. C-arm fluoroscopy device is used for imaging purposes for radiofrequency thermocoagulation process. In order to prevent vascular injury, the needle is advanced under the guidance of ultrasonography. There are target points determined in fluoroscopy for the femoral nerve and the obturatory nerve. Before the thermocoagulation procedure, local anesthetic and steroid are injected into each of the target points. Patients who do not have any complications after the procedure and who are mobilized are discharged in the 2nd hour.</description>
