      Women living with HIV are unsufficiently screened for cervix cancer although they have a&#xD;
      higher risk of developping it, resulting of many obstacles. Offering a new screening&#xD;
      technique, more accessible and which doesn't require gynecologic examination, could help&#xD;
      improving this coverage rate. HPV screening have a higher-performance for cervix cancer than&#xD;
      smear test. Self-collected vaginal swabs are as efficient as vaginal swabs collected by&#xD;
      clinicians. They are also proved acceptable among general population but only one study in&#xD;
      South Africa is about women living with HIV. The main hypothesis is that self-collected&#xD;
      vaginal swabs are also acceptable among women living with HIV in the CoreVIH IDF Nord cohort.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer (10% of all cancers), in 2012:&#xD;
      528,000 cases and 266,000 deaths. In France, in 2012, the incidence is estimated at 6.7 per&#xD;
      100,000 women, with 3,028 new cases per year and 1,102 deaths. Screening for cervical cancer&#xD;
      is a public health issue because cancer affects young, healthy women and early detection is&#xD;
      available. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV (Human Papillomavirus) is responsible for&#xD;
      the development of pre-cancerous lesions and cervical cancer. There are more than a hundred&#xD;
      genotypes of HPV identified. Among them, HPV 16 and 18 are the genotypes most often&#xD;
      associated with cancer. The natural history of cervical cancer has led to the definition of&#xD;
      several ways to prevent the development of cancer, such as vaccination to prevent infection,&#xD;
      screening for infection using HPV virological tests that detect DNA, and cervical smears to&#xD;
      detect precancerous or cancerous lesions. In France, in the general population, screening is&#xD;
      done by smear test performed by a clinician or in a biological laboratory for cytological&#xD;
      analysis. The recommendations of the French Health Authority (HAS) are to perform a smear&#xD;
      test every three years, after two normal smears one year apart from 25 to 65 years of age,&#xD;
      except in women who have never had sexual intercourse and those who have had a hysterectomy&#xD;
      with removal of the cervix. Since July 2019, the HAS has introduced in its recommendations&#xD;
      for cervical cancer screening the use of HPV testing, which must now replace the cytological&#xD;
      examination from the age of 30 years and must be performed 3 years after the last cytological&#xD;
      examination with a normal result and then every 5 years in case of negativity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test can be offered as a vaginal self-sampling for women who are not or insufficiently&#xD;
      screened. Women living with HIV are part of this population and are included in these&#xD;
      recommendations. Other countries such as the Netherlands have included virological analysis&#xD;
      in their strategy: in 2011 the health authorities have decided to use HPV self-tests in&#xD;
      primary care instead of FCU. In 2016, the recommendation in the Netherlands is to perform an&#xD;
      HPV test every 5 years from 30 to 60 years of age. In case of a positive HPV test, an FCU is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virological tests can be carried out on vaginal swabs by hetero or self-sampling or on urine&#xD;
      samples. In HIV patients, earlier screening is recommended because of the increased risk of&#xD;
      developing cancerous lesions as a result of immunosuppression. The Morlat Report (2013)&#xD;
      recommends an annual smear test as soon as seropositivity is discovered, with no upper age&#xD;
      limit. France has individual and unorganized screening (such as breast or colon cancer) with&#xD;
      incomplete coverage. According to HAS data in 2010, only 8% of women eligible for smear&#xD;
      screening have an adequate follow-up rate. 52% of women aged 25-65 are not screened at all or&#xD;
      have smears too far apart (more than 3 years). A majority of cases of cervical cancer are&#xD;
      diagnosed in France in women participating irregularly or not participating in individual&#xD;
      screening. The tests are based on the detection of HPV on a sample of the cervix. The&#xD;
      virological technique is already recommended in the triage of smear test with atypical&#xD;
      squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Several types of self-samples are&#xD;
      currently available. Studies show a good level of agreement for all vaginal swabs using HPV&#xD;
      testing by PCR technique (dry swab, swab with liquid transport medium). The different studies&#xD;
      that have tested the acceptability of HPV self-sampling in the general population show good&#xD;
      acceptability; between 66 and 94% acceptability depending on the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use could be interesting in the first instance to catch up with women who have not been&#xD;
      screened due to the hindrance of gynaecological examination or the constraint of a medical&#xD;
      consultation. In a French study, the APACHE project, the proposal of self-sampling in&#xD;
      unscreened women had increased participation in cervical cancer screening. The use of&#xD;
      self-sampling improves participation in screening by sending the kits to women who are not&#xD;
      up-to-date in their smear test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study conducted among HIV-infected women in South Africa in 2015, there was 90%&#xD;
      acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The APACHE project is a series of studies carried out in France between 2009 and 2014 on the&#xD;
      subject whose two objectives were to evaluate the performance of self-sampling for the&#xD;
      detection of cervical HPV infection and to assess the effectiveness on participation of&#xD;
      sending a self-sampling kit to the homes of undetected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous medical thesis showed that 54% of patients followed up at the CoreVIH Ile de&#xD;
      France Nord had a smear that was less than two years old (9). The idea is therefore to&#xD;
      explore alternative options for these women who are being followed at CoreVIH Ile de France&#xD;
      Nord but who are not being screened at the recommended rate.&#xD;
