  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be done to investigate the effectiveness of a 24-week multidomain&#xD;
      intervention program consisting of cognitive training, exercise, nutrition management,&#xD;
      vascular disease risk factor management, social activity, and motivational enhancement on the&#xD;
      cognitive function compared to the control group in mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physical exercise program will consist of aerobic exercise, exercise to enhance balance&#xD;
      and flexibility, muscle-strengthening activities involving major muscle groups, and&#xD;
      finger-toe movements. Cognitive training targets the cognitive domains of episodic memory,&#xD;
      executive function, attention, working memory, calculation, and visuospatial function.&#xD;
      Cognitive training will be conducted using a tablet-based application. Participants will be&#xD;
      advised to eat something according to the recommendation of the MIND diet. They will also&#xD;
      meet the study nurse every 4 weeks for anthropometric measurements and monitoring of smoking&#xD;
      and alcohol intake. The purpose of the motivational enhancement program is to induce,&#xD;
      maintain, and strengthen motivation, which is a psychological resource to help maintain&#xD;
      dementia prevention activities.&#xD;
