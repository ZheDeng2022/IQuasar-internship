      with mFOLFOX x9 cycles in combination with AB928 and AB122. Patients will thereafter be&#xD;
      assessed for therapeutic responses (week 22-24) with a digital rectal examination, pelvic&#xD;
      MRI, and endoscopy. Each case will be reviewed by the Weill Cornell Medicine Colorectal&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary Tumor Board for consensus agreement regarding clinical treatment response.&#xD;
      The patients thereafter will proceed with total mesorectal excision (TME, week 24) by&#xD;
      transabdominal resection for pathologic evaluation (primary tumor and pelvic lymph nodes will&#xD;
      be examined).&#xD;
