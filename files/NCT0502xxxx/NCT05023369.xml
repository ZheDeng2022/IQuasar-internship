  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to evaluate if periarticular corticosteroid injection during&#xD;
      endoprothesis implantation can lead to any advantage to the patients, namely if it can reduce&#xD;
      post-operative pain, lenght and cost of hospitalisation, use of analgesics drugs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip endoprothesis is a common orthopaedic prosthetic procedure, with continuously growing&#xD;
      numbers in the last years, and the demand for this procedure is predicted to increase 4-fold&#xD;
      by 2030. Recently, major interest has been given to improve postoperative pain management, to&#xD;
      decrease the discomfort of the patients and with an outlook for reducing the length of&#xD;
      hospital stay and decrease health-care costs. However, postoperative pain management is still&#xD;
      problematic after this operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain control with the optimization of the analgesia protocol is a key aspect&#xD;
      to be addressed to reduce the need for opioid analgesics, to quicken recovery and&#xD;
      mobilisation, and to decrease the hospitalization length. To this regard, steroid&#xD;
      supplementation is considered effective in decreasing post-operative pain. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis from our research group on patients with total knee prosthesis proved the&#xD;
      efficacy in decreasing post-operative pain. Moreover, a positive effect has been documented&#xD;
      in terms of lower incidence of nausea and vomit, less post-operative range of motion&#xD;
      limitation, and decreased systemic inflammatory response. All these benefits produced a&#xD;
      shortened length of hospital stay without an increased risk of complications such as local&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this overall positive effect of steroid supplementation, and their use by other&#xD;
      specialties - e.g. anaesthesiology - and while there is now good evidence about the benefits&#xD;
      of periarticular hip analgesic injection, e.g. FANS, opioid etc., there is still lacking&#xD;
      evidence on the efficacy of periarticular corticosteroids in patients undergoing hip&#xD;
      prosthetic replacement. In fact, there is a lack of information in the literature on their&#xD;
      effectiveness in terms of pain management and function recovery. Furthermore, the influence&#xD;
      of perioperative steroid application on the long-term follow-up results is poorly explored.&#xD;
      This is a key issue, since the intensity of acute post-operative pain has been widely related&#xD;
      to the risk of developing chronic post-operative pain, and thus the advantages of steroid&#xD;
      supplementation, could go beyond the short-term pain relief and be even longer lasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will thus investigate the benefit of implementing the&#xD;
      peri-operative analgesia protocol not only to improve the acute post-operative recovery and&#xD;
      shorten the hospital stay, but also to optimize the overall results after hip endoprosthesis.&#xD;
