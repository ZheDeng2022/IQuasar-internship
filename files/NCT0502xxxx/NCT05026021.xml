  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BKvirus associated nephropathy (BKvAN) is a major complication in kidney transplantation. Due&#xD;
      to BKvirus (BKv) intra-graft replication, BKvAN affects nearly 10% of patients and causes&#xD;
      graft loss in more than 50% of cases. Without current antiviral therapy, the treatment&#xD;
      consists of minimizing immunosuppression, secondarily exposing the patient to a graft&#xD;
      rejection risk. Impaired BKv specific T cell response plays a crucial role in the BKvAN&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Several teams, including ours, have demonstrated a profound impairment of&#xD;
      BKv specific T cell response during BKvAN. Immunovirological monitoring allows an individual&#xD;
      assessment of viral reactivation risk based on the anti-viral immune response. Our group has&#xD;
      developed the NEPHROVIR method. This non-invasive biological method for BKvAN allows the&#xD;
      identification of BKvAN risk level. The aim of this work is to evaluate, by the NEPHROVIR&#xD;
      method, the risk to develop a BKvAN with renal impairment in kidney transplant recipients&#xD;
      with sustained BKv viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the BKVIR study. This is a prospective multicentric study involving&#xD;
      100 kidney transplant recipients with sustained BKv viremia. The aim of this work is to&#xD;
      evaluate the NEPHROVIR method as an innovative immunovirological surveillance method for&#xD;
      predicting the risk of BKvAN occurrence. The characterization of individual BKvAN risk level&#xD;
      could help in the individualized follow-up and management of immunosuppression in patients.&#xD;
      The long-term objective would be to diagnose very early, or even anticipate, the occurrence&#xD;
      of BKvAN and to allow early readjustment of the immunosuppressive treatment.&#xD;

      BKvirus associated nephropathy (BKvAN) is a major complication in kidney transplantation. Due&#xD;

      graft loss in more than 50% of cases. Without current antiviral therapy, the treatment&#xD;

      rejection risk. Impaired BKv specific T cell response plays a crucial role in the BKvAN&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Several teams, including ours, have demonstrated a profound impairment of&#xD;
      BKv specific T cell response during BKvAN. Immunovirological monitoring allows an individual&#xD;
      assessment of viral reactivation risk based on the anti-viral immune response. Our group has&#xD;

      identification of BKvAN risk level. The aim of this work is to evaluate, by the NEPHROVIR&#xD;
      method, the risk to develop a BKvAN with renal impairment in kidney transplant recipients&#xD;
      with sustained BKv viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the BKVIR study. This is a prospective multicentric study involving&#xD;
      100 kidney transplant recipients with sustained BKv viremia. Four kidney transplant centers&#xD;
      (APHP hospitals) will participate to the study. To ensure sustained BKv viremia, only kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients with a confirmed plasma BKv viral load ≥ 103 copies/ml on 2 consecutive&#xD;
      blood BKv PCR values for a duration ≥ 1 month will be eligible for the study. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to correlate the occurrence of BKvAN with the results of the NEPHROVIR&#xD;
      method. The primary endpoint will be the occurrence of histologically proven BKvAN associated&#xD;
      with renal impairment within 12 months of the initial NEPHROVIR assessment. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints of this work are multiple, including the evaluation of the reconstitution delay of&#xD;
      BKv specific T cell response; as well as the evaluation of the NEPHROVIR method prognosis on&#xD;
      BKv infection and renal graft function. The expected duration of the research is 42 months.&#xD;
      The inclusion period will be 18 months. The duration of patient follow-up will be 24 months&#xD;
      post-inclusion. The NEPHROVIR method will be performed in the included patients at 3 distinct&#xD;
      points: at D0 of inclusion, at 3 months and 6 months of inclusion. The NEPHROVIR method&#xD;
      requires an additional and minimal collection of human body product (14 ml of whole blood)&#xD;
      from a peripheral venous blood sample. Statistical analyses will be performed at the end of&#xD;
      the follow-up period for all patients. All confidence intervals will be calculated at the 5%&#xD;
      first-species risk and the results of the statistical tests will be given at the 5% two-sided&#xD;
      threshold. The statistical analysis will be performed by the biostatisticien at the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit Paris Saclay, using SAS® software or R software in the last version at the time&#xD;
      of the analyses. The aim of this work is to evaluate the NEPHROVIR method as an innovative&#xD;
      immunovirological surveillance method for predicting the risk of BKvAN occurrence. The&#xD;
      characterization of individual BKvAN risk level could help in the individualized follow-up&#xD;
      and management of immunosuppression in patients. The long-term objective would be to diagnose&#xD;
      very early, or even anticipate, the occurrence of BKvAN and to allow early readjustment of&#xD;
      the immunosuppressive treatment.&#xD;
