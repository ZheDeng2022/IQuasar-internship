      Aim:The present study aims to evaluate the intervention effectiveness of the Healthcare Chief&#xD;
      Executive Officer mobile application in patients with type 1 diabetes transitioning from&#xD;
      adolescence to early adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A 9-month two-arm, parallel-group, single-blind, randomized controlled trial Methods:&#xD;
      Ninety-six Type-1 diabetes patients, aged 16-25 years, are expected to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental or control group by central&#xD;
      randomization. The Healthcare Chief Executive Officer app, which consists of the following&#xD;
      functions: data recording, knowledge, communication skills, food swap guide, exercise&#xD;
      recommendations, chatroom, reminders, and SOS, will be used as the intervention measure. We&#xD;
      will compare the differences in disease control outcomes, confidence in self-management,&#xD;
      self-care behaviors, emotional distress, quality of life, and specific diabetes-related&#xD;
      knowledge between the two groups before intervention and at 3, 6, and, 9 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. The differences within the experimental group pre- and post- intervention&#xD;
      will also be analyzed. This study design was approved by the ethics committee of the&#xD;
      researcher's affiliation in March 2021.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Blinding strategies include the following: (1) the statistician will not be allowed to disclose the randomization results to others; (2) after physician referral, the participant will be immediately ushered to a separate room to ensure that the caregiver does not receive information regarding the intervention content; and (3) participants of both the experimental and control groups will download the app, but app content will be different between the two groups. (4) research assistants will specially emphasize for all participants that app usage is beneficial for disease management.</masking_description>

    <description>Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS):The original questionnaire was developed by Wallston et al. (2007). It consists of 8 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree),The translated questionnaire has content validity, Cronbach's α, and test-retest reliability values of 0.75, 0.93, and 0.97, respectively.</description>

    <description>Self-care Behavior Assessment Scale: This scale was developed by Wang (2010) to measure self-care behaviors of adolescents with T1D. A total of 39 items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not achieved at all) to 5 (completely achieved). The total score ranges from 39 to 195, with higher scores indicating better self-care behaviors. Cronbach's α and the content validity index (CVI) value based on content rating by experts are 0.87 and 0.92, respectively.</description>

    <description>Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS): The original scale was developed by Polonsky et al. (2005). The Chinese version consists of 18 items across four subscales. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (no distress) to 4 (severely distressed), with higher scores indicating more severe emotional distress. Cronbach's α and test-retest reliability values of the DDS were 0.89 and 0.81, respectively (Liu et al., 2010).</description>

(1999).Higher scores are indicative of higher QOL. Cronbach's α and test-retest reliability values of the scale and subscales are within the ranges of 0.76-0.92 and 0.94-0.99, respectively.</description>

The total score ranges from 0 to 24 points.reliability and Cronbach's α values of 0.78 and 0.89, respectively (Hu et al., 2013)</description>
