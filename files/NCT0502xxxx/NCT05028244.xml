      This clinical trial is destinated to evaluate if the periodic screening for deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis by ultrasound of lower extremity in patients with intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      patients with COVID 19 impacts on mortality, ICU stay and total lenght of stay in the&#xD;
      hospital, along with other outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: COVID-19 has a high incidence of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), especially&#xD;
      pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with an even higher incidence&#xD;
      in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The presentation of these events is&#xD;
      related to an increase in mortality and the mean stay in the ICU. The impact of systematic&#xD;
      screening for asymptomatic lower extremity DVT in these patients has not been studied, so we&#xD;
      propose to carry out a clinical trial to assess its impact in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Serial DVT screening in patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 does not&#xD;
      improve survival, mean stay, or the incidence of symptomatic VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To study whether DVT screening in these patients has an impact on the incidence of&#xD;
      symptomatic VTE, mortality and average stay in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Non-blind randomized clinical trial on all patients aged 18 years or older admitted&#xD;
      to the ICU for COVID-19 with less than 72 hours elapsed since their admission to the unit.&#xD;
      Patients with DVT or PE will be excluded at the time of recruitment (all patients will be&#xD;
      ruled out by routine ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CT Angiography));&#xD;
      Pregnant patients, patients with a previous diagnosis of DVT or PE, and patients undergoing&#xD;
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) will also be excluded. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      into two arms at the time of inclusion: the screened group (Group 1) and the non-screened&#xD;
      group (Group 2). Group 1: patients who will be treated according to the usual ICU protocol&#xD;
      and, additionally, will undergo serial ultrasounds of the lower extremities twice a week&#xD;
      (Monday and Thursday). Group 2: they will be treated according to the usual ICU protocol and&#xD;
      no screening examinations will be performed. Patients will be followed until discharge from&#xD;
      the ICU or death and up to a maximum of 3 weeks. The incidence of symptomatic VTE will be&#xD;
      assessed, as well as all-cause mortality and days of stay in the ICU. Clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      variables will be collected from each patient for subsequent statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The thrombotic complications of COVID-19 are well described, as well as their high&#xD;
      incidence in critically ill patients. This work aims to clarify the current doubts about the&#xD;
      need for systematic DVT screening in these patients. If our hypothesis is verified, a limited&#xD;
      resource such as ultrasound of the lower limbs could be saved, as well as the use of the&#xD;
      necessary protection materials and, most importantly, avoid unnecessary exposure of health&#xD;
      personnel with the consequent risk that it represents for other professionals and patients.&#xD;
