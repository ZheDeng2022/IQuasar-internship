      The researchers are doing this study to find out whether E7820 is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      people with relapsed/refractory myeloid cancers with mutations in splicing factor genes.&#xD;
      Participants will have acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or&#xD;
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).&#xD;

        defined by OncoKB) or a nonsense or frameshift mutation in ZRSR2. A splicing factor&#xD;

&#xD;
        b. Refractory AML is defined as failure to achieve a CR, CRh, or CRi after one of the&#xD;
        following regimens: i. Two cycles of intensive induction chemotherapy with a cytarabine&#xD;
        containing regimen (e.g. 7+3, MEC, HIDAC, etc.) ii. Two cycles of HMA/venetoclax or&#xD;
        LDAC/glasdegib iii. 4 cycles of HMA monotherapy c. Relapsed MDS is defined as: i. Any&#xD;
        relapse after achieving an IWG defined response. d. Refractory MDS is defined as: i. For&#xD;
        patients with intermediate, high or very high risk disease by IPSS-R, the failure to&#xD;
        achieve a response (as per IWG 2006 criteria) after 4 cycles of HMA monotherapy or 2 cycles&#xD;
        of HMA + venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. For patients with very low and low risk disease by IPSS-R failure to achieve&#xD;
        hematologic improvement or loss of hematologic improvement after treatment with standard of&#xD;
        care agents such as ESAs, Luspatercept (for MDS with ringed sideroblasts) and lenalidomide&#xD;
        (for pts with a 5q-).&#xD;
&#xD;
        e. Relapsed CMML is defined as: i. Any relapse after achieving an IWG defined response. f.&#xD;
        Refractory CMML is defined as: i. Failure to achieve a response (as per IWG 2006 criteria)&#xD;
        after 4 cycles of HMA monotherapy or 2 cycles of HMA + venetoclax.&#xD;

             involvement by the patient's myeloid malignancy (in that case a cut off of ≤ 5 x ULN&#xD;
             will be used)&#xD;
