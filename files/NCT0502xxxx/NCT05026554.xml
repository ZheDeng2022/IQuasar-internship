    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine differences in skin morphological parameters between cohorts assessed with Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI). The HECSI scoring system incorporates both the extent and the intensity of the disease. Each hand will be divided into five areas (fingertips, fingers [except the tips], palms, back of hands and wrists). For each of these areas the intensity of the six following clinical signs: erythema, induration ‚ÅÑ papulation, vesicles, fissuring, scaling and oedema will be graded on the following scale: 0, no skin changes; 1, mild disease; 2, moderate and 3, severe. For each location (total of both hands) the affected area will be given a score from 0 to 4 (0, 0%; 1, 1-25%; 2, 26-50%; 3, 51-75% and 4, 76-100%) for the extent of clinical symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Determine disease severity impact on lifestyle</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate correlation of lifestyle with disease severity. Lifestyle information will be captured with type of occupation performed daily by the subject. In addition, tobacco product usage will be collected with information on history (length of usage) and rate (the frequency of usage).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine disease severity impact on quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate correlation of quality of life with disease severity. Quality of life will be captured with Dermatology Life Quality Index Questionnaire (DLQI). DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire used to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life of an affected person. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).</description>
