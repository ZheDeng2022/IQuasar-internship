    <textblock>
      Ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture is a well-known complication of urinary diversion which&#xD;
      occurs in 4-25% of patients. Recent study has yielded that radiation is a significant risk&#xD;
      factor for development of ureteroenteric stricture. The goal of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether intraoperative use of SPY fluorescent angiography during urinary diversion reduces&#xD;
      rate of ureteroenteric stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 215 patients who have undergone urinary diversion over the past 5&#xD;
      years as historic controls and compare ureteroenteric stricture rates to a prospective cohort&#xD;
      of patients in whom intraoperative SPY fluorescent angiography was used at the time of&#xD;
      urinary diversion to assess the anastomotic perfusion. This will include injection of ICG&#xD;
      intravenously as well as utilization of the SPY device to assess ureteral perfusion before&#xD;
      and after ureteroenteric anastomosis. Based on power analysis, this study will require&#xD;
      approximately 50 patients in our prospective group to detect a clinically significant&#xD;
      difference of 5% between groups. Data analysis plan includes the use of chi square test for&#xD;
      comparison of stricture rates between groups. Clinical outcomes will be followed&#xD;
      prospectively, with no amendment to standard follow-up per physician.&#xD;

      Ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture is a well-known complication of urinary diversion which&#xD;
      occurs in 4-25% of patients. Strictures present clinically with flank pain, decreased renal&#xD;
      function, pyelonephritis or may be asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally with progressive&#xD;
      hydronephrosis and renal impairment. Strictures are a cause of significant morbidity and&#xD;
      health care expenditure, as treatment necessitates procedural intervention and often several&#xD;
      inpatient admissions. Numerous studies have sought to identify risk factors for development&#xD;
      of ureteroenteric strictures as well as opportunities for technical approaches to reduce&#xD;
      stricture risk. Studies have demonstrated that Clavien-Dindo â‰¥ 3 complication and BMI were&#xD;
      associated with higher risk of stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemia of the anastomosis related to the tenuous ureteral blood supply is implicated in the&#xD;
      formation of ureteroenteric stricture. Basic science and animal data have established the&#xD;
      detrimental impact of radiation therapy on microvasculature. Radiation induced ureteral&#xD;
      ischemia in conjunction with periureteral fibrosis make preservation of distal ureteral blood&#xD;
      supply during urinary diversion tenuous and challenging. This is especially of concern in&#xD;
      patients requiring pelvic exenteration for colorectal or gynecological malignancy, which&#xD;
      often necessitate radiation therapy prior to surgical intervention. Radiation history is also&#xD;
      an important contributor commonly in patients undergoing benign diversion for radiation&#xD;
      cystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several groups have tested whether varied surgical methods may offer risk reduction. Surgical&#xD;
      anastomotic approach has not significantly impacted ureteroenteric stricture rate. However, a&#xD;
      more recent study suggests that intracorporeal diversion confers a higher risk of&#xD;
      ureteroenteric stricture. The gold standard for treatment of ureteroenteric stricture is open&#xD;
      repair with ureteral reimplantation. Open surgical repair has success of 92-100%, while&#xD;
      endoscopic management has success of 30-50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study demonstrated that through the use of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent&#xD;
      angiography while performing urinary diversion using the DaVinci robotic system, that they&#xD;
      were able to reduce stricture rates from 10.6% to 0%. Use of this technology allows the&#xD;
      surgeon to evaluate the vascular supply to the ureter as well as the newly created&#xD;
      ureteroenteric anastomosis. This significant reduction in complications has tremendous&#xD;
      implications for improvement in patient care and reduction of morbidity. Many patients are&#xD;
      not candidates for robotic urinary diversion and thus undergo open surgery. Fluorescent&#xD;
      angiography has also shown promise for decreasing ureteroenteric stricture rate in open&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
