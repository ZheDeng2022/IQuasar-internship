  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of mechanical low back pain&#xD;
      (LBP) associated with radiating leg pain. Conservative treatment, including exercise,&#xD;
      analgesic, and physical therapy, is regarded as the first-line treatment of LDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of back and hip&#xD;
      strengthening exercises combined with activities of daily living instructions (ADLIs) to&#xD;
      reduce pain intensity in patients with LDH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 70 patients with LDH were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (IG)&#xD;
      or the control group (CG). Patients in IG received different back and hip strengthening&#xD;
      exercises five days a week for six weeks. The patients in CG were treated with Naproxen (500&#xD;
      mg) and Baclofen (10 mg) tablet twice a day for three weeks, followed by hot moist&#xD;
      compression for the next three weeks. In addition, the patients in both groups were&#xD;
      instructed to follow the ADLIs during the intervention and at least 3 months after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The straight leg raising (SLR) test and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score were used to&#xD;
      evaluate the patients' pain intensity. Outcomes were measured at baseline, at three weeks,&#xD;
      and six weeks of the intervention. Patients were followed up after 3 months of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
