      The correct categorization of breast density is essential to adapt the diagnostic examination&#xD;
      to the needs of each patient. Assessment of breast density is performed visually by&#xD;
      radiologists. Some authors have detected that this method involves considerable intra and&#xD;
      interobserver variability. On the other hand, automated systems for measuring breast density&#xD;
      are becoming more and more frequent. Machine learning is a domain of Artificial Intelligence,&#xD;
      which comprises the process of developing systems with the ability to learn and make&#xD;
      predictions using data. These systems are designed to aid healthcare professional decision&#xD;
      making. In the present work, the multicenter study of external validation of a tool based on&#xD;
      deep learning for the categorization of mammographic breast density is proposed.&#xD;

      The correct categorization of breast density is essential to adapt the diagnostic examination&#xD;
      to the needs of each patient. Assessment of breast density is performed visually by&#xD;
      radiologists. Some authors have detected that this method involves considerable intra and&#xD;
      interobserver variability. On the other hand, automated systems for measuring breast density&#xD;
      are becoming more and more frequent. Consequently, in clinical practice, breast density is&#xD;
      reported from the assessment carried out by specialists with the support of these systems.&#xD;
      But there are few studies about the use, concordance and perception of usefulness of&#xD;
      professionals on these tools. A study carried out at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires&#xD;
      reported a moderate to almost perfect inter- and intra-observer agreement among radiologists&#xD;
      and a moderate concordance between the categorization carried out by experts and that carried&#xD;
      out by commercial software of a digital mammography machine. Machine learning is a domain of&#xD;
      Artificial Intelligence, which comprises the process of developing systems with the ability&#xD;
      to learn and make predictions using data. Once a system designed to aid healthcare&#xD;
      professional decision making is developed, it must be validated. In 2019, an internal&#xD;
      validation of a tool based on deep learning techniques was carried out for the automatic&#xD;
      categorization of mammographic breast density. The tool reached a very good interobserver&#xD;
      agreement, kappa = 0.64 (95% CI 0.58-0.69), when compared with the performance of the&#xD;
      professionals. It reached a sensitivity of 83.2 (CI: 76.9-88.3) and a specificity of 88.4&#xD;
      (83.9-92.0.) In the present work, the multicenter study of external validation of a tool&#xD;
      based on deep learning for the categorization of mammographic breast density is proposed. The&#xD;
      evaluation of this tool will be carried out in two external institutions: Hospital Alemán and&#xD;
      Fundación Científica del Sur.&#xD;

        The unit of analysis will be the bilateral mammographic images with mediolateral oblique&#xD;
        and craniocaudal views. The images selected for this study will be screening mammograms&#xD;
        performed at Saint John's Cancer Institute. The institution will select the images&#xD;
        according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The images will be extracted from the&#xD;
        institutional database retrospectively and will be anonymized without any personal data,&#xD;
        except for the age of the patient. These images will be stored in DICOM format, in a safe&#xD;
        place with restricted access limited only to the investigation team.&#xD;
