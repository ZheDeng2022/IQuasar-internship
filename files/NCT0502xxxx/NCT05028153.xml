  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial is to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of a three-day azithromycin treatment versus placebo treatment in children aged 1-5&#xD;
      years who are hospitalized due to asthma-like symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The children who are included must be have a known history with one or more previous episodes&#xD;
      of asthmatic symptoms and is currently / have received treatment with SABA as monotherapy or&#xD;
      SABA in combination with ICS and possibly LTRA. The primary purpose during hospitalization is&#xD;
      to replicate the results of our previous study, where it was shown that azithromycin&#xD;
      treatment significantly shortened the duration of the asthmatic episode. In this study,&#xD;
      hospitalized children who provide a more diverse group than the COPSAC2010 cohort will be&#xD;
      included. In addition, the study aims to focus on examining the individual response to&#xD;
      treatment. The expectation is that in the future the study will be able to contribute to&#xD;
      personal treatment based on the child's respiratory microbiome and / or immunological profile&#xD;
      so that only the children who will benefit from the azithromycin treatment will receive it.&#xD;
      The expectation is also that the study will contribute to an increased understanding of the&#xD;
      influence of bacteria on asthma-like episodes in preschool children, and thus will lead to an&#xD;
      evidence-based better treatment of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ‚óè that antibiotic treatment with azithromycin compared to placebo in the patient group aged&#xD;
      1-5 years, known with previous episode (s) with asthma-like symptoms and is currently / have&#xD;
      received treatment with SABA as monotherapy, or SABA in combination with ICS and possibly&#xD;
      LTRA, will lead to a significant reduction in the symptom burden and duration of the&#xD;
      asthmatic episode in days.&#xD;
