  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BTK participates in a variety of signal transduction of innate and adaptive immunity, and has&#xD;
      an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The impact of BTK&#xD;
      inhibitors on hematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases has been well studied. This&#xD;
      project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to report&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the selective BTK inhibitor Orelabrutinib in the management of&#xD;
      refractory ITP.&#xD;

      The investigators are undertaking a prospective, open-lable, multicentre trial of 40&#xD;
      refractory ITP adult patients in China. Eligible participants will receive Orelabrutinib in&#xD;
      50 mg po. qd, every 4 weeks for one cycle and it will be given 3 cycles. For non-responders&#xD;
      who were well tolerated at 12 weeks of follow-up, the treatment could be extended to 6&#xD;
      cycles. The treatment will be discontinued after 6 months without blood index reaction. In&#xD;
      order to report the efficacy and safety of Orelabrutinib in the management of refractory ITP,&#xD;
      platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms will be evaluated before and after treatments.&#xD;
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>Complete response was defined as a platelet count of 100×10⁹ cells per L or higher and an absence of bleeding. Partial response was defined as a platelet count of 30×10⁹ cells per L or higher, but less than 100×10⁹ cells per L, and at least a doubling of the baseline platelet count and an absence of bleeding. Platelet counts were confirmed on two separate occasions at least 7 days apart when defining complete response or partial response. No response was defined as a platelet count of less than 30×10⁹ cells per L, or less than two-times increase from baseline platelet count, or bleeding.</description>
