      SPEAR is a non-interventional / observational, prospective, multicenter study planned to be&#xD;
      conducted across ~ 30 sites in India, among HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC/MBC patients.&#xD;
      This being a non-interventional study, no investigational drug or intervention will be&#xD;
      administered as a part of the study participation. All the therapeutic decisions, as well as&#xD;
      the type and timing of disease monitoring, laboratory tests or medical procedures will be at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating physician and upon patient's consent. No visits will be&#xD;
      scheduled as a part of this non-interventional study, however, data by visits for variables&#xD;
      will be collected for all the enrolled patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overall, this study will have 2 parts (Part A and Part B). However, it is to be noted that,&#xD;
      these parts (Part A and Part B) are independent of each other and can run in parallel. The&#xD;
      purpose of the Part A of study is to determine the proportion of PIK3CA mutation positive&#xD;
      patients among the HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC/MBC diagnosed patients in India. The&#xD;
      Part B of the study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and tolerability of alpelisib&#xD;
      plus fulvestrant among men, pre-menopausal women (ovarian ablation) or post-menopausal women&#xD;
      who are PIK3CA mutation positive patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC/MBC&#xD;
      diagnosis among Indian population, in the real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A- This will involve enrolling of approximately 1200 patients (males, post-menopausal&#xD;
      women or pre-menopausal women who are receiving ovarian ablation) with a documented diagnosis&#xD;
      of HR-positive HER2-negative ABC/MBC. The data on PIK3CA mutation status will be collected&#xD;
      only for those patients who signs ICF for participation in the study. Once, patient signs&#xD;
      ICF, their samples will be sent for PIK3CA mutation status testing, that will be performed at&#xD;
      central laboratory and the results on mutation status will be reported to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B- This part aims to enroll approximately 200 patients who are PIK3CA mutation positive.&#xD;
      The patients enrolled into the Part B of the study can either be continued from Part A of the&#xD;
      study or be a direct enrollment into the Part B of the study. For the patient's entering&#xD;
      directly into Part B of the study, positive PIK3CA status should be available prior to study&#xD;
      entry. All the patients entering into part B of the study must be alpelisib treatment naïve.&#xD;
      The patients enrolled into Part B of the study, should have already been planned to receive&#xD;
      treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant, based on their treating physician's discretion and&#xD;
      upon patient's consent. The treatment decision by the physician are to be made independent of&#xD;
      the patient's inclusion in this observational study. During the Part B of the study, data by&#xD;
      visits for variables will be collected for the enrolled patients at every 3 months interval&#xD;
      (±1 month), if feasible or until a maximum of 24 months observational period or lost to&#xD;
      follow-up (End-of-study [EoS] assessment will be performed), or death, or disease&#xD;
      progression, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
