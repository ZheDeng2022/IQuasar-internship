      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant involves taking blood stem cells from a donor&#xD;
      and giving them to a recipient. The transplants are used to treat certain diseases and&#xD;
      cancers. Researchers want to see if the transplant can treat VEXAS Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if stem cell transplants can be successfully performed in people with VEXAS and even&#xD;
      improve the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-75 who have VEXAS Syndrome that has caused significant health problems and&#xD;
      standard treatment either has not worked or is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a chest x-ray. They will have an imaging scan of the head, chest,&#xD;
      abdomen, pelvis, and sinus. They will have a bone density scan. They will have a dental exam&#xD;
      and eye exam. They will meet with specialists. They will repeat some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the NIH hospital. They have a central venous catheter put&#xD;
      into a vein in the chest or neck. They will receive drugs to prepare their bone marrow for&#xD;
      the transplant. They may have total body irradiation. They will receive the donor stem cells&#xD;
      through the catheter. They will get other drugs to prevent complications and infections.&#xD;
      After discharge, they must stay in the DC area for 3 months for weekly study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits 30, 60, 100, 180, 210, 240, 300, and 360 days later.&#xD;
      After that, they will have yearly visits for 2 years and then be contacted yearly by&#xD;
      phone....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, investigators at the National Institutes of Health defined a new disease syndrome&#xD;
      named VEXAS: Vacuoles in bone marrow cells, E1 enzyme mutations, X-linked, Autoinflammatory,&#xD;
      Somatic syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by inflammatory and hematologic features and&#xD;
      is frequently accompanied by marrow dysplasia, progressive bone marrow failure, and in some&#xD;
      cases, the development of overt myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Somatic mutations are present&#xD;
      at methionine 41 in UBA1, an X-linked gene encoding the major E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme&#xD;
      that initiates the majority of cellular ubiquitylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory features of VEXAS include fever, pulmonary infiltrates, skin lesions, ear&#xD;
      and nose chondritis, musculoskeletal involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers. The&#xD;
      hematologic features include cytopenia, characteristic vacuoles in myeloid and erythroid&#xD;
      precursors cells, and dysplastic bone marrow. Patients included in the initial description of&#xD;
      the syndrome fulfill clinical or classification criteria for both inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      (relapsing polychondritis, Sweet syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis) and&#xD;
      hematologic conditions (MDS or plasma cell dyscrasia). The inflammatory features of VEXAS are&#xD;
      refractory to treatment other than high doses of glucocorticoids. Increased mortality and&#xD;
      frequent morbidity are common in VEXAS secondary to the disease and treatment-related&#xD;
      complications. The clinical manifestations of VEXAS are time-dependent. Systemic inflammation&#xD;
      typically precedes progressive bone marrow failure with or without the development of&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies leading to death. Escalating doses of glucocorticoids are typically&#xD;
      administered to control the refractory, progressive features of systemic inflammation.&#xD;
      Worsening cytopenias often require transfusion support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of hematologic mosaicism as the genetic driver of rheumatologic/hematologic&#xD;
      syndromes defines a novel class of diseases, termed hematoinflammatory diseases (HINDS), and&#xD;
      it raises the possibility that therapies aimed at eradicating these clones may be efficacious&#xD;
      in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) results in&#xD;
      sustained donor engraftment at day 100 and one-year post-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether allogeneic HSCT results in reversal of the clinical phenotype of VEXAS&#xD;
      at one year and two years post-HSCT without requiring interval prednisone at &gt;= 0.5 mg/kg per&#xD;
      day for reasons other than graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients ages 18-75 year-old with or without a somatic mutation in UBA1 who have: 1) the&#xD;
      clinical phenotype for VEXAS with refractory cutaneous, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and/or&#xD;
      other recurrent acute inflammatory manifestations, and 2) require &gt;= 0.5 mg/kg per day of&#xD;
      prednisone for inflammatory manifestations OR have cytopenia (transfusion dependent anemia,&#xD;
      transfusion dependent thrombocytopenia/platelets &lt;75,000, neutropenia &lt;1,000/microL) or MDS&#xD;
      (by WHO criteria) or being intolerant or refractory to use steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have an 8/8 or 7/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Recipients with 8/8 HLA Matched Donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive reduced intensity conditioning with the following regimen:&#xD;
      fludarabine 40 mg/m^2 IV once daily for four days on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and Busulfan IV for&#xD;
      three days on days -6, -5, -and -4 followed by HSCT on day 0. The busulfan dose will be based&#xD;
      on pharmacokinetic levels from the test dose and will be targeted to an AUC of 3600-4800&#xD;
      micorMol*min/L (52-65 mg*h/L) (3.2 mg/kg IV per day will be the default dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Recipients with 7/8 HLA Matched Donors or Haploidentical Related Donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive reduced intensity conditioning with the following regimen:&#xD;
      fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 IV once daily for five days on days -6, -5, -4, -3, and -2,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg for two days on days -6 and -5, 200 cGy total body irradiation&#xD;
      (TBI) on day -1, busulfan IV once daily for two days on days -4 and -3, and HSCT on day 0.&#xD;
      The busulfan dose will be based on pharmacokinetic levels from the test dose and will be&#xD;
      targeted to an AUC of 3600-4800 (Micro)Mol*min/L (52-65 mg*h/L) (3.2 mg/kg IV per day will be&#xD;
      the default dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Post-Transplant GVHD Prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis in all groups will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      once daily for 2 days on days +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to&#xD;
      approximately day +35 and sirolimus from day +5 to approximately day +180.&#xD;

             days before treatment initiation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study agents have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or social situations (as determined by a licensed&#xD;
