      Global longitudinal strain emerged as an important predictive marker that could be assessed&#xD;
      during echocardiography. It enabled the detection of subclinical myocardial systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, without observable reductions in cardiac output or left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction, often years before diabetes induced heart failure. In asymptomatic T2D patients&#xD;
      with no history of cardiovascular disease, an impaired global longitudinal strain is a&#xD;
      predictor of future adverse left ventricular remodeling and adverse cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      Exercise training is a promising intervention to interfere in the diabetes induced heart&#xD;
      failure pathophysiology. However, the impact of different exercise modalities (e.g. intensity&#xD;
      and volume) on the global longitudinal strain in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is unknown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 400 million people worldwide are affected by diabetes mellitus whose prevalence&#xD;
      keeps increasing. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), up to 23% of the patients have&#xD;
      asymptomatic diastolic and 13% systolic cardiac dysfunction. Diabetes-induced heart failure&#xD;
      (DIHF), with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, is thus one of the major complications&#xD;
      of T2DM, which is characterized by structural and functional changes in the myocardium in&#xD;
      absence of coronary artery disease, other cardiac pathologies or hypertension. These changes&#xD;
      significantly affect prognosis: patients with DIHF are at a 147% elevated risk for premature&#xD;
      death within 4 years vs. 29% in patients without DIHF. It is thus of the utmost importance to&#xD;
      prevent the development of DIHF. Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia are considered as key risk factors, but&#xD;
      also oxidative and dicarbonyl stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and inflammation&#xD;
      play an important role in the pathophysiology of DIHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent adverse cardiac remodeling in T2DM and the development of DIHF, early biomarkers&#xD;
      are mandatory. In this respect, in the past few years global longitudinal strain (GLS)&#xD;
      emerged as an important predictive marker that could be assessed during echocardiography: the&#xD;
      global longitudinal strain enables the detection of subclinical myocardial systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, without observable reductions in cardiac output or left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction, often years before DIHF. In asymptomatic T2DM patients with no history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, an impaired GLS is a predictor of future adverse left ventricular&#xD;
      (LV) remodeling and adverse cardiovascular events, thus providing incremental prognostic&#xD;
      value beyond clinical data, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and diastolic function. The&#xD;
      investigators found that GLS is indeed significantly lowered (by ±14%, at rest and during&#xD;
      low-intense and high-intense exercise, in asymptomatic well-controlled T2DM patients (HbA1c:&#xD;
      6.9±0.7%). During exercise, GLS increases in T2DM, but fails to normalize when compared with&#xD;
      healthy controls. In contrast to current assumption, the investigators' data demonstrate that&#xD;
      a disturbed GLS is highly common in T2DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training is strongly recommended to T2DM patients, and is a crucial treatment next&#xD;
      to medication and diet, as this (further) optimizes glycemic control by improving insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, next to the positive impact on physical fitness, blood pressure, lipid profile&#xD;
      and body composition. Recent evidence also indicates a significantly lowered mortality in&#xD;
      habitual physically active vs. non-active T2DM patients (hazard ratio=0.61).&#xD;
&#xD;
      What type of exercise is most effective? What remains debatable is whether exercise&#xD;
      intervention can prevent the development of DIHF in asymptomatic T2DM patients. According to&#xD;
      a recent systematic review from the investigators' laboratory, the impact of exercise&#xD;
      intervention on GLS in asymptomatic T2DM is equivocal: significant improvements from some&#xD;
      studies could not be reproduced in other. In line with these findings, the investigators'&#xD;
      unpublished pilot data also reveal the capability of exercise training to improve GLS in some&#xD;
      T2DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' data show the potency of exercise in preventing DIHF in asymptomatic T2DM&#xD;
      patients, but they also show that crucial aspects deserve further study to maximize the&#xD;
      benefits of exercise training on GLS in T2DM patients, and hereby to offer maximal protection&#xD;
      against the development of DIHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of different exercise modalities (e.g. intensity, volume) on GLS in T2DM patients&#xD;
      is currently unknown. In the only clinical study that examined T2MD patients to date, results&#xD;
      show that high-intense interval training is more effective to improve GLS, as opposed to&#xD;
      moderate-intense exercise training. However, the study is biased due to the lack of&#xD;
      supervision in the moderate-intense trained group and the lack of control for equal caloric&#xD;
      expenditure between training groups. Therefore, it is likely that differences in exercise&#xD;
      volume could be at the basis of different changes in GLS between groups. Indeed, the&#xD;
      investigators' pilot data, in which iso-caloric interventions were compared, show different&#xD;
      results: moderate-intense exercise training seems more potent to improve GLS, as opposed to&#xD;
      high-intense interval training. As a result, although there is evidence that exercise&#xD;
      training improves GLS in T2DM patients, it remains to be studied whether different volumes or&#xD;
      intensities are of key importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite following identical exercise interventions, studies and the investigators' pilot data&#xD;
      also show significant inter-subject variances in changes in GLS. Therefore, the impact of the&#xD;
      patient's phenotype, as well as habitual physical activity (PA) and dietary habits, on the&#xD;
      effects of exercise training on GLS in T2DM patients is currently unknown. Revealing which&#xD;
      (non-)modifiable patient-related factors (e.g. phenotype, habitual PA and dietary habits)&#xD;
      predict the responsiveness of GLS to exercise intervention in T2DM patients may lead to a&#xD;
      more patient-specific application of such intervention or further tailoring of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
