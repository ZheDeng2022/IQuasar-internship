    <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) is a 12-question validated questionnaire used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. The OSDI scoring scale ranges from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the more symptomatic relief from dry eye symptoms a patient experiences. Change between the score at baseline and the score at 4 weeks is reported.</description>

    <measure>Change in Non-Invasive Tear Break-Up Time (NITBUT) from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time required for a dry spot to appear on the corneal surface after blinking is referred to as the tear film break-up time. The change in this time (measured in seconds) between baseline and 4 weeks is reported.</description>

&#xD;
               -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or&#xD;
                  inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered&#xD;
                  clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction,&#xD;
                  papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and mild dry eye are not considered&#xD;
                  active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of&#xD;
                  previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.&#xD;
