  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) are genetic defects of&#xD;
      heme biosynthesis that cause life-long, painful cutaneous sensitivity to light. EPP and XLP,&#xD;
      collectively called the protoporphyrias, result in the accumulation of the light-sensitive&#xD;
      molecule protoporphyrin IX initially in the bone marrow during hemoglobin synthesis and&#xD;
      secondarily in erythrocytes, plasma, and the liver. In addition to photosensitivity,&#xD;
      protoporphyria can also result in anemia, gallstones, and liver failure. No therapy has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to reduce protoporphyrin levels or prevent the potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      complications of EPP. Cimetidine has gained attention as a possible treatment for human&#xD;
      porphyrias because of a potential off-target effect of inhibition of delta-aminolevulinate&#xD;
      synthase (ALAS), the first enzyme of heme biosynthesis. This inhibition was first described&#xD;
      in vitro; however, case reports of benefit in EPP have been anecdotal and uncontrolled.&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of oral&#xD;
      cimetidine administration in the protoporphyrias. Efficacy will be based on protoporphyrin&#xD;
      levels, photosensitivity, and quality of life questionnaires. If the results are positive,&#xD;
      this would be the first study providing quality evidence for an agent acting as a&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapy for EPP. The study is also attractive because it repurposes an&#xD;
      already approved drug with few side effects to treat a rare human disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective, blinded, randomized, 2x2 cross-over design comparing&#xD;
      cimetidine to placebo in patients with protoporphyria. Eligible protoporphyria patients will&#xD;
      be randomized with equal allocation to one of two treatment sequences that will be&#xD;
      administered over two 3-month study periods. Randomization will be stratified by site and&#xD;
      permuted block randomization will be used to prevent chronological bias. Patients randomized&#xD;
      to sequence 1 will receive placebo during period 1 and cimetidine during period 2. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to sequence 2 will receive cimetidine during period 1 and placebo during period 2.&#xD;
      Between periods, to eliminate any carry-over effects from the treatment administered in&#xD;
      period 1, a wash-out period of 3 months will occur in which all patients receive neither&#xD;
      cimetidine nor placebo. Three months was selected for each study period and for the wash-out&#xD;
      period because of the rapid decline in protoporphyrin in red cells over the lifespan of the&#xD;
      red cell (120 days), as well as to account for the time frame needed to measure light&#xD;
      sensitivity in EPP.&#xD;
