  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a kind of clonal myeloid tumor. The major manifestation is&#xD;
      decrease of tri-lineages of blood due to ineffective and abnormal hematopoiesis, some of&#xD;
      which can progress to acute myeloid leukemia. According to the international prognosis&#xD;
      scoring system (IPSS) of MDS, about 10% low/intermediate risk-1 MDS patients have severe&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (PLT &lt; 30 × 109/ L). These patients have both decreased platelet count and&#xD;
      platelet dysfunction, resulting in a high risk of bleeding. In the new prognostic score, such&#xD;
      as IPSS-r, the degree of thrombocytopenia is regarded as a poor prognostic factor. Platelet&#xD;
      transfusion is mainly used in the treatment of this kind of patients. The indications of&#xD;
      transfusion include bleeding events or severe platelet count reduction (&lt; 10 × 109 / L).&#xD;
      However, platelet transfusion can only lead to short-term platelet elevation, while repeated&#xD;
      transfusion increases the possibility of infection and ineffective platelet transfusion. TPO&#xD;
      is a newly discovered hematopoietic promoting factor, which can specifically bind to the TPO&#xD;
      receptor on the cell and participate in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation,&#xD;
      maturation and division of megakaryocyte to form functional platelet. The efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the TPO receptor agonists eltrombopag and romiplostim in the treatment of thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      in low/intermediate risk-1 MDS patients have been successfully confirmed in foreign studies.&#xD;
      Hetrombopag is a new kind of a TPO receptor agonists which is highly specific platelet&#xD;
      stimulating factor. At present, there is no large report on the application of Hetrombopag in&#xD;
      such patients. The purpose of this study is to explore the short-term and long-term&#xD;
      therapeutic effect and safety of Hetrombopag on low/intermediate risk-1 MDS patients.&#xD;
