  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, it has been reported that health promotion model-based care approaches are&#xD;
      beneficial in gaining positive healthy lifestyle behaviors, taking responsibility for the&#xD;
      individual's health and increasing the quality of life. It is thought that the health&#xD;
      promotion model in pregnant women with preeclampsia will positively affect the healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors and self-efficacy level of pregnant women by ensuring active&#xD;
      participation of pregnant women in symptom management, reduce the stress of the pregnant and&#xD;
      positively affect maternal and fetal-neonatal health outcomes. In line with this information,&#xD;
      it was aimed to determine the effect of the web-based support program based on the health&#xD;
      promotion model on maternal infant health in pregnant women with preeclampsia.&#xD;

      Research Hypotheses H1a: The web-based support program based on the Health Promotion Model&#xD;
      enables the pregnant woman to monitor blood pressure, weight, edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1b: The web-based support program based on the Health Promotion Model increases the baby's&#xD;
      postpartum first-minute apgar score, fifth-minute apgar score, and prevents the baby's&#xD;
      respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1c: Web-based support program based on the Health Promotion Model positively affects&#xD;
      fetal-neonatal health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1d: The web-based support program based on the Health Promotion Model reduces the stress of&#xD;
      pregnant women related to their own and their baby's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1e: The web-based support program based on the Health Promotion Model enables the mother to&#xD;
      make decisions about her health and to participate in decisions about her health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Type It is a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled-type experimental&#xD;
      study using a pre-test-post-test layout. Research Place and Time The study is planned to be&#xD;
      carried out with pregnant women who applied to Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics in Istanbul&#xD;
      University - Cerrahpaşa Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty Hospital. After the research ethics&#xD;
      committee and institution permissions are obtained, it is planned to begin the application&#xD;
      phase with patients in June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Sample The universe of the study will be composed of pregnant women who&#xD;
      applied to Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics at the dates of the research at Istanbul&#xD;
      University - Cerrahpaşa Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty. In order to calculate the sample size,&#xD;
      the power of the study was calculated in the G * Power (v3.1.7) program. The total score of&#xD;
      the Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale was used as the main parameter in the study. In the&#xD;
      study, the HLBS total score after healthy lifestyle behaviors training was found to be 125.11&#xD;
      ± 16.86 in the control group, and 138.22 ± 27.88 in the intervention group, after training on&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle behaviors for women at 20-24 weeks of gestation (1). In the statistical&#xD;
      analysis made on the basis of the results of this study, the alpha reliability level of the&#xD;
      study was taken as 0.05 and the power was 80%, and the minimum number of pregnant women&#xD;
      required for each group was determined as 39 according to the HLBS score in the two-way&#xD;
      hypothesis analysis. Considering that there may be losses during the working process, it is&#xD;
      planned to include 45 people to each group. As a result, according to the results of the&#xD;
      power analysis, the number of pregnant women to be included in the study was 45 for each&#xD;
      group as an experimental and a control group, and the total number of pregnant women to be&#xD;
      included in the study was 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Pregnant women with preeclampsia who receive a web-based support program&#xD;
      based on the Health Promotion Model in addition to routine clinical care will form the&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Pregnant women who receive routine clinical care applied to pregnant women&#xD;
      with preeclampsia will constitute the control group.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Having inpatient treatment at the hospital C.1.2.2. Methods to be Used in the Study The&#xD;
           study is planned to be carried out with 90 pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia&#xD;
           who applied to Obstetrics clinics or received treatment at Istanbul University -&#xD;
           Cerrahpaşa Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty at the time of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before working with pregnant women, a web site will be created and opinions of 10 experts&#xD;
      will be taken on the suitability of the site. The web page expert opinion form will be&#xD;
      carried out under the guidance of the DISCERN Guidelines (Appendix 1), and the consistency&#xD;
      between the scores of the experts will be evaluated with the Kendall Conformity Coefficient.&#xD;
      Information on the features of the website is given in Annex 2. After the expert opinions,&#xD;
      the website will be finalized and the pre-application of the study will be made. A&#xD;
      pre-application will be done with 10% of the participants (n = 5) of the initiative group,&#xD;
      and these participants will not be included in the results of the study. Pregnant women who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly distributed to the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups through a randomized procedure. For randomization in this distribution, randomization&#xD;
      was performed using a computer program module used in controlled studies&#xD;
      (http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm). Pregnant women to be included in the study according to&#xD;
      the order of the researcher meeting the pregnant in the hospital; to the initiative group;&#xD;
      (7, 41, 39, 69, 79, 49, 12, 14, 72, 15, 13, 59, 60, 63, 73, 22, 67, 68, 42, 56, 77, 54, 66,&#xD;

      38, 81) placed by matching Until the data reaches the sample size, the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups will be collected together. The study will be added to the protocol&#xD;
      registration system where interventional research is recorded (clinicaltrials.gov) and the&#xD;
      NCT number will be obtained for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first interview with pregnant women, an explanation about the study will be made, and&#xD;
      the consent of the participants will be obtained through the informed consent form (Annex 3,&#xD;
      Annex 4) prepared separately for the intervention and control group. In both groups, at the&#xD;
      first interview, &quot;Participant introduction form (Appendix 5)&quot;, &quot;Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors&#xD;
      Scale (HLBS) (Appendix 6)&quot;, &quot;Prenatal Distress Scale (PBI)&quot; (Appendix 7) &quot;and&quot; Self-efficacy&#xD;
      Scale (AAS) ) (Annex 8) &quot;will be applied. Both groups will be given a brochure about&#xD;
      preeclampsia at the first encounter. The web site will be introduced to the initiative group,&#xD;
      a username and password will be given to login, and how to use the web site will be taught.&#xD;
      If pregnant women do not log in to the site within five days after the password is given, a&#xD;
      reminder will be made via e-mail or telephone. If they still do not log in to the site in&#xD;
      case of a reminder, they will be disabled. The planned training program will be started with&#xD;
      the first entry of pregnant women to the website. It will be ensured that pregnant women&#xD;
      complete the six modules with the following topics in two weeks. After each module, 5-6&#xD;
      questions will be added, if the participant answers the questions correctly, they will be&#xD;
      able to switch to the next module. The researcher will track the completion status of the&#xD;
      modules over the course of two weeks. Pregnant women will be able to complete the modules 24&#xD;
      hours a day whenever they are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Module titles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is preeclampsia and what are the danger signs in preeclampsia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How can preeclampsia symptoms be followed at home?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What can a pregnant woman do to adapt to the treatment of preeclampsia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What should be done to improve health in preeclampsia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How should a pregnant with preeclampsia monitor herself in the postpartum period?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What should a pregnant woman with preeclampsia do for the risk of developing&#xD;
           preeclampsia in the next pregnancy? Participants will evaluate the usefulness /&#xD;
           satisfaction of the training through the Vizuel Analog Scale after each module.&#xD;
           Web-based support program subjects, content and training plan, &quot;Topic and content plan,&#xD;
           module purpose, learning objectives, training period and training materials&quot; and&#xD;
           &quot;Web-based support program based on health development model&quot; are given in Annex 9. No&#xD;
           intervention will be made to the control group, and the control group will receive&#xD;
           routine care according to the hospital protocol. Two weeks after the first interview,&#xD;
           &quot;HLBS&quot;, &quot;AAS&quot;, &quot;PBL&quot; and &quot;Self-monitoring form of the pregnant woman (Appendix 10) will&#xD;
           be applied to both groups twice with two-week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum monitoring will be performed on postpartum 0, 1, and 2 days using the &quot;Postpartum&#xD;
      evaluation form (Appendix 11)&quot;. Data collection tools will be sent to the control group via&#xD;
      e-mail, the participants will be called from time to time and the status of filling out the&#xD;
      forms will be questioned. The initiative group will fill out the questionnaires on the&#xD;
      website and will be called by the researcher at least once a week. Pregnant women will be&#xD;
      able to conduct investigative interviews on the meet with experts platform (Google meet,&#xD;
      zoom, etc.) when they need it. The initiative group will be able to chat with other&#xD;
      participants from the forum page on the website. When necessary, they will be able to&#xD;
      communicate with the researcher both on the website and on the phone. A &quot;Frequently Asked&#xD;
      Questions&quot; section will be created by the researcher on the website, and the participants in&#xD;
      the initiative group will be able to benefit from that section whenever they want. Postpartum&#xD;
      2nd day, the initiative group will evaluate the usability of the website with the &quot;System&#xD;
      Usability Scale (Annex 12)&quot;. Process evaluation form will be used in the study. Process&#xD;
      evaluation is used to document and monitor the implementation of the program. A process&#xD;
      evaluation plan will be implemented in each of the stages of the planning, method, data&#xD;
      collection tools, implementation and evaluation of the study. In the first interview with&#xD;
      pregnant women, an explanation about the study will be made, and the consent of the&#xD;
      participants will be obtained through the informed consent form prepared separately for the&#xD;
      intervention and control group. &quot;Participant introduction form&quot;, &quot;Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors&#xD;
      Scale&quot;, &quot;Prenatal Distress Scale&quot; and &quot;Self-efficacy Scale&quot; will be applied to both groups in&#xD;
      the first interview. Both groups will be given a brochure about preeclampsia at the first&#xD;
      encounter. The web site will be introduced to the initiative group, a username and password&#xD;
      will be given to login, and how to use the web site will be taught. If pregnant women do not&#xD;
