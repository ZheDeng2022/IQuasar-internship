  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic papillectomy is the preferred approach for management of ampullary adenomas.&#xD;
      Endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an ablative therapy that has been used to treat&#xD;
      malignant biliary strictures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of endoscopic papillectomy combined with endobiliary RFA for ampullary neoplasms with&#xD;
      intraductal biliary extension.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ampullary neoplasms remain rare, with a reported prevalence of 0.04% to 0.12% in autopsy&#xD;
      studies. , endoscopic papillectomy is now recognized as a safe and reliable alternative to&#xD;
      surgery for ampullary adenomas and is associated with high success rates (72%-95%), low&#xD;
      morbidity (10%-30%), and minimal mortality (0.2%-1%). Typically, however, intrabiliary&#xD;
      extension of the adenoma has been regarded as a contraindication for endoscopic papillectomy.&#xD;
      Surgical referral is therefore recommended with intraductal extension, particularly when the&#xD;
      length of extension exceeds 1 cm. Radiofrequency ablation offers a potentially safe and&#xD;
      effective treatment for malignant biliary strictures. The use of RFA as a primary treatment&#xD;
      for intraductal dysplasia after endoscopic papillectomy has been shown in few small case&#xD;
      series to be feasible with the primary limitation of short follow-up periods. The primary aim&#xD;
      of this study was to describe our experience with RFA in patients with ampullary neoplasia&#xD;
      and associated intraductal extension who were not surgical candidates.&#xD;
