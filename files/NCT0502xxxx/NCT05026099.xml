  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of stroke is a clinical syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of&#xD;
      cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death with no apparent cause other&#xD;
      than a vascular origin'.Stroke has further three types i.e. ischemic, hemorrhagic, and&#xD;
      transient ischemic stroke. As most gestures in daily life involve the upper limbs and hands,&#xD;
      patients who cannot use their hands not only suffer from severe physical and psychological&#xD;
      pain but also encounter difﬁculties in the activities of daily living that primarily involve&#xD;
      upper limb function. Stroke patients have various problems such as asymmetrical posture,&#xD;
      abnormal body balance, and decreased ability to move the weight.&#xD;

      As most gestures in daily life involve the upper limbs and hands, patients who cannot use&#xD;
      their hands not only suffer from severe physical and psychological pain but also encounter&#xD;
      difﬁculties in the activities of daily living that primarily involve upper limb function.&#xD;
      Stroke patients have various problems such as asymmetrical posture, abnormal body balance,&#xD;
      and decreased ability to move the weight. The loss of motion element involved in ﬁne&#xD;
      functions, and the above-mentioned problems can lead to decreased muscle cooperativity of the&#xD;
      lower limbs while walking and may also result in an asymmetric gait due to imbalance in the&#xD;
      ability to perform the exercise. Due to such persistent disorders, most stroke patients&#xD;
      suffer from depression, problems in interpersonal relationships and social life, and a&#xD;
      generally lower quality of life. Recent studies on the treatment of stroke patients reported&#xD;
      that approaches such as more intensive and repetitive training as compared to conventional&#xD;
      general and passive intervention, training related to reality, intervention involving&#xD;
      motivation and active participation and forced induction exercise, visual exercise feedback,&#xD;
      purpose-oriented training, and task-oriented training are more effective in promoting&#xD;
      function after stroke onset. Virtual reality (VR) is frequently used in different disease&#xD;
      groups at the clinic for rehabilitation purposes. Xbox Kinect, Nintendo Wii, Sony&#xD;
      PlayStation, and Cyber Glove are among the most commonly used VR applications in&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Several studies reported that VR applications improved both upper and lower&#xD;
      extremity functions and promoted independence in performing activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Task-specific training focused on both upper limbs and lower limbs could have a greater&#xD;
      impact in improving mobility and physical activity in individuals with stroke but these&#xD;
      studies have very little impact on balance, gait, and quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      stroke. Previous studies reported that task-oriented training programs in stroke patients&#xD;
      only focus on lower limb and upper limb function. The main barrier or limitation in&#xD;
      task-oriented training is the repetition of tasks in an appropriate manner, and most patients&#xD;
      lose interest and feel bored and there is less active participation during the performance of&#xD;
      similar tasks. This will affect their performance and function and not very much effective&#xD;
      intervention for treating stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, it has been observed that boxing therapy has positive outcomes in&#xD;
      individuals with neurological diseases. In the literature, the first study, including boxing&#xD;
      therapy, was conducted in patients with Parkinson's disease, which concluded that boxing&#xD;
      therapy was feasible and reliable for Parkinson's patients. As a form of high-intensity&#xD;
      exercise, it is argued that goal-based activities such as boxing can be engaging and&#xD;
      accessible for people with chronic diseases. Boxing incorporates high-intensity exercise,&#xD;
      with movements of all regions of the body in a weight-bearing and aerobic context. Either&#xD;
      non-contact or as a contact sport, boxing movements can be performed in sitting, standing, or&#xD;
      as part of dynamic, complex movement sequences. In able-bodied people, high-intensity boxing&#xD;
      programs performed for 50-minutes four times per week improved fitness, health, and&#xD;
      well-being. The other preliminary on the effects of the sitting boxing program in stroke&#xD;
      patients investigated and demonstrated that the sitting boxing program had a positive impact&#xD;
      on upper extremity function, balance, gait, and quality of life in stroke patients.&#xD;

    <description>A three-point ordinal scale is used to measure impairments of volitional movement with grades ranging from 0 (item cannot be performed) to 2 (item can be fully performed). Specific descriptions for performance accompany individual test items. Subtests exist for Upper extremity function, Lower extremity function, balance, sensation, Range of Motion, and pain. The cumulative test score for all components is 226 with availability of specific subtest scores (e.g., Upper extremity maximum score is 66, Lower extremity score 34; balance score 14)</description>

    <time_frame>week 8</time_frame>
    <description>the Wolf Motor Function Test consists of 17 items Composed of 3 parts:&#xD;
Time&#xD;
Functional ability&#xD;
Strength Includes 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength-based tasks Performance time is referred to as Wolf Motor Function Test-Time. Functional ability is referred to as Wolf Motor Function Test. Items 1-6 involve timed functional tasks, items 7-14 are measures of strength, and the remaining 9 items consist of analyzing movement quality when completing various tasks Examiners should test the less affected upper extremity followed by the most affected side. Uses a 6-point ordinal scale &quot;0&quot; = &quot;does not attempt with the involved arm&quot; to &quot;5&quot; = &quot;arm does participate; movement appears to be normal.&quot; The maximum score is 75 Lower scores are indicative of lower functioning levels Wolf Motor Function Test Time allows 120 seconds per task</description>

Domain scores are composed of unweighted averages&#xD;
Summary scores are composed of an unweighted average of the 12 domain average scores Scores range from 49-245. Higher scores indicate better functioning.&#xD;
