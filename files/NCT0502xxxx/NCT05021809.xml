    <textblock>
      Calcium hydroxide is advocated as an intracanal medication for various purposes, including&#xD;
      prevention of post-treatment symptoms. Calcium hydroxide has a pain-controlling effect at&#xD;
      different times when compared to non-intracanal medication .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study to compare between postoperative pain after using two formulations of&#xD;
      calcium hydroxide intracanal medication with and without iodoform .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most persuasive factor for a patient to visit a dental health care professional is the&#xD;
      existence of odontalgia. Accordingly, the pain after a dental therapy results in demotivation&#xD;
      of the patient. Unfortunately, mild to severe pain following a tooth-preserving therapy such&#xD;
      as root canal treatment is reported to be experienced by 40% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients with symptomatic necrotic teeth had significant postoperative pain&#xD;
      and required analgesic medication to manage this pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a correlation between the intensity of preoperative pain and postoperative pain ,The&#xD;
      preoperative pain has a significant influence on postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several strategies are suggested to manage or prevent post instrumentation pain. One of them&#xD;
      is insertion of intracanal medicament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interappointment intracanal medicaments are suggested for disinfection of the infected&#xD;
      root canal system in multi-visit endodontic treatment. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is&#xD;
      considered as a universal intracanal medicament for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, calcium hydroxide is hypothesized to exert a pain-preventing effect indirectly&#xD;
      through its antimicrobial and tissue modifying properties .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significantly high healing rates have been shown with short term use of calcium hydroxide&#xD;
      Ca(OH)2 in teeth with apical periodontitis. As a temporary root filling, it has been shown to&#xD;
      be an effective antimicrobial agent when applied for a minimum of 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium hydroxide is a suitable material of choice as an inter-appointment dressing for teeth&#xD;
      diagnosed with pulpal necrosis and apical periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium hydroxide reduced pain risk than no intracanal medication within the 1-14 days&#xD;
      interval as well as triple-antibiotic paste within the first day and was similar to&#xD;
      corticosteroid/antibiotics combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodoform has bacteriostatic property by releasing free iodine.Thereby, iodine eliminates the&#xD;
      infection of root canal and periapical tissue by precipitating protein and oxidizes essential&#xD;
      enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of calcium hydroxide-iodoform-silicon-oil paste as nonsurgical approach for treatment&#xD;
      of periapical lesions showed a high success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As clinicians , one of the most important goals to achieve is reducing the pain of the&#xD;
      patient. Up to our knowledge, none of the previous studies investigated the postoperative&#xD;
      pain incidence after application of Ca(OH)2 with iodoform as an intracanal medication .&#xD;
