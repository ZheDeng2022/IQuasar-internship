      This study will test the effectiveness of a phone-based big sister/big brother program&#xD;
      designed to provide health information and support, reduce school dropouts, and promote safer&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program's goal is to create a phone-based safe space, to ensure adolescents remained&#xD;
      connected with access to support and health information during COVID lockdowns.&#xD;
