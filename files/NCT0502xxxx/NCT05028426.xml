  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to describe the transition from traditional care to an enhanced recovery&#xD;
      program for the management of total knee arthroplasty, and to evaluate the effect on patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      Enhanced recovery programs are an organizational evolution in surgical patient management, in&#xD;
      which the patient becomes an actor of his or her own recovery. This multimodal approach aims&#xD;
      at optimizing patient physiological and psychological states across preoperative,&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative domains of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At la Rochelle hospital, the decision to take the step happened at the end of 2016. It was&#xD;
      proposed by a young surgeon that have been trained on this new approach during his studies&#xD;
      and who convinced the head of the surgery department of the benefits for the patients, the&#xD;
      healthcare workers, and the institution. The transition took place in two stages, first&#xD;
      operative and postoperative techniques were modified, and then preoperative education and&#xD;
      counselling were added.&#xD;
