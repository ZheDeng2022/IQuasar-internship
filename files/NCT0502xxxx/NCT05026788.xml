    <textblock>
      The COVERT Collaborative is led by a group of academic surgeons that is looking into the&#xD;
      impact of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic on Trauma and Orthopaedic practice. This will&#xD;
      involve both trauma and elective procedures, as well as mortality rates, operative and&#xD;
      anaesthetic case mix. The information will help to shape service reconfiguration and enhance&#xD;
      patient-specific treatment especially in the threat of potential subsequent waves and future&#xD;
      pandemics.&#xD;

      In response to the health crisis, it is the responsibility of clinicians to audit and&#xD;
      collaborate in order to observe the impact of the pandemic on clinical practice. With the&#xD;
      restructure of the health infrastructure, there is likely to be changes to the nature of&#xD;
      acute referrals to Trauma and Orthopaedics, operative and anaesthetic casemix, polytrauma and&#xD;
      open fractures as well as the role of technology to reduce viral transmission. Patient safety&#xD;
      ought to be prioritised at all times but a national narrative is required to equip healthcare&#xD;
      services to counter the pandemic at various time intervals post-social distancing and&#xD;
      lockdown at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. This will act as an audit to compare and&#xD;
      contrast if the reconfiguration of healthcare services is abiding by the governmental, DoH,&#xD;
      NHS, WHO, RCS and BOA (BOAST) policies and guidelines.&#xD;
