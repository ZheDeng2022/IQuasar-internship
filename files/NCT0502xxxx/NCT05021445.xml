      The process of age-related changes involves some kind of degenerative, gradual changes which&#xD;
      are irreversible such as degradation of activity of cells and loss of physical adaptability.&#xD;
      According to age-related changes such as changes in balance are specifically begins near the&#xD;
      age 45 years-old, physical characteristics such as (flexibility, strength, balance and&#xD;
      coordination) and sensory systems are affected which ultimately increase the chances of falls&#xD;
      in elderly individuals. Balance can be defined as the ability of a person to control their&#xD;
      position within the limits of base of support. Pilates is an individualized-based and&#xD;
      low-intermediate intensity exercise that can be easily performed by the elderly .&#xD;
      Conventional balance exercises which have rehabilitative effect in reducing risk of falls and&#xD;
      enhancing functional ability in elderly population. Conventional balance training comprises&#xD;
      of four components which are flexibility exercises, strength training, postural control&#xD;
      exercise and endurance training.The objective of the study IS to find out the effects of&#xD;
      Pilates exercises on dynamic balance in elderly population. The Twenty-four participants will&#xD;
      be recruited and divided into two equal groups randomly. The group A(n=12) will perform&#xD;
      Pilates-based exercises protocol for 50- minutes with 10-minutes warm-up phase, 30-minutes&#xD;
      training phase and 10-minutes for cool-down phase, thrice a week for four week and the group&#xD;
      B(n=12) will receive Conventional balance training exercises for 50-minutes, thrice a week&#xD;
      for four weeks. Outcome measures will be were TUG and SPPB before and after the trial and the&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared before and end of four weeks treatment protocol. Data will be&#xD;
      analyze by SPSS version 21. Independent sample t- test and paired sample t-test will be&#xD;
      utilize to compare and evaluate the effects of both approaches.&#xD;

The group A consists of 12 elderly participants who received intervention protocol of Pilates- based exercises program in which total 12-sessions were given for thrice a week for four weeks for 50-minutes.&#xD;
Group B The group B consists of 12 elderly participants who received intervention protocol of Conventional balance training exercises in which total 12-sessions were given for thrice a week for four weeks for 50-minutes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Time Up and Go is a very simple, quick, valid, reliable and an objective test which is widely clinical performance based measure used to assess and quantify the basic mobility skills. It assesses that how a person could perform series of sequential tasks during walk and turn. TUG is commonly used for the assessment of balance and it is considered to be appropriate for elderly population which is at risk of fall.</description>
