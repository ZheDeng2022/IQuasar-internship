  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid status and congestion can be determined by the CPM wearable device and correlates with&#xD;
      invasive measures, non-invasive measures and biochemical markers of congestion and changes in&#xD;
      congestion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HF is associated with frequent and lengthy hospitalisations. These hospitalisations are&#xD;
      usually as a result of congestion. The signs of congestion that can be recognised by&#xD;
      physicians or health care professionals such as lung crackles or worsening of peripheral&#xD;
      oedema are often seen at a late stage before an intervention can be made to prevent overt&#xD;
      decompensation and admission to hospital. Recognising changes in excess fluid status either&#xD;
      before a patient becomes unwell or during decongestion treatment is highly desirable so that&#xD;
      timely treatment can be started or so that treatment can be adjusted based on an individual's&#xD;
      response to therapy. The ability to assess patients by applying a single, non-invasive device&#xD;
      would potentially provide a useful tool for assessing a patient's congestion levels and allow&#xD;
      patients with progressive deterioration to be identified earlier.&#xD;
