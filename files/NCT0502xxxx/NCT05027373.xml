      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial of safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic of Recombinant anti-IL-1β Humanized Monoclonal Antibody by&#xD;
      single subcutaneous injection with five different doses in healthy subjects. There are 5&#xD;
      groups as follows: 0.03mg/kg (S1), 1.0mg/kg (S2), 3.0mg/kg (S3), 6.0mg/kg (S4) and 10.0mg/kg&#xD;
      (S5); and 2 subjects were included in the S1 group (both received study drugs); 8 subjects&#xD;
      were included in each of the S2 ~ S5 groups (of which 6 received study drugs and 2 received&#xD;
      placebo). In each group, two subjects were sentinels (1 received the study drug and 1&#xD;
      placebo). Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Anti-drug antibody (ADA) data will be&#xD;
      collected; Drug safety, tolerability and immunogenicity for healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
