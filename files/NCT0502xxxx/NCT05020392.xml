  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label and pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate the primary&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CART-CD19)&#xD;
      with concurrent BTK inhibitor in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell has shown dramatical efficacy in B cell&#xD;
      malignancies. And Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor agents have been validated as an&#xD;
      effective drug to treat B cell malignancies. Combined therapies comprising ibrutinib (a BTK&#xD;
      inhibitor) and anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in patients with CLL after ibrutinib failure are&#xD;
      considered feasible and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib is the first-generation BTK inhibitror and Zanubrutinib is the second-generation&#xD;
      BTK inhibitor. Orelabrutinib is a newly developed BTK inhibitor with high selectivity and&#xD;
      have received its approval in China. Autologous cells derived T cells are purified and&#xD;
      transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the humanized CD19 scFv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether the addition of BTK inhibitor (Ibrutinib, Zanubrutinib and Orelabrutinib)&#xD;
      in anti-CD19 CAR-T cells therapy would further improve efficacy and safety, we intend to&#xD;
      conduct this pragmatic clinical trial.&#xD;
