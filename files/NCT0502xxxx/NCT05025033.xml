  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effective rate of second-line and later-line single-agent therapy for advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer is limited. This research plan aims to explore whether the combination of drugs can&#xD;
      further improve the benefits of second-line and above therapies. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that there is a significant synergistic effect between chemotherapy and PD-1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, or anti-angiogenic TKI drugs and PD-1 monoclonal antibody. This project is planned&#xD;
      to be based on the classic chemotherapy drugs irinotecan or paclitaxel, combined with&#xD;
      mesylate Apatinib and PD-1 monoclonal antibody, explore the effectiveness and safety of this&#xD;
      three-drug combination regimen for the second-line and above treatment of advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer, in order to provide a better late-line treatment plan for patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical study, which aims to&#xD;
      explore the efficacy of PD-1 antibody combined with apatinib combined with chemotherapy as a&#xD;
      second-line and above regimen in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.The enrolled&#xD;
      patients were patients with advanced inoperable gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma who had advanced first-line fluorouracil combined with platinum or advanced&#xD;
      second-line paclitaxel and irinotecan, with an ECOG PS of 0-1. Treatment plan: PD-1 antibody:&#xD;
      200mg intravenous drip every 3 weeks; Apatinib 250mg/day; Chemotherapy: Irinotecan 150mg/m2,&#xD;
      intravenous drip every 2 weeks, or Paclitaxel 150mg/m2, intravenous drip, once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
      An imaging evaluation is performed every 6-8 weeks. Monitor blood routine, blood&#xD;
      biochemistry, electrocardiogram, urine routine, thyroid function, heart function according to&#xD;
      clinical routine, and record adverse events. Primary observational endpoints: objective&#xD;
      effective rate (ORR), progression-free survival time (PFS), secondary observational&#xD;
      endpoints: overall survival time (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety, and dynamic&#xD;
      monitoring of serum biomolecular markers for exploration study .&#xD;
