      The goal of this proposal is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      virtual-reality-based biofeedback (VR-B) treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
      PTSD is driven in part by difficulty self-regulating emotional and physical arousal.&#xD;
      Biofeedback, which involves the provision of real-time information about physiology, is a&#xD;
      well-studied approach to enhancing self-regulatory ability, with potential promise for PTSD.&#xD;
      In children (as well as adults), biofeedback may be ideally facilitated through video game&#xD;
      environments, which offer engaging, immersive, yet dynamic environments that can be changed&#xD;
      in real-time. Video games are enormously popular with youth, and may represent an important&#xD;
      avenue for treatment in pediatric populations. The current proposal aims to evaluate a novel&#xD;
      virtual-reality-based video game treatment for dysregulation in PTSD. This pilot study will:&#xD;
      1) evaluate the feasibility of applying a VR-B treatment for youth with PTSD, 2) identify&#xD;
      potential changes in physiological signaling (e.g., heart rate) across treatment sessions, 3)&#xD;
      identify potential changes in self-regulatory ability or symptom severity across treatment&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common in adolescence and causes significant&#xD;
      suffering and burden throughout the lifespan. The incidence of PTSD rises markedly in&#xD;
      adolescence, reaching a lifetime prevalence of 5% by age 18 and up to 40% in cases of sexual&#xD;
      abuse and assault. In addition to psychological suffering, PTSD is associated with lower&#xD;
      academic achievement and increased incidence of depression, suicide attempts, and substance&#xD;
      abuse into adulthood. Childhood trauma and PTSD also impose tremendous societal costs in&#xD;
      terms of health care utilization and financial outlay. For example, the sequelae of childhood&#xD;
      maltreatment, including PTSD, cost the United States an estimated $500 billion annually.&#xD;
      These sobering statistics highlight the urgent need to uncover novel, evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments to improve the well-being of afflicted youth. Unfortunately, current&#xD;
      pharmacological approaches to youth PTSD show only minimal efficacy. Psychotherapy offers&#xD;
      modest benefits, yet only for some, and only temporarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances may come from multidisciplinary efforts to evaluate and adapt current treatments.&#xD;
      Many mental illnesses, including PTSD, are driven in part by difficulty self-regulating&#xD;
      emotional and physical arousal. Biofeedback is an evidence-based mental health treatment&#xD;
      involving provision of real-time information about physiological arousal. Individuals learn&#xD;
      to recognize the bodily sensations of high arousal and use acquired skills or conditioned&#xD;
      behavior to control that arousal. Yet this approach has historically been difficult for&#xD;
      youth, as it requires sustained attention and engagement to the biofeedback signals. The&#xD;
      current proposal aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      virtual-reality-based video game biofeedback system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video games are an ideal treatment vehicle for adolescents - nearly 97% of whom play video&#xD;
      games on a regular basis - as well as an established avenue for training cognitive processes,&#xD;
      such as effortful autonomic regulation. Davidson and colleagues recently demonstrated that a&#xD;
      mobile game teaching focused attention on breathing enhanced functional connectivity in&#xD;
      prefrontal regulatory circuits among adolescents. Biofeedback-based breath awareness is an&#xD;
      efficacious technique for augmenting effortful autonomic regulation. Regularized guided&#xD;
      breathing treatment decreases autonomic reactivity to stress among adults with PTSD. Notably,&#xD;
      common approaches to biofeedback with heart rate or respiration make use of textual or&#xD;
      abstract graphical feedback (e.g., sine waves, breaths per minute). Virtual reality allows&#xD;
      biofeedback to be embedded in the characteristics of the environment itself, thereby&#xD;
      sustaining attention and engagement, with proven benefits over traditional implementations.&#xD;
      Indeed, VR-based applications are now widely used to great benefit for a variety of&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. This will be the first study to integrate these concepts - virtual&#xD;
      reality and biofeedback - for the targeted treatment of adolescent PTSD and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation.&#xD;

    <description>Youth will be asked to experience an immersive virtual-reality simulation. Youth will wear a lightweight, ultra-high-resolution, wireless, head-mounted VR display (HTC Vive Pro Eye; HTC Corp., Taiwan). Each session will proceed through a series of three stages. First, participants will begin with a 5-min. acclimation period inside a demo VR environment. Second, baseline levels of physiological arousal will be captured over a 5 min. resting period where participants will be asked to sit quietly in a serene virtual environment. Physiological data will be collected using disposable gel-pad electrodes placed on the fingers (galvanic skin response) and torso (electrocardiography). Third, youth will progress through the DEEP VR experience for 15 minutes (see Behavioral Task), an underwater navigation video game wherein regularized, diaphragmatic breathing facilitates movement.</description>
