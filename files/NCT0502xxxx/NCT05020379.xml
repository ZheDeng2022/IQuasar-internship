  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a new technique that is increasingly used in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute and chronic pain. Bariatric surgery is a surgical treatment method used in&#xD;
      the treatment of morbid obesity and related comorbidities. Providing pain control in obese&#xD;
      patients is a topic that remains up-to-date. Poorly controlled early postoperative pain&#xD;
      impairs quality of recovery, increases the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, and&#xD;
      is a risk factor for the subsequent development of chronic pain. Therefore, optimizing acute&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia is a priority in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The primary&#xD;
      aim of this prospective, randomized study is to evaluate the effect of ESPB on quality of&#xD;
      recovery with the QoR-40 questionnaire in patients undergoing elective Laparoscopic Bariatric&#xD;
      Surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the operating room, all patients will receive standard monitoring, including&#xD;
      electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation. Patients&#xD;
      in the ESPB group will be placed in a sitting position. A convex probe ultrasound transducer&#xD;
      will be placed in a longitudinal parasagittal orientation approximately 3 cm lateral to the&#xD;
      spinous process. The needle tip was advanced until it will be located in the inter-fascial&#xD;
      plane deep to the erector spinae muscle group and superior to the transverse process. Once in&#xD;
      position, bupivacaine 0.25%, 20 ml was injected under ultrasound, guidance. The same&#xD;
      procedure will be repeated on the contralateral site. Standard perioperative and&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia protocol will be given and postoperative pain levels will be&#xD;
      determined by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). NRS scores for pain and postoperative opioid&#xD;
      consumption will be recorded on the 15th,30th minute, 1st, 2nd, 12th, 24th hour, 2nd day.&#xD;
      Quality of recovery-40 (QoR-40) scores will be given on the ward, at postoperative 24th hour,&#xD;
      3rd and 7th day ( the 3rd and 7th-day scores will be calculated after telephone interview if&#xD;
      the patient will be discharged from the hospital).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Postoperative 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative complications will be identified by visiting patients every day or alternate day during their in hospital course, suplemented by patients medical records using our hospital's electronic patient record database. We will use the Claviene Dindo Classification system from which CC is derived. We defined a postoperative complication as any deviation from the ideal postoperative course, not inherent in the procedure itself and does not constitute a failure to cure. CCI scores willbe calculated using the online CCI calculator.</description>

    <description>The patients in Group N will not receive any intervention. Patients will receive standard multimodal analgesia comprising paracetamol, tenoxicam, and tramadol. The pain intensity will be evaluated with the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). NRS are the simple and most commonly used scales.11 The numerical scale is most commonly 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;the worst pain imaginable.&quot;</description>
