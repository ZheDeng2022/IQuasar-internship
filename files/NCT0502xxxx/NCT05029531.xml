  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The innovation of this protocol is the risk-adapted choice of therapy and the use of a&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      for patients with risk factors. we have proposed a two-stage stratification into risk groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard risk: patients with no rearrangement of the KMT2A gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermediate risk: patients with rearrangement of the KMT2A gene without damage to the&#xD;
           central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk: patients with rearrangement of the KMT2A gene with lesions of the central&#xD;
           nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results of induction therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The high-risk group includes patients from the standard risk group with an MRD level of&#xD;
           more than 0.1% after the induction course and from the intermediate risk group with&#xD;
           MRD-positive (PCR) after HR1 block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The allocation of children in the first year of life without the rearranged KMT2A gene&#xD;
           into a separate group seems to be logical, since the prognosis in this group is better&#xD;
           than in children with the rearranged KMT2A gene. In this protocol, non-intensive therapy&#xD;
           with consolidations and maintenance therapy remains for those who achieve a low MRD&#xD;
           level (less than 0.1%) after a course of induction. The rest of the patients move into a&#xD;
           high-risk group: they receive blinatumomab and HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The concept of therapy for patients at intermediate risk is based on the rate at which&#xD;
           MRD-negativity is achieved: standard consolidation and maintenance therapy for those who&#xD;
           became MRD-negative at the end of induction, &quot;block&quot; chemotherapy for those who were&#xD;
           positive at the end of induction, but achieved negativity after HR1 block, blinatumomab&#xD;
           with HSCT for those who have preserved the MRD after the HR1 block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For high-risk patients, a combination of immunotherapy (blinatumomab - a bispecific CD3&#xD;
           / CD19 T-cell activator) and HSCT in the first remission was chosen.&#xD;

      -  Standard risk group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of remission: 36 days of dexamethasone, 5 weekly injections of vincristine, 2&#xD;
           injections of daunorubicin on days 8 and 22, a single injection of pegelated&#xD;
           asparaginase on days 5-7 and 6 weekly intrathecal injections of three drugs&#xD;
           (methotrexate, cyamethosar and dexamethason ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further therapy in this therapeutic group depends on the status of remission, the level&#xD;
           of MRD on the 36th day of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRD-negative patients receive consolidation therapy in the amount of 3 consolidations&#xD;
           (6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, peg-asparaginase, daunorubicin) with re-induction&#xD;
           courses (dexamethasone, vincristine) and maintenance therapy (6-mercaptopurine,&#xD;
           methotrexate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRD-positive patients receive a course of blinatumomab and HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermediate risk group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of remission: 36 days of dexamethasone, 5 weekly injections of vincristine, 2&#xD;
           injections of daunorubicin on days 8 and 22, a single injection of pegelated&#xD;
           asparaginase on days 5-7, 6 weekly intrathecal injections of three drugs (methotrexate,&#xD;
           cyamethosar, dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further therapy in this therapeutic group depends on the status of remission on the 36th&#xD;
           day of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have achieved molecular remission receive consolidation therapy in the&#xD;
           amount of 3 consolidations with re-induction courses and maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have not achieved molecular remission receive HR1 block. Further therapy&#xD;
           depends on the remission status after HR1 block. Patients who have not achieved&#xD;
           molecular remission receive a course of blinatumomab and HSCT, patients who have&#xD;
           achieved molecular remission, two more blocks HR2 and HR3, protocol II and maintenance&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of remission: 36 days of dexamethasone, 5 weekly injections of vincristine, 2&#xD;
           injections of daunorubicin on days 8 and 22, a single injection of pegelated&#xD;
           asparaginase on days 5-7, 6 weekly intrathecal injections of three drugs (methotrexate,&#xD;
           cyamethosar, dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further therapy in this therapeutic group does not depend on the status of remission on&#xD;
           the 36th day of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients receive HR1 block, blinatumomab course and HSCT (subject to morphological&#xD;
           remission).&#xD;
