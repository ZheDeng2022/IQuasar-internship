  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is the most commonly used mode in mechanical ventilated&#xD;
      patients. Studies have shown that over-assistance was prevalent in patients undergoing PSV.&#xD;
      Up to now, no reliable method has been recommended to select an &quot;optimal&quot; inspiratory support&#xD;
      level. Pressure muscle index (PMI) was introduced recently to evaluate the degree of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing effort. We hypothesize that PMI might be used as an indicator for&#xD;
      over-assistance during PSV. In this randomized crossover study, inspiratory support is set at&#xD;
      three levels according to negative, positive and zero PMI. Inspiratory effort, work of&#xD;
      breathing, and respiratory mechanics are compared among the three inspiratory pressure&#xD;
      support levels.&#xD;
