  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an important emergent issue for all in the&#xD;
      country, there is a significant number of people in the population who are especially&#xD;
      vulnerable to the potential impact that the novel coronavirus epidemic may have on their&#xD;
      health. The overall purpose of the study is to investigate: (1) the dynamics of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection among people living with HIV and health care workers providing HIV services; (2)&#xD;
      the provision of HIV and HIV/TB care and treatment services at health facilities, within the&#xD;
      scope of COVID-19 or in the context of COVID-19 and; (3) the perceptions of COVID-19 and&#xD;
      access to care among people living with HIV and health care workers providing HIV services.&#xD;

      The protocol is designed to assess prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 among PLHIV (people&#xD;
      living with HIV) and health care workers. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 epidemic on clinical and immunological outcomes and health care service delivery&#xD;
      among PLHIV and HCWs providing HIV services in Mozambique. This will facilitate timely&#xD;
      estimates of transmissibility of SARS-nCoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2), and of the severity of COVID-19 infection among PLHIV and HCWs providing HIV services, as&#xD;
      well as inform public health responses to these vulnerable populations. In Mozambique, this&#xD;
      is particularly important as health systems are operating at capacity, and resources to&#xD;
      expand services in the country are limited. It is in this context that a novel respiratory&#xD;
      pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, could have a potentially severe impact in Mozambique among its&#xD;
      estimated 2.2 million HIV-infected persons and the health care providers caring for them. The&#xD;
      study protocol will be implemented at national level in up to 11 provinces of Mozambique&#xD;
      Results will be used primarily for program improvement and strengthening, and will support&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health in the decision making on strategies for the COVID-19 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal The overarching goal of this protocol is to determine the incidence, prevalence, and&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 among patients living with HIV and healthcare workers&#xD;
      providing HIV services, and to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) and the&#xD;
      impact that COVID-19 has on them and on the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the incidence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in two groups: 1) PLHIV and&#xD;
           enrolled in care, and 2) Healthcare workers (HCWs) providing HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the knowledge, attitudes, practices and perceived risks (KAP-P) regarding&#xD;
           SARS CoV-2, prevention, transmission, and management among PLHIV and HCWs providing HIV&#xD;
           services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on retention to HIV care. Secondary&#xD;
           Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the clinical, immunologic, and virological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      in PLHIV and HCWs providing HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To describe the perceptions of PLHIV and HCWs providing HIV services regarding the&#xD;
      influence that the COVID-19 pandemic has on the delivery of essential services (including&#xD;
      HIV/TB care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To measure the fidelity of participating health facilities to the implementation of&#xD;
      national COVID-19 guidelines.&#xD;
