    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial finds out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      ALX148 in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide in treating patients with indolent and&#xD;
      aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunotherapy with ALX148, may induce changes in&#xD;
      body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy drugs, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called CD20 found on&#xD;
      B-cells, and may kill cancer cells. Giving ALX148 in combination with rituximab and&#xD;
      lenalidomide may help to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability, and to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      and schedule of CD47 antagonist ALX148 (ALX148) in combination with rituximab and&#xD;
      lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory B-non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) (both&#xD;
      indolent and aggressive histology) in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of ALX148, rituximab and lenalidomide at the&#xD;
      RP2D (determined in phase I) in patients with previously untreated and high tumor burden&#xD;
      indolent B-NHL in phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate other toxicity and efficacy measures of the combination of ALX148, rituximab&#xD;
      and lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic effects and investigate biomarkers of response and&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ALX148 followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ALX148 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, or days&#xD;
      1 and 15, or day 1 depending on dose level. Patients also receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1, then on day 1 of cycles 2-6, and lenalidomide orally (PO)&#xD;
      daily once (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-6. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 30 days, then up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
