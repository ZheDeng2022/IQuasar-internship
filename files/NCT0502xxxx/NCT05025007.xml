  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot deformities are one of the most common orthopedic problems in patients with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy(CP). Various methods have been proposed to evaluate foot morphology. Arch height index&#xD;
      (AHI) measurement is a simple and quantitative method that can be applied in outpatient&#xD;
      settings to evaluate the morphology of the medial longitudinal arch(MLA) of the foot. In this&#xD;
      study, we aim to investigate the feasibility of AHI measurement in children with CP and, to&#xD;
      identify other clinical findings that may be related to foot arch height determined by the&#xD;
      AHI method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a posture, movement, and motor dysfunction that occurs as a result of&#xD;
      non-progressive damage of the developing brain during the intrauterine period or early&#xD;
      childhood. Foot deformities, including pes planus and pes cavus, are common in children with&#xD;
      CP and deteriorate posture and mobility due to its progressive nature and accompanying pain.&#xD;
      Spasticity, muscle imbalances, soft tissue changes, and subsequent skeletal disorders are&#xD;
      blamed for foot deformities in patients with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some methods such as foot posture index, navicular drop test, footprint methods, and&#xD;
      radiological imaging have been described to identify and evaluate the MLA and foot/ankle&#xD;
      posture. Arch height index (AHI) measurement is a novel method that evaluates especially&#xD;
      medial longitudinal arch(MLA) morphology, with proven validity and reliability. It is&#xD;
      essentially based on the measurement of the dorsum height and the length of the foot by using&#xD;
      various caliper systems during varying degrees of load-bearing like sitting or standing. AHI&#xD;
      measurement has some advantages over other methods. Measuring AHI during varying degrees of&#xD;
      load-bearing such as sitting or standing allows us to quantitatively assess the mobility of&#xD;
      the MLA. AHI measurement should be preferred in patients with foot sole skin disorders where&#xD;
      footprint measurement methods are inefficient. Its results are not affected by some factors&#xD;
      such as x-ray tube angle differences in foot radiography. It does not pose a risk of&#xD;
      radiation exposure and is easy to apply. However, there is no data on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the AHI method in determining the MLA morphology in children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hypothesis of this study is that AHI measurement results in patients with CP&#xD;
      correlate with data obtained from standard foot radiographs. The second aim of the study is&#xD;
      to investigate the relationship between MLA morphology and other findings such as joint range&#xD;
      of motion and spasticity of lower extremity muscles in patients with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy who were admitted to the Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Department of our hospital will be evaluated in terms of eligibility criteria&#xD;
      for the study. Eligible patients will be informed about the trial, and informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from those who agree to participate. It was planned to recruit 24 subjects with a&#xD;
      correlation coefficient of 0.8, a power of 0.90, and a margin of error of 0.05 to determine&#xD;
      the correlation between AHI and quantitative foot radiography data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, body mass indexes, physical examination findings including gait patterns,&#xD;
      ankle and foot range of motion and tone of the certain lower extremity muscles of&#xD;
      participants will be recorded. MLA morphology will be evaluated by foot radiographs and AHI&#xD;
      measurements. The AHI measurement will be made both in the bipedal standing and in the&#xD;
      sitting position with both feet calmly on the ground. AHI will be calculated by proportioning&#xD;
      the height of the dorsum measured from the middle 1/2 of the total length of the foot to&#xD;
      truncated foot length.&#xD;
