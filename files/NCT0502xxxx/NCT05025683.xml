  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, investigators apply operations research techniques, more specifically data&#xD;
      analytics, system simulation, mathematical modelling, and optimization, for analyzing and&#xD;
      improving operations in the Emergency Department at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The long&#xD;
      term goals of this project are to demonstrate that integrated approach of data analytics and&#xD;
      systems thinking is beneficial to health service planning and to extend present work to&#xD;
      applications in other health-service systems.&#xD;

      Design and subjects The current study requires time stamps for which patients start and end&#xD;
      activities in the department. Personally identifiable information is not needed in this&#xD;
      study. Investigators will collect the data from the computer system of the Department. The&#xD;
      data will be used for data analysis and the development of simulation and optimization&#xD;
      models. With current models, investigators investigate the effects of queueing policies,&#xD;
      study workforce planning, and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for strategic planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments Data analytics tools and simulation and optimization softwares are needed&#xD;
      in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions With simulation and optimization models, investigators examine the impacts of&#xD;
      different operational strategies on the performance of the Emergency Department. The&#xD;
      Computational experiments will not disturb the actual operations but will provide insights&#xD;
      into the effectiveness of the various intervention policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures Investigators will derive insights from computational experiments and&#xD;
      deliver useful recommendations for managing emergency department operations in Hong Kong.&#xD;
