  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical performance of 2 bonding and composite packing techniques in the proximal&#xD;
      cavities of permanent posterior teeth will be assessed. Incremental packing with pre-curing&#xD;
      of universal adhesive in selective etching mode is compared to injection molding of preheated&#xD;
      composing co-cured with universal adhesive in selective-etch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes will focus on marginal integrity, post-operative hypersensitivity, and contact&#xD;
      form and tightness.&#xD;

      Aim of the study: To evaluate the clinical performance in terms of marginal integrity,&#xD;
      contact tightness and form, and post-operative hypersensitivity of injection-molded co-cured&#xD;
      bulk-fill composite versus incrementally-packed composite in proximal cavities of permanent&#xD;
      posterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICOTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P: Population: Adult patients with carious posterior molars requiring moderate-sized proximal&#xD;
      composite restorations I: Intervention: Injection-molding technique using co-cured bulk-fill&#xD;
      composite resin C: Comparator: Conventional incrementally-packed resin composite O: Outcome:&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Marginal integrity of examined restorations; Secondary Outcomes: Post-&#xD;
      operative hypersensitivity and contact tightness of examined restorations T: Time:&#xD;
      Restorations will be evaluated at baseline (T0), 6 (T1), 12 (T2), 24 (T3) and 36 (T4) months.&#xD;
      Post-operative hypersensitivity will be evaluated at 48 hours and at baseline (one week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      S: Study design: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT): parallel,&#xD;
      equivalence trial with 1:1 allocation ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis tested is that- in moderate-sized proximal cavities, there is no&#xD;
      difference in clinical performance between injection-molded and incrementally-packed&#xD;
      composite restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: In class II proximal cavities, does injection-molding of co-cured&#xD;
      bulk-fill composites provide better clinical performance than conventional&#xD;
      incrementally-packed composite restorations?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting Study will be conducted in the Conservative Dentistry Clinic, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry- The British University in Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a.i. Examination and diagnosis: Examination and selection of patients will be done according&#xD;
      to inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon confirming medical and dental history, recording patients' chief complaints and&#xD;
      dentition, a pre-operative radiograph will be taken using an intraoral sensor to detect&#xD;
      proximal caries and evaluate it against the inclusion criteria. Clinical examination will be&#xD;
      done under 4x magnification and dental unit light using front-face dental mirror and an&#xD;
      explorer&#xD;
&#xD;
      a.ii. Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cavity preparation: Both intervention and control restorations will be placed by one&#xD;
           operator (A.G) in a single visit per participant. Local anaesthetic agent will be&#xD;
           administered followed by rudder dam quadrant isolation and pre-wedging using wooden&#xD;
           wedges of appropriate sizes. Cavity preparation will be done using appropriate burs;&#xD;
           enamel margins will be beveled, and proximal line angles will be finished using coarse&#xD;
           and medium grit strips. Soft caries will be removed using sharp excavators of&#xD;
           appropriate shapes and sizes. Finished cavities will be air-water rinsed to remove all&#xD;
           blood and contaminants prior to bonding procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bonding procedures: Finished cavities will receive bioclear pre-contoured matrix bands&#xD;
           of appropriate sizes. Suitable wedges and separator rings will be applied accordingly&#xD;
           for all cavities. Etching of enamel will take place for 30 seconds with 34-37%&#xD;
           orthophosphoric acid, which will then be rinsed off with a steady shower of air-water&#xD;
           for 15 seconds. Cavity will be air-dried gently followed by universal adhesive&#xD;
           application in several coats that will not be cured separately before composite&#xD;
           injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cavity liner: Bulk-fill flowable composite comprising 10% of the anticipated volume of&#xD;
           the final restoration will be injected prior to the succeeding pre-heated composite&#xD;
           paste. In this case, flowable paste is to be co-cured with the preheated successor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Injection-molding procedure: a bulk-fill composite will be pre-heated in a special&#xD;
           composite heater to 50 degrees Celsius. Composite will be dispensed from pre-heated&#xD;
           compules into the preceding flowable paste- while maintaining the tip of the compule in&#xD;
           the injected composite to avoid air entrapment. Both injected bulk-fill composite and&#xD;
           preceding flowable composite will be co-cured using a LED dental lamp, checked for&#xD;
           intensity before each procedure, according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Finishing and polishing: restorations will be contoured under copious coolant using&#xD;
           medium grit diamond stones, then finished using fine-grit ones. Inter-proximal surfaces&#xD;
           will be finished using medium and fine-grit strips. Restorations will further be&#xD;
           polished using diamond impregnated rubber points and cups and composite polishing paste.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. iii. Comparator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- Cavity preparation: cavity preparation procedures will be carried out using appropriate&#xD;
      rotary and hand instruments so that the final cavity will be caries free, with rounded&#xD;
      internal line angles, saucer-shape internal outline, and finished external enamel outline. No&#xD;
      beveling of enamel margins will take place. 2- Bonding procedures: a sectional matrix system:&#xD;
      thin pre-contoured metal matrix of appropriate sizes, suitable wedges and separator rings&#xD;
      will be applied to all cavities. Selective etching approach will be followed whereas enamel&#xD;
      will be etched for 30 seconds using 34-37% orthophosphoric acid, and then rinsed off with a&#xD;
      steady shower of air-water for 15 seconds. Cavity will be gently air dried before universal&#xD;
      adhesive application and LED curing according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- Cavity liner: a very thin layer of flowable composite resin will be applied over bonded&#xD;
      surfaces, gently agitated with an explorer to clear any bubbles, then LED cured according to&#xD;
      the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4- Composite resin packing: composite will be packed in a centripetal pattern using&#xD;
      non-sticky metal composite applicators of appropriate shapes and sizes; starting with a 1 mm&#xD;
      vertical marginal ridge followed by oblique increments, sculpted to final anatomy, and&#xD;
      not-more-than 2 mm thick each. Each increment will be cured according to composite resin&#xD;
      manufacturer's instruction- using a LED dental lamp checked for intensity before each&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5- Finishing and polishing: restorations will be contoured under copious coolant using medium&#xD;
      grit diamond stones, then finished using fine-grit ones. Inter-proximal surfaces will be&#xD;
      finished using medium and fine-grit strips. Restorations will further be polished using&#xD;
      diamond impregnated rubber points and cups and composite polishing paste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a.iv. Assessment: Two double-blinded assessors will be calibrated to 100% agreement on 10&#xD;
      patients- not included in this trial. In cases of disagreement between evaluators, further&#xD;
      discussion will take place till reaching consensus. 1ry and 2ry outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      following the International Dental Federation, criteria and assessment tools. Evaluation will&#xD;
      be done at baseline (T0) (1 week after restoration); (T1) after 6 months; (T2) after 12&#xD;
      months; (T3) after 24 months; and (T4) at 36 months. Post-operative hypersensitivity,&#xD;
      however, will be assessed at 48 hours and baseline only followed by vitality assessment at&#xD;
      following recall appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Criteria for discontinuing the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of pathologic or traumatic pulp injury, the process will be discontinued and the&#xD;
      proper line of treatment will be carried out accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Intervention adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment objectives, timelines and prognosis will be explained elaborately to patients by&#xD;
      the operator. For improving oral hygiene measures, the operator will ask the patients to&#xD;
      adhere to oral hygiene instructions as per their follow-up instruction charts. A tooth brush&#xD;
      and floss will be provided for each patient on each follow-up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Intervention-concomitant care: Patients will be instructed not to use pain killers without&#xD;
      referring to the operator so as not to obscure the assessment of post-operative&#xD;
      hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A success/failure response is planned to be assessed for the intended outcomes of this study-&#xD;
      Power analysis was designed to have adequate power to apply statistical test of the research&#xD;
      hypothesis, to evaluate bulk fill paste-like resin composite compared to conventional&#xD;
      incremental resin composite, in restoration of carious posterior permanent teeth in terms of&#xD;
      marginal adaptation, after 12 months using FDI criteria. According to a study in 2015, listed&#xD;
      in the references, in which the probability of score 1 for marginal adaptation of&#xD;
      conventional incremental resin composite (comparator) was ( 0.99); probability of score 2 was&#xD;
      (0.01) with effect size w=0.98 (n=9). If the estimated probability of marginal adaptation for&#xD;
      bulk fill paste-like resin composite was (0.9) for score 1, (0.1) for score 2 with effect&#xD;
      size w= 0.8 (n=13). By adopting an alpha (α) level of 0.05 (5%), power=80%, the predicted&#xD;
      sample size was a total of 22 (11 per group). Sample size was increased by (30%) to account&#xD;
      for possible dropouts during follow-up intervals to be total of (28) cases i.e. (14) for each&#xD;
      group. Sample size calculation was performed using G*Power 3.1.9.2 using chi square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Assignment of interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Random sequence generation: M.Y performed block randomization; numbers were generated from&#xD;
      1:28 deciding which tooth to receive which intervention in each patient using online software&#xD;
      available at www.sealedenvelope.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Allocation-concealment mechanism:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence generation will be concealed using opaque sealed envelopes. Operator, A.G., will&#xD;
      choose between numbers arranged by M.Y who will not be involved in any clinical phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Implementation: M.Y. will perform sequence concealment. A.G and M.Y will carry out&#xD;
      allocation concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding (masking): It will be a triple blinded study so that subjects, assessors (A.Y and&#xD;
      R.H), and statisticians will be blinded&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Data collection, management and analysis a. Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a.i. Baseline data collection: For every patient, chief complaint, medical and dental&#xD;
      history, and contact information will be recorded in examination charts and outpatient clinic&#xD;
      software. Data entry will be done by A.G&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ii. Outcome data collection: (A.Y and R.H) will be calibrated to 100% agreement on 10&#xD;
           patients- not included in this trial. In cases of disagreement between evaluators,&#xD;
           further discussion will take place till reaching consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient retention: A.G. will record telephone numbers and address of all subjects in the&#xD;
           study as a part of the signed consent. Patients will be contacted by phone one day&#xD;
           before the follow-up dates. A.G will also explain to the patient the benefits of follow&#xD;
           up and any defective restoration will be managed accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.G will electronically enter all the data. Patients' files are to be stored in numerical&#xD;
      order in a secured place. All paper sheets concerned with the personal or outcome data will&#xD;
      be stored in a locked cabinet and the Conservative dentistry department, the British&#xD;
      University in Egypt. The excel sheets of patients data will be stored in a computer in the&#xD;
      Conservative Department- Faculty of Dentistry, the British University in Egypt. The computer&#xD;
      will have a password only known to A.G and M.Y. to prevent unauthorized access to data and&#xD;
      double data entry. A back-up will be made online to avoid data loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be presented as percentages. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      when applicable will be used for comparisons between the groups. Friedman's test and&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier plot will be used to study the changes by time. Log-rank test will be used to&#xD;
      statistically compare the groups when evaluating survival analysis. The significance level&#xD;
      will be set at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed with IBM® SPSS® Statistics&#xD;
      Version 20 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., an IBM Company).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Data monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      M.Y will monitor this study for the risk of bias and to monitor blinding. She will also have&#xD;
      full access to the results and to take the final decision to terminate the trial when&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.G will explain possible harms to patients. o harms are expected and if the is any adverse&#xD;
      actions, the process will be stopped immediately and managed accordingly after reporting it&#xD;
      to M.Y and R.H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing of the study design will be done by M.Y and R.H the co-supervisor to assure quality&#xD;
      of the research procedures&#xD;
