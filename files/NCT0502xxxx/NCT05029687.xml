  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will integrate user-centered design, community engagement, and&#xD;
      implementation science, with a randomized controlled trial (RCT), to develop, test, and&#xD;
      collect implementation data on a youth-led hypertension (HTN) education digital badge. The&#xD;
      badge will act as an electronic tool to guide youth through learning and then teaching adults&#xD;
      on how to achieve better HTN control. Adults with HTN and youth will be recruited for&#xD;
      user-centered design sessions to provide input in the development of a youth-led HTN&#xD;
      education digital badge. The investigators will then recruit adult emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      patients with uncontrolled HTN (blood pressure (BP) ≥130/80 mm Hg) who live with a youth&#xD;
      (15-18 years old) and the youth themselves for a RCT. The adult plus youth dyad will be&#xD;
      randomized to either: 1) intervention arm- 6-week youth-led HTN education digital badge at&#xD;
      home- or 2) control arm- 6-week youth job readiness digital badge at home. In addition to the&#xD;
      primary study outcome of adult BP change 2-months post-intervention, the investigator will&#xD;
      collect secondary outcomes of HTN knowledge and youth self-efficacy, as well as&#xD;
      implementation metrics of intervention acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Create a youth-led HTN education digital badge by means of user-centered design&#xD;
      methods and community engagement with adults with HTN and youth to obtain input on the&#xD;
      contents of the digital badge prior to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: The hypertension knowledge assessment being used in the study has not been used&#xD;
      before on youth or Spanish-speaking populations, so the investigators will obtain feedback on&#xD;
      the assessment from these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of a youth-led HTN education digital badge intervention on&#xD;
      the primary outcome of mean systolic BP and diastolic BP change in adults with uncontrolled&#xD;
      HTN at 2-months post-intervention compared to the control group. Additionally, evaluate&#xD;
      change in HTN knowledge and youth self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation process of the youth-led HTN education digital badge by&#xD;
      collecting qualitative and quantitative data on acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of&#xD;
      the intervention by participants.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is a youth-led HTN education digital badge, which will be comprised of a 6-week playlist of one module per week comprising the playlist. Youth will learn from the module and will teach the adult in their dyad about hypertension education in each week's themed module.</description>

    <description>For dyads that are randomized into the control arm, the youth will complete job readiness digital badges. These will include existing LRNG Career &amp; Job Readiness digital badge playlists, with such playlists as, &quot;Interview Preparation&quot;, &quot;Resume Ready&quot;, and &quot;Professionalism&quot;. While this group may complete multiple digital badges, the total time needed to complete the badges will be approximately equivalent to that of the intervention group (eg. one hour per week for each arm).</description>
