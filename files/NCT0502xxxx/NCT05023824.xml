    <textblock>
      The investigators compare the efficacy of alpha-blocker and 5-ARI withdrawal to continued&#xD;
      combination therapy on the maintenance of LUTS and improvement of quality of life outcomes in&#xD;
      men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is the primary cause of lower urinary tract symptoms&#xD;
      (LUTS). Combination therapy with an alpha-blocker and 5α reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) is the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of BPH-related LUTS for the reduction of the size of the prostate and&#xD;
      LUTS improvement. Combination therapy is tolerated well by most men; however, the incidence&#xD;
      of adverse events is higher than with either therapy alone. In patients with improved LUTS&#xD;
      following combination therapy, the aim of this study is based on the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      withdrawal of either therapy will not increase the risk of LUTS aggravation while improving&#xD;
      the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel trial, comparing&#xD;
      alpha-blocker withdrawal and 5-ARI withdrawal to continued combination therapy. Treatments&#xD;
      will be allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio, based on IPSS score (≤30% decrease from baseline) and&#xD;
      prostate volume (≤35% decrease from baseline).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS is the sum of the seven questions with each score ranging from 0 (best) to 5 (worst). IPSS is self-administered at screening and each time-point of month 3, 6, 12, and 18. Seven questions included are incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining and nocturia. The total IPSS score can range from 0-35 with severity catagories of mild (0 to 7), moderate (8 to 19) or severe (20 to 35). Month 18 is the primary timepoint and earlier timepoints are considered secondary. Change from baseline defined as difference between post-baseline value and baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change in Overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OABSS is a symptom assessment questionnaire designed to quantify OAB symptoms into a single score. The questionnaire consists of 4 questions on OAB symptoms with maximum scores ranging from 2 to 5: daytime frequency (2 points), night-time frequency (3 points), urgency (5 points), and UUI (5 points). OABSS is self-administered at screening and each time-point of month 3, 6, 12 and 18. Change from baseline defined as difference between post-baseline value and baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change in EuroQol five dimension scale (EQ-5D) score from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol five dimension descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ-5D is self-administered at screening and each time-point of month 3, 6, 12 and 18. Change from baseline defined as difference between post-baseline value and baseline value.</description>

    <description>The measurement of maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) is widely used in the assessment of men complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms. Qmax is performed at screening and each time-point of month 3, 12, and 18. Change from baseline defined as difference between post-baseline value and baseline value.</description>
