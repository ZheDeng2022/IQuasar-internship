  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease (autosomal recessive) which involves malfunction of the&#xD;
      exocrine glands, leading to abnormal secretions in the body. It is a progressive disease that&#xD;
      causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time. Clinical&#xD;
      symptoms include persistent coughing, at times with phlegm, wheezing or shortness of breath,&#xD;
      fatigue, difficulty with bowel movements sinus infections, poor growth, clubbing of the&#xD;
      fingers and toes, and infertility in most males. The disease must be managed throughout life&#xD;
      with diet, medication and preventive chest physical therapy as soon as any symptoms are noted&#xD;
      in the young child. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the difference between the&#xD;
      effects of Manual Chest Physiotherapy (CPT) and Active Cycle of Breathing Techniques (ACBT)&#xD;
      in patients of Cystic Fibrosis. The tools of our study were Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale and&#xD;
      Quality of well-being Scale. The total sample of our study was 14 out of which 7 were&#xD;
      included in GROUP A and 7 Group B. SPSS 23 was used for statistical analysis and parametric&#xD;
      tests were used for analysis&#xD;

    <description>Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale is most commonly used to assess symptoms of breathlessness. It has a range from 0 to 10 (with 0 being no exertion and 10 being maximum effort).</description>

    <description>The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) is a general health quality of life questionnaire which measures overall status and well-being over the previous three days in four areas: physical activities, social activities, mobility, and symptom/problem complexes. It consists of 71 items and takes 20 minutes to complete</description>

    <description>all the components of Manual Chest Physiotherapy wer performed on the patients of this group. MCPT was done few hours before meals and it was made sure that nothing was in patient's mouth while doing chest physiotherapy. MCPT includes postural drainage, percussion and vibrations. Chest Physiotherapy was done thrice a day for 30 minutes and there were 21 sessions a week.</description>

    <description>all the components of Active Cycle of Breathing techniques (ACBT) were performed on the patients of this group. ACBT includes Breathing control techniques, chest expansion exercises and Forced Expiration Technique. These were performed thrice a day for 30 minutes and for 21 sessions a week.</description>
