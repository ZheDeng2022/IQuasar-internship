    <textblock>
      The study will identify pediatric patients 3-18 years old who have penicillin allergy label&#xD;
      in the electronic medical record. Those who are identified will be stratified into no-risk,&#xD;
      low-risk and high-risk category using a screening questionnaire. The following definitions&#xD;
      will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No-risk: Patients who are historically labeled with penicillin allergy in the EMR based on&#xD;
      family history alone OR those who have tolerated penicillin after a concerning incident&#xD;
      without any reaction OR with penicillin allergy label but deny any history of reaction to any&#xD;
      form of penicillin on screening questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-risk: Patients with previous reaction not suggestive of anaphylaxis (defined below) AND&#xD;
      not requiring hospitalization for the reaction OR reaction considered non- immunologic (e.g.&#xD;
      diarrhea, nausea, yeast vaginitis) OR exposure to penicillin- containing antibiotic after the&#xD;
      date of reported reaction with no anaphylaxis and hospitalization AND no serious types of&#xD;
      delayed reactions such as Steven- Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),&#xD;
      acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), drug-induced hepatitis or other documented organ injury,&#xD;
      drug rash eosinophilia systemic symptoms (DRESS), hemolytic anemia, drug-induced cytopenia,&#xD;
      and serum sickness. Patients who had delayed reaction (onset more than 24 hours) of isolated,&#xD;
      non-progressive symptoms (such as rash/hives alone) also belong to this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-risk: Patients with penicillin allergy label on EMR with previous reaction suggestive of&#xD;
      anaphylaxis (defined below) OR requiring hospitalization/epinephrine administration for the&#xD;
      reaction OR reactions considered immunologic (angioedema, joint pains) OR involving serious&#xD;
      types of reactions such as Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),&#xD;
      acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), drug-induced hepatitis or other documented organ injury,&#xD;
      drug rash eosinophilia systemic symptoms (DRESS), hemolytic anemia, drug-induced cytopenia,&#xD;
      and serum sickness. Patients who were previously diagnosed with penicillin allergy by an&#xD;
      allergist also belong to the high-risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the no-risk group will be immediately delabeled. Patients in the high-risk group&#xD;
      will be referred to allergy/immunology for further work up. The focus of this study is to&#xD;
      identify the patients who belong to the low-risk group. This group of patients will be&#xD;
      subjected to graded oral amoxicillin challenge testing. Those who will have reactions&#xD;
      compatible with allergy will have their allergy status retained in the electronic medical&#xD;
      record. Those that will not have reactions or those that will have reactions that are not&#xD;
      compatible with allergy will be delabeled in the electronic medical record.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify pediatric patients with reported penicillin allergy in electronic medical record&#xD;
      (EMR) by performing direct oral amoxicillin challenge testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Pediatric patients with reported penicillin allergy in EMR can be verified by&#xD;
      performing direct oral amoxicillin challenge testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify no-risk, low-risk and high-risk patients among pediatric patients with&#xD;
           reported penicillin allergy in EMR through a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: No-risk, low-risk and high-risk pediatric patients with reported penicillin&#xD;
           allergy in EMR can be identified using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To be able to delabel pediatric patients with reported penicillin allergy in EMR who are&#xD;
           identified as no-risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: No-risk pediatric patients with reported penicillin allergy in EMR can be&#xD;
           delabeled using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To be able to delabel identified low-risk pediatric patients with reported penicillin&#xD;
           allergy in EMR who are verified not allergic to penicillin by direct oral amoxicillin&#xD;
           challenge testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Identified low-risk pediatric patients with reported penicillin allergy in&#xD;
           EMR using a questionnaire can be verified using direct oral amoxicillin challenge&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To be able to provide proper referral guidance to patients identified as high-risk and&#xD;
           those who failed oral amoxicillin challenge testing to allergy and immunology for&#xD;
           further evaluation and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Proper referral guidance to patients identified as high-risk and those who failed&#xD;
      oral penicillin challenge testing to allergy and immunology can be provided for their further&#xD;
      evaluation and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance Penicillin remains a reliable class of antibiotics that&#xD;
      addresses a majority of infections both in outpatient and inpatient settings.(1,2) It is also&#xD;
      one of the cheapest antibiotics to use for empiric therapy for susceptible infections.(3,4)&#xD;
      Emerging literature suggests that the number of patients with historical penicillin allergy&#xD;
      is an overestimate. A growing number of studies show that only approximately 1-10 % of&#xD;
      patients with historical penicillin allergy are truly allergic after verified allergy testing&#xD;
      is done.(1-3,5,7,8,10,11,12) Despite this, efforts on antibiotic allergy delabeling remains&#xD;
      sparse and penicillin allergy remains to be the most common drug allergy reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few institutions have implemented, much less conceptualized, protocols to determine truly&#xD;
      allergic patients who have reported penicillin allergy when diagnosed with infections&#xD;
      theoretically susceptible to penicillin.(6) One limitation perhaps is the absence of&#xD;
      validated questionnaire that uniformly captures accepted levels of risk especially in the&#xD;
      pediatric population.(7) As a result, these patients end up receiving alternative&#xD;
      antimicrobial agents that pose a risk for emergence of resistance, development of unnecessary&#xD;
      intestinal dysbiosis, and increased economic burden to health care resulting in suboptimal&#xD;
      clinical outcome. (1-6) Studies aiming to validate direct oral challenge testing as a means&#xD;
      of penicillin allergy delabeling is a fertile avenue for this clinical query to be addressed&#xD;
      in a cost-effective and timely manner. (8-13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying patients with no immunologically-mediated penicillin allergy and delabeling them&#xD;
      in the electronic medical record (EMR) accordingly will mitigate the use of second-line&#xD;
      antibiotics, aid in minimizing development of antimicrobial resistance, ameliorate&#xD;
      unnecessary economic burden, and overall lead to positive impact in clinical outcome and&#xD;
      patient care. (1,5,7,8,10,11,12) In the same way, this process will also identify patients&#xD;
      with true penicillin allergy creating a point-of-care opportunity to provide them proper&#xD;
      guidance on the importance of Allergy/Immunology follow-up for further evaluation and&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 3-18 years old admitted at our institution will be screened for inclusion. We will&#xD;
      screen approximately 800 patients and enroll 60 patients in our study (based on the weekly&#xD;
      census) over a span of 3 months. HIPAA regulations will be strictly observed in data handling&#xD;
      to protect patient privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and consenting of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed parental consent and verbal consent from study team will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      screening. Patients will be screened using a questionnaire to identify risk status. Patients&#xD;
      identified as no-risk (EMR label based purely on family history of penicillin allergy,&#xD;
      mislabeled patients) will be immediately delabeled in EMR. High-risk patients (those with&#xD;
      reaction consistent with IgE mediated reaction or with history of anaphylaxis) will be&#xD;
      excluded. Guidance on further care such as referral to an allergist will be recommended if&#xD;
      not yet done. Low-risk patients (those with mild reaction not consistent with IgE mediated&#xD;
      reaction, no history of serious delayed reaction or no reaction on subsequent penicillin&#xD;
      receipt) will be identified to undergo graded direct oral amoxicillin challenge testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Amoxicillin Challenge Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed parental consent and patient assent (7 years and older) will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      challenge testing. Only low-risk patients with parent/guardian in the room and no receipt of&#xD;
      anti-histamine 48 hours prior will be challenged. Only patients who can tolerate enteral&#xD;
      amoxicillin will be challenged. Rescue kits (containing diphenhydramine, epinephrine and&#xD;
      albuterol) will be ready at bedside prior to challenging. Baseline vital signs will be&#xD;
      obtained prior to challenging. Oral challenge testing will be graded: initial 10% of the dose&#xD;
      followed by remaining 90% of the dose (total dose 45 mg/kg with maximum of 1000 mg) 30&#xD;
      minutes apart. Vital signs will be repeated 30 minutes after the first dose, 30 minutes after&#xD;
      the second dose and finally 60 minutes after the second dose. Study team will administer&#xD;
      amoxicillin doses and monitor for signs of amoxicillin allergic reaction. Any reaction during&#xD;
      the testing will be assessed by trained study team member. A clinical event note will be&#xD;
      written in the EMR for any reaction occurring during the testing as well the management&#xD;
      implored to mitigate reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delabeling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-risk patients who passed the challenge testing will be delabeled in EMR. Documentation of&#xD;
      the result will be sent to patient's primary care doctor (with permission from parent) for&#xD;
      guidance on future use of penicillin.&#xD;
