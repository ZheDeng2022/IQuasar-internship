  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the main factors that contribute to an acquired flat foot deformity which&#xD;
      in turn impairs the balance strategies. The purpose of the current study was to compare the&#xD;
      effect of plyometric exercises with flatfoot corrective exercise on balance, foot posture,&#xD;
      and functional mobility in obese children with flexible flatfoot.&#xD;

      A sample of 47 male children participated in the current study. The participants were&#xD;
      selected from different elementary schools in Taif, Saudi Arabia. Their age ranged from 7 to&#xD;
      11 years. the sample was randomly divided into 3 groups: the experimental group I, (EGI), the&#xD;
      experimental group II, (EGII), and the control group (CG). The EGI received a plyometric&#xD;
      exercise program. The EGII received the corrective exercises 2 sessions per week for 10&#xD;
      weeks. The control group did not perform any planned physical activities during the&#xD;
      intervention period but continued in their routine physical activities. The Prokin system was&#xD;
      used to assess the static balance, timed up and go test was used to assess functional&#xD;
      mobility, and Navicular drop test was used to assess the degree of flatfoot deformity, prior&#xD;
      to and after the intervention for all groups.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A Pretest-posttest control group design was used. A sample of 47 male children participated in the current study. After gathering the baseline measurements, the participants were randomly assigned into three groups: experimental group I, (EGI) contained 16 participants, experimental group II (EGII) contained 16 participants, and control group, (CG) contained 15. The stratification was done using sealed envelopes. The children were not aware of their group.</intervention_model_description>
