      This phase 3 study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Quadrivalent HPV&#xD;
      recombinant vaccine in Chinese females aged 9 to 26 years&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a singel-center study (protocol 4-HPV-3002) in which women are planned to receive&#xD;
      q-HPV vaccine. Study participation will last approximately 60 months and involves a total of&#xD;
      nine or eleven scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also assess whether the immunogenicity of the q-HPV vaccine given 2-dose&#xD;
      schedule in 9-14 year old girls is noninferior to that in young women, aged 20-26, receiving&#xD;
      3 doses, and 3 doses in 9-19 year old girls is noninferior to that in young women receiving 3&#xD;
      doses, while assessing the safety of this vaccine.&#xD;
