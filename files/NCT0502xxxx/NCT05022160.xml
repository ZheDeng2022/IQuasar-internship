    <textblock>
      Bladder irrigation with a 3 way foley catheter is an important component of post operative&#xD;
      management of transurethral bladder surgeries. But it is associated with a high incidence of&#xD;
      bladder discomfort. Catheter related bladder discomfort (CRBD) doesn't respond to the&#xD;
      orthodox opioid pain medication and is greatly distressful to the patients postoperatively,&#xD;
      adversely affecting the quality of recovery often requiring administration of additional pain&#xD;
      medication thereby increasing treatment costs, patient dissatisfaction and longer hospital&#xD;
      stays. Several systemic agents have been used to reduce CRBD, but they have many side&#xD;
      effects. A trial has been planned to find a way of reducing CRBD avoid distressing systemic&#xD;
      side effects&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trans urethral resection of prostate (TURP) and trans urethral resection of bladder tumor&#xD;
      (TURBT) are the two most commonly performed endourological procedures associated with&#xD;
      complication rates of 10% and 11% respectively.1 This relatively high percentage of&#xD;
      complications can be owed to the amount of blood loss that occurs in these surgical&#xD;
      procedures and can cause subsequent clot retention. Irrigation attached with three-way large&#xD;
      bore urinary catheters is employed in order to avoid this clot retention.2 Catheter related&#xD;
      bladder discomfort (CRBD) is a consequence of these large bore urinary catheters irritating&#xD;
      the bladder mucosa causing involuntary bladder contractions being mediated by urothelial&#xD;
      muscarinic receptors.3 The incidence of CRBD ranges from 47% to 90%.4 CRBD induced by&#xD;
      indwelling urinary catheter is characterized by supra-pubic discomfort and a burning&#xD;
      sensation in the urethra accompanied by an intense urge to void and increased urinary&#xD;
      frequency.5 CRBD doesn't respond to the orthodox opioid pain medication and is greatly&#xD;
      distressful to the patients postoperatively, adversely affecting the quality of recovery&#xD;
      often requiring administration of additional pain medication thereby increasing treatment&#xD;
      costs, patient dissatisfaction and longer hospital stays.3-5 The sensory supply of urethra&#xD;
      and bladder neck is carried by Pudendal nerve. It originates from the ventral rami of the&#xD;
      anterior nerve roots arising from sacral segments S2 to S4. Therefore theoretically, CRBD can&#xD;
      be prevented by applying Pudendal Nerve Block (PNB).5 Xiaoqiang et al in 2017 reported that&#xD;
      pudendal nerve block significantly reduced incidence of post-operative CRBD with&#xD;
      administration of pudendal nerve block as compared to controls. The frequency of&#xD;
      postoperative CRBD was at 63% in PNB versus 82% in control group at 30 minutes which was&#xD;
      statistically significant (p=0.004). Similarly, the frequency of CRBD at 2 hours was 64% in&#xD;
      PNB and 90% in control group (pË‚0.001); and the frequency of CRBD at 8 hours was 58% in PNB&#xD;
      and 79% in control group (p=0.003) respectively coinciding with the duration of action of&#xD;
      Ropivacaine. Beyond that time there was no statistically significant difference between the&#xD;
      two groups.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this study is that there is no previous study on this specific topic in the&#xD;
      Pakistan. Thus, the findings of my study will help to determine the efficacy of pudendal&#xD;
      nerve block in preventing CRBD in our population and will help improve evidence-based&#xD;
      practices in patients undergoing TURP and TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;To compare between spinal anesthesia with pudendal nerve block versus spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      alone in terms of frequency of post-operative CRBD and its severity in patients undergoing&#xD;
      TURP and TURBT&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CATHETER RELATED BLADDER DISCOMFORT CRBD will be defined as presence of supra-pubic&#xD;
           discomfort and a burning sensation in the urethra accompanied by an intense urge to&#xD;
           void.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PUDENDAL NERVE BLOCK PNB is achieved by Infiltration of .5% ropivacaine in 5ml&#xD;
           increments, maximum of 10 ml bilaterally, around Pudendal nerve on both sides under&#xD;
           nerve stimulator guidance via two separate punctures 3 and 9 o'clock; approximately 3.5&#xD;
           to 4 cm from the center of the anus after making lithotomy position and aseptic&#xD;
           preparation of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. NUMERIC RATING SCALE FOR PAIN Numeric Rating Scale for Pain (NRSP) is a continuous scale&#xD;
           of pain intensity, consisting of a straight line 10 cm long between the two end-points&#xD;
           from 0-10. The patient will specify their level of pain by indicating a position along&#xD;
           this line, as detailed in Annexure C. Pain will be scored as no pain (0), mild pain (&lt;4&#xD;
           cm), moderate pain (4-7 cm) and severe pain (&gt;7 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia and Pudendal Nerve Block are better than spinal anesthesia alone in&#xD;
      preventing post-operative CRBD in patients undergoing TURP and TURBT.&#xD;

&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Total of 250 patients from Armed Forces Institute of Urology, Rawalpindi undergoing TURP or&#xD;
      TURBT who will meet the inclusion and exclusion criterion will be enrolled in the study after&#xD;
      taking permission from hospital ethical review committee and approval of synopsis from CPSP&#xD;
      REU. Written informed consent will be taken from patients included in the study attached as&#xD;
      Annexure A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups; group A and group B containing 125 patients&#xD;
      each by lottery method. Group A patients will be administered bilateral pudendal nerve block&#xD;
      with 0.5% Ropivacaine after giving spinal anesthesia while group B patients will only be&#xD;
      given spinal anesthesia before undergoing TURP or TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics will be documented before the surgery. Postoperatively all the patients&#xD;
      will be observed at intervals of 30 minutes, 08 and 24 hours for development of any&#xD;
      post-operative CRBD and its severity. Data in both the groups will be recorded on a&#xD;
      predesigned proforma of questionnaire attached in the end as Annexure B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be given due respect and their comfort will be taken care of during&#xD;
      examination. The exclusion criteria will be strictly followed to control confounders and bias&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered in and analyzed by SPSS Version 16. Mean and standard deviation will be&#xD;
      calculated for the quantitative variables i.e. Age, BMI etc. Qualitative variables like&#xD;
      gender, ASA grade and CRBD severity will be expressed as frequency and percentages. Effect&#xD;
      modifiers like age, BMI and ASA grade will be controlled by stratification. Frequency of CRBD&#xD;
      in both the groups will be compared by applying post stratification Chi square test. P value&#xD;
      â‰¤ 0.05 will be taken as significant.&#xD;
