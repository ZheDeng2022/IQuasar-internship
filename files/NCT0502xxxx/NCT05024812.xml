  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single arm phase Ⅰb/Ⅱ clinical study aims to&#xD;
      explore the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with toripalimab and SOX regimen in&#xD;
      the first-line treatment of unresectable advanced metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the first-line standard treatment of metastatic gastric cancer is still doublet&#xD;
      or triplet chemotherapy of fluorouracil combined with platinum or paclitaxel. In recent&#xD;
      years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged in advanced gastric cancer with their&#xD;
      unique mechanism of action. PD-1 monoclonal antibody has been explored in multiple&#xD;
      combination schemes in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer. This study aims&#xD;
      to explore the efficacy and safety of an antiangiogenetic TKI, fruquintinib combined with an&#xD;
      ICI, toripalimab and the standard doublet SOX regimen in the first-line treatment of&#xD;
      unresectable advanced metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
