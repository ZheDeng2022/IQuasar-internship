      This paper designs the core strength training scheme based on the query and reference of&#xD;
      relevant literature and the characteristics of C-level difficult movements of Wushu. The&#xD;
      training plan of the experimental group includes three stages (weeks 1-3; weeks 4-9; and week&#xD;
      10-12). Each stage consists of different difficulty levels. The training program is divided&#xD;

      Effect of core strength training on C-level difficulty movements of Wushu routine athletes&#xD;
      Dear Professor Hello! Investigator, a doctoral student in physical education at UPM. This is&#xD;
      an experimental research process on the impact of core strength training on the C- level&#xD;
      difficulty of Competitive Wushu routines. The subjects were 18-22 year old Wushu athletes.&#xD;
      The data obtained from this survey are only for academic research. Therefore,investigator&#xD;
      sincerely invite experts to score each stage of investigator experiment, help investigator do&#xD;
      this experiment better. Thank you very much.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This paper designs the core strength training scheme based on the query and reference of&#xD;
      relevant literature and the characteristics of C-level difficult movements of Wushu. The&#xD;
      training plan of the experimental group includes three stages (weeks 1-3; weeks 4-9; and week&#xD;
      10-12). Each stage consists of different difficulty levels. The specific training contents&#xD;
      are as follows:&#xD;
