    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study that will evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      docetaxel, and cisplatin or carboplatin (PDC) as single treatment modality in patients with&#xD;
      stage II-IVb (T2-4, any N, M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses&#xD;
      (PNS SCC).&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Increase overall response rate (ORR), following pembrolizumab combined with induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to radiation, from historical 60% with induction chemotherapy alone to&#xD;
      80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the following efficacy endpoints relative to historical results with&#xD;
           chemotherapy alone: progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), organ&#xD;
           [orbital, maxillary, cranial] preservation rate (OPR), and locoregional failure (LRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab combined with induction&#xD;
           chemotherapy and chemoradiation in patients with PNS SCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate immune phenotype in tumors and blood, including T cell infiltration and PD-L1&#xD;
           status, with treatment outcomes.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male/female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing&#xD;
             informed consent with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically and/or&#xD;
             cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage II-IVb PNS SCC will be enrolled in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A male participant must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this&#xD;
        protocol during the treatment period and for at least 150 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
        treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;

          1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in Appendix 3 during the&#xD;
             treatment period and for at least 150 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  are preferred to archived tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.&#xD;
                  Have adequate organ function as defined in the following table (Table 1). Blood&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to treatment&#xD;
             (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,&#xD;
             OX 40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including&#xD;
             investigational agents or radiation therapy for PNS SCC but could have received&#xD;
             treatment for prior cancers if greater than 2 years (refer to Item 8 for further&#xD;
             details).&#xD;
