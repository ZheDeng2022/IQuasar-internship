  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCOS is a widely reported condition among young female population and anti-androgen agents&#xD;
      are increasingly being used as part of the medical management of such cases. However,&#xD;
      Clinical studies have reported higher prevalence of gingival inflammation, loss of attachment&#xD;
      and gingival enlargement in women taking hormone based oral contraceptives. Additionally, CPA&#xD;
      has been reported to have an osteoclastic action. Therefore, it is necessary to explore&#xD;
      whether these medications affect the periodontal condition of PCOS patients, who already are&#xD;
      pre-disposed to systemic inflammation. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      periodontal status of female patients diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary syndrome on Cyproterone&#xD;
      acetate/ethinyl estradiol combination regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine, reproductive and metabolic&#xD;
      condition, affecting women of reproductive age globally with a worldwide prevalence ranging&#xD;
      from 5-15%.It is characterised by elevation of multiple markers of inflammation such as&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, white blood cell count as&#xD;
      well as increased oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been hypothesised that PCOS might exacerbate the periodontal condition that is caused&#xD;
      by dental plaque, through various pathophysiological links, namely, low-grade systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance (IR), advanced glycation end products&#xD;
      (AGE), and systemic hormonal levels. Evidence has suggested that periodontal disease causes&#xD;
      chronic subclinical inflammation leading to Insulin resistance, initiating the development of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, which in turn is a prominent feature in PCOS. Hence, a two-way relationship&#xD;
      between PCOS and periodontal disease is currently being explored There exists a pathological&#xD;
      imbalance of Luteinizing Hormone(LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) in women with&#xD;
      PCOS which explains the rationale for treatment with combined hormonal treatment.11 These&#xD;
      treatments include combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and anti androgen tharapy (ADT) in the&#xD;
      form of antiandrogenic progestogen/ ethinylestradiol (EE) combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receptors for estrogen have been demonstrated in the gingiva and periodontal connective&#xD;
      tissue cells While the effects of different contraceptive combinations and/or oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemics on the periodontal condition of female patients diagnosed with PCOS has been&#xD;
      explored, the specific drug combination of CPA/EE has not been studied in detail as yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to evaluate the periodontal status of female patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      PCOS on CPA/EE combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS- The present cross-sectional study will be conducted in the Department&#xD;
      of periodontology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak in collaboration with&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak&#xD;
      over a period of 12-14 months in Female patients diagnosed with PCOS.It will include 150&#xD;
      individuals, who will be comprised into 3 groups and the individuals in each group will be&#xD;
      recruited as Test group 1- Female patients diagnosed with PCOS ON CPA/EE DRUG REGIMEN FOR&#xD;
      ATLEAST 6 MONTHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group 2- Female patients diagnosed with PCOS( NEWLY DIAGNOSED) ,NOT ON ANY MEDICATION,&#xD;
      Control group -SYSTEMICALLY HEALTHY FEMALES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures include bleeding on probing (BOP),Probing pocket&#xD;
      depth(PPD),Clinical attachment level(CAL),Serum High Sensitivity C- reactive Proteins&#xD;
      (hsCRP).SECONDARY MEASURES include Plaque index, Gingival index,Gingival phenotype,Gingival&#xD;
      recession,Demographic parameters ( Education status, Socio-economic status),Anthropometric&#xD;
      parameters (Waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, Body mass index) ,Quality of life ( via&#xD;
      PCOS Questionnaire, Oral health related Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - Data recorded will be processed by standard&#xD;
      statistical analysis.The normality of distribution of data will be examined by Shapiro Wilk&#xD;
      test. Statistical analysis will be performed according to distribution of data. If it is in&#xD;
      normal distribution inter group comparison will be done by using Independent T test between&#xD;
      signed rank test and if in non-normal distribution inter group comparison will be done by&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. The Chi square test will be applied to analyze categoric data.&#xD;
      Correlation and association between predictors and dependent variables will be analyzed by&#xD;
      correlation analysis and regression analysis.&#xD;
