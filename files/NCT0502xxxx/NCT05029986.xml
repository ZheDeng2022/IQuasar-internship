  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to various comorbidities affecting the respiratory system, older speakers are at risk of&#xD;
      experiencing breathing discomfort (dyspnea) during high-demand vocal activities such as&#xD;
      singing, loud speaking, and speaking while exercising. Dyspnea during speech can promote&#xD;
      avoidance of certain situations involving voice production, thus leading to vocal&#xD;
      deconditioning and decreased quality of life. The goal of this pilot study is to test the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a 4-week remote group intervention targeting phonatory&#xD;
      dyspnea, and to gather preliminary efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an intervention including a 2-week socialization phase (control&#xD;
      condition) and a 4-week speech breathing intervention phase (experimental condition). Both&#xD;
      phases will be delivered remotely and in a group setting (10 participants per group).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reported dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, after the 2-week control condition, and after the 4-week experimental condition.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant self-ratings of dyspnea on the University of Cincinnati Dyspnea Questionnaire. This questionnaire contains 30 items scored on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all short of breath) to 5 (always short of breath or cannot do). A higher scores indicates greater shortness of breath and therefore greater handicap.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reported voice handicap</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, after the 2-week control condition, and after the 4-week experimental condition.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant self-ratings of voice handicap on the Voice Handicap Index-10. The Voice Handicap Index-10 is an ordinal scale that measures the degree of handicap a person experiences because of their voice disorder. Each item is scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4. The minimum score is 0 and the maximal score 40. A higher score indicates a greater perceived voice handicap.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reported self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, after the 2-week control condition, and after the 4-week experimental condition.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant self-ratings of self-efficacy for managing their symptoms, using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Self-Efficacy Questionnaire - Managing Symptoms. This questionnaire contains 28 items, each scored on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (I am not at all confident) to 5 (I am very confident). A higher score indicates a greater self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after the 4-week experimental condition, at the end of the study period.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' perceived acceptability of the intervention using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure. This questionnaire contains 5 items scored on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). A higher score indicates a greater acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Breath intake pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, after the 2-week control condition, and after the 4-week experimental condition.</time_frame>
    <description>Pattern of breath intake as measured by the location of inspirations within a speech sample.</description>

    <description>This is a single-arm trial. All participants will receive (1) a control condition (socialization phase, 2 weeks) and (2) an intervention condition (speech breathing intervention, 4 weeks). Group sessions will take place once a week, and participants will be instructed to practice their exercises every day at home during the study duration.</description>
