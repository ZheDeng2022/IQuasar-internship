      This is a prospective, within-subject randomized, single blinded study designed to follow up&#xD;
      to forty-two (42) qualified and consenting adult females, 18-65 years of age scheduled for&#xD;
      elective breast reduction surgery using a standard inverted Wise (inverted &quot;T&quot;) incision&#xD;
      pattern. Subjects will be randomized to the method of closure and wound support of the&#xD;
      symmetrical vertical breast incisions. On the intervention side subjects will have FMTBs&#xD;
      applied for final layer closure of the vertical breast incision and will continue with repeat&#xD;
      application every two weeks for ongoing wound support for a total of 8 weeks of therapy. On&#xD;
      the control side standard suture closure and wound dressings will be utilized. Patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated at two-week intervals up until 8 weeks post-operative, then will have 3&#xD;
      additional follow up visits at 3-months, 6-months and 12-months post-operatively. The effects&#xD;
      of the therapy will be analyzed during the follow up visits through photography, skin&#xD;
      assessments and POSAS (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) results. A subgroup of 10&#xD;
      patients will also undergo biopsies of the area of interest at five time points throughout&#xD;
      the study. Primary study outcomes include POSAS results and photographic assessment while&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include scar volume/surface area, gene regulation and genetic analysis&#xD;
      obtained via biopsies, collagen volume, skin assessments, colorimetry and time of length of&#xD;
      adherence of the device.&#xD;
