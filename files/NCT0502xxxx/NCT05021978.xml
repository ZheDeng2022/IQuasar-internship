  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 40 and&#xD;
      120 mg oral PRAX-944 compared to placebo in the treatment of adults with essential tremor.&#xD;
      Part A is designed to study the dose titration from 20 to 40 mg every morning (QAM) (ie, 2&#xD;
      weeks with 7 days at each dose level). Part B is designed to study the dose titration from 20&#xD;
      to up to 120 mg QAM with at least 14 days of dosing at the highest tolerated dose for each&#xD;
      participant. Blood levels of PRAX-944 will also be measured throughout the trial and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>The TETRAS is a performance and activities of daily living (ADL) rating scale. The full scale has 2 sections, the Performance subscale (PS) and the ADL subscale. The PS consists of 9 items covering different body regions. The TETRAS upper limb score is item 4 of the TETRAS PS. This item is rated on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4). This item consists of ratings for 3 tasks rated separately for upper limbs on both sides of the body for a total of 6 ratings. The total score of the item ranges from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating greater tremor severity.</description>

    <description>The TETRAS is an essential tremor and ADL rating scale. The full scale has 2 sections, the Performance subscale and the ADL subscale. The ADL subscale consists of 12 items measuring the impact of essential tremor on typical daily activities. These 12 items are rated on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4).

    <time_frame>7 days, 21 days, 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>The QUEST is a brief, 30-item, patient-reported ET-specific quality of life scale. The scale contains 5 subscales that cover physical, psychosocial, communication, hobbies/leisure, and work/finance dimensions. The individual items are rated either on a 5-level Likert scale from 0 to 4 (never, rarely, sometimes, frequently, always) or a 2-level scale from 0 (no) to 4 (yes) relative to the respondent's current situation. Five items could also be rated as not applicable. Respondents are also asked to indicate which tremor was perceived to impact a function or be associated with the feeling or attitude in question. The QUEST total and subscale scores are calculated as the sum of all applicable items divided by the number of applicable items times 100. Higher scores indicate greater impact of tremor on quality of life.</description>
