  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the delivery of ambulatory care in the US. One of the&#xD;
      most notable changes to ambulatory care practice has been the rapid expansion of telemedicine&#xD;
      services. Such expansion sought to preserve access to necessary care for patients while&#xD;
      protecting them and their clinicians from undue risk of exposure to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multiphase, Veteran-centered approach to developing and evaluating a novel behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to provide full cost transparency to Veterans will achieve the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Create an automated system to generate personalized estimates of Veterans' full costs&#xD;
      (travel costs, time costs, and out-of-pocket costs) for different types of primary care&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Develop and refine a novel behavioral intervention that will help Veterans and their&#xD;
      clinicians use personalized information about the full costs of different types of primary&#xD;
      care visits in the VHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of the&#xD;
      developed intervention to Veterans and their clinicians.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Within VA Primary Care, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an abrupt shift from mostly&#xD;
      face-to-face visits to almost exclusively telephone and VA Video Connect (VVC) appointments.&#xD;
      As the COVID-19 curve has flattened and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies have&#xD;
      stabilized, VA Medical Centers such as the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System are now grappling&#xD;
      with how to match these opportunities for different vehicles for delivering ambulatory care&#xD;
      to patients' needs and preferences. One highly promising, Veteran-centered way to match&#xD;
      opportunities for face-to-face, telephone, and VVC visits in the COVID-19 era is to consider&#xD;
      the value each visit type yields for an individual Veteran. Value for a given health care&#xD;
      service is broadly defined as its health outcomes (i.e., benefits) per dollars spent (i.e.,&#xD;
      costs). From the perspective of patients, costs entail not just out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses&#xD;
      but also travel and time costs. These costs are even more salient for many Veterans in the&#xD;
      current economic downturn which, unfortunately, is unlikely to abate until the US fully&#xD;
      emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Careful consideration of these full costs -- which can&#xD;
      vary widely across face-to-face, telephone, and VVC visits -- by both Veterans and their&#xD;
      clinicians could result in higher-value ambulatory care visits. For example, when services&#xD;
      could be provided by telephone rather than a face-to-face visit, the former would result in&#xD;
      much higher value for Veterans because there are no copays or travel costs for telephone&#xD;
      visits. Similarly, when a face-to-face visit is necessary, transparent cost information could&#xD;
      encourage Veterans and their clinicians to maximize the necessary services delivered,&#xD;
      amplifying the benefits realized for the relatively higher patient cost of that particular&#xD;
      type of visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the clear benefits of making patient costs more transparent, and of broader policy&#xD;
      initiatives within VA to better inform Veterans' health care choices, Veterans and their&#xD;
      clinicians currently lack the personalized cost information that they need to make high-value&#xD;
      choices about ambulatory visit modalities. This project will make transparent the full costs&#xD;
      to Veterans of different types of ambulatory visits in order to optimize the value of their&#xD;
      health care investments in the COVID-19 era and beyond.&#xD;
