  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine has been discovered since 1929 and used in the acute treatment of arrhythmias. It&#xD;
      uses as a therapeutic diagnosis in patients with regular narrow QRS complex tachyarrhythmias.&#xD;
      The conventional method of adenosine administration is the double syringe technique (DST).&#xD;
      However, it consumes a lot of resources including two syringes, a stopcock, an extension&#xD;
      tube, and needs 2 nurses to administer. An observational study found that a single syringe&#xD;
      technique (adenosine diluted with normal saline up to 20 ml) was as effective as a double&#xD;
      syringe technique. However, there is no randomized control trial for proving its efficacy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common tachyarrhythmias in young adults,&#xD;
      children, and infants. The most common type in adults is the atrioventricular nodal reentrant&#xD;
      tachycardia (AVNRT) and the incidence is 35 per 10,000 person-years or 2.29 per 1000 persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment approach of SVT is based on hemodynamical stability. The synchronized&#xD;
      cardioversion is recommended for hemodynamically unstable patients, on the other hand, the&#xD;
      vagal maneuvers and medications are considered for patients with stable hemodynamic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the 2019 ESC guideline for the management of supraventricular tachycardia stated&#xD;
      that adenosine is still the first medication for acute therapy in patients with SVT if the&#xD;
      vagal maneuver fails or is contraindicated. A systematic review in 2021 showed that adenosine&#xD;
      is equally efficacious for treating SVT, but it is safer than intravenous calcium channel&#xD;
      blockers due to a shorter half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies reported that the effectiveness of conventional vagal maneuvers, namely, carotid&#xD;
      sinus massage in SVT termination was around 19 to 54% when properly done. The enhanced method&#xD;
      of vagal maneuver or named the modified syringe technique was performed by blowing into a 10&#xD;
      mL syringe to move the plunger, the success conversion rate of SVT was a little better than&#xD;
      the convention technique (43% vs 17%). Therefore, adenosine is still crucial in the acute&#xD;
      therapy of SVT in an emergency setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenosine has been discovered since 1929 and used in the acute treatment of arrhythmias. It&#xD;
      was used as a therapeutic diagnosis in patients with regular narrow QRS complex&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias and it is also helpful in treating some type of regular wide QRS complex&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias (differentiate between SVT with aberrancy/bundle branch block and&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside, is the first drug of choice to terminate SVT. The&#xD;
      pharmacological response of adenosine is mediated through cardiac adenosine type 1 (A1)&#xD;
      receptors and has a dose-response relationship. It prolongs atrioventricular (AV) conduction&#xD;
      and results in transient AV block that is responsible for tachyarrhythmia termination. The&#xD;
      dosages for the peripheral intravascular (IV) route are 6 mg and follow by 12 mg if the first&#xD;
      dose is failed.2 To achieve rhythm conversion, the injection should be performed as a rapid&#xD;
      bolus with immediate saline flush through large veins (e.g. antecubital) in 1-2 seconds,&#xD;
      because adenosine is rapidly metabolized by enzymatic deamination to inactive inosine within&#xD;
      seconds, and achieve end-organ effects within 20-30 seconds.2 This conventional method of&#xD;
      adenosine administration is well-known as the double syringe technique (DST). The repeat dose&#xD;
      is safe when administered at least 1 minute after the first dose. The success rate of&#xD;
      adenosine in terminating SVT was greater than 90% approximately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential side effects of adenosine are transient AV block, flushing, chest pain, or&#xD;
      dyspnea, AF can be initiated or worsened in case of preexcitation existing, premature&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardias (PVCs)/ventricular tachycardia (VT), bronchospasm (rare), or&#xD;
      coronary steal.5 In addition, Adenosine should be excluded or used with caution in patients&#xD;
      with these conditions (e.g. AV block greater than first degree or sinoatrial (SA) node&#xD;
      dysfunction, reactive airway disease, concomitant use of verapamil or digoxin, and&#xD;
      Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome).5&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DST requires a two-way stopcock which may not stock in some workplaces e.g. emergency&#xD;
      medical services (EMS) and need the nursing staff to coordinate their actions administering&#xD;
      the drug and flush simultaneously. In the real world, small hospitals had a transient&#xD;
      shortage of medical equipment supply e.g. syringes. The convenient method which combined&#xD;
      adenosine and 15 mL of normal saline in one syringe was firstly proposed in the non-blind,&#xD;
      randomized prospective study between 1999 to 2001 and published the full original article in&#xD;
      the Korean language since 2003 by Choi SC et al. This trial demonstrated the success rate of&#xD;
      the convenient method was higher than the standard method (85.7 vs 80%), but it's not&#xD;
      statistically significant, in addition, the average of total administering doses, and the&#xD;
      complication of the convenient and standard method was not statistically different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly two decades later, Marc McDowell et al. conducted a single-center, prospective,&#xD;
      observational study with setting a 20% non-inferiority margin demonstrated that the&#xD;
      successful conversion of SVT in the first dose (73.1 vs 40.7%) and up to three doses (100 vs&#xD;
      70.4%) in the single syringe technique (SST) and DST respectively. And they didn't found any&#xD;
      serious adverse effects e.g. dyspnea, bradycardia, or asystole. Unfortunately, superiority&#xD;
      testing was not performed due to the limiting sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we hypothesized that the SST is non-inferior to the DST for terminating stable&#xD;
      SVT, by comparison, a rate of successful conversion of SVT at the first 6 mg-dose of&#xD;
      adenosine and the total average dosage of adenosine administered. And we also aimed to&#xD;
      compare the rate of side effects between both techniques of intravenous adenosine in those&#xD;
      diagnosed with stable SVT.&#xD;
