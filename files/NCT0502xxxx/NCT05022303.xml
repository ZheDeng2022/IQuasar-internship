    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AT1001 versus placebo&#xD;
      in pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who experience early signs of MIS-C and are&#xD;
      at high risk of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AT1001 10 μg/kg/dose up to 500 μg/dose (rounded to the nearest 50 μg) or matching placebo&#xD;
      will be administered orally four times a day (QID) to the standard of care for MIS-C.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a (Proof of Concept), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of AT1001 for use in hospitalized pediatric patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with MIS-C. Eligible participants (N=20) will be treated with AT1001 or matching&#xD;
      placebo orally four times a day (QID) for up to 21 days as an add-on to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening/Baseline: The main purpose of this phase is to determine if the participant&#xD;
           meets entry criterion after obtaining informed consent and obtain baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Eligible participants will be treated with AT1001 or matching placebo 10&#xD;
           μg/kg/dose QID up to 500 μg/dose (rounded to the nearest 50 μg) for 21 days as an add-on&#xD;
           to standard of care for MIS-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up through 24 weeks: The participant will return for a follow-up visits during&#xD;
           weekly clinic visits during Week 1 through Week 3, with monthly telemedicine visits at&#xD;
           Week 4, Week 8, Week 16 and Week 20, and clinic visits at Week 12 and Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring, including physical examination, vitals, and clinical laboratory testing&#xD;
      will be performed during the screening phase, periodically during treatment phase and at the&#xD;
      follow-up phase. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded during the&#xD;
      entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the participants' participation in the study is approximately 24 weeks&#xD;
      (with 21 days treatment period). Total duration of the study is projected to be 12 months,&#xD;
      dependent on enrollment timeline.&#xD;
