    <textblock>
      This clinical trial assesses the feasibility and acceptability of a smarter screening&#xD;
      intervention for breast and colorectal cancer in older adults. This study aims to learn more&#xD;
      about how to support patients and physicians in making cancer screening decisions for older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Complete development of and refine &quot;Smarter Screening&quot;, a multi-component,&#xD;
      patient-centered intervention centered around ePrognosis: Cancer Screening to facilitate&#xD;
      shared decision-making screening discussions for breast and colorectal cancer in older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess feasibility and acceptability of the &quot;Smarter Screening&quot; intervention and assess&#xD;
      its impact versus usual care on shared decision-making about whether or not to continue&#xD;
      breast and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among multi-ethnic and socioeconomically diverse&#xD;
      primary care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Impact on breast and CRC screening versus usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Risk perception, worry, and a patient-reported measure of decision quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants receive Passport to Health booklet and complete ePrognosis before&#xD;
      scheduled primary care visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants receive usual care before scheduled primary care visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 week post primary care visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Responses to Qualitative Acceptability survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A survey will be provided to PCPs and used to measure acceptability of the ePrognosis report by asking patients and providers to provide feedback about the intervention, including likes and dislikes, and future recommendation of using the report provided.</description>
