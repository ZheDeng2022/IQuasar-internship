  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major spinal surgery causes greater pain in the postoperative 24 hours. Patients with severe&#xD;
      pain may have prolonged hospital stays and delay in mobilization. In addition, chronic pain&#xD;
      may be seen in these patients due to ineffectively managed acute postoperative pain.&#xD;
      Therefore, optimizing acute postoperative analgesia is a priority in patients undergoing&#xD;
      major spinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, ultrasound-guided interfascial plane blocks such as thoracolumbar interfascial&#xD;
      plane block (TLIPB)and the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) have been described in spinal&#xD;
      surgery. Both blocks clinically seem to be safe and easily performed. The aims of this study&#xD;
      are to compare the quality of recovery scores, overall morbidity and postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      after major spinal surgery in patients receiving either TLIPB or ESPB.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracolumbar interfascial plane block (TLIPB)and erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and have&#xD;
      been shown to provide effective analgesia after spinal surgery. ESPB targets ventral and&#xD;
      dorsal rami of the spinal nerve and also spreads over the paravertebral and epidural space.&#xD;
      However, TLIPB targets only dorsal rami of the spinal nerve and spare ventral rami which may&#xD;
      provide early ambulation. In addition, depositing local anesthetic in the fascial planes may&#xD;
      prevent intraoperative washout. It may translate to an increase in the quality of analgesia.&#xD;
      On the other hand, pain is an incomplete measure of postoperative recovery. No study to date&#xD;
      has compared these two blocks in terms of the quality of recovery after major spinal surgery.&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that patients receiving TLIPB have higher QoR-40 scores&#xD;
      in comparison with patients receiving ESPB.&#xD;

Each item is rated on a scale of 1-5, providing a minimum score of 40 and maximum of 200.Global QoR-40 scores range from 40 to 200 representing, respectively, very poor to outstanding quality of recovery. QoR-40 score will be recorded on the morning of operation and at the postoperative 24th hour.</description>

intravenous fentanyl 50 µg for NRS of 6 or greater. On discharge to the ward, subjects will be provided immediate-release oral oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours as needed for NRS of 4-6; and 10 mg every 4 hours as needed for NRS of 7-10.&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative complications will be identified by visiting patients every day or alternate day during their in-hospital course, supplemented by patients' medical records review by assessors masked to group allocation, using our hospital's electronic patient record database. We will use the Claviene Dindo Classification system from which CCI is derived. We defined a postoperative complication as any deviation from the ideal postoperative course, not inherent in the procedure itself and does not constitute a failure to cure. CCI scores will be calculated using the online CCI calculator.</description>
