  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the interaction of the cognitive and visual-cognitive&#xD;
      task with postural stability in patients suffering by cerebellar ataxia. Investigators will&#xD;
      measure changes in postural stability parameters and in secondary task performance, which&#xD;
      should show the ability of the patients to manage the dualtask situations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research will be to describe the interaction between cognitive and cognitive&#xD;
      sensory tasks and stability in patients whose disease impairs the ability to maintain a&#xD;
      stable upright position, for example in patients with cerebellar syndromes. And further&#xD;
      compare this interaction with a control group of healthy probands. This interaction will be&#xD;
      investigated in variously demanding postural situations (eg. standing on both lower limbs,&#xD;
      with the exclusion of visual control, with reduced proprioceptive input from the patch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient stability will be quantified using a stabilometric examination on the Kistler&#xD;
      platform (Kistler Instrumente AG, Switzerland). investigators will quantify the performance&#xD;
      of patients in secondary tasks using parameters such as response time to response and success&#xD;
      in assigned tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected number of probands is 20 individuals in both groups. Study will objectify&#xD;
      postural stability by means of a static stabilometric examination on the Kistler platform,&#xD;
      the recording length of each postural situation will be 30 s. Four different demands of&#xD;
      postural tasks were chosen - a bipedal stand, a bipedal stand with the exclusion of visual&#xD;
      control, a stand on a foam pad and a stand on a foam pad with the exclusion of visual&#xD;
      control. To evaluate postural deviations, investigators chose the following CoP parameters:&#xD;
      stabilogram curve length and stabilogram area. During the stabilometric measurement, the&#xD;
      number of touches of the guardrail will also be recorded, or the number of falls or touches&#xD;
      with a lightened limb of the pad or the other limb during the measurement. Testing will take&#xD;
      place in the Neurological Laboratory of the Department of Neurology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      Charles University in Prague and FN Motol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gradually, two types of secondary task will be added to the postural tasks, with visual input&#xD;
      (modified Stroop test) and a purely cognitive task (Backward counting test). At first,&#xD;
      probands will be acquainted with what types of tasks await them during the experiment and&#xD;
      will be able to train each of them in two trial experiments. This will be followed by testing&#xD;
      trials in random order (cognitive tests in single-task situations, namely sitting in a chair,&#xD;
      single task postural tasks and dual-task situations).&#xD;
