  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a real-time home&#xD;
      CPR(cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training program. The study participants will be allocated&#xD;
      to two different CPR training programs. The intervention group will participate in the&#xD;
      real-time home CPR training program while the control group will participate in the&#xD;
      conventional CPR training program. The investigators will compare the quality of chest&#xD;
      compression between the two study groups. The investigators hypothesize that the new&#xD;
      real-time home CPR training program is non-inferior to the preexisting conventional CPR&#xD;
      training program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bystander CPR(cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is important for the survival of out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest patients. CPR training for the general public is important to improve the rate&#xD;
      and quality of bystander CPR. Conventional CPR education was conducted under face-to-face&#xD;
      contact with instructors and multiple trainees gathered at a training center, but after the&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, face-to-face training became difficult. To overcome this&#xD;
      limitation the investigators have developed a new real-time home CPR training program. The&#xD;
      training program delivers Little Anne QCPR mannequins (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) to each&#xD;
      participants homes and the participants use an application specifically developed for CPR&#xD;
      training that automatically connects wirelessly to the Little Anne QCPR mannequin through&#xD;
      Bluetooth so that the instructor can give real-time feedback on chest compression quality to&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a real-time home&#xD;
      CPR(cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training program. The study participants will be allocated&#xD;
      to two different CPR training programs. The intervention group will participate in the&#xD;
      real-time home CPR training program while the control group will participate in the&#xD;
      conventional CPR training program. The investigators will compare the quality of chest&#xD;
      compression between the two study groups. Chest compression quality at the start of both&#xD;
      training programs and after completion of the programs will be measured by Little Anne QCPR&#xD;
      mannequins used in the training programs. The investigators hypothesize that the new&#xD;
      real-time home CPR training program is non-inferior to the preexisting conventional CPR&#xD;
      training program.&#xD;

    <description>The participants in the intervention group will have Little Anne QCPR mannequins (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) delivered to their homes. The participants will use an online platform specifically developed for CPR training (HEROS Remote app). The training program will provide video-based self-instruction training followed by hands-on chest compression training with the instructor. The hands-on chest compression training session provides real-time chest compression quality measurement followed by real-time feedback from the instructor. Chest compression quality will be measured by Little Anne QCPR mannequins.</description>

    <description>Participants in the conventional CPR training program group will be provided CPR education with the &quot;Home Education and Resuscitation Outcome Study (HEROS)&quot; program that is currently provided in Seoul, Korea. The HEROS program is a 1-hour training course, consisting of a 30-minute video-based self-instruction training with a mannequin. The program also includes a bystander CPR simulation with a simulated dispatcher using the participants own cell phone. Little Anne QCPR mannequins will be provided to measure and give feedback on the participants chest compression performance.</description>
