  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is one of the most used techniques for surgery. Anesthesiologists usually&#xD;
      check the block height (dermatome) of spinal anesthesia before surgery start. More than 20&#xD;
      factors have been postulated to alter spinal anesthetic block height. We would like to use&#xD;
      machine learning to comprehensively consider various factors such as physiological parameters&#xD;
      and different drug characteristics to establish a predictive model to evaluate the sensory&#xD;
      blockade of spinal anesthesia.&#xD;

      This is an observational study of the retrospective collection of patient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators retrospectively collected the electronic medical record of patients&#xD;
      receiving spinal anesthesia from July 1, 2018, to Dec 31, 2018. Anesthesia-related factors&#xD;
      such as anesthesiologist's expertise, injection site, patient position, the dosage of local&#xD;
      anesthetics, needle size, the direction of needle bevel, and basic demographic information of&#xD;
      the patients were used for data analysis. Patients less than 18 years old were excluded from&#xD;
      this study. Twenty percent of the dataset was used as a testing dataset, and the remaining&#xD;
      were used for model training. The investigators will utilize four machine learning algorithms&#xD;
      as XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), Random Forest (RF), and&#xD;
      support vector machine (SVM). Model performances were evaluated visually with a confusion&#xD;
      matrix.&#xD;
