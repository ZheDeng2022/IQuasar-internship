  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational clinical trial. Patients who were diagnosed and&#xD;
      treated for the first time were enrolled and their surgical pathology was confirmed to be&#xD;
      high-grade serous ovarian cancer. At the same time, these patients will receive first-line&#xD;
      maintenance treatment with PARP inhibitors after traditional chemotherapy. During the trial&#xD;
      period, patients' plasma will be collected before surgery, after chemotherapy, during&#xD;
      targeted maintenance therapy, and during disease progression, and ctDNA-specific genomes will&#xD;
      be detected, and clinical data will be collected over the same period. It is expected that&#xD;
      specific ctDNA can be used to predict the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in patients with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, and to detect the recurrence of the disease early.&#xD;
