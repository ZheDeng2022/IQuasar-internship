  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor vital signs with contact and non-contact monitors in&#xD;
      patients during anesthesia, and analyze the signal differences between the two monitors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard vital signs routinely monitored in patients during anesthesia include heart&#xD;
      rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, body temperature, respiratory rate, and peripheral&#xD;
      blood oxygen saturation, and etc. Continuous measurement and interpretation of these vital&#xD;
      signs can provide important information about the underlying physiological state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional techniques for tracking vital signs require physical contact, and most&#xD;
      techniques are invasive. Body contact with sensors (for example, electrocardiograph&#xD;
      electrodes) can irritate or damage the patient's skin, interfere with the patient's treatment&#xD;
      or comfort, provide a vector for infection and cross-contamination, and only hinder mobility.&#xD;
      In addition, when placing the sensor/wire on the body, the patient may feel uncomfortable&#xD;
      (for example, anxiety, tension, and excitement). This negative experience may change the&#xD;
      patient's breathing and heart rate and produce misleading results for medical service&#xD;
      providers. Therefore, people need effective sensing methods that can wirelessly&#xD;
      (non-contact/remote) monitor vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1970s, researchers have been looking for ways to conduct non-contact monitoring of&#xD;
      vital signs. The following important medical situations have promoted continuous research in&#xD;
      this field: (1) The patient's skin is fragile or vulnerable, such as low birth weight. ,&#xD;
      Premature infants, burn patients; (2) monitor wiring can endanger or interfere with patients,&#xD;
      such as: Infant Death Syndrome and sleep apnea; (3) cross-contamination between patients&#xD;
      (such as reusable wires) . The non-contact life monitoring technology does not involve&#xD;
      electrodes or adhesives, does not touch the skin, does not have the risk of wires,&#xD;
      entanglements or patient discomfort, does not consume any consumables, and there is no chance&#xD;
      of cross-infection caused by inadequately disinfected equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, advances in sensing technology have enabled smart systems to monitor vital signs, such&#xD;
      as respiration and heart rate, in a non-contact manner. The two most advanced non-contact&#xD;
      vital signs monitoring methods are the use of radio frequency (radar) and imaging (camera).&#xD;
      In the past 15 years, the development of camera technology has increased its applicability&#xD;
      and affordability, making people more and more interested in using these technologies in&#xD;
      medical institutions. Monitoring methods using images can measure multiple vital signs at the&#xD;
      same time and are relevant. The research has been applied to many ethnic groups, including&#xD;
      sleeping healthy people, intensive care unit patients, kidney dialysis patients, and&#xD;
      fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;
