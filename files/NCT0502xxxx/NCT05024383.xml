  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) produces a higher prevalence and more severe pain than all&#xD;
      other cancers. Orofacial pain is one of the most common initial symptoms of oral cancer and&#xD;
      often leads to the diagnosis of oral cancer. However, the character, severity, and unique&#xD;
      features of oral cancer widely differ between patients. There is currently no effective and&#xD;
      lasting treatment available to alleviate suffering from oral cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant obstacle to effectively treating cancer pain is that the relative contributions&#xD;
      of nociceptive mediators and their mechanisms of action (i.e., responsible receptors) are&#xD;
      largely unknown. There is, therefore, a critical need to define the neurobiologic mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for oral cancer pain. Without such information, the promise of non-opioid therapy&#xD;
      for the treatment of oral cancer pain will remain unfulfilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to define and quantify the phenotype of oral cancer&#xD;
      pain in patients, by comparing mechano- and chemosensitivity in oral cancer patients with&#xD;
      healthy subjects. Pain will be stimulated on the site of cancer in 40 oral cancer patients&#xD;
      and on the tongue in 40 healthy volunteers utilizing chemical sensitivity and mechanical&#xD;
      sensitivity tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The majority of&#xD;
      patients with oral SCC suffer from severe, chronic, function-induced pain. Despite the&#xD;
      severity of pain in many patients, the presentation of oral cancer pain is variable. Opioids&#xD;
      are the only treatment available for oral cancer pain. Opioids are often ineffective and&#xD;
      associated with tolerance, constipation, somnolence, respiratory depression, and addiction,&#xD;
      which is now a national crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current hypothesis for the etiology of oral cancer pain, which is based on clinical&#xD;
      studies utilizing questionnaires and preclinical studies, is that cancer cells and cells&#xD;
      within the microenvironment produce mediators that activate and sensitize nociceptors.&#xD;
      Published and preliminary data indicate that cancer-secreted mediators induce mechano- and&#xD;
      chemosensitivity. For example, preliminary clinical studies demonstrate that oral cancer&#xD;
      patients experience preoperative sensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chemosensitivity) and report&#xD;
      greater functional (i.e., mechanosensitivity) pain. Capsaicin activates transient receptor&#xD;
      potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1 is activated by temperatures above 43°C and endogenous&#xD;
      lipid metabolic products. Mice deficient in TRPV1 respond to mechanical stimuli, suggesting&#xD;
      that TRPV1 is not involved in the detection of mechanical stimulation. By contrast, TRP&#xD;
      ankyrin repeat 1 (TRPA1), co-localized with TRPV1, is responsive to mechanical stimuli, in&#xD;
      addition to irritants such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). Both TRPV1 and TRPA1 have been&#xD;
      reported to play important roles in orofacial pain. Improved knowledge of the contribution of&#xD;
      TRPV1 and TRPA1 to oral cancer pain holds considerable promise for the development of novel,&#xD;
      non-opioid treatment strategies that specifically address the unique pain experience of&#xD;
      individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of published data characterizing the sensory phenotype of tumor-related&#xD;
      cancer pain, which has significant implications for understanding the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of cancer pain. Quantitative sensory testing can provide&#xD;
      insight into the mechanism(s) responsible for pain. In this proposal, we will test our&#xD;
      hypothesis that the quality of pain experienced by oral cancer patients is dependent on the&#xD;
      level of activation of specific channels on nociceptors. We will perform mechanical (von Frey&#xD;
      testing) and chemical sensitivity tests (sensitivity to capsaicin, TRPV1 agonist, and AITC&#xD;
      (TRPA1 agonist) on oral cancer patients, and compare the sensitivities to healthy subjects.&#xD;
      For cancer patients, we will administer the validated University of California San Francisco&#xD;
      (UCSF) Oral Cancer Pain Questionnaire to evaluate the correlation between mechanical and&#xD;
      chemical thresholds with relevant aspects of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that the quality of pain experienced by oral cancer patients is quantifiable and&#xD;
      dependent on the level of sensitization and activation of specific channels on nociceptors.&#xD;
