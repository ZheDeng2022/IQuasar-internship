    <textblock>
      Patients with treatment resistant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are recruited from secondary&#xD;
      care gastroenterology clinics in Stockholm. Eligible participants are screened for&#xD;
      eligibility criteria at a baseline visit at the Karolinska Institutet. Patients providing&#xD;
      written informed consent for participation are invited to Nordic Clinic, a clinic offering&#xD;
      personalized lifestyle interventions based on the functional medicine model. Before the first&#xD;
      visit to the clinic, the participant fill out a longer questionnaire that is used for the&#xD;
      planning of the participant's personal treatment program. At the first visit, the therapist&#xD;
      goes through the responses together with the participant. Based on the participant's symptom&#xD;
      profile, it is determined which tests are taken in the first step. Based on symptoms and test&#xD;
      results, the therapist and participant come up with a treatment plan that can include several&#xD;
      of the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary supplements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measures to improve sleep / circadian rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicines, in exceptional cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment plan is evaluated continuously by the participant and the therapist and&#xD;
      adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment involves a total of 9 visits to the Nordic Clinic during one year. The&#xD;
      subsequent visits are planned by the therapist at the Nordic Clinic together with the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with the treatment program, the participant makes return visits to Karolinska&#xD;
      Institutet to collect follow-up data for the evaluation of the treatment after 6 months, 12&#xD;
      months, 18 months and 24 months after the start of treatment where participants are&#xD;
      clinically assessed and fill out forms for the evaluation of treatment.&#xD;
