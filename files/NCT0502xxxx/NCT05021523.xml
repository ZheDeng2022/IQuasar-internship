      Animal models suggest that heat stress increases protein content and facilitates the recovery&#xD;
      of atrophied muscle after an immobilization period, or following a chemically induced muscle&#xD;
      injury in rats. Thus, a recent study in human have reported that daily heat treatments,&#xD;
      applied during 10 days of immobilization, reduced the loss of muscle mass. In addition of&#xD;
      protecting muscle mass, repeated heat stress may also help to maintain cardiovascular fitness&#xD;
      from the onset of injury through passive exposures in the condition that they sufficiently&#xD;
      trigger an increase in body temperature, circulation and sweating. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the benefits of using heat therapy to prevent deconditioning during&#xD;
      immobilization in human.&#xD;

      1.3 Background information &amp; study rationale Heat is often used as a traditional therapy in&#xD;
      many cultures to treat a variety of health conditions. At the level of the skeletal muscle,&#xD;
      repeated heat exposures have been reported to increase cell proliferation and muscle protein&#xD;
      content in vitro and in animal studies. Rodent studies have further shown that repeated heat&#xD;
      exposure may reduce muscle atrophy during immobilization and facilitate the recovery of&#xD;
      atrophied muscle after immobilization. The effect of heat therapy might also have numerous&#xD;
      benefits in humans. For example, repeated passive heat exposure may improve quality of life&#xD;
      in different populations, improve cardiovascular health, and is associated with a lower risk&#xD;
      of fatal cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Moreover, considering the&#xD;
      association between skeletal muscle mass/function and health, two studies demonstrated that 8&#xD;
      to 10 weeks of repeated localized heat therapy induced skeletal muscle adaptations,&#xD;
      increasing peak torque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the only study conducted in humans reported that daily 2-h of local heat&#xD;
      therapy during 10 days of lower limb immobilization was sufficient to reduce vastus lateralis&#xD;
      atrophy and maintain mitochondrial function. In rats, a single 60-minute exposure to heat an&#xD;
      environmental chamber protects against short-term atrophy of skeletal muscle. In addition,&#xD;
      Daily 30-min exposure to similar environmental thermal stress has also been shown to maintain&#xD;
      mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore conducted a first study in Aspetar showing that passive heat&#xD;
      acclimation (11 days, 1 h per day) improves skeletal muscle contractile function during both&#xD;
      normothermic and in the hyperthermic humans. These improvements were verified in measures&#xD;
      obtained at rest and during contractions at different intensities ( 10, 25, 50, 75% MVC), as&#xD;
      well as in different neuromuscular parameters: an increase in electrically evoked .peak&#xD;
      twitch amplitude, an increase in maximal torque production at a similar level of voluntary&#xD;
      activation, and an improvement of the relative torque/EMG linear relationship. This infers&#xD;
      that passive heat acclimation improves skeletal muscle contractile function in humans,&#xD;
      irrespective of thermal state. As such, this highlights a novel passive method to improve&#xD;
      muscle function via passive heat exposure that may be used with athletes and patients during&#xD;
      a period of musculoskeletal unloading, such as post-surgical immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Study goals and objectives The aim of the study is to investigate the benefits of using&#xD;
      whole-body heat therapy to prevent deconditioning during immobilization in human 1.5 Study&#xD;

           This study will assess the effect of daily heat therapy on skeletal muscle subjected to&#xD;
           immobilization. All participants will first undergo 4 weeks of standardized physical&#xD;
           conditioning, followed by 2 weeks of limb immobilization and 2 weeks of return to sport&#xD;
           (RTS). During immobilization, participants will be assigned, in a counterbalanced&#xD;
           fashion, to either HEAT (11 sessions of whole-body passive heat exposure) or CON (sham&#xD;
           treatment with the participants being told that they are at an altitude of 3000 m while&#xD;
           it remained at 200 m) groups. Throughout return to sport, the HEAT group will perform 5&#xD;
           trainings in the heat whereas the CON group will perform the same training in sham&#xD;
           conditions. the tests will be performed the week before the intervention as well as at&#xD;
           the end of weeks 4, 6 and 8 of interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial training: All participants will be engaged in a structured physical training program&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. Each week includes 2 'aerobic' sessions and 3 strength and conditioning&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immobilization: Prior commencing the immobilization protocol, participants will receive&#xD;
      instructions for the use of the therapeutic boots and medical arm crutches. The left ankle of&#xD;
      each participant will be immobilized at an angle of 90° for 14 consecutive days. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to use crutches and not to engage in any weight-bearing activity with the&#xD;
      immobilized ankle. They will however, be allowed to ambulate freely throughout the&#xD;
      immobilization period. All participants will report to the laboratory six days per week&#xD;
      during the immobilization period, during which they will receive either 60 min of whole-body&#xD;
      passive heat treatment (i.e., HEAT) or sham treatment (i.e., CON). Heat treatment will be&#xD;
      undertaken according to previous methods where participants will assume seated rest in an&#xD;
      environmental chamber set at 50°C and 50% relative humidity. The control group will receive&#xD;
      sham treatment and will undertake seated rest in altitude room set at 200 m of altitude,&#xD;
      24°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Return to sport: Following the immobilization period, participants will be engaged in a&#xD;
      structured rehabilitation program for 2 weeks including 5 sessions per week. Three of the&#xD;
      sessions will have a general conditioning objective while the 2 others will focus on&#xD;
      neuro-muscular training. The HEAT group will perform the three conditioning sessions in an&#xD;
      environmental chamber set at 35ºC and 60 % humidity, whilst the CON group will be at 200 m,&#xD;
      22ºC. The remaining two sessions will be performed in standard laboratory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical tests will be performed before training (week 0), after training (week 4), after&#xD;
      immobilization (week 6) and at return to sports (week 8) (Fig. 1). The biopsy and MRI will be&#xD;
      performed after training (week 4), after immobilization (week 6) and at return to sports&#xD;
      (week 8) only (Fig. 1). A typical week of testing will include the MRI imaging and physical&#xD;
      tests on the Saturday, the questionnaires and proprioception on the Sunday and the biopsy and&#xD;
      blood samples on the Monday (i.e., 48h after the physical tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The isometric neuromuscular tests will be conducted on Dynamometric pedal (Captels, St.&#xD;
      Mathieu de Treviers, France). The fatigue test will be performed on a isokinetic dynamometer&#xD;
      (Biodex System 3, NY, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrically evoked twitch: The tibial nerve will be electrically stimulated (voltage400 V,&#xD;
      rectangular pulse of 0.2 ms) via a high-voltage stimulator (Digitimer DS7AH; Digitimer,&#xD;
      Hertfordshire, UK). through a cathode placed in the popliteal cavity (diameter 9 mm) and an&#xD;
      anode placed distally to the patella (5 x 10 cm). The intensity for each participant will be&#xD;
      increased progressively (10-mA increment) until a plateau in twitch mechanical response&#xD;
      (i.e., peak twitch, PT). The final intensity will be set at 150% of the final plateau, the&#xD;
      participant will be stimulated 5 times with 5 s rest between each peak twitch. The twitch&#xD;
      evoked will be used to calculate the peak twitch amplitude (Pt), contraction time (CT) and&#xD;
      half relaxation time (HRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H-Reflex: EMG activity of the soleus and gastrocnemius medialis will be recorded using&#xD;
      bipolar surface electrodes. The intensity will be adjusted to obtain maximal soleus H-reflex&#xD;
      amplitude. 6 soleus H-reflex responses will be recorded with an interval of 20 sec to avoid&#xD;
      post-activation depression. The H-reflex will be normalized by the M-wave recorded during the&#xD;
      peak twitch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of torque development: Participants will receive the instructions to produce 5 maximal&#xD;
      contractions as fast as possible. The contractions will be short (~1 s) and interspersed by&#xD;
      short rest periods (e.g., 20 s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal Voluntary contraction: Participants will be required to perform an isometric maximal&#xD;
      voluntary contraction (MVC) of the plantar flexors. Participants will be instructed to push&#xD;
      as hard as possible against the dynamometric pedal by contracting his plantar flexor muscles.&#xD;
      Visual feedback will be given to the participant during the effort, and standardized verbal&#xD;
      encouragement. The MVC is reached when a plateau is observed. Double stimulation will be&#xD;
      delivered during the plateau of MVC (superimposed twitch), and another double stimulation&#xD;
      when the muscle is fully relaxed Immediately after the contraction (potentiated twitch). The&#xD;
      ratio between the superimposed and the potentiated twitch will be used to calculate voluntary&#xD;
      activation as VA (%) = (1-superimposed twitch/potentiated twitch) x 100. The subject will&#xD;
      perform a second MVC of the plantar flexor with at least 1 min rest between each trial, If&#xD;
      the peak torque from the second trial is not within 5% of the first, additional trials must&#xD;
      be performed. The greatest torque achieved by the subject is taken as the MVC torque.&#xD;
      Thereafter, participant will perform a submaximal contraction at 25, 75 and 50 % of the&#xD;
      previous MVC to estimate the torque/electromyographic (EMG) relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue test: Fatigue protocols will be performed on an isokinetic dynamometer with the&#xD;
      participants seated with the hip joint at about 80° and knee at 100°. The foot will be placed&#xD;
      on the foot adapter with an ankle angle in 10° of plantar flexion and fixed with straps. In&#xD;
      order to induce fatigue in the ankle, the participant will perform 30 contractions in&#xD;
      concentric mode at 60° s-1 for the plantar flexion and at 90° s-1 for the dorsiflexion (the&#xD;
      range of motion is between -25°and 45°). A fatigue resistance index (FRI) will be calculated&#xD;
      hinge on the changes in torque over the 30 contractions using the following formula: FRI =&#xD;
      (100 x (total PT/Ideal PT)) - 100, where total PT: the sum of PT over 30 contractions, Ideal&#xD;
      PT: best PT x 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprioception testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic balance testing: The Y Balance Test (YBT) will be performed with the participants&#xD;
      standing barefoot on the balance test kit™ (a stance platform with three pieces of plastic&#xD;
      pipe in the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral reach directions). Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to reach as far as possible in each direction. Participant will first perform 3&#xD;
      unrecorded practice followed by 3 recorded trial. The outcome measure will be the average of&#xD;
      the best 2 properly executed tests for each direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement discrimination testing: Gibsonian 'obtained' proprioceptive acuity would be assessed&#xD;
      at the ankle using a custom-made Active Movement Extend Discrimination Apparatus (AMEDA). The&#xD;
      participants will stand with the left leg on a fix support and the right leg on a mobile&#xD;
      support. The mobile support will allow the participants to reach 5 different plantar flexion&#xD;
      angles. The participants will undergo a total of 50 trials (10 at each angle) and will have&#xD;
      to actively recognize the angle allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the questionnaires are hard copy distribution (attached). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
      Index (PSQI) will be used to assess subjective sleep quality over the next month. The PSQI&#xD;
      consists of 19 questions measuring seven components: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep&#xD;
      duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, the use of sleeping medications, and daytime&#xD;
      dysfunction. The total score for the PSQI ranges from 0 to 21, where ''0'' indicates no&#xD;
      difficulty and ''21'' indicates severe difficulties in all areas. A PSQI score 5 is&#xD;
      considered to indicate poor sleep quality, although a more conservative threshold of 8 may&#xD;
      also be used. Based on the above, subjects will be classified as good sleepers (PSQI&lt;=5) and&#xD;
      bad sleepers (PSQI&gt;5). In addition, self-reported variables from PSQI component scores&#xD;
      provided quantitative data for sleep onset latency (minutes), total sleep time (hours), and&#xD;
      sleep efficiency (%; ratio of total sleep time to time in bed for sleep. The questionnaire&#xD;
      will be distributed before the begging of the tests. The PSQI is a valid and reliable&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine subjective sleep quality. It has a sensitivity of 89.6% and&#xD;
      specificity of 86.5% for identifying cases with sleep disorder, using a cut-off score of 5.&#xD;
      Validity is further supported by similar differences between groups using PSQI or&#xD;
      polysomnographic sleep measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) The instrument is a 26-item&#xD;
      self-report inventory, rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale with varying scale response&#xD;
      anchors. Two items are intended to measure perceptions of general QOL and health, and the&#xD;
      remaining 24 items are designed to measure one of the following four domains of QOL: physical&#xD;
      (seven items), psychological (six items), social (three items), and environment (eight&#xD;
      items). Only the 24 items used to yield domain scores. The score for each domain varies from&#xD;
      zero to 20, zero being considered the worst and 20 the best quality of life.5 For questions&#xD;
      one and two the maximum score is 25 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Profile of Mood States Brief questionnaire (POMS Brief questionnaire) consists of 40&#xD;
      adjectival items (e.g., tense, worthless) which was used to measure 7 aspects of mood&#xD;
      (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, esteem-related affect, confusion). Participants&#xD;
      rated each item on a five-point answer scale. The score of each mood dimension equals the sum&#xD;
      of scores of several particular questions. The total score of abbreviated POMS, called total&#xD;
      mood disturbance, is calculated by subtracting the scores of two positive dimensions from the&#xD;
      five negative dimensions and adding 100. Therefore, the higher the total score is, the more&#xD;
      negative mood one may have Lower extremity functional scale (LEFS): The participants will&#xD;
      fill the LEFS to estimate their lower limb function after immobilization and return to sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incremental exercise testing: Each participant performed an incremental cycling test on an&#xD;
      electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur, Lode, Groningen, The Netherlands),&#xD;
      which will be adjusted to each participant's specifications and with the feet securely&#xD;
      strapped on the pedal. The test will commence by 7 min of warm-up (2min at 50 W + 3 min at&#xD;
      1.5 W/kg + 2 min at 50 W) and will thereafter progressively (i.e. ramp) progress by 25 W per&#xD;
      minute until volitional exhaustion. Maximal oxygen uptake will be determined by the highest&#xD;
      30 s average upon exercise termination (InnocorTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) will be measured using the optimized CO-rebreathing technique.&#xD;
      Briefly, participants will be seated for 20-min to allow plasma volume to stabilize.&#xD;
      Participants will fully exhale to residual volume into a portable CO sensor (Draeger,&#xD;
      Luebeck, Germany) to detect existing levels of CO within the body and baseline fingertip&#xD;
      capillary samples (200 μL) will be obtained. Participants will wear a nose-clip and will be&#xD;
      connected to a closed spirometer via the mouth piece at the end of a maximal expiration.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to inhale deeply and hold their breath for 10-s while an&#xD;
      individualized bolus (1.2g/kg) of 99.5% medical grade carbon monoxide (CO) is administered&#xD;
      via a 150mL syringe. Simultaneously, the valve for a 3L anesthetic bag pre-filled with pure&#xD;
      oxygen will be opened. After 10-s participants will be asked to continue normal respiration&#xD;
      through the spirometer for 1-min 50-s. During this time, a portable CO analyzer (Draeger&#xD;
      Luebeck, Germany) with parts-per-million sensitivity will be held in close proximity to the&#xD;
      mouth piece and spirometer to verify that no gas has escaped. After 2-min of re-breathing,&#xD;
      the participants will be asked to fully exhale to residual volume or until the anesthetic bag&#xD;
      is filled to quantify the amount of CO which was not taken up by the body. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      spirometer will be disconnected and the participants will continue to sit quietly. Two&#xD;
      minutes later, participants will again fully exhale to residual volume into a portable CO&#xD;
      sensor (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) and combined with the remainder of CO within the&#xD;
      spirometer after the test to determine the quantity of CO not taken up by the body. At&#xD;
      exactly 7-min after commencement of re-breathing, further fingertip capillary samples (200&#xD;
      μL) will be obtained. All capillary samples will be immediately analyzed in triplicate for&#xD;
      percent carboxyhemoglobin (%HbCO) and hematocrit (Hct.) using a spectrophotometer (ABL 90,&#xD;
      Radiometer, Denmark). Carbon monoxide leaves the body within 5 hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical loading:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical changes during walking (4 km/h) and running (10 km/h) will be assessed on an&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill (HP Cosmos, Germany) with a capacitance-based pressure platform&#xD;
      (FDM-THQ, Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany). The treadmill surface will be set at 0° grade for&#xD;
      all testing. The capture surface of the Zebris FDM-THQ system is 1.70 × 0.65 m and contains a&#xD;
      sensing area of 1.36 × 0.64 m which consists of 10,240 sensors of 0.85 × 0.85 cm each. The&#xD;
      sensor threshold will be set at 1 N/cm2 and the measuring range is 1-120 N/cm2. Locomotion at&#xD;
      each velocity will be for 60 s, with 60 s rest in-between. Mechanical loading during walking&#xD;
      will be assessed prior to training and immobilization, as well as following immobilization&#xD;
      and return to sport. Assessment during running will be omitted immediately following&#xD;
      immobilization, which otherwise will be undertaken at all other time-points. At each speed,&#xD;
      data will be captured for the last 20 s of each minute. Raw data from the Zebris system will&#xD;
      be exported, and analyzed for changes in plantar pressure distribution, asymmetry and plantar&#xD;
      vertical force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsy: Muscle samples will be extracted from the muscle belly of medial gastrocnemius&#xD;
      using a disposable, spring-loaded microbiopsy system (MAX-CORE, Bard Biopsy Systems). A&#xD;
      14-gauge biopsy needle will be inserted under local anesthesia (1% xylocaine) after skin&#xD;
      incision, and 4 samples, totaling approximately 80 mg will be extracted per biopsy. The&#xD;
      tissue samples will be immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a -80°C freezer&#xD;
      until further analysis. Analyses will include 23 proteins (FGF21, GDF15, Adropin, Irisin,&#xD;
      Humanin, SHLPs, MOTS-c, TFAM, Cardiolipin, ND6, P-FOXO3, P-FOXO1, Total FOXO, P-AMPK, Total&#xD;
      AMPK, P-4EBP1, Total 4E-BP1, P-P70S6K, Total P70S6K, P-RPS6, Total RPS6, NCAM, PAX7) and 19&#xD;
      mRNAs (UPRmt as measured by ATF5, CHOP, ClpP, HSP10, HSP60; mt DNA as measured by COX1, ND1,&#xD;
      ND6, D-loop; Atrogin-1; MuRF-1; HSP 70; PGC-1alpha; Myostatin; Myogenin; MyoD; and 3&#xD;
      housekeeping genes). Participants will be provided with standardized meal for the 2 days&#xD;
      preceding the biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: Approximately 16 ml of blood will be drawn from the antecubital vein using&#xD;
      standard venipuncture technique. Blood will be drawn into 1 serum (red) and 3 EDTA (purple)&#xD;
      vacutainers and will be subsequently centrifuged. The supernatant will be aliquoted to&#xD;
      Eppendorf tubes and subsequently stored at -80°C until further analysis. Analyses will&#xD;
      include 10 proteins (FGF21, GDF15, Adropin, Irisin, Humanin, SHLP2 or 3, MOTS-c, TFAM,&#xD;
      Cardiolipin, ND-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle volume:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: T1-weighted Spin Echo Axial Images will be acquired from the knee to the Achilles tendon&#xD;
      with the following parameters: FOV 300mm, Image Matrix 240x320, Slice thickness 6mm with 0mm&#xD;
      gap, TR/TE = 730/14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound assessment: Muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length of the&#xD;
      Gastrocnemius will be determined from images taken along the longitudinal axis of the muscle&#xD;
      belly, by utilizing a two-dimensional, B-mode ultrasound (frequency 12 MHz; depth 8 cm; field&#xD;
      of view (FOV) 14×47 mm) (Logiq E, GE Healthcare, IL, USA). The scanning site will be halfway&#xD;
      point between the ankle and knee joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Tissue Characterization (UTC): UTC imaging utilizes a 5-12MHz ultrasound (US)&#xD;
      transducer (SmartProbe 12 L5, Terason 2000, Teratech, USA) fixed in a transverse position&#xD;
      into a 12 cm tracking device (UTC Tracker, UTC imaging, Netherlands), allowing the capture&#xD;
      and storage of a sequence of transverse images of the tendon at regular intervals of 0.02 cm.&#xD;
      The UTC tracking device is maintain in contact with the achilis by the experimenter. The US&#xD;
      transducer then moved down the track driven by a motor, from proximal to distal, resulting in&#xD;
      a total of 598 sequential transverse images acquired in 45 s. With these scans the UTC&#xD;
      algorithm creates a 3D block of the scanned area allowing additional reconstructed coronal&#xD;
      and sagittal views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: Muscle mass and body fat percentages will be assessed by an accredited&#xD;
      nutritionist from skinfold thickness (Harpenden, UK). The muscle volume of the leg will be&#xD;
      specifically assessed from the leg length and circumferences (i.e. truncated cone methods)&#xD;
      along skinfold thickness (Siri 1956, Durnin and Rahaman 1967, Durnin and Womersley 1974,&#xD;
      Jones and Pearson 1969).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core, skin and muscle temperature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core temperature will be measured the first and the last day of the intervention period and&#xD;
      the RTS period using a e-Celsius® rectal capsules (BodyCap®, Caen, France) . Skin&#xD;
      temperatures will be determined using iButton temperature sensors/data loggers (iButtonTM,&#xD;
      Maxim Integrated Products, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), secured to the participants' chest, arm,&#xD;
      thigh and calf using non-porous adhesive tape. Mean skin temperature will be determined using&#xD;
      the following formula: Tsk = (0.3 x Tchest) + (0.3 x Tbicep) + (0.2 x Tthigh) + (0.2 x&#xD;
      Tcalf). Muscle temperature will be measured only once (e.g. on the Thursday of week 1) using&#xD;
      an indwelling flexible thermistor (MAC flexible probe, Ellab, Hilleroed, Denmark), and&#xD;
      inserted via a catheter (16 GA) after local anesthesia of the skin (2 mL of Xylocaine without&#xD;
      adrenaline) by a physician.&#xD;
