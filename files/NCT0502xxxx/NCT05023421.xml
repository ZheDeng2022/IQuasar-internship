  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between screen usage time and&#xD;
      problematic social media use in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) with motor function, hand&#xD;
      function, speech and vision function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problematic Media Use Measure, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were administered to&#xD;
      158 parents of children with CP. In order to determine the screen usage time, parents were&#xD;
      asked about the screen usage time of their children on weekdays and weekends, and the average&#xD;
      usage time in a week was calculated. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS),&#xD;
      Manual Abilities Classification System (MACS), Eating and Drinking Ability Classification&#xD;
      System (EDACS), Communication Function Classification System (CFCS),and Visual Function&#xD;
      Classification System (VFCS) were used to determine functional levels.The structural equation&#xD;
      model was used for statistical analysis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Problematic Media Use Measure (PMUM) was developed by Domoff et al. to detect problematic media use in children aged 4-11. Both the long form and the short form of the scale have only one factor structure. Items are scored on a Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). PMUM total score is obtained by taking the average of scores from all items. High scores from the scale indicate problematic use. The scale, which is applied by parents considering behavior of the child, tries to detect not the problematic use of a specific media tool, but generally the problematic use of visual media tools (such as television, computer, tablet, phone), in other words, screen addiction.</description>

    <measure>Strength and Difficulties Questionniare</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Strength and Difficulties Questionniare (SDQ) is used to screen emotional and behavioral problems. The scale, which consists of 25 items in total, has 5 sub-dimensions: attention deficit and hyperactivity, behavioral problems, emotional problems, peer problems and social behaviors. Scale scoring was made as &quot;0 (not correct)&quot;, &quot;1 (partially correct)&quot;, &quot;2 (absolutely correct)&quot; for each statement. Turkish validity and reliability study has been done</description>

    <description>The participants in the current study were parents of children with CP aged 4-18 years. They were recruited at the Hacettepe University Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Faculty Cerebral Palsy and Pediatric Rehabilitation Unit and Special Education and Rehabilitation Centers. The inclusion criteria were having a child with CP aged 2-18 years without severe cognitive problems, being a primary caregiver.</description>
