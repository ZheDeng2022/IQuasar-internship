      Clinical trial of &quot;line extension&quot; of drug ARAFARMADOL® 0.075% cream in a new formulation in&#xD;
      topical solution applicable in roll-on and with the same therapeutic indications approved for&#xD;
      the cream.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor created a new pharmaceutical formulation of CAPSAICIN topical solution applicable&#xD;
      in roll-on. This new formulation in roll-on represents a line extension of drug ARAFARMADOL&#xD;
      0.075 cream, which is currently marketed in Spain by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed investigational product as topical solution applicable in roll-on is expected to&#xD;
      solve the compliance and safety issues of the cream with the same indications for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized into two groups: CAPSAICIN topical solution applicable&#xD;
      in roll-on and CAPSAICIN cream (ARAFARMADOL® ) for 8 weeks. Then, they will have a 4 week&#xD;
      washout period and will be crossed over to the other treatment group for 8 weeks. A follow-up&#xD;
      period of 2 weeks will take place after the end of both treatments.&#xD;

    <measure>To demonstrate the efficacy and the non-inferiority of a new formulation of the capsaicin topical solution in &quot;roll-on&quot; compared to capsaicin in cream.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate the efficacy and the non-inferiority of a new formulation of Capsaicin 0.75 mg / g topical solution applicable in &quot;roll-on&quot; compared to the formulation currently marketed (comparator) in cream (Arafarmadol® 0.075% cream). The main variable will be the decrease in pain on the visual analogue pain scale (score range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible) at 8 weeks of treatment with each drug. The change in efficacy between the two treatments (pain reduction with cream minus pain reduction with roll-on) will be calculated and the 95% confidence interval for this change will be obtained; If the confidence interval does not exceed the non-inferiority limit (1.0), it will be concluded that the new formulation is not inferior to the one currently marketed.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts - the descriptive part and the visual scale analog (EVA). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, habitual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression. In the EVA the patient scores their health between two extremes, 0 and 100, worst and best health status imaginable.</description>
