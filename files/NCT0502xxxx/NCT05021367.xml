    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , occurrence of all adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) , pharmacokinetic parameters and antitumor&#xD;
      effect of TQB3823 tablets in Chinese adult patients with advanced solid tumors .The study was&#xD;
      divided into phase Ia and phase Ib, Phase Ia: Dose escalation period, to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of TQB3823 tablets, determine MTD;Phase Ib: Effectiveness exploration&#xD;
      period, to expand the safe and effective dose group, and to recommend appropriate dosage and&#xD;
      method for subsequent clinical research.&#xD;
