  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global aging population is rising year by year. According to the result of Taiwan&#xD;
      epidemiological survey, dementia has become the health issue in aging population. Mild&#xD;
      cognitive function impairment may present years before dementia is diagnosed. Therefore early&#xD;
      diagnosis of dementia at its Mild cognitive function impairment stage is beneficial for&#xD;
      disease prevention and potentially delaying the deterioration of cognitive function&#xD;
      impairment. Nutritional status includes a healthy diet, favor body composition and activity&#xD;
      habits, which not only reduces the risk of nutritional metabolic diseases, but also has a&#xD;
      direct relationship with delaying cognitive function impairment. The dietary quality index of&#xD;
      Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative&#xD;
      Delay diet (MIND diet) may prevent aging and positively associated with delaying dementia in&#xD;
      elderly. However, the result in dietary quality index and delaying cognitive function&#xD;
      impairment from current studies were still unclear. In additions, based on the differences in&#xD;
      dietary patterns between Taiwan and Western countries, no current calorie and dietary&#xD;
      nutrition recommendations. This cross-sectional study is to investigate the association&#xD;
      between dietary quality index and nutritional status risk factors in cognitive function&#xD;
      impairment patients and expected to develop an assessment tool for Taiwanese clinical&#xD;
      nutrition strategies and applications.&#xD;

      Aging populations is rising by years in Taiwan. Mild cognitive function impairment (MCI) has&#xD;
      become the important health issue. Current knowledge of the etiology of cognitive decline is&#xD;
      incomplete, the potential modifiable factors, such as diet may delay the deterioration of&#xD;
      disease. This study is aimed to comprise the differences nutritional status,include dietary&#xD;
      nutrients intake, MIND diet scores,body composition analysisin with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. Design and methods: this cross-sectional study from July, 2019. According to&#xD;
      clinical dementia rating (CDR) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE), subjects are divided&#xD;
      into healthy group (CDR = 0 and MMSE ≧ 26) and MCI group (CDR ≧ 0.5 and MMSE ≧ 26). Dietary&#xD;
      data were obtained by 3-day dietary records and nutrients intake were calculated by trained&#xD;
      dietitian. We expected to understand the nutritional status of patients with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
