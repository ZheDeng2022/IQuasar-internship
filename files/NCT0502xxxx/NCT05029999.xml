  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to find out if the immunotherapy drugs called CDX-301 and&#xD;
      CDX-1140 in combination with the standard chemotherapy treatment pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin (PLD, Doxil) are safe and effective at controlling the cancer in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer, and to determine a safe dose and treatment schedule&#xD;
      of the three drugs. This research study will also test how these treatments improve your&#xD;
      body's immune response against the cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immunotherapy drugs CDX-301 and CDX-1140 in combination with the standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment PLD work by kickstarting the immune response against cancer cells. CDX-301&#xD;
      increases the antigen presenting immune cells needed to kickstart the immune response,&#xD;
      CDX-1140 activates these cells, and chemotherapy helps release antigens from the cancer cells&#xD;
      to train these antigen presenting immune cells to recognize the cancer for the immune system&#xD;
      to attack it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic or unresectable triple negative breast cancer patients will receive this triplet&#xD;
      combination that has been shown in preclinical studies to be more effective than the&#xD;
      individual treatments or doublet combinations. To understand how the immunotherapies are&#xD;
      working, some patients will receive the immunotherapy or chemotherapy only for one cycle&#xD;
      prior to receiving the full triplet combination therapy. Ultimately, all patients will&#xD;
      receive the triplet combination to study safety and how effective this treatment is at&#xD;
      controlling triple negative breast cancer and improving survival outcomes.&#xD;

             acceptable if ≤ equivalent of prednisone 10 mg daily. Brain MRI required on screening&#xD;
             to document lack of progression.&#xD;

             patients with resolved childhood asthma/atopy or other syndromes which would not be&#xD;
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g., drug-related serum&#xD;

             severe valvular heart disease or any of the following within 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary&#xD;
             artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack.&#xD;

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. The&#xD;
             COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are not live vaccines and are allowed&#xD;
             if the final vaccine dose (of a regimen that requires more than 1 dose) is received at&#xD;
             least 1 week prior to study enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy, known HIV infection, or positive test for&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C (antibody screen and if positive confirmed&#xD;
             by RNA analysis). If positive results are not indicative of a true active or chronic&#xD;
             infection, the patient can be enrolled after discussion with and agreement by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that could increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug&#xD;
             administration or could interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of acute or chronic infection on screening chest radiography.&#xD;
