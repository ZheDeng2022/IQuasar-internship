  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      administrating mutated-CALR peptide Vaccine to patients with MPN. The researchers plan to&#xD;
      enroll 10 patients over a 12 month period. Maximum length of participation in 80 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires, bone marrow biopsies, research lab&#xD;
      collection, and standard of care lab draw. This research will be taking place only at The&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital, specifically at the Ruttenberg Treatment Center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current MPN treatments are geared towards symptom palliation and not on changing the natural&#xD;
      course of the disease. Mutations in calreticulin gene (CALR) is the second most common driver&#xD;
      mutation in ET and MF patients (30%). All CALR mutations identified to date in MPN patients&#xD;
      result in the formation of an altered protein with an identical 36-amino acid sequence in the&#xD;
      C-terminus. This altered protein results in a MPN-specific shared neo-antigen. The mutated&#xD;
      CALR neoantigen present in patient with MPN represents an ideal antigen for targeted&#xD;
      immunotherapy as it is stably and specifically expressed by the malignant cells and is absent&#xD;
      in the normal tissues. CALR neoantigen is immunogenic, effector T cells are capable of&#xD;
      recognizing this neo-antigen, and hematopoietic cells carrying the mutation can be potently&#xD;
      killed by these specific effector T-cells in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers believe that a mutated-CALR vaccine will enhance mutated-CALR-specific T cell&#xD;
      immunity in MPN patients carrying CALR mutations, which in turn would target and eliminate&#xD;
      CALR+ malignant cells, thereby leading to improved clinical outcomes in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
