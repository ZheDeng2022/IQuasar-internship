      It will be developed and evaluated the antihistamine potential of a gel containing&#xD;
      alpha-bisabolol. Method: Interventional and cross-sectional study, with convenience sampling,&#xD;
      conducted with 20 volunteers. The forearm will be sensitized at four points (A, B, C and D).&#xD;
      Point A: positive control will be sensitized with a drop of histamine at a concentration of&#xD;
      10 mg / Ml. Point B: histamine will apply and immediately after, the alpha bisabolol gel with&#xD;
      a concentration of 0.5%. Point C: histamine and gel with 2.5% alpha-bisabolol will apply.&#xD;
      Point D will be sensitized with a drop of histamine and 5.0% alpha-bisabolol gel. The test&#xD;
      reading at each point will occur 15 minutes after the procedure. For the analysis of the&#xD;
      results, the T Test will be applied.&#xD;

      Context:. Phytotherapy has been widely used to treat health with a prophylactic, curative and&#xD;
      palliative purpose due to its easy access and low cost when compared to other available drug&#xD;
      forms. Some plant species have antiallergic and anti-inflammatory properties that can be used&#xD;
      to help contain signs and damage in allergic reactions, triggered mainly by histamine such&#xD;
      as: pain, redness, heat and edema. Alpha-bisabolol, extracted from Candeia, has several&#xD;
      applications in the treatment of illnesses, however, there are no studies on the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential for antihistamine. Objective: To develop and evaluate the antihistamine potential&#xD;
      of a gel containing alpha-bisabolol. Method: Pilot study, interventional, cross-sectional&#xD;
      study, with convenience sampling, conducted with 20 volunteers. The forearm will be&#xD;
      sensitized at four points (A, B, C and D). Point A: positive control sensitized with a drop&#xD;
      of histamine at a concentration of 10 mg / Ml. Point B: histamine will be applied and&#xD;
      immediately after, the alpha bisabolol gel with a concentration of 0.5%. Point C: histamine&#xD;
      and gel with 2.5% alpha-bisabolol will be applied. Point D will be sensitized with a drop of&#xD;
      histamine and 5.0% alpha-bisabolol gel. The test reading at each point will occur 15 minutes&#xD;
      after the procedure. For the analysis of the results, the T Test will be applied.&#xD;
