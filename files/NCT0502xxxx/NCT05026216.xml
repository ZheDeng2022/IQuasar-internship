  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, off-label, multiple dose, multiple injection areas, Phase 4 study to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of multi-dilution CCH in adult women with mild or moderate&#xD;
      edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP). 5 subjects will be screened and dosed in the&#xD;
      buttock and thigh areas using a multi-dilution injection technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified subjects (determined by investigator assessment) will receive a single vial of 0.84&#xD;
      mg of CCH to treatment areas (buttocks and thighs) for a total dose of 1.68 mg in both&#xD;
      buttocks and both thighs per treatment session × 3 treatment sessions (Day 1, Day 22, and Day&#xD;
      43). Subjects will have follow-up visits at approximately 90 after Day 1.&#xD;
