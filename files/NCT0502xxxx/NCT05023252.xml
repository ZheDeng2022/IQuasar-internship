  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serious mental illnesses require years of monitoring and adjustments in treatment. Stress,&#xD;
      substance abuse or reduced medication adherence cause rapid worsening of symptoms, with&#xD;
      consequences that include job loss, homelessness, suicide, incarceration, and&#xD;
      hospitalization. Treatment visits can be infrequent. Illness exacerbations usually occur with&#xD;
      no clinician awareness, leaving little opportunity to make treatment adjustments. Tools are&#xD;
      needed that quickly detect illness worsening. At least two thirds of Veterans with serious&#xD;
      mental illness use a smart phone. These phones generate data that characterize sociability,&#xD;
      activity and sleep. Changes in these are warning signs for relapse. Members of this project&#xD;
      developed an app that monitors and transmits these mobile data. This project studies passive&#xD;
      mobile sensing that allows Veterans to self-track their activities, sociability and sleep;&#xD;
      and studies whether this can be used to track symptoms. The project intends to produce a&#xD;
      mobile platform that monitors the clinical status of patients, identifies risk for relapse,&#xD;
      and allows early intervention.&#xD;

      Background: Serious mental illnesses are common, disabling, challenging to treat, and require&#xD;
      years of monitoring with adjustments in treatments. Stress or reduced medication adherence&#xD;
      can lead to rapid worsening in symptoms and functioning with consequences that include&#xD;
      relapse, job loss, homelessness, incarceration, hospitalization and suicide. In usual care,&#xD;
      clinician visits are infrequent, with intervals ranging from monthly to yearly. Communication&#xD;
      between patients and clinicians between visits is challenging and often nonexistent. Patient&#xD;
      illness exacerbations and relapses generally occur with little or no clinician awareness in&#xD;
      real time, leaving little opportunity to adjust treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: For the large population of Veterans with serious mental illness, tools&#xD;
      are needed that passively monitor their mental health status, allowing them to self-track&#xD;
      their behaviors, quickly detect worsening of mental health, and support prompt assessment and&#xD;
      intervention. At least 60% of Veterans with serious mental illness use a smart phone. These&#xD;
      generate data that characterize sociability, activity, and sleep. Changes in these behaviors&#xD;
      are warning signs of relapse. Passive self-tracking could be used to identify and predict&#xD;
      worsening of illness in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: Passive mobile sensing is a novel approach to illness self-tracking and&#xD;
      monitoring. There has been relatively little research on passive self-tracking in serious&#xD;
      mental illness, with limited analytics development in this area, and none in VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: This project studies passive mobile sensing with Veterans in treatment for&#xD;
      serious mental illness. Data are used for self-tracking of behaviors and symptoms. While&#xD;
      passive mobile sensing has been feasible, acceptable and safe in patients with serious mental&#xD;
      illness, these are studied for the first time in VA. Analytics are developed that use passive&#xD;
      data to predict behaviors and symptoms. This project responds to the HSR&amp;D priority areas of&#xD;
      Mental Health and Healthcare Informatics. The project has these objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct user-centered design of passive mobile self-tracking to support Veterans'&#xD;
           management of their mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the feasibility, acceptability and safety of passive self-tracking of mental&#xD;
           health that includes feedback of mental health status to the Veteran.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use mobile sensor and phone utilization data to develop individualized estimates of&#xD;
           sociability, activities, and sleep as measured by weekly interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study the predictive value of using data on sociability, activities, and sleep to&#xD;
           identify exacerbations of psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Activities can be assessed with data on movement, location, and habits.&#xD;
      Sociability can be assessed with data on communication and public interactions. Sleep can be&#xD;
      assessed using data on light, sound, movement, and phone use. Investigators on this project&#xD;
      developed a functional mobile app that monitors and transmits mobile sensor and utilization&#xD;
      data. Focus groups and in-lab usability testing inform further app and intervention&#xD;
      development. Mixed methods research study deployment in Veterans who passively self-track&#xD;
      their behaviors and psychiatric symptoms. If this project meets intended goals, the VA will&#xD;
      have a mobile analytics platform that continuously monitors behaviors and symptoms of&#xD;
      patients with serious mental illness.&#xD;
