      The purpose of this data collection is to establish the validity and reliability of several&#xD;
      different commercially available bioelectrical impedance analysis devices that are used to&#xD;
      estimate body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve 1-2 total visits: one initial visit followed by an optional follow-up&#xD;
      visit 12-16 weeks later. These visits will consist of body composition assessments after an&#xD;
      overnight fast. Before the overnight fast, the individual will be asked to drink 1 liter (the&#xD;
      equivalent of two 16.9-ounce water bottles) between the final meal of the day and the&#xD;
      beginning of the 8-hour fasting period. At the first visit, participants will undergo dual&#xD;
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; GE Lunar Prodigy), air displacement plethysmography (ADP; Cosmed&#xD;
      Bod Pod), a 3D body scan (SizeStream SS20), and several multi- and single-frequency&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) assessments. The BIA assessment methods will be&#xD;
      conducted twice. This will allow for test-retest reliability assessment of each of the BIA&#xD;
      devices being assessed in our study. At the optional second visit, all assessment methods&#xD;
      utilized in our laboratory will be conducted once. By comparing these values to the values&#xD;
      from the first visit, we will be able to establish the cumulative error due to technical&#xD;
      error and biological error (i.e. random biological differences in the participants between&#xD;
      the two assessments). We will collect data in a similar fashion during this second visit in&#xD;
      order to compare the changes over time between the measurements provided by the commercially&#xD;
      available BIA devices against the changes detected by a validated 4-compartment model of body&#xD;
      composition, which uses research-grade devices. Cumulatively, this information will provide&#xD;
      essential data to consumers regarding both the immediate and long-term test-retest&#xD;
      reliability as well as the validity of commercially available BIA devices such as home body&#xD;
      fat scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commercially available BIA devices being examined in the present study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omron HBF-306&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RENPHO Smart Bathroom Scale (item number: ES-26BB-B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hawanna Body Fat Scale (UPC: 791555289926)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wyze Scale (SKU: WHSCL1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INEVIFIT Smart Body Fat Scale (UPC: 711841680565; EAN: 0711841680565)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WeightWatchers Scale by Conair (model: WW721XF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tanita UM-081 (model: UM-081; EAN: 0742496801012 and 0885157966993)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VitaGoods FormFit Digital Scale and Body Analyzer (model: VG42252-0000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omron HBF 516 Body Composition Monitor (model: HBF-516B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seca sensa 804&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withings/Nokia BodyCardio Body Composition Digital Scale (model: WBS04b-Black-All-Inter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tanita BC554 IronMan Body Composition Monitor (model: BC-554)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tanita BC568 InnerScan Segmental Body Composition Monitor (model: BC-568)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  InBody H2ON Smart Full Body Composition Analyzer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, several laboratory-grade bioimpedance technologies will be performed, including&#xD;
      ImpediMed SFB7 bioimpedance spectroscopy and Seca mBCA 515/514 multi-frequency bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance analysis. Urine specific gravity will also be assessed using digital refractometry,&#xD;
      and height will be assessed via stadiometer. As part of the ADP test, body mass estimates&#xD;
      from a calibrated, research-grade scale will be obtained (Modified BWB-627-A, Tanita&#xD;
      Corporation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test-retest reliability of the commercially available bioelectrical impedance analysis&#xD;
      devices will be examined through duplicate assessments. The validity of the commercially&#xD;
      available bioelectrical impedance analysis devices will be examined as compared to the&#xD;
      criterion laboratory methods, namely the 4-compartment model for total body composition and&#xD;
      DXA and/or laboratory-grade segmental bioimpedance technologies for segmental body&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
