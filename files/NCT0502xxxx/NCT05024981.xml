  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular Accident affects the majority of the elderly population and its frequency is&#xD;
      constantly increasing. The resulting deficits are numerous and lead in particular to an&#xD;
      alteration in the quality of walking and autonomy. Numerous rehabilitation techniques have&#xD;
      been described. In practice, correction instructions are often given by the therapist while&#xD;
      the motor activity is being performed. Walking is a complex activity, as is the processing of&#xD;
      dual-task information in elderly stroke patients. It therefore appears interesting to&#xD;
      separate the time of motor realization and that of correction instructions. Investigators&#xD;
      therefore propose firstly to film the patient during the performance of a walking activity&#xD;
      and then, secondly, to analyse the video with the patient, which thus represents a source of&#xD;
      delayed feedback. The main objective of the study is to observe the effects of this practice&#xD;
      on walking speed. Investigators are comparing two groups of patients: the control group&#xD;
      receiving conventional rehabilitation and the experimental group receiving conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation plus sessions with the video tool. They expect to observe a greater&#xD;
      improvement in walking speed in the experimental group.&#xD;

    <description>Twice a week during his classic re-education sessions, the patient will be filmed for 1 minute. After transferring the video to a tablet, he will watch the video once and decide what he wants to correct. During the second viewing, he will analyse his walk, the therapist being present to provide additional information. Finally, the patient will apply his analysis while being filmed and will compare the possible differences between the 2 videos. Depending on the time available, the patient may have to repeat the recordings, analyses and exercises.</description>
