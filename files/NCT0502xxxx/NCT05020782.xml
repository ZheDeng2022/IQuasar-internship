      AIM: The primary objective of the BeLimumab Antiphospholipid Syndrome Trial (BLAST) is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab for up to 24 months in patients with&#xD;
      persistent aPL positivity and clinical features attributable to aPL that are resistant to&#xD;
      warfarin and/or heparin.&#xD;
