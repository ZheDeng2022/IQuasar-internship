  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use agnostic genomic evaluation using whole exome sequencing&#xD;
      (WES) of a variety of rare hematologic diseases grouped under rare blood diseases and its&#xD;
      variants to further elucidate the understanding of the chemistry of these disorders and&#xD;
      identify potential actionable mutations that can be targeted with therapies in the context of&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study team will examine genetic changes, also known as mutations, in the DNA of&#xD;
      participants' blood, or if applicable, bone marrow specimen. These types of tests are&#xD;
      increasingly used by doctors to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and make decisions during&#xD;
      care. This study seeks to understand how many patients will benefit from this testing, and in&#xD;
      what ways. The results of this portion of the study are placed in the individual's medical&#xD;
      record and are communicated back to each participant.&#xD;
