  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to see if ziltivekimab reduces the risk of having cardiovascular&#xD;
      events (for example heart attack and stroke) in people with cardiovascular disease, chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will either get ziltivekimab (active medicine) or placebo (a dummy medicine&#xD;
      which has no effect on the body). This is known as the study medicine. Which treatment&#xD;
      participants get is decided by chance. Participants chance of getting ziltivekimab or placebo&#xD;
      is the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ziltivekimab is not yet approved in any country or region in the world. It is a new medicine&#xD;
      doctors cannot prescribe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study medicine in a pre filled syringe. Participants will need to&#xD;
      use the pre filled syringe to inject the study medicine into a skinfold once-monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to last for up to 4 years. Participants will have up to 20 clinic&#xD;
      visits. Participants will have blood and urine samples taken at most of the clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their heart examined using sound waves (echocardiography) and&#xD;
      electrodes (electrocardiogram).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to get pregnant during the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
