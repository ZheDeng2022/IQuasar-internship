  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchospasm during anaesthesia is a rare but potentially life-threatening event. They are&#xD;
      classically part of IgE-dependent anaphylaxis but can also occur as an independent clinical&#xD;
      entity, triggered by inflammatory factors such as smoking, chronic bronchitis, asthma,&#xD;
      overweight and mechanical factors such as tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiological diagnosis is currently established during an allergy-anaesthesia consultation&#xD;
      after skin testing for drugs used for induction of anaesthesia and antibiotic therapy when it&#xD;
      is attributable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics that differ between 2 groups:&#xD;
      isolated non-allergic bronchospasm and bronchospasm as part of an immediate allergic&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction.&#xD;

        The patients included were those referred to the allergy consultation (dermato-allergology&#xD;
        department of the Nancy University Hospital), over a period from October 2017 to March&#xD;
        2021, for investigation of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, involving a bronchospasm&#xD;
        explicitly identified by the anaesthetist, which occurred during an anaesthetic procedure.&#xD;
        There were no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
