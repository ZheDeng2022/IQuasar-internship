  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with stroke-related disability spend more time sedentary than adults without&#xD;
      stroke-related disability, which places them at risk for poor cardiovascular health outcomes.&#xD;
      Few interventions are designed to reduce post-stroke sedentary time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to test whether the teleABLE (Activating Behavior for Lasting&#xD;
      Engagement) Intervention is feasible and acceptable to adults within the first 12 months&#xD;
      post-stroke. The hypothesis is that teleABLE can be feasibly delivered using&#xD;
      videoconferencing within the first 12 months post-stroke. 10 participants will complete&#xD;
      assessments and activity monitoring (activPAL micro3) at 0 (baseline) and 8&#xD;
      (post-intervention)-weeks. Participants will complete 12 sessions of the teleABLE&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study will be used to guide the intervention protocol in the planned next&#xD;
      phase of this research.&#xD;

    <measure>Participant Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8. This is an 8-item questionnaire with each item ranked on an 1 to 4 Likert-type scale. We will compute the mean score across all items. The possible range is 1 to 4, with high scores indicating high satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participation Restrictions</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Activity Card Sort 3. This is a 100-item tool during which participants indicate whether they did the activity prior to their stroke, continue to do the activity since their stroke, or have given up the activity since their stroke. Change in the proportion of activities retained will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level. This is a 5-item self-report questionnaire with each item scored on a 1 to 5 scale. Scores are converted to Index Scores following published procedures (possible range -0.573 to 1), with high scores indicating high quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sedentary Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the activPAL micro3 monitor following a 7-day wear protocol. The mean daily minutes of sitting time accumulated in bouts of 30 minutes or more will be computed for each time point. Change in mean daily minutes of sitting time accumulated in bouts of 30 minutes or more will be reported.</description>
