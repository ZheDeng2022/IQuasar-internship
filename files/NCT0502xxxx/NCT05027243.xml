      Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy has been used successfully for intra-articular&#xD;
      disorders. Until now, limited studies are available regarding the clinical evidence of&#xD;
      bilateral TMJ arthroscopy for Dimitroulis 2-3. This prospective study investigated the&#xD;
      efficacy of TMJ arthroscopy in patients with bilateral disorders, and also the need for a&#xD;
      posterior surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy has been used successfully for intra-articular&#xD;
      disorders. It was first introduced by Onishi at 1975, as a pioneering technique to treat&#xD;
      painful joints and has been associated with a reduction in the number of open joints&#xD;
      surgeries. This minimally invasive technique allows observation of the TMJ upper compartment&#xD;
      tissues, and sometimes the lower compartment. Moreover, this intervention allows joint lysis&#xD;
      and lavage (level 1 arthroscopy) and intra-articular surgical procedures (level 2-3&#xD;
      arthroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies updated that TMJ arthroscopy promotes a reduction in pain and inflammatory&#xD;
      process and restoring the mandibular function with low morbidity. Moreover, TMJ arthroscopy&#xD;
      seems to be also long-term effective for relieving TMJ symptoms. Until now, limited studies&#xD;
      are available regarding the clinical evidence of bilateral TMJ arthroscopy for Dimitroulis&#xD;
      2-3. This prospective study investigated the efficacy of TMJ arthroscopy in patients with&#xD;
      bilateral disorders, and also the need for a posterior surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The TMJ arthroscopy was performed with a 1.9-mm arthroscope including a video system, with a 2.8-mm outer protective cannula. Briefly, for TMJ arthroscopy level 1, the authors used the classic puncture with an entry point 10 mm anterior and 2 mm below the Holmlund-Hellsing (H-H) line. A second puncture with a 21-G needle was performed 30 mm anterior and 7 mm below the H-H line to wash the joint with 250-300 ml Ringer solution. After washing the joint, 1.5-2 cc of hyaluronic acid was injected into it. For level 2 TMJ arthroscopy, the second puncture was substituted by a 2.8-mm outer protective cannula with a sharp trocar until the joint was reached. The 2.8-mm cannula was used for (1) intra-articular coblation and/or (2) intrasynovial medication. Antibiotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were routinely prescribed. Patients were instructed to follow a soft diet for 3 days after surgery and 5 physiotherapy and 3 speech therapy exercise sessions after intervention.</description>
