  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) is typically associated with a high tumour mutation&#xD;
      burden, with the majority caused by Ultraviolet (UV) exposure (Pickering et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of this trial using neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in patients with cSCC who will&#xD;
      otherwise undergo highly morbid radical surgical resection has multiple potential advantages,&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in surgical and radiotherapy morbidity by reducing tumour burden and allowing&#xD;
           the appropriate selection of patients to undergo post-operative radiotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provision of immediate information about pathological response and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Access to tissue to provide insight into resistance mechanisms and identification of&#xD;
           biomarkers of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesized that the use of neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab could reduce tumour&#xD;
      burden allowing appropriate selection of patients undergoing radical surgical resection and&#xD;
      adjuvant radiotherapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive cSCC that is locally advanced (Stage&#xD;
             II-IV on AJCC 8th edition) assessed preoperatively as sufficiently high risk that they&#xD;
             will warrant post-operatively RT (as recommended by MDT) who is a candidate for a&#xD;
             complete resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Participants with tumors arising on cutaneous non-glabrous (hair-bearing) lip with&#xD;
        extension onto vermillion (dry red lip) may be eligible after communication and approval&#xD;
        from the principal investigator. Participants for whom the primary site is the nose may be&#xD;
        eligible after communication and approval from the MDT if the primary site is skin, not&#xD;
        nasal mucosa with outward extension to skin. Participants who have squamous cell parotid&#xD;
        metastases and have been treated previously for cSCC are permitted. cSCC that has recurred&#xD;
        in the same location after 2 or more surgical procedures are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a&#xD;
             previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been&#xD;
             demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;

          -  Participants must have adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a tissue sample adequate for translational research. This&#xD;
             tissue sample may be obtained from either a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a life expectancy of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be at least 18 years of age on the day of signing the informed consent. 8. Female&#xD;

             or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of trial&#xD;
             medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: In the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the&#xD;
        first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed&#xD;
        and must be negative in order for the participant to start receiving study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not&#xD;
        breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Not a woman of&#xD;

        adequate method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 120 days&#xD;
        after the last dose of study treatment. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual&#xD;
        lifestyle and preferred contraception for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) must be willing and&#xD;
        able to provide written informed consent for the trial. The participant may also provide&#xD;
        consent for Future Biomedical Research. However the participant may participate in the main&#xD;

             the past 2 years (eg, with use of disease-modifying agents, anticoagulants,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the&#xD;
             participant's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best&#xD;
             interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
