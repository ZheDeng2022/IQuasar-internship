      Immunodeficiency associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection could&#xD;
      predispose people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) to defective serological responses following&#xD;
      infection or vaccination. To evaluate the health outcomes of coronovirus disease-2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) and HIV co-infection, PLHA and HIV-uninfected persons in Hong Kong are invited to&#xD;
      join a study for understanding their clinical characteristics and for tracking their levels&#xD;
      of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) over a&#xD;
      one-year observation period after infection or vaccination. The results could inform the&#xD;
      development of prevention and control strategy for PLHA in response to the emerging&#xD;
      coronavirus threats.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the health outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) co-infection in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in Hong Kong,&#xD;
      with the specific objectives of (a) describing the clinical and immunological characteristics&#xD;
      of coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) in PLHA; (b) tracking the CD (cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation) 4/CD8 lymphocytes changes following SARS-CoV-2 infection; (c) assessing the&#xD;
      temporal changes of SARS-CoV-2 serology profile of PLHA following SARS-CoV-2 transmission and&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive study involving the analyses of data derived from the testing of PLHA&#xD;
      and non-infected controls at different time-points, following SARS-CoV-2 infection / COVID-19&#xD;
      or vaccination, in conjunction with routinely collected clinical data in the setting of Hong&#xD;
      Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of subjects to be recruited is 800, of which 50 would be HIV/SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      co-infected persons. In order that their serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be&#xD;
      interpreted in perspective, 400 HIV uninfected adults would be recruited for comparison.&#xD;
      Separately, 400 PLHA and 50 healthy adults who have received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination would be&#xD;
      recruited to form another control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling would be performed upon diagnosis of COVID-19 disease when a SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infected person is hospitalized for treatment, or after vaccination. This would be repeated&#xD;
      after discharge for hospitalized patients and on follow-up at the following time-points: 3,&#xD;
      6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Plasma would be separated from the collected blood samples and&#xD;
      stored at -20Â°C before testing. The levels of antibody to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike&#xD;
      protein would be measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, while&#xD;
      surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) would be performed to track the changes of&#xD;
      sero-protection. .&#xD;
