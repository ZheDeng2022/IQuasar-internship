  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBI110 is an investigational drug under evaluation for treatment of small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study was to assess the Efficacy and Safety of IBI110 in combination with&#xD;
      Sintilimab and chemotherapy with untreated ES-SCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, multicenter, open-lable study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of IBI110 (anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3 [LAG-3] monoclonal antibody) and sintilimab&#xD;
      (anti-programmed death 1 [PD-1] antibody) in combination with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      cisplatin/carboplatin plus (+) etoposide (EP) in treatment na√Øve patients with&#xD;
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) . Sixty eligible subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the experimental arm or the control arm. The experimental&#xD;
      arm will be IBI110+ sintilimab + EP Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by IBI110+ sintilimab Q3W&#xD;
      until disease progression. The control arm will be sintilimab + EP Q3W for 4 cycles, followed&#xD;
      by sintilimab Q3W until disease progression.&#xD;
