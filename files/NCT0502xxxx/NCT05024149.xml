  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three groups of subjects will be included: 20 subjects in the healthy control group, 20&#xD;
      subjects in the MDD electroacupuncture (EA) intervention group, and 20 subjects in the MDD&#xD;
      waiting-list group (participants will receive no treatment within 4 weeks). The temperature&#xD;
      and infrared thermography (IRT) images of the facial acupoints of three groups will be&#xD;
      recorded by an infrared thermal-imaging camera. The average facial temperature and acupoints&#xD;
      temperature will be analyzed and compared within 3 groups. In addition, the correlation&#xD;
      between facial infrared radiation characteristics of MDD patients and emotional changes will&#xD;
      be explored. Besides, the relative specificity of the two meridians will be investigated.&#xD;

    <measure>Hamilton depression scale (HAMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>HAMD will be performed in the first week, the second week and the fourth week to evaluate the severity of the disease and the treatment effect.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is performed by two trained raters to perform a Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), usually in the form of conversation and observation. After the examination, the two raters will score independently. HAMD score of 21 to 35 values, and higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will not undergo acupuncture intervention. For participants in the healthy control group, the IRT examination of the measurement sites will last for 3 minutes, with one thermal image taken every 10s. In the Healthy group, there will be two visits, and the first visit will be considered as the screening stage (i.e., demographic data recording, medical history taking, physical examination report review and recording on the day of enrollment) and the second visit will be considered as the detection stage (i.e., the day of enrollment). At the second visit, the subjects received the Self-rating depression scale (SDS), HAMD, and then the infrared thermographic images to be acquired.</description>

    <description>In this study, we used a waiting list control group. During the 4 weeks follow-up period, participants from the MDD waiting-list group had no contact with participants from the MDD EA intervention group and no access to the EA intervention. After the 4 weeks follow-up period, patients in the waiting list group received access to the EA intervention.</description>
