  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a syndrome of unbalanced response of the sympathetic system to&#xD;
      noxious stimuli below the level of spinal cord injury (SCI), characterized by paroxysmal&#xD;
      hypertension. Mostly, it is combined with symptoms such as pounding headache, slowed heart&#xD;
      rate, and upper body flushing, but it can also be asymptomatic. When resulting in&#xD;
      hypertensive crisis, it can be life-threatening and result in seizures, cardiac arrest,&#xD;
      retinal or subarachnoid hemorrhages, stroke, and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the risk level of vascular complications in SCI people&#xD;
      by correlating the clinical symptoms with their individual perception during AD triggered&#xD;
      below the level of injury.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After spinal cord injury, the disruption of descending vasomotor pathways to sympathetic&#xD;
      neurons causes their hyperexcitability. When irritated by noxious stimuli below the level of&#xD;
      injury, a massive sympathetic reflex is triggered, causing widespread vasoconstriction. If&#xD;
      the neurological level of injury is at or above T6, this vasoconstriction can lead to&#xD;
      progressive hypertension possibly involving the splanchnic vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to hypertension, the baroreflex system lowers blood pressure by reducing heart&#xD;
      rate and decreasing the activity of sympathetic neurons. However, a decrease in peripheral&#xD;
      vascular resistance below the injury level does not occur because of the disruption of&#xD;
      descending vasomotor pathways to sympathetic neurons. Thus, hypertension persists until the&#xD;
      triggering stimulus is removed. Hypertensive crises can result in vascular complications like&#xD;
      cardiac arrest, retinal or subarachnoid hemorrhages, stroke, and even death. Vasodilatation&#xD;
      above the lesion level is accompanied by characteristic signs and symptoms such as upper body&#xD;
      flushing and sweating, and a pounding headache. Sometimes bradyarrhythmia, seizures, nausea,&#xD;
      or anxiety can occur. Unfortunately, AD can take place asymptomatically in almost 40 %. These&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals are at high risk of life-threatening complications mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent AD triggers are overfilled bladder or bowel. Nevertheless, it can be any&#xD;
      irritating stimuli below the level of injury, i.e., skin lacerations, ingrown toenails, or&#xD;
      pressure sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher intensity of perception of clinical symptoms accompanying AD decreases the risk of&#xD;
      vascular complications. People who perceive subjective signs of AD even in slightly elevated&#xD;
      blood pressure can eliminate irritating stimuli or use an antihypertensive medication and&#xD;
      thus avoid life-threatening complications. On contrary, people who cannot perceive the signs&#xD;
      intensely enough are at a significantly higher risk of vascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the risk level of vascular complications in SCI people.&#xD;
      The AD will be triggered below the injury level so that the clinical symptoms can be&#xD;
      correlated with their subjective individual perception. Moreover, the development of a method&#xD;
      allowing capturing AD episodes in individuals without subjective signs is intended.&#xD;

    <description>Continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring will be recorded using Finapres device.&#xD;
The risk level will be determined according to the value of systolic blood pressure (SBP):&#xD;
Low risk - SBP to 150 mmHg&#xD;
Moderate risk - SBP 150-200 mmHg&#xD;
High risk - SBP above 200 mmHg</description>

    <measure>Dermal sweating</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Wrist sweating will be monitored using a measure of dermal resistance with range 0-5 MΩ (difference 0,1 kΩ, accuracy 0,15 %) and 5-32 MΩ (difference 10 kΩ, accuracy 1 %) and sampling frequency 10 second.&#xD;
Regarding the AD symptoms, level of dermal resistance decrease corresponds to increase of sweating.</description>

    <time_frame>During the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective individual symptoms are divided into three groups, according to their severity (minimum value: mild symptoms, maximum: strong symptoms):&#xD;
Mild symptoms - shivers on the nape or on the back&#xD;
Moderate symptoms - sweating on the forehead, neck or upper extremities&#xD;
Strong symptoms - pounding headache, nausea</description>

    <measure>ADFSCI questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The ADFSCI (Autonomic Dysfunction Following Spinal Cord Injury) questionnaire provides information about individual symptoms of blood pressure (BP) instability. The ADFSCI is a 24-item questionnaire consisting of four parts: demographics, medication, AD, and hypotension. The AD and hypotension parts include 10 and 7 items, respectively, each using a 5-point scale to score the frequency and severity of hyper- or hypotensive symptoms with a range of 0 ∼ 204 (highest BP instability) points.</description>
