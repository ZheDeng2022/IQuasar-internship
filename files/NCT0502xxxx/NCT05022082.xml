  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to compare the impact of chest physiotherapy applied with two different&#xD;
      methods on physiologic parameters in children hospitalized in the intensive care unit. In the&#xD;
      intensive care unit where the study was conducted, the patients who have a respiratory&#xD;
      disorder and receive supplemental oxygen therapy with non-invasive mechanical ventilation or&#xD;
      an oxygen mask are first administered an inhaler drug therapy placed in the physician's&#xD;
      order. It is followed by chest physiotherapy and then oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      aspiration. However, in practice rendered by the researcher, it is suggested that when chest&#xD;
      physiotherapy and aspiration are administered in the first place and then followed by an&#xD;
      inhaler drug therapy, it might have a more positive impact on the patient's physiologic&#xD;
      parameters. For this reason, it is intended to compare the efficiency of chest physiotherapy&#xD;
      applied in a different order.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      52 children who complied with the inclusion criteria will be included in the study. The&#xD;
      mother or father of the children hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit of the&#xD;
      hospital where the study is conducted will be given information about the study and asked to&#xD;
      sign the &quot;Informed Voluntary Consent Form&quot;. After the family's approval, they will be asked&#xD;
      to fill out the &quot;Parent Introductory Information Form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization method will be used to create the control group and the study group.&#xD;
      Children to be included in the study will be placed in the groups with the randomized&#xD;
      controlled method with 26 children in each group. The randomization of the study will be made&#xD;
      with the online program available at the URL address https://www.randomizer.org/. Before&#xD;
      entering the sample size in the program, lots will be drawn, and the 1st set will be assigned&#xD;
      to the control group, and the 2nd set will be assigned to the study group. In order to&#xD;
      determine in which group the children involved in the study will be placed, numbers from 1 to&#xD;
      52 will be entered into the program without repetition. Children that will constitute the&#xD;
      study group through the program will be randomly distributed into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (n=26) will be administered the inhaler drug routinely administered in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit where the study is conducted and then receive chest physiotherapy&#xD;
      (tapotement or vibration), then nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal aspiration. The study group&#xD;
      (n=26) will first receive chest physiotherapy (tapotement or vibration) and aspiration,&#xD;
      followed by inhaler drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Patient Data Collection Forms&quot; of both groups will be filled out. Chest physiotherapy&#xD;
      will follow the &quot;Tapotement and Vibration Application Procedure,&quot; and aspiration will follow&#xD;
      the &quot;Nasopharyngeal and Oropharyngeal Aspiration Application Procedure&quot;. The &quot;Patient&#xD;
      Physiologic Parameter Assessment Form&quot; information will be recorded before the application&#xD;
      and 20 minutes after the application. It is known that the stress hormones epinephrine and&#xD;
      norepinephrine half-life is 1-3 minutes, and it is believed that after a stressful invasive&#xD;
      intervention, the release of stress hormones increases but turns back to their normal levels&#xD;
      in 15-20 minutes (Puntillo et al. 2001). Based on this information, vital findings will be&#xD;
      recorded in the &quot;Patient Physiologic Parameter Assessment Form&quot; after 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtained data will be evaluated using necessary statistical tests in the computer&#xD;
      environment. Evaluation methods will be selected considering if data is distributed&#xD;
      homogenously. If it has a homogenous distribution, parametric tests will be used. If it does&#xD;
      not have a homogenous distribution, non-parametric methods will be used.&#xD;
