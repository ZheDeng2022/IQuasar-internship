  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, sham-controlled intervention measuring the effects of isometric exercise&#xD;
      training (IET) on blood pressure and cardiac autonomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IET has been proven effective in a plethora of randomized trials, but very little research&#xD;
      has employed a sham-controlled design. This researched involved the recruitment of 30&#xD;
      participants who completed a 4 week IET intervention, sham control of the IET intervention,&#xD;
      or a non-intervention control period. Pre and post blood pressure and cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      measures were acquired and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this trial was a significant effect of IET on blood pressure, with no such&#xD;
      effects following the sham control or normal control interventions.&#xD;
