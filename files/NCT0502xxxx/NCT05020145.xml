    <textblock>
      The objective of this US-based retrospective cohort study is to evaluate characteristics,&#xD;
      vaccine utilization and outcomes among subjects with immunocompromising conditions that&#xD;
      received COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be aged 12 years and older and will have no evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be conducted on subjects vaccinated with BNT162b2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses are planned.&#xD;
