      1. use QoL assessments to check whether interventions have been as effective from the&#xD;
           patient's point of view as from the clinician's, and to determine whether further action&#xD;
           is required . Knowledge of which factors are determinants of QoL in patients with MS&#xD;
           would assist clinicians in choosing the most appropriate interventions. Several&#xD;
           determinants of QoL have been identified with varying strengths of association and&#xD;
           include both disease-related variables (disability status ,disease duration ,fatigue&#xD;
           ,depression ,cognition , sociodemographic variables (age and sex ,level of education,&#xD;
           and marital status . A number of these factors might be amenable to treatment&#xD;
           intervention, which might be expected to improve QoL: fatigue , depression , and&#xD;
           cognition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study effect of psychiatric comorbidity on the disease activity by using clinical,&#xD;
           laboratory and psychiometric tools.&#xD;

      2.1 Background (Research Question, Available Data from the literature, Current strategy for&#xD;
      dealing with the problem, Rationale of the research that paves the way to the aim(s) of the&#xD;
      work). (200-250 words max.) Multiple sclerosis (MS) refers to a chronic, autoimmune and&#xD;
      demyelinating inflammatory pathology that affects the Central Nervous System (CNS) in&#xD;
      multiple areas, namely the cerebral peduncle and periventricular areas of the brain, optic&#xD;
      nerves, and spinal cord . MS is characterized by a diverse set of symptoms and lesions, which&#xD;
      can cause serious physical alterations, compromise cognitive functioning, and even trigger&#xD;
      neurological problems .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS etiology is not yet fully understood. However, it is considered a multifactorial disease&#xD;
      with environmental and genetic variables being risk factors with immunological implications&#xD;
      that alter myelin (white matter) . Myelin, when degraded due to the inflammatory process&#xD;
      inherent to the disease (flare-up), can lead to scarring (plaques/lesions) which, in turn,&#xD;
      leads to a CNS impairment in the transmission of impulses, resulting in complications in the&#xD;
      functioning of several organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of MS on patients' quality of life (QoL) is undeniable. However, there are other&#xD;
      variables whose influence are significant, such as duration of diagnosis that is associated&#xD;
      with worse physical and mental QoL, the degree of disability, and the evolution of the&#xD;
      disease, which also appear to be negatively associated with QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have attempted to correlate advancing neurologic disability with impaired QOL&#xD;
      in MS patients . However, advancing neurologic disability has been shown to only partly&#xD;
      explain impaired QOL . This supports the hypothesis that factors other than neurologic&#xD;
      disability play a role in the QOL of MS patients.&#xD;

    <description>â€¢ Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) Can be considered as the most known disease-specific instrument for the evaluation of quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). It was developed to combine generic quality of life aspects of the SF-36 with MS-targeted dimensions and ratings for the overall quality of life. Therefore, 18 disease-specific items were added to the original 36 items of the SF-36. The 54 items are divided into 12 multi-item and 2 single-item scales. The MSQOL-54 items are transformed linearly to 0-100 scores and final scores are obtained by averaging items within the scales</description>
