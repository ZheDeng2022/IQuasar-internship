  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who have COPD need a nursing service, which provides qualified and effective&#xD;
      professional care, self-care, and supportive care to perform their daily life activities, and&#xD;
      improve their quality of life. It is predicted that the Chronic Care-Based Training Program&#xD;
      to be implemented and the follow-ups can increase the level of self-efficacy and&#xD;
      satisfaction, and raise awareness on the management of the disease in patients. The purpose&#xD;
      of the study was to evaluate the effects of the Chronic Care Model based education and&#xD;
      telephone follow-up given to patients with COPD on self-efficacy and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes. Also, the Modified Patient-Reported Outcome Scale for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease-mCOPD-PRO scale, which will be used in the study, will be adapted into Turkish&#xD;
      language and culture, and will be used in the study after its validity and reliability are&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a major global healthcare problem with its high&#xD;
      prevalence, increasing incidence (partly due to population aging), and major serious&#xD;
      personal, social, and economic costs. Individuals who have COPD require a nursing service&#xD;
      that provides qualified and effective professional care, self-care, and supportive care to&#xD;
      perform their daily life activities and improve their quality of life. Nurses have active&#xD;
      roles in the management of COPD as professional members of the team, and perform the roles of&#xD;
      caregiving, consultancy, researcher, manager, and trainer in COPD management. The skills&#xD;
      needed for the management of COPD and the knowledge and interventions to develop these skills&#xD;
      are conceptualized as self-management, which is a complex structure including drug&#xD;
      compliance, smoking cessation, maintaining and increasing exercise capacity, healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle changes that include nutrition regulation, vaccination, and symptom management. The&#xD;
      purpose of &quot;Self-management&quot; in COPD is stated in the GOLD 2021 report as &quot;to provide&#xD;
      motivation, encouragement, and guidance for patients to acquire positive health behaviors and&#xD;
      to gain the ability to cope with their disease&quot;. The Self-Management Training and Guidance&#xD;
      provided by healthcare staff must be the basic element of the &quot;Chronic Diseases Care Model&quot;&#xD;
      in the scope of the healthcare provided. Although various models were proposed for chronic&#xD;
      disease management, the best known, most used, and most effective among these is the Chronic&#xD;
      Care Model. The model has the quality of being a roadmap for high-quality and&#xD;
      patient-centered service delivery in chronic diseases. Four components of the Chronic Care&#xD;
      Model will be implemented in the present study, which are; Decision Making Support,&#xD;
      Self-Management Support, Health Services Delivery Plan, and Clinical Information Systems. The&#xD;
      study has a randomized controlled experimental study design. The sampling of the study will&#xD;
      consist of the patients who were diagnosed with COPD, hospitalized in Elbistan State Hospital&#xD;
      Chest Service of Kahramanmara≈ü Provincial Health Directorate, met the inclusion criteria, and&#xD;
      who volunteer to participate in the study. A total of 66 patients, 33 in the Control Group,&#xD;
      and 33 in the Intervention Group will be randomized into groups in the computer medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the intervention protocol of the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A training booklet will be created for COPD patients in the scope of the Chronic Care&#xD;
           Model self-management support component of the study. The quality of the booklet will be&#xD;
           evaluated by submitting it to expert opinions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the present study as the&#xD;
           Intervention and Control Group according to the randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients in the Control and Intervention Group will be interviewed before patients are&#xD;
           discharged, and their pre-test data will be collected after informed consent is obtained&#xD;
           from them. For this purpose, Patient Information Form, COPD Self-Efficacy Scale, COPD&#xD;
           Assessment Test (CAT),modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale, Modified&#xD;
           Patient-Reported Outcome Scale for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (mCOPD-PRO)&#xD;
           Scale will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After the pre-tests are completed, the patients in the Intervention Group will be given&#xD;
           training during their hospital stays (0 months) with the training booklet, which is&#xD;
           prepared by the researcher based on the Chronic Care Model, and which includes&#xD;
           information and suggestions about self-management strategies. The training will be&#xD;
           organized in one single session and in the patient room, in a way not to exceed&#xD;
           approximately 45-50 minutes. The dietitian and physiotherapist, who are the team members&#xD;
           of the patients, will conduct interviews before the patients are discharged from the&#xD;
           ward, and the information obtained will be registered in the hospital clinical&#xD;
           information system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patients, who will be included in the Intervention Group, will be followed up by&#xD;
           phone every two weeks after their discharge. Also, reminders and informative information&#xD;
           based on the training booklet will be sent to patients every week in the form of a short&#xD;
           message.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The patients in the Control Group will continue their routine procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Post-tests will be applied to the patients who will be included in the Control and&#xD;
           Intervention Group at the 3rd-month polyclinic follow-up. The Patient Assessment of&#xD;
           Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) will be used in this post-test in addition to the&#xD;
           pre-tests. At the end of the study, Training will be given to the Control Group patients&#xD;
           along with Training Booklet.&#xD;

    <description>The COPD Self-Efficacy Scale consists of 34 items and 5 subscales, and is used to determine the degree of confidence of COPD patients in managing or avoiding breathing difficulties in certain activities. The sub-factors of the scale consist of negative impact, emotional state, physical effort, weather/environment effect, and behavioral risk factors. On the scale, as the mean score increases, the degree of confidence also increases in managing or avoiding respiratory distress.</description>

The scale consists of 27 items and physiological (17 items), psychological (7 items), and environmental (3 items) fields. The mCOPD-PRO is not a mere measurement of symptoms, it is a comprehensive measurement of disease-specific health status including physiological, psychological, and environmental domains. Each item consists of a 5-point Likert-type design, and the scores of the scale are graded between 0-4.</description>
