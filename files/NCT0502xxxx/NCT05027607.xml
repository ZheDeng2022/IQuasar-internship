      The standard treatment at Nordsjællands Hospital in Hillerød (NOH) has since 2007 been&#xD;
      Bascom's pit-pick procedure (PP) for simple pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), while Bascom's&#xD;
      cleft-lift procedure has been performed in complicated cases not suitable for PP operation,&#xD;
      recurrences following previous excisions, including PP, and unhealed midline wounds. PP&#xD;
      operation is a minimally invasive procedure performed using local anesthesia in day surgery&#xD;
      or outpatient clinic with certain advantages such as quick healing, less pain and a quick&#xD;
      return to work as well as cosmetic advantages with no change to the overall appearance and&#xD;
      shape of the gluteal cleft. The procedure is less resource demanding requiring fewer staff&#xD;
      members and less time spent at the hospital as well as a quick return to daily life.&#xD;
      Short-term studies showing great results following PP operation have previously been&#xD;
      published, but so far, no long-term results have been published regarding Danish patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it has previously been stated that most recurrences happen within the first 5&#xD;
      years following surgery. A follow-up of at least 5 years after surgery for PSD has been&#xD;
      proposed as the gold standard. A longer follow-up is warranted to fully understand, whether&#xD;
      PP procedure is a fully adequate treatment with an acceptable rate of recurrence and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction or whether it only delays the time before the patients eventually undergo a&#xD;
      final treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on data of patients in a local pilonidal database. The patients in the&#xD;
      database have all undergone surgery for pilonidal sinus disease at NOH during the period of&#xD;
      2007 to 2014. Data in the database has been collected prospectively up to one year following&#xD;
      surgery and subsequently supplemented with data collected by questionnaire and telephone&#xD;
      interviews for the period from one year follow-up and until the date of long-term follow-up.&#xD;
      Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at&#xD;
      NOH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a REDCap survey per e-mail to a personal digital mailbox or are asked to&#xD;
      participate in a telephone interview to fill out a standardized questionnaire. Patients&#xD;
      without a personal digital mailbox receive the questionnaire by regular mail. The survey is&#xD;
      sent out twice with a four-week interval. Only patients who do not fill out the questionnaire&#xD;
      the first time, receive the survey a second time as a reminder. Telephone interviews are only&#xD;
      conducted, if patients do not reply to the questionnaire received digitally or as a physical&#xD;
      copy. The questionnaire includes questions regarding demographic characteristics, lifestyle,&#xD;
      complications, recurrence and new interventions, pain, and cosmetic satisfaction. Medical&#xD;
      records are reviewed to verify answers from the questionnaire if consent by the patient is&#xD;
      given through the survey or during the telephone interview. Patients experiencing symptoms of&#xD;
      recurrence, are offered an assessment at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical intervention: the patient is placed in a prone position and the natal cleft is&#xD;
      kept open using tape straps. Local analgesia is administered around the midline pits and at&#xD;
      the site of the planned lateral incision using lidocaine 5 mg/ml with adrenaline 5 µg/ml.&#xD;
      Occasionally the procedure was performed under general anesthesia. All midline pits are&#xD;
      identified and excised using a scalpel removing hairs and infected granulation tissue. To&#xD;
      drain the sinus, a lateral incision is made about 1-2 cm from the midline on the most&#xD;
      appropriate side and through this incision underlying sinuses are either curetted or excised.&#xD;
      Additional secondary pits are removed as part of the lateral incision. Midline wounds and&#xD;
      separately excised secondary pits close to the midline are closed with suture using&#xD;
      transcutaneous polypropylene 3-0 or 4-0 madras suture, while the lateral incision is left&#xD;
      open and covered with bandage and transparent film dressing to heal by secondary intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of recurrence and time to complete wound healing is analyzed using competing risk&#xD;
      analysis as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses including the&#xD;
      following risk factors: sex, age, smoking, BMI, relevant co-morbidities, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      acne, hidradenitis, previous interventions, preoperative abscess, number of primary and&#xD;
      secondary pits, number of lateral incisions and postoperative complications. Remaining&#xD;
      outcomes are analyzed as categorical variables using descriptive data analyses.&#xD;
