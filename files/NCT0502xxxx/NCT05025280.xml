  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the sensory processing abilities of adults with acquired hearing&#xD;
      loss and to explore the differences in sensory processing between adults with hearing loss&#xD;
      and adults with normal hearing. Sensory processing functions of 30 adults with acquired&#xD;
      hearing loss will be evaluated using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile. The data from&#xD;
      adults with hearing loss will be compared with data from 30 adults with normal hearing who&#xD;
      were similar in gender and age.&#xD;

      This study aims to investigate the sensory processing patterns of adults with hearing loss&#xD;
      and compare them with healthy controls. In this study, it was hypothesized that adults with&#xD;
      hearing loss, had an abnormal sensory profile like children with hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consist of individuals between the ages of 18-65 who were taken into&#xD;
      audiological evaluation at the outpatient unit of Audiology of a hospital and voluntarily&#xD;
      agreed to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the audiological test results, individuals with a pure tone average of more than&#xD;
      25 decibel (dB) in the better ear and with less than 10 dB difference between the air-bone&#xD;
      conduction thresholds will be included in the study group, and those with a pure tone average&#xD;
      of 25 dB or less in both ears and with less than 10 dB difference between the air-bone&#xD;
      conduction thresholds will be included in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing aid users, those with chronic tinnitus and/or dizziness, and those with major medical&#xD;
      disorders and/or handicaps will not be included in the study. In this study, Hearing Handicap&#xD;
      Inventory for Adults (HHIA) and Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile will be used.&#xD;

    <description>There are 15 questions in each quadrant for 60 questions in total. The responses provided are in a Likert-scale system with &quot;almost always (5 points)&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot; and &quot;almost never (1 point)&quot; and the scores of the related items are summed up to provide the score for each quadrant. Norm values have been established for three different age intervals: 11-18, 18-65, and 65 years and over for evaluation and respondents are classified in the end for the four quadrants using the statements &quot;much more than most people,&quot; &quot;more than most people,&quot; &quot;similar to most people,&quot; &quot;less than most people,&quot; and &quot;much less than most people&quot;.&#xD;

    <description>The Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile Questionnaire (AASP), was developed based on Dunn's model of sensory processing. It is a 60-item self-assessment questionnaire that evaluates behavioral patterns related to sensory processing. The questionnaire consists of six different subsections such as taste/smell processing, movement processing, visual processing, touch processing, auditory processing, and activity level. According to the answers given, individuals are evaluated in 4 quartiles as &quot;low registration,&quot; &quot;sensory sensitivity,&quot; &quot;sensation avoiding,&quot; and &quot;sensation seeking.&quot;</description>
