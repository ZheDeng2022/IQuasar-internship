      The objective of this study is to better understand public attitudes towards coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. This understanding will inform the development of&#xD;
      community engagement strategies to be used in future interventions and studies aimed at&#xD;
      addressing factors that impact the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 in under-served and&#xD;
      vulnerable communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly instigated a&#xD;
      global pandemic. As of this writing, there are more than 33 million documented cases of&#xD;
      infection in the United States (US). Furthermore, in the US, COVID-19 has disrupted the&#xD;
      economy, overwhelmed the healthcare system, led to widespread school cancellations, and&#xD;
      caused more than 595,000 deaths since March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of three highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 within a year of the&#xD;
      start of the pandemic is an extraordinary achievement and cause for great optimism. However,&#xD;
      a significant proportion of adults in the U.S. have not accepted vaccination against&#xD;
      COVID-19. Efforts are needed to identify effective messages and communication strategies to&#xD;
      overcome COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this need, the investigators plan to conduct two rapid surveys among Massachusetts&#xD;
      residents, to assess attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;

The message that participants in each experimental group receive will vary slightly and systematically. Specific content and wording of these messages were developed to address and mitigate concerns about the Covid-19 vaccination.</description>
