  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease is a common complication of diabetes and the main cause of end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease. Clinically, most patients with DKD have albuminuria, but some patients with&#xD;
      DKD have normal urinary albumin, even until they develop stage 5 diabetic kidney disease. In&#xD;
      these diabetic patients with normal urinary albumin, relatively intact renal function and no&#xD;
      significant renal damage (abnormal urine sediment and electrolyte) were observed on&#xD;
      laboratory tests. Whether imaging can detect kidney injury sensitively is an urgent problem&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ultrasound examination is a convenient, cheap and non-invasive method for kidney examination.&#xD;
      However, the ability of conventional ultrasound to distinguish diabetic kidney disease from&#xD;
      normal kidney is limited, and it is difficult to accurately distinguish between diabetic&#xD;
      kidney disease and normal kidney only with the naked eye. In recent years, computer science&#xD;
      has developed rapidly and artificial intelligence has been developing continuously. Much&#xD;
      progress has been made in applying ARTIFICIAL intelligence to data analysis. Machine learning&#xD;
      is a direction of generalized artificial intelligence, its main characteristic is to make the&#xD;
      machine autonomous prediction and create algorithm, so as to achieve autonomous learning.&#xD;
      kidney disease and deep learning are two different approaches in the field of machine&#xD;
      learning. In this study, image omics and deep learning were used to analyze the images. Image&#xD;
      omics extracts traditional image features, including shape, gray scale, texture, etc., and&#xD;
      uses machine learning (pattern recognition) models to classify and predict, such as support&#xD;
      vector machine, random forest, XGBoost, etc. Deep learning directly uses the convolutional&#xD;
      network CNN to extract features, and completes classification and prediction in combination&#xD;
      with the full connection layer, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the detection of diabetic kidney disease and its pathological&#xD;
      degree based on self-divided ultrasound image omics, maximize the mining of internal&#xD;
      information of ultrasound images, and form a set of non-invasive monitoring of diabetic&#xD;
      kidney disease complications development system, especially in primary medical institutions,&#xD;
      has a broad clinical application prospect.&#xD;
