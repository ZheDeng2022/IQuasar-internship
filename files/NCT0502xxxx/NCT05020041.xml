  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a factor that contributes to a motor and cognitive development in early&#xD;
      childhood. Currently, childhood obesity has grown steadily in Chile. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a school environmental intervention on the physical activity and&#xD;
      cognitive functions in 1st-grade schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study will&#xD;
      use a randomized experimental design with a sample of 300 schoolchildren divided into a&#xD;
      control and an intervention group (n=150 each group). Sociodemographic characteristics and&#xD;
      lifestyle of the schoolchildren will be obtained through a questionnaire answered by&#xD;
      parents/guardians. Cognitive function will be evaluated using the TENI test by tablet and&#xD;
      physical activity will be measured during 7 consecutive days using accelerometers (Actigraph&#xD;
      GT3X and wGT3X-BT). Both groups will receive a lecture aimed at schoolchildren. Teachers of&#xD;
      the intervention group will also receive a talk regarding the intervention that will take&#xD;
      place in their school environment, which includes a circuit of psychomotor games painted on&#xD;
      the recess playground floor. ANCOVA analysis will be performed, adjusted for age and sex;&#xD;
      then, a multivariate linear regression model will be applied considering the significant&#xD;
      variables and adjustment. The significance level will be p&lt;.05. SPSSv25 and R version 3.14&#xD;
      will be used for the analyses. The intervention is expected to contribute to the increase of&#xD;
      physical activity favoring the school environment within a context of vulnerability and with&#xD;
      a low-cost initiative&#xD;

    <description>The schools in the intervention group will receive the online educational talk aimed at schoolchildren and a talk aimed at Physical Education teachers, given that they are fundamental for the development of habits in the school stage; besides, painted games will be implemented in the school playground.&#xD;
The implementation of painted games will consist of adapting a space destined for recreation, designing a psychomotor circuit that does not require contact between peers or manipulation of objects in order to maintain COVID-19 sanitary and safety protocols. The psychomotor circuit includes a line circuit, a jumping sequence game, and a letter spiral. All the games will be implemented in a space within the educational establishment to which the students will have access during recess. The game designs involve activities to develop motor patterns such as jumping with different supports, running, and dynamic balance.</description>
