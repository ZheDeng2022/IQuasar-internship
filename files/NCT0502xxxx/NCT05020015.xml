    <textblock>
      This study has 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of Part 1 is to check for side effects from TAK-007 in adults with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of Part 2 is to learn if lymphomas are reduced or gone after treatment&#xD;
      withTAK-007 in adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or indolent&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy for 3 days before receiving a single&#xD;
      injection of TAK-007. After this, participants will regularly visit the clinic for check-ups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The product being tested in this study is called TAK-007. TAK-007 is being tested to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability in adult participants with r/r B-cell NHL. The study will include&#xD;
      2 parts: Part 1 (Dose escalation and dose expansion) and Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 242 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts participants will receive TAK-007 as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Dose escalation: TAK-007 - 200×10^6 CD19-CAR+ Viable NK Cells (±30%) Part 1: Dose&#xD;
      escalation: TAK-007 - 800×10^6 CD19-CAR+ Viable NK Cells (±25%) Part 1: Dose expansion: r/r&#xD;
      LBCL: TAK-007 - 200×10^6/800×10^6 Viable NK Cells Part 1: Dose expansion: r/r iNHL: TAK-007 -&#xD;
      200×10^6/ 800×10^6 Viable NK Cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data in Part 1, a single TAK-007 dose level will be selected by the sponsor and&#xD;
      investigators as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once RP2D is determined, participants will be enrolled in Part 2 of the study in the&#xD;
      following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: TAK-007 (LBCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: TAK-007 (iNHL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will enroll in a&#xD;
      separate, long-term, follow-up study for continued safety assessments for up to 15 years&#xD;
      after TAK-007 administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Participants with primary or secondary central nervous system (CNS) involvement by&#xD;
             lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma, or&#xD;
             transformation from CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (Richter transformation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with a history of anti-CD19 therapy (eg, CD19-targeted CAR-T cells or&#xD;
             monoclonal antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with a history of malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer,&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ (eg, cervix, bladder, breast), low-grade tumors deemed to be cured&#xD;
             and not treated with systemic therapy (eg, by gastro-endoscopy curatively removed&#xD;
             gastric cancer) or unless disease free for ≥3 years at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants who have undergone autologous or allogeneic transplant within 3 months of&#xD;
             planned enrollment. Participants after allogeneic transplant have to be off systemic&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy and without the evidence of clinically relevant acute or&#xD;
             chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants with clinical evidence of active infection, including fungal, bacterial,&#xD;
             viral, or other infection that is uncontrolled or requires IV antimicrobials for&#xD;
             management within 3 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants with any of the following within 12 months of enrollment: myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina, symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure (ie, New York Heart Association Class II or greater), clinically&#xD;
             significant arrythmia (including uncontrolled atrial fibrillation), or any other&#xD;
             clinically significant cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants who have received a live vaccine ≤6 weeks before the start of the&#xD;
             conditioning regimen.&#xD;
