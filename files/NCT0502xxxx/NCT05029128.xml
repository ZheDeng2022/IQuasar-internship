  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is essential for building and maintaining bone mass and strength, but current&#xD;
      exercise recommendations for how to achieve this lack detail on the optimal exercise&#xD;
      prescription. Recent studies found that blood calcium level decreases during exercise, and&#xD;
      that calcium is mobilized from bone to slow the decline. If this occurs repeatedly during&#xD;
      exercise training, it could diminish the potential benefits of exercise to improve bone&#xD;
      health. The proposed study will determine whether further research on pre-exercise&#xD;
      supplemental calcium to minimize the decline in blood calcium level during exercise is&#xD;
      warranted. This research is important for Veterans because they are at increased risk of hip&#xD;
      fracture when compared with non-Veterans. Further, because osteoporosis in men is&#xD;
      under-recognized and under-treated, providing male (and female) Veterans with more specific&#xD;
      exercise and nutrition guidelines has the potential to enhance bone health, reduce fracture&#xD;
      risk, and improve quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is essential for building and maintaining bone mass and strength, but recent work&#xD;
      has raised the possibility that current exercise recommendations for bone health may not be&#xD;
      appropriate. There is strong evidence that a single bout of vigorous exercise has an acute&#xD;
      catabolic effect in bone (i.e., increased resorption) that lasts several hours. This is&#xD;
      mediated by a decrease in serum calcium (Ca) during exercise, which stimulates parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (PTH) secretion. PTH then activates bone resorption to mobilize Ca from bone,&#xD;
      presumably to prevent the decrease in serum Ca from progressing to a harmful level. This&#xD;
      cascade of events can be markedly attenuated by minimizing the decline in serum Ca during&#xD;
      exercise via either intravenous or oral Ca administration. The timing of Ca supplementation&#xD;
      relative to exercise is likely important, because it must be available for gut absorption&#xD;
      during exercise. Interestingly, repeated pharmacologic stimulation of the PTH receptor with&#xD;
      PTH analogs (teriparatide, abaloparatide) has anabolic effects on bone, suggesting that&#xD;
      repeated exercise-induced increases in PTH could have a chronic anabolic skeletal effect, in&#xD;
      addition to the acute catabolic effect, which may be apparent only after repeated exercise&#xD;
      sessions. If this is the case, suppressing the PTH response with pre-exercise Ca&#xD;
      supplementation may not be appropriate. In this context, this proof-of-concept study will&#xD;
      include a short exercise intervention consisting of treadmill exercise at 70% to 80% of&#xD;
      maximal heart rate, 60 minutes per day, 4 days per week, for 4 weeks. Serum markers of bone&#xD;
      formation and resorption will be measured before, during, and for 24 hours after the 1st,&#xD;
      8th, and 16th exercise sessions to address two questions: 1) Does the acute catabolic&#xD;
      response of bone to a single bout of exercise continue to occur with repeated exercise&#xD;
      sessions (i.e., exercise training)? 2) Does exercise training also generate an anabolic&#xD;
      PTH-mediated bone response, similar to the anabolic response to PTH analog therapy? If the&#xD;
      answers to questions 1 and 2 are YES (persistent catabolic signal) and NO (lack of anabolic&#xD;
      signal), this will support the need for the randomized controlled trial (RCT), which will&#xD;
      evaluate whether taking Ca before exercise to attenuate the acute catabolic response improves&#xD;
      skeletal adaptations to exercise training. The overarching goal is to improve the currently&#xD;
      imprecise recommendations for exercise to improve and maintain bone health. This research is&#xD;
      of high relevance to Veterans, who are at increased risk of hip fracture when compared with&#xD;
      non-Veterans. Further, because osteoporosis in men is under-recognized, under-diagnosed, and&#xD;
      under-treated, providing male Veterans with an effective non-pharmacologic therapeutic option&#xD;
      to reduce fracture risk may help close this treatment gap. The potential impact of this&#xD;
      research also extends beyond Veterans. It could lead to reduced risk of exercise-related bone&#xD;
      injury (i.e., stress fractures) in active duty military personnel and athletes and to&#xD;
      improved bone health in the general population.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will undergo the same exercise intervention, so there is no randomization. The exercise will be treadmill walking at 70-80% of HRmax for 60 min/d, 4 d/wk, for 4 wk. The mode and intensity of exercise were selected because high-intensity weight-bearing exercise is recommended for bone health, and walking is the most common weight-bearing activity. Although &quot;high-intensity&quot; exercise for bone health refers to the intensity of bone-loading forces, %HRmax is a good proxy because peak bone-loading forces increase as walking or running speed increases. Exercise sessions will be supervised by the research team.&#xD;
This exercise prescription was used in the studies of young and older adults that provided the scientific premise for the current study and resulted in robust PTH and CTX responses.</intervention_model_description>
