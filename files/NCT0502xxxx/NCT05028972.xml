  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      I-HearVA involves six VA facility emergency departments (ED) over a 3-year intervention&#xD;
      period. The first part of this study will test whether providing personal amplifiers to&#xD;
      Veteran ED patients who self-report hearing difficulty is acceptable to these patients, can&#xD;
      improve their hearing, enhance understanding of discharge instructions, and can reduce the&#xD;
      risk of coming back to the ED in a short period of time (3 days and 30 days). The second part&#xD;
      of the study will then identify whether ED staff can implement this program and achieve&#xD;
      similar results. The second part will give ED staff increasing levels of responsibility for&#xD;
      screening Veterans for hearing difficulty and providing personal amplifiers when such&#xD;
      difficulty is detected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      I-HearVA is a randomized controlled trial to explore the utility and outcomes of providing&#xD;
      point-of-care access to hearing-impaired Veterans, comparing an offer of personal amplifiers&#xD;
      versus control in an environment where the clinical stakes are high. It addresses a knowledge&#xD;
      gap about the utility of providing such hearing assistance during clinical encounters. The&#xD;
      study measures whether providing personal amplifiers is acceptable to older patients, can&#xD;
      improve hearing, enhance understanding of discharge instructions, and improve care&#xD;
      transitions at discharge. If such a strategy is beneficial, this simple low-tech approach has&#xD;
      great potential for implementation and wide dissemination. HearVA-ED has two phases - the&#xD;
      first, which has been completed, established the feasibility and acceptability of research&#xD;
      and procedures in the ED environment through a pilot efficacy study and the second phase will&#xD;
      be to complete a larger more definitive efficacy study and a detailed implementation study&#xD;
      resulting in a strategic approach that can be widely disseminated across all VA emergency&#xD;
      departments throughout the United States. This second phase will use a mixed-methods, hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation design to implement and evaluate the hearing assistance&#xD;
      intervention in six VA Emergency Department Sites (in different facilities across the&#xD;
      country). Implementation will occur in four stages with variation in the starting sequence at&#xD;
      each site: The first group of two VA emergency departments will initiate implementation with&#xD;
      an efficacy trial; second group of two sites will initiate implementation with delivery and&#xD;
      support of personal amplifiers after screening and randomization by a research assistant&#xD;
      (Stage 1); the third group of two sites will initiate implementation with the entire&#xD;
      implementation (Stage 2) and the presence of a research assistant to conduct discharge&#xD;
      interviews; and all sites will progress from this sequence to Stage 3 - Sustainability -&#xD;
      which is the full implementation without research assistant presence.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to the control or intervention arm of the study. Participants in the intervention arm will receive PockeTalkers (personal amplifiers) for the duration of their time in the emergency department. Participants in the control group will not receive personal amplifiers during their time in the emergency department, but will receive one upon discharge from the emergency department. In later stages, there will be no control group and all participants will receive a personal amplifier during their time in the emergency department.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>3-5 days after initial ED stay</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigators will determine whether patients have had an ED revisit within three days through CPRS review as well as a brief follow-up phone call 3-5 days after ED discharge</description>

    <measure>Patient-Rated Quality of Hearing, Understanding, and Communication With Providers During ED Stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ED stay, average of 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-rate their quality of hearing, understanding, and communication using a six item questionnaire. Scored on a 10-point Likert scale (1 = do not agree at all; 10 = completely agree) the questions will be: When I talked to the doctors and nurses today ... (1) their voices were very clear; (2) I was able to hear the sounds that I wanted to hear; (3) noises did not cause a problem for my hearing; and (4) listening did not make me tired. Two additional statements will explicitly capture understanding: (5) I was able to understand what they said; and (6) I was able to understand without making an effort. Higher scores will indicate better communication and understanding with providers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Rated Quality of Post-Discharge Care</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of discharge from ED, average 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-rated quality of post-discharge care using a three-item subset of the Care Transition Measure (CTM). The questions are scored on a 1-4 scale (1= strongly disagree; 4 = strongly agree): (1) The ED staff considered my preferences and those of my family or caregiver in deciding what my healthcare needs were for discharge; (2) Leaving the ED, I have a good understanding of the things I am responsible for in managing my health; (3) Leaving the ED, I clearly understand the purpose for each of my medications. Higher scores will indicate better discharge preparation.</description>
