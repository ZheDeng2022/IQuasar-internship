  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a laboratory-based pilot randomized control trial of&#xD;
      smartphone-enabled breath alcohol monitoring on perceived fitness to drive a vehicle among&#xD;
      intoxicated adults. We will enroll up to 30 adults aged &gt; 21-44 who are frequent drinkers&#xD;
      without dependence who drive more than four times per week to complete a standardized alcohol&#xD;
      drinking protocol in a monitored setting collecting breathalyzer measurements. The protocol&#xD;
      involves consuming three weight-based doses of alcohol with a target BAC of 0.10 and&#xD;
      completing breathalyzer measurements every 20 minutes until a BAC of 0.03 is reached. The&#xD;
      control group will complete a visual analog scale on their perceived fitness to drive and be&#xD;
      blinded to their breath alcohol readings with the BACtrack Mobile Pro breathalyzer device,&#xD;
      while the intervention group would do the same, but be shown their breath alcohol readings on&#xD;
      the paired BACtrack smartphone application. Our previous research has validated the accuracy&#xD;
      of the BACtrack Mobile Pro device to measure BAC within +/- 0.001 of police-grade&#xD;
      breathalyzer and estimate BAC within +/- 0.01 of a blood test.&#xD;
