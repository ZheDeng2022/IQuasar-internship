    <textblock>
      This phase II trial the side effects and possible benefits of etigilimab and nivolumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with platinum-resistant clear cell ovarian, primary peritoneal, or&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer that has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as etigilimab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The goal of&#xD;
      this clinical trial is to learn if adding etigilimab to nivolumab therapy can help to control&#xD;
      clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers that are resistant to&#xD;
      platinum-based therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate of the combination of etigilimab and nivolumab in&#xD;
      patients with platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the toxicity of the combination of etigilimab and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine progression free survival (PFS) of the combination of etigilimab and&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the disease control rate of the combination of etigilimab and nivolumab in&#xD;
      patients with platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate molecular and immunological changes associated with the combination of&#xD;
      TIGIT and PD-1 inhibition; specifically to describe changes in T cell populations (including&#xD;
      but not limited to CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3) and cell proliferation, as well as report changes in&#xD;
      the proportion of macrophage phenotypes M1 and M2 (with phenotypic markers potentially&#xD;
      including arginase1, CD11b, PDL-1, and CD206).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive etigilimab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 2 and 15 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days.&#xD;
