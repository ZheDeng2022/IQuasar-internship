    <description>In the preparatory session, the participant is given a survey. It is about demographic information such as gender, age, and age, as well as prior experience with the procedure. The primary test is performed with a fluoroscopy guided lumbar transforaminal epidural block with a human-shaped phantom.&#xD;
After that, the test group and the control group receive the same audiovisual education for about 5 minutes. The test group receives about 60 minutes of training using a virtual reality program.</description>

After that, the test group and the control group receive the same audiovisual education for about 5 minutes. The control group have provided with video materials and books provided during audiovisual education and have given time for self-study for 60 minutes. Subsequently, a second test is performed with a fluroscopy-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural block with a human-shaped phantom.</description>
