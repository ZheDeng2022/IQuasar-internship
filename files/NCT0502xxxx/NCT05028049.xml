      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the incidence of postoperative hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil in&#xD;
           patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery in plateau and plain areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the peri-operative analgesic requirements of patients in plain and plateau&#xD;
           areas&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our research group has been committed to the research of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia&#xD;
      for a long time. In the previous study, it was found that intraoperative infusion of&#xD;
      remifentanil (0.3ug/kg•min) &gt;1h can lead to remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and the&#xD;
      incidence rate is relative high in the plain area. Due to the long-term low pressure and&#xD;
      hypoxia of people living in plateau areas, a series of changes will occur in the respiratory&#xD;
      and circulatory systems, and their anesthesia management needs to be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
      However, there is no relevant research on whether or not hyperalgesia occurs in people in&#xD;
      plateau areas (altitude level &gt;3000 meters). Therefore, this study hopes to compare the&#xD;
      incidence and degree of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia after gynecological laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery in plain areas and plateau areas.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical Hyperalgesia Threshold on the Dominant Inner Forearm</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The mechanical hyperalgesia threshold was defined as the lowest force (g) necessary to bend a Von Frey filament, which was perceived to be painful by the patient and measured by Von Frey filament after surgery</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Score (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The pain score at rest or after movement was evaluated by pain 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS): 0 = no pain, 10= greatest imaginable pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Normalized Area of Hyperalgesia Around the Incision</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The skin around the incision is stimulated in steps of 5 mm at intervals of 1 s starting outside of the hyperalgesic area in the direction of the incision. The distance from the incision to the first point where a'painful', 'sore' or 'sharper' feeling occurred is measured and noted. This measurement is repeated at predefined radial lines around the incision. To eliminate the variable length of incision, this length is subtracted from the longer diameter leaving four radial distances from the end and from the middle of the incision. The normalized area of hyperalgesia is calculated by summing up the areas of the remaining four triangles measured by and Von Frey filament.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative Hydromorphone Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient was administered analgesics using a PCA (Patient-controlled analgesia) pump containing Hydromorphone (200μg) in normal saline at a total volume of 100 ml after leaving PACU (Postanesthesia care unit). This device was set to deliver a basal infusion of 2 ml/h and bolus doses of 0.5 ml with a 15-min lockout period. Hydromorphone cumulative consumption is recorded 48 hours postoperatively</description>
