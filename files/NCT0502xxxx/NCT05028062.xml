  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IV, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      assess whether individuals identified as primarily reward drinkers are significantly more&#xD;
      likely to reduce heavy drinking if they receive XR-NTX than a matching placebo injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will receive monthly injections of long-acting injectable naltrexone 380 mg (4&#xD;
      mL) or matching placebo. All subjects will also receive 4 sessions of Medical Management&#xD;
      (MM). Post-treatment follow-up visits will be conducted at 4 weeks after the scheduled&#xD;
      completion of treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study eligibility is determined at an initial screening visit, which can be completed in a&#xD;
      single day or divided over multiple days. Portions of the screening may occur by telephone or&#xD;
      video conference. Participants are asked not to drink before this and at all study visits. At&#xD;
      all study visits, study staff will check breath alcohol level using a breathalyzer. If the&#xD;
      breath alcohol level is greater than 0.02% (which can result from a single standard drink),&#xD;
      participants may not be able to complete the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: The screening visit will determine whether the study is a good fit for&#xD;
      participants. It take about three hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to show legal photo ID and undergo a breathalyzer test to&#xD;
           ensure that the breath alcohol level is below 0.02% to complete this visit. A reading&#xD;
           test wil be given to evaluate participant's ability to understand the consent form and&#xD;
           study assessment questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the informed consent is complete a study clinician will complete a medical history&#xD;
           and perform a physical examination. Study staff will draw approximately 3 tablespoons of&#xD;
           blood for standard laboratory tests. Participants will also be asked to provide a urine&#xD;
           sample to conduct a urinalysis, drug screen, and a urine pregnancy test (only for for&#xD;
           women of childbearing potential--i.e., who have not had a hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
           removal of the ovaries, or a tubal ligation or is less than two years postmenopausal).&#xD;
           We will not include women who are pregnant, breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be required to provide the names and contact information of&#xD;
           one or two people (trusted friends or family members) who may serve as additional&#xD;
           contacts to assist staff with locating participants for safety or other study-related&#xD;
           reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete 4 assessments of about psychological health and&#xD;
           alcohol and drug use history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Study Drug Visit (Week 1): Staff will contact participants within 1 week after&#xD;
      completing the screening visit to inform eligibility status and schedule the next study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This visit will take approximately one and one-half hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete a breathalyzer test and study staff will measure&#xD;
           weight and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Woman of childbearing potential, will be asked to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete 11 assessments about psychological health and&#xD;
           alcohol and drug use history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff will instruct participants how to use the interactive voice response (IVR) system&#xD;
           via telephone. During the 8 weeks of the study, participants will be asked to call a&#xD;
           toll-free phone number each day, between 5:00 and 8:00 p.m. to connect to the system.&#xD;
           Access to the system via a touch-tone phone requires a study ID and a password. The&#xD;
           system has prompts to answer questions about feelings and use of alcohol on the day of&#xD;
           the call and the preceding day. It takes about 5 to 8 minutes to complete the daily&#xD;
           interview. The IVR system will provide a reminder if a call has not been completed by&#xD;
           8:15 p.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first brief counseling session will last about 45 minutes. The study nurse will&#xD;
           discuss a treatment goal either to drink less or become completely abstinent. The nurse&#xD;
           will also encourage participants to consider ways to reduce or stop drinking, based upon&#xD;
           the treatment goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be assigned to receive an injection of study medication administered&#xD;
           by the nurse, which will be either XR-NTX or placebo (an inactive substance). The&#xD;
           decision as to which medication received will be random, like a flip of a coin. The&#xD;
           XR-NTX or placebo will look the same. Neither participants nor any of the study&#xD;
           personnel will know which medication is received. In an emergency, though, the study&#xD;
           staff in charge of the study medication can be contacted for that information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, study staff will ask about any side effects or other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biweekly Visits (Weeks 2, 4, and 6): At each biweekly visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The staff will check breath alcohol concentration (Breathalyzer), weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs and ask about any side effects or other adverse events that were experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will asked to complete 6 assessments about psychological health and alcohol&#xD;
           and drug use history. These should take about 20 minutes to answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive brief counseling from the study clinician, which will last&#xD;
           about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At week 4, woman of childbearing potential, will have another urine pregnancy test. If&#xD;
           the urine permanency test is positive, staff will discontinue the medication and the&#xD;
           participant will be referred to an obstetrician for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At week 4 the study nurse will give the second injection of XR-NTX or a placebo (an&#xD;
           inactive substance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to call and complete the toll-free IVR number nightly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Endpoint Visit (Week 8): At this visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The staff will measure breath alcohol concentration (Breathalyzer), weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs and asked about any side effects or other adverse events that may have&#xD;
           experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study staff will ask you to complete 11 assessments about your psychological health&#xD;
           and your alcohol and drug use history. These should take about 45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will draw 1 tablespoonful of blood for lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive brief counseling from the study clinician, which will last&#xD;
           about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits (4 weeks after endpoint visit): At the follow-up visit (which will take&#xD;
      about one hour), the study staff will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check breath alcohol concentration (Breathalyzer), weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Draw 1 tablespoonful of blood for lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete 9 assessments about psychological health and&#xD;
           alcohol and drug use history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once participants have completed the study, they will have an option to receive a letter&#xD;
           to inform them whether they received XR-NTX or placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Participants who choose to withdraw from the study before participation is complete will be&#xD;
      asked to return to the research center for a visit to allow staff to administer the&#xD;
      end-of-study procedures.&#xD;
