  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if exercise preconditioning can mitigate the off&#xD;
      target effects of chemotherapy treatment on measures of cardiovascular function, peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, and quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While survivorship for those diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer has continued to&#xD;
      improve, the significant off target effects of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy have&#xD;
      become more prominent. These off-target effects include increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, neuropathy, and decreased quality of life. Exercise initiated prior to chemotherapy&#xD;
      induction and continued through treatment has promise in terms of preserving VO2peak and&#xD;
      potentially mitigating the negative cardiovascular and neuropathic effects of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to examine the effects of initiating exercise prior to any&#xD;
      oncologic therapy and sustaining this exercise paradigm in newly diagnosed women with ovarian&#xD;
      cancer who are undergoing initial surgery and chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the exercise group will perform interval training (HIIT) 3 days per week, with each session consisting of four, 4-min intervals at 85-90% peak heart rate (PHR), separated by 3 min at 50% PHR. Each training session will begin with a 10-minute warm-up at 50% of PHR and end with a 5-min cool down at 50% PHR. Patients will undergo 2 initial training sessions at the exercise physiology core lab. All exercise will consist of stationary cycling to avoid discomfort associated with abdominal surgery as well as stress to the incision and help reduce fall risk. Study investigators will check in weekly with participants and remotely track exercise data and compliance via the Fitbit app.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control group (physical activity education and physical activity monitoring) will receive counseling regarding the benefits of physical activity during chemotherapy treatment. During the intervention, participants will receive a weekly phone call to discuss their physical activity and remind them to engage in physical activity. Patients will be given a goal of working up to 30 minutes of exercise daily. Subjects will be urged to increase daily step counts by 250-500 steps/day. Physical activity will be objectively assessed and made available to the participant using a Fitbit.</description>
