    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Remission at Week 8 (Co-primary Endpoint)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score of less than (&lt;) 150 (in general, CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600; higher score indicates higher disease activities). CDAI will be assessed by collecting information on 8 different Crohn's disease-related variables: extra-intestinal manifestations, abdominal mass, weight, hematocrit, total number of liquid or very soft stools, abdominal pain [AP]/cramping, use of antidiarrheal drug(s) and/or opiates, and general well-being. The last 4 variables are scored over 7 days by the participant on a diary card that participants are to complete on a daily basis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Endoscopic Response at Week 16 (Co-primary Endpoint)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic response is defined as at least 50 percent (%) improvement from baseline in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) score or SES-CD score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 2. The SES-CD score is based on the evaluation of 4 endoscopic components (presence/size of ulcers, percentage of mucosal surface covered by ulcers, the percentage of affected surface, and presence/type of narrowing/strictures) across 5 ileocolonic segments. Each endoscopic component is scored from 0 to 3 for each segment, and a total score is derived from the sum of all the component scores (range, 0 [remission] to 56 [the most severe endoscopic activity]).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a single dose of ustekinumab intravenously (IV) (weight-based dose approximating 6 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]) at Week 0.

For participants who achieve clinical response with ustekinumab induction dosing at Week 8, will continue to receive 90 mg ustekinumab SC every 12 weeks with final dose at Week 44. If these participants meet the criteria for loss of response from Week 16 to Week 40, dose can be adjusted to 90 mg every 8 weeks (q8w). Participants who are non-responders to ustekinumab at Week 8, and achieve clinical response at Week 16, will continue to receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w from Week 16 to Week 48.</description>

             450, and either: a. Mean daily stool frequency (SF) count &gt;3, based on the unweighted&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history of, or ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease, including but&#xD;
