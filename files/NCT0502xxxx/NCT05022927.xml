    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) by evaluating dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor effect, and biomarkers of ERY974 in&#xD;
      combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab following premedication with tocilizumab in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC.&#xD;
