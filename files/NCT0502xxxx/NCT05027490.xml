  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it has been established that the perception of food and eating and cooking habits&#xD;
      change during cancer and its treatment, quality of life related to meals, which is an&#xD;
      indicator of the psychobiological and physiological well-being of patients in their&#xD;
      relationship to food, has been little studied in the pathological context, and particularly&#xD;
      in patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond its biological role, food plays a significant psychobiological and social role, as&#xD;
      shown by a series of qualitative studies based on interviews with patients. Following a&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis, loss of appetite, difficulty in sharing a meal with the family, and reduced&#xD;
      pleasure in eating disrupt the patient's relationship with his or her food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, side effects such as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and alterations in taste and smell&#xD;
      induced by chemotherapy will affect patients' eating behavior, increasing the risk of&#xD;
      deteriorating their quality of life with food. As these side effects are less known and&#xD;
      therefore less expected by patients, they often lack the information and tools necessary to&#xD;
      understand them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study proposes a support for cancer patients treated by chemotherapy in order to&#xD;
      improve their quality of life related to meals, and thus keep the pleasure of eating and&#xD;
      reduce the risks of malnutrition. This support will consist of a guide provided to patients,&#xD;
      in which they will have information on the functioning of the sensory systems involved in the&#xD;
      eating experience, advice and culinary tips to adapt foods to their sensory disorders, and&#xD;
      recipes that can be adapted in mild (for patients with hypersensitivity to tastes/smells),&#xD;
      accentuated (for patients with hypersensitivity to tastes/smells) and enriched (for patients&#xD;
      at risk of denutrition) versions. In addition, their sensory abilities will be assessed at&#xD;
      the beginning of the study by psychophysical tests, then between each chemotherapy via a&#xD;
      telephone interview (self-reported sensory abilities), and they will benefit from orientation&#xD;
      according to the test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will be a first action to improve the quality of life related to the meal by&#xD;
      information, follow-up, and adaptation of the meals to the sensory performances of each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
