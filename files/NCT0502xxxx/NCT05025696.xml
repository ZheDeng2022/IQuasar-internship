  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Scabies is a skin disease due to Sarcoptes scabiei. The transmission risk is high&#xD;
      among communities living together, such as dormitories, boarding schools, nursing homes, and&#xD;
      so on. Blacksoap® is a soap product that is recognized as adjuvant therapy. Until now, there&#xD;
      has been no research on the effectiveness and side effects of using Blacksoap®. Purpose: This&#xD;
      research aimed to assess the cure rate of standard scabies treatment, with and without&#xD;
      Blacksoap®, to determine pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) score, transepidermal water loss&#xD;
      (TEWL) score before and after receiving therapy, and to evaluate the side effects of the&#xD;
      treatment. Methods: The intervention group obtained standard therapy and Blacksoap®;&#xD;
      meanwhile, the control group received standard therapy and baby soap.&#xD;

      This study is a single-blind randomized clinical trial on scabies patient population at&#xD;
      Pondok Pesantren Al Islami, Cibinong, Bogor. It is part of a research and social service by&#xD;
      the Dermatology and Venereology Department of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia / dr.&#xD;
      Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital entitled &quot;Early Detection of Scabies and&#xD;
      Other Dermatoses and Evaluation of Scabies Treatment in Al-Hidayah and Al Islami Islamic&#xD;
      Boarding School&quot; Research subjects who are participating are those diagnosed with scabies&#xD;
      (fulfilling 2 out of 4 cardinal signs of scabies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was conducted from September to October 2018 with the entire scabies patient in&#xD;
      Indonesia as the target population, and all students at Al Islami Boarding School who at the&#xD;
      time had scabies as the accessible population. A random cluster sampling was done on the&#xD;
      population member diagnosed with scabies based on the boarding school building location into&#xD;
      the intervention group and control group. The intervention group was receiving permethrin 5%&#xD;
      cream and Blacksoap®, while the control group was receiving permethrin 5% cream and baby&#xD;
      soap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin scraping examination was done on the research subjects with potassium hydroxide (KOH)&#xD;
      solution to find the mites, alongside pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) score assessment and&#xD;
      transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement before suitable therapy given. In the first and&#xD;
      fourth weeks after the initial assessment, which includes the scabies cure rate, pruritus VAS&#xD;
      score, TEWL score, and side effects evaluation, a follow-up was conducted. TEWL was measured&#xD;
      using Tewameter® TM 300 made by Courage-Khazaka from Germany. Subsequent data were documented&#xD;
      and processed using Statistical Product and Service Product (SPSS) program version 20.&#xD;
      Finally, an analysis was done by a third-party which did not seem aware of the treatment&#xD;
      given (single-blind).&#xD;
