      A Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      and preliminary antitumor activity of AK127 in combination with AK104.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a , Phase 1, first-in-human, multicenter, open label, dose escalation and dose&#xD;
      expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of AK127 in combination with AK104 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced and metastatic solid tumours. The study comprises of 2 phases: a dose&#xD;
      escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. Dose escalation for AK127 will occur using the&#xD;
      3+3+3 model given with a fixed regimen of AK104. Dose expansion will open at the discretion&#xD;
      of the Sponsor.&#xD;
