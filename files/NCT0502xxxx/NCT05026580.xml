      Objectives: To examine changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL), pain and function&#xD;
      among patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) participating in digitally delivered&#xD;
      exercise and education treatment for up to 12 or 24 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: An observational longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will include patients who had participated in the digitally delivered exercise and&#xD;
      education treatment program Joint Academy® for 3, 6 , 9 , 12 and if enough patients also for&#xD;
      24 month. We will analyze both cross-sectional samples at each time point and a longitudinal&#xD;
      sample that have participated for at least 12 month, with at least one follow-up in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: We will analyze HRQL with EQ-5D-5L, pain with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0-10 (best&#xD;
      to worst) and function with 30-sec chair stand test (CST) at baseline and at 3, 6, 9,12 and&#xD;
      if possible 24 months during the treatment. Main outcome will be change in level in EQ-5D-5L&#xD;
      dimensions. We will also analyze minimally clinical important changes (improved or not) and&#xD;
      mean changes in EQ-5D-5L index score, pain and 30-sec chair stand test (CST). Logistic&#xD;
      regression models and linear mixed models will be used for analysis. Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed for repeated cross-sectional samples and a longitudinal sample.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      International treatment guidelines recommend exercise, education and weight control (if&#xD;
      needed) as first-line treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA). Still, evidence suggest&#xD;
      that less than 50% of OA patients have participated in first-line treatment before getting&#xD;
      joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several observational and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that exercise therapy is&#xD;
      effective in reducing pain, improving physical function and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQL) at clinically important levels in the short-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is rated lower by people with OA compared to norm populations and measures of&#xD;
      well-being are increasingly used as outcomes in health interventions. Face-to-face first-line&#xD;
      OA treatment following the Better Care for persons with OsteoArthritis (BOA) or Good Life&#xD;
      with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D) initiatives seem to have small but clinically&#xD;
      significant effects on HRQL immediate after intervention, at six month and with maintained&#xD;
      improvements at one year for knee but not hip OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digitally delivered first-line OA treatment program Joint Academy® (JA) was developed in&#xD;
      Sweden in 2016 in an attempt to improve implementation and adherence to guidelines. The&#xD;
      program is based on evidence from BOA. Initial observational studies show that both patients&#xD;
      with hip and knee OA had clinically important improvements in pain and function at six weeks&#xD;
      with sustained improvements up to 48 weeks of treatment. Further, HRQL dimensions mobility&#xD;
      and pain/discomfort significantly improved after six weeks, while others did not (self-care,&#xD;
      usual activities, and anxiety/depression. However, the long-term change in HRQL during&#xD;
      digitally delivered first-line OA treatment is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to identify changes in HRQL, pain and function, during up to12 months of&#xD;
      digitally delivered first-line treatment. A second aim was to examine if changes differs&#xD;
      between hip/knee and women/men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Outcomes were collected at start and at standardized time points during the&#xD;
      treatment. They were chosen based on the International Consortium for Health Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Standard Set for Hip &amp; Knee Osteoarthritis (ICHOM), self-entered using the&#xD;
      digital program interface and stored in the JA database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRQL was evaluated every third month using the EuroQol-5 dimensions five level index&#xD;
      questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), which is a generic quality of life measurement tool. The&#xD;
      questionnaire covers five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain&#xD;
      or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. The levels of severity range from no problems (1)&#xD;
      to extreme problems/unable to (5) and are recorded for each of the five dimensions. The raw&#xD;
      scores are also converted to a single EQ-5D index value using a scoring algorithm (British&#xD;
      tariff was used) ranging from -0.594 (worst perceived health state) to 1.00 (best perceived&#xD;
      health state). A change of ≥0.03 in the index was considered as minimally clinical important&#xD;
      change (MCIC) according to a comprehensive review of musculoskeletal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint pain was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), with the instruction Mark on&#xD;
      this scale how much pain you had the last week in your hip/knee, followed by a 0-10 scale&#xD;
      where 0 indicates No pain and 10 indicates Maximum pain. A difference of 15 of 100 for&#xD;
      absolute improvement (slightly or moderately) is considered as MCIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical function was assessed with the 30-s chair-stand test (CST) performed by the&#xD;
      participant with the help of an instruction video with a coupled visual timer. The patient&#xD;
      entered the performed number of repetitions after each test. The 30-s CST is recommended by&#xD;
      the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) as a performance-based functional&#xD;
      test for knee and hip OA (Dobson 2013). A difference of two rises is considered as MCIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the participants' overall health and characteristics such as OA location (hip/knee),&#xD;
      age, sex, educational level (), height, weight and medical conditions (xx) were collected at&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;

        Participants join the digital OA treatment program via online advertisements and campaigns&#xD;
        placed on search engines and social networks, or by recommendations by their local&#xD;
        physiotherapist or orthopaedic surgeon. Procedure for inclusion and exclusion has been&#xD;
        described above. Data will be extracted from the Joint Academy (JA) database registry for&#xD;
        Swedish patients who had started their treatment Janurary 1st 2019 or after. A&#xD;

        with all available participants with data at baseline and/or 3, 6, (9), and 12 month (+- 6&#xD;
        weeks) and one longitudinal sample including those who had data at baseline and at 12&#xD;
