    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI90 response assessments are based on at least 90% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <measure>Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 (clear or almost clear with at least 2-category improvement from Baseline) response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) measures the overall psoriasis severity following a 5-point scale (0-4), where scale 0= clear, no signs of psoriasis; presence of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, scale 1= almost clear, no thickening; normal to pink coloration; no to minimal focal scaling, scale 2= mild thickening, pink to light red coloration and predominately fine scaling, 3= moderate, clearly distinguishable to moderate thickening; dull to bright red, clearly distinguishable to moderate thickening; moderate scaling and 4= severe thickening with hard edges; bright to deep dark red coloration; severe/coarse scaling covering almost all or all lesions.&#xD;
IGA response (Clear or Almost Clear) is defined as clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a two-category improvement from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Patient Symptom Diary (PSD) (P-SIM) response for itch at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, the PSD (further published as P-SIM) is used to assess key symptoms relevant to patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Site staff trains the participants on the use of the electronic device used to collect electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) diary data at the Screening Visit, following which the device is dispensed to the participant for home use until the Week 16 Visit. The ePRO diary is completed on a daily basis from Screening to the Week 16 Visit. PSD score for itch is an average of daily values over the week prior to the visit. Each item is assessed for severity/impact level over a recall period of the past 24 hours on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 means no symptoms or impact and 10 means very severe symptoms or worst impact. The response variable is characterized in terms of cumulative percent of participants demonstrating an improvement above the prespecified 4-point threshold at Week 16.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The scalp IGA will be assessed for all study participants at Baseline. The scalp IGA will be completed by the Investigator electronically. Only study participants with a scalp IGA score &gt;0 at Baseline will have the scalp IGA assessed at later visits as specified in the Schedule of Activities (SoA).

    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a skin disease-specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect study participants' health related QOL. This instrument asks study participants about symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. It has been shown to be valid and reproducible in study participants with PSO. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating lower health related QOL. A 4-point change in the DLQI total score has been reported to be meaningful for the study participant (within-subject minimal important difference); while a DLQI total score of 0 or 1 indicates no impact of the disease on health related QOL.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to End of Safety Follow-Up (up to Week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as those AEs that have a start date on or following the first dose of IMP.</description>

Results in death&#xD;
Is life-threatening&#xD;
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
Results in persistent disability/incapacity&#xD;
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring the severity of depression. The PHQ-9 scores for depression range from 0 to 27 with higher scores indicating a worse state. A score of 5 to 9 is considered to be minimal symptoms of depression. A score of 10 to 14 is considered minor depression, dysthymia, or mild major depression. A score of 15 to 19 is considered to indicate moderately severe major depression, and a score ≥20 is considered to be severe major depression. Change from Baseline is derived as post-Baseline score minus Baseline score, where a positive change indicates worsening and a negative score indicates improvement</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
