      The study aims to further demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the FemoSeal™ VCS in&#xD;
      achieving hemostasis following percutaneous endovascular procedures performed via the common&#xD;
      femoral artery (CFA) access site. This study is conducted in real-world subjects according to&#xD;
      the FemoSeal™ VCS instruction for use (IFU), as part of the study device post-market clinical&#xD;
      follow up surveillance plan and prospective clinical evidence collection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed Post-Market Clinical Follow-up study is a Prospective, Multi-Center,&#xD;
      Observational Study, aiming to further demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      FemoSealTM VCS in achieving hemostasis of common femoral artery (CFA) access site in&#xD;
      real-world subjects undergoing percutaneous endovascular procedures. 230 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at up to 6 European sites. Follow-ups are scheduled at 30 days (±7 days) by hospital&#xD;
      visit or telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor shall provide training and the necessary guidelines to assist each investigation&#xD;
      site on the data collection in the eCRF. Each site is responsible to report the available&#xD;
      data requested by the CIP. In order to ensure data quality, validation &amp; consistency, edit&#xD;
      checks will be designed during database development. Data Management team and the study&#xD;
      monitors will be responsible to review the data and raise queries in the eCRF. Data cleaning&#xD;
      will be done in regular intervals specified in Data Monitoring Plan. The final clean&#xD;
      standardised datasets will be available prior to database lock for data analysis. An audit&#xD;
      trail logging all data entered and edited is available within the EDC system. All source&#xD;
      documents are maintained in the hospital files ready for inspection by the Sponsor and&#xD;
      regulatory authorities upon request. The Sponsor will inform the investigator of the time&#xD;
      period for retaining these records as per applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored at all stages of its development by study monitors appointed by&#xD;
      the sponsor. Study monitors are designated as Sponsor representatives and are assigned to&#xD;
      oversee the conduct and progress of the study at each site in accordance with the Monitoring&#xD;
      Plan established for this clinical investigation.&#xD;
