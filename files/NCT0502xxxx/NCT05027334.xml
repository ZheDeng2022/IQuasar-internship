  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a global health emergency, since its prevalence has become alarming&#xD;
      in many countries in the previous years. Because of the increasing healthcare requirement, it&#xD;
      has also progressively become an economic burden for every country. From the International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation (IDF) Atlas (International Diabetes Federation, 2015), 415 million people&#xD;
      worldwide were estimated to have DM in 2015 and this figure is expected to rise to 642&#xD;
      million in 2040. DM contributed to 5 million adult deaths globally in 2015. Mauritius has one&#xD;
      of the highest DM prevalence in the world (24.3% prevalence for ages 20 - 79) for 2015&#xD;
      (International Diabetes Federation, 2015). 2,932 adult died due to Diabetes, and the average&#xD;
      cost of DM related problems amount to 2 billion rupees per year. The Mauritius Non&#xD;
      Communicable Diseases Survey (Ministry of Health and Quality of Life, 2015) reports an&#xD;
      estimated 257,442 people between the ages of 25 and 74 with Diabetes in Mauritius. A high&#xD;
      prevalence of pre-diabetes is also noted, which may subsequently result in diabetes and heart&#xD;
      disease, if not appropriately managed. The DM epidemic has a significant impact locally and&#xD;
      globally, calling for urgent remedial strategies to curb the spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that patient's self-care including monitoring of blood glucose improve&#xD;
      glycemic control (Allemann et al, 2009; Skeie et al, 2009; Istepanian et al, 2009). Patients&#xD;
      are currently empowered through face to face counselling, websites, social media and other&#xD;
      state of the art technologies. The use of smart phones for self-monitoring of blood glucose&#xD;
      has shown to have substantial beneficial effects (Liang et al, 2011; Pal et al 2014). This&#xD;
      project aims at using mobile technologies to instil behavioural changes in people living with&#xD;
      DM and pre-diabetes in an attempt to alleviate the long term problems associated with DM.&#xD;
      More precisely, it will constitute the development of an autonomous system for&#xD;
      self-management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in Mauritius. The prototype will&#xD;
      be tested for feasibility among patients with T2DM and pre-diabetes. It is expected that the&#xD;
      proposed system will help to reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system in&#xD;
      Mauritius through patient empowerment and improved self-care in the long run.&#xD;

      he global burden of diabetes mellitus is an issue of increasing concern globally. The social&#xD;
      and economic burden is soaring, pushing scientist to discover alternative options to reduce&#xD;
      the burden. It is estimated that the burden is worse in countries with limited resources such&#xD;
      as Mauritius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mauritius has one of the highest DM prevalence in the world (24.3% prevalence for ages 20 -&#xD;
      79) for 2015 (International Diabetes Federation, 2015). 2,932 adult died due to diabetes, and&#xD;
      the average cost of DM related problems amount to 2 billion rupees per year. The Mauritius&#xD;
      Non Communicable Diseases Survey (Ministry of Health and Quality of Life, 2015) reports an&#xD;
      estimated 257,442 people between the ages of 25 and 74 with Diabetes in Mauritius. A high&#xD;
      prevalence of pre-diabetes is also noted, which may subsequently result in diabetes and heart&#xD;
      disease, if not appropriately managed. The DM epidemic has a significant impact locally and&#xD;
      globally, calling for urgent remedial strategies to curb the spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that patient's self-care including monitoring of blood glucose improve&#xD;
      glycemic control (Allemann et al, 2009; Skeie et al, 2009; Istepanian et al, 2009). Patients&#xD;
      are currently empowered through face to face counselling, websites, social media and other&#xD;
      state of the art technologies. The use of smart phones for self-monitoring of blood glucose&#xD;
      has shown to have substantial beneficial effects (Liang et al, 2011; Pal et al 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect on glycaemic levels among patients living with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes who are using a newly designed mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure the change in HbA1c after 3 months of using the application Compare secondary&#xD;
      outcomes such as weight and BMI following the use of the application Assess the perception of&#xD;
      patients using the digital tool and relate behavioural changes with the use of the&#xD;
      application&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single arm prospective non randomised study is proposed. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      using adverts in the local newspapers and social media. Interested participants will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility and given the mobile application to use. They will be advised to&#xD;
      record their daily fasting and post-prandial blood glucose as well as their levels of&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following clinical and biomarkers will be checked before and after the use of the&#xD;
      intervention: HbA1c, FBS, weight, BMI and blood pressure. The duration of follow up will be&#xD;
      3-6 months. An investigator designed questionnaire will be used to evaluate the use of the&#xD;
      mobile app.&#xD;
