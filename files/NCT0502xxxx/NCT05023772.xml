  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to combine two complementary modes of treatment, spinal&#xD;
      interstitial laser ablation and stereotactic spine radiosurgery (SSRS) for the treatment for&#xD;
      spinal tumors near the spinal cord with an objective to improve tumor control, improve pain&#xD;
      control, preserve function, and improve quality of life. We will also assess how effective&#xD;
      these combined modes of treatment are in patients with spinal metastasis with an epidural&#xD;
      component.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Documenting rate of local control in patients who have received this combined treatment&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Documenting safety of MRI compatible hardware for MRI based image guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determining the accuracy of the MRI-based image guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine local control at 1, 3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 months, and to compare to a&#xD;
           historical control where patients received only SSRS at these time points and at 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To document the extent of epidural tumor regression at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calculate decrease in epidural tumor volume (by volumetric measurements using Brain&#xD;
                Lab Elements software)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calculate increase in thecal sac patency (by volumetric measurements using Brain&#xD;
                Lab Elements software and according to Bilsky method&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine overall survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess changes in muscle strength, location and severity of spinal-related pain,&#xD;
           sensory function, ability to ambulate, and neurological grading at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18,&#xD;
           and 24 months compared with pretreatment baselines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the effect of treatment on quality of life, measured at 1 month and every 3&#xD;
           months after with validated outcome measure tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To describe adverse side effects after treatment and to descriptively correlate those&#xD;
           effects with radiographic findings, pain control, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>We are measuring quality of life with the Health Survey that will be assessed during each follow up Clinic visit. The participants are asked questions that measure eight health domains to assess physical and mental health. Physical health-related domains include: General health, Physical Functioning, Role Physical, and Body Pain. Mental health-related scales include Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health. A 3 and 5 point Likert scale is used in the survey. Two summary scores of the physical and mental health using weighted means of the eight domains. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize pain relief and quality of life at each follow up visit, which will be the changes in scores from baseline to each assessment visit. Time to maximum pain relief will be the time from the day of thermal ablation until the lowest pain score for average pain after radiotherapy.</description>

    <description>We are measuring quality of life with the Brief Pain Inventory Survey that will be assessed during each follow up Clinic visit. The patient survey will be assessed to measure postoperative response to treatment. Participants are asked to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. Severity of pain, including the pain location, worst pain in the last 24 hours, least pain in the last 24 hours, pain on average and pain right now. Range 0-10: a score of 0 would mean no pain and a score of 10 means the pain is as bad as you can imagine. Pain medications, amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours, and impact of pain on daily function, including general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life, and range 0-10.</description>
