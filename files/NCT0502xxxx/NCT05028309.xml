      The overall objective of this application is to investigate the effects of obesity on lung&#xD;
      function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in older obese adults as compared with older adults&#xD;
      without obesity, using a novel probe for mechanically unloading the thorax at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise. The investigators will use 1) continuous negative cuirass pressure, and 2) assisted&#xD;
      biphasic cuirass ventilation to decrease obesity-related effects in older obese adults. Our&#xD;
      approach will be to examine respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE with and&#xD;
      without mechanical unloading in older obese men and women (65-75 yr), including those with&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms (defined by a score of 1 or 2 on the modified Medical Research Council&#xD;
      Dyspnea Scale), as compared with older adults without obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The investigators will test the following hypotheses in older adults with and&#xD;
      without obesity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) Obesity will decrease respiratory function but to a greater extent in older obese&#xD;
      adults with respiratory symptoms, (as evidenced by altered pulmonary function and breathing&#xD;
      mechanics at rest); Aim 2) Obesity will decrease exercise tolerance (as evidenced by peak&#xD;
      V•O2 in ml/min/kg, i.e., physical fitness), but not cardiorespiratory fitness (as evidenced&#xD;
      by peak V•O2 in % of predicted based on ideal body wt), except in older obese adults with&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms where both may be reduced during graded cycle ergometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3) Obesity will increase DOE but to a greater extent in older obese adults with&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms as evidenced by increased ratings of perceived breathlessness (sensory &amp;&#xD;
      affective dimensions) during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4) Mechanical unloading of the thorax will improve respiratory function, submaximal&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, and DOE in older obese adults, but to a greater extent in older obese&#xD;
      adults with respiratory symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 40% of older adults (60+ yr) are obese and 30% are overweight. While regular exercise is&#xD;
      an important component in the prevention and treatment of obesity, many older adults with&#xD;
      obesity are unable or unwilling to exercise due to exercise intolerance and/or dyspnea on&#xD;
      exertion (DOE). The Investigators have identified numerous obesity-related respiratory&#xD;
      effects that could influence exercise tolerance and DOE in younger obese adults including&#xD;
      decreased pulmonary function altered respiratory mechanics increased work of breathing and&#xD;
      increased metabolic demands of exercise. The Investigators have also identified many&#xD;
      age-related ventilatory constraints in older adults without obesity. However, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether these obesity-related and aging-related effects combine to reduce exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      impose DOE, or contribute to respiratory symptoms in older obese adults. Respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      in older adults are often wrongly diagnosed as deconditioning and/or cardiopulmonary disease,&#xD;
      placing older obese adults at risk of costly clinical testing, unnecessary treatment, and&#xD;
      potentially a reluctance to exercise, which is counterproductive to weight loss (WL) and the&#xD;
      preservation of functional capacity, thus further diminishing their quality of life. The&#xD;
      respiratory effects of obesity are underappreciated and have not been carefully examined in&#xD;
      older adults, especially older obese adults with &quot;respiratory symptoms&quot; who may experience&#xD;
      even greater respiratory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose that many of the obesity-related respiratory effects in older obese&#xD;
      adults are the result of low lung volume breathing, i.e., a reduction in functional residual&#xD;
      capacity (FRC) at rest (seated upright &amp; supine), and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV)&#xD;
      during exercise. The Investigators suggest that increased fat on the chest wall (i.e.,&#xD;
      abdomen &amp; rib cage) produces low FRC and EELV levels, where breathing limitations like&#xD;
      expiratory flow limitation and enhanced perception of dyspnea are more likely to occur. This&#xD;
      is because older adults have an age-related decline in maximal expiratory flow at low lung&#xD;
      volumes. As such, excess fat on the thorax appears to exert an unfavorable burden on the&#xD;
      older obese adult, particularly during exercise. Our overall hypothesis is that respiratory&#xD;
      limitations, exercise intolerance, DOE, and respiratory symptoms in older obese adults are&#xD;
      due to mechanical loading of the thorax and low lung volume breathing coupled with the&#xD;
      age-related decline in maximal expiratory flow. The Investigators propose to test this&#xD;
      hypothesis with the use of an external cuirass (i.e., a plastic shell over the thorax) to&#xD;
      mechanically unload the chest wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although our laboratory has used modest WL in younger obese women to reduce the effects of&#xD;
      obesity, the mechanisms by which WL (i.e., decreased fat over the entire body) decreases DOE&#xD;
      remain unclear. This may be in part due to our single global assessment of DOE (i.e., sensory&#xD;
      domain only &amp; pre-post WL only), and/or that changes in DOE in the time domain are not in&#xD;
      parallel with WL. To circumvent these limitations of WL, an external cuirass will be used to&#xD;
      mechanically unload the chest wall (includes rib cage &amp; abdomen) in older obese adults. This&#xD;
      will effectively decrease the load on the chest wall thereby increasing FRC at rest and EELV&#xD;
      during exercise (i.e., via continuous negative cuirass pressure), and potentially decreasing&#xD;
      the work of breathing during exercise (i.e., via assisted biphasic cuirass ventilation). This&#xD;
      novel and quantifiable probe will allow us to investigate the effects of obesity in older&#xD;
      adults and their influence on lung function, exercise tolerance, and DOE (sensory &amp; affective&#xD;
      dimensions). The proposed mechanistic studies would lead to a better understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanical effects of obesity in older adults, which could alter testing and treatment&#xD;
      strategies for older obese adults, especially those with exercise intolerance, DOE, and&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this application is to investigate the effects of obesity on lung&#xD;
      function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in older obese adults as compared with older adults&#xD;
      without obesity, using a novel probe for mechanically unloading the thorax at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise. The Investigators will use 1) continuous negative cuirass pressure, and 2) assisted&#xD;
      biphasic cuirass ventilation to decrease obesity-related effects in older obese adults. Our&#xD;

      without mechanical unloading in older obese men and women (65-75 yr), including those with&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms (defined by a score of 1 or 2 on the modified Medical Research Council&#xD;

&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The Investigators will test the following hypotheses in older adults with and&#xD;
      without obesity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) Obesity will decrease respiratory function but to a greater extent in older obese&#xD;

      exercise tolerance, and DOE in older obese adults, but to a greater extent in older obese&#xD;
      adults with respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' long-term objective is to examine the effects of obesity in older obese&#xD;
      adults and provide novel results that could clarify the mechanisms of respiratory&#xD;
      limitations, exercise intolerance, DOE, and/or obesity-related respiratory symptoms in older&#xD;
      obese adults. Thus, these results will have broad and immediate clinical impact on the care&#xD;
      of older adults with obesity, especially those with exercise intolerance, DOE, and/or&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
