        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is male or female aged ≥18 years and ≤65 years at the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             at the Screening Visit, which is confirmed to be negative by urine testing prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). Female subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control&#xD;
             during the study and for a period of 20 weeks after their last dose of the IMP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be in good health (physically and mentally) as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator on the basis of medical history (any chronic and acute illness), physical&#xD;
             examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and laboratory screening tests during the&#xD;
             Screening Period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a body weight of 45 to 90 kg (inclusive) and body mass index (BMI) between&#xD;
             19 and 28 kg/m^2 (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject who is pregnant, or plans to become pregnant during the study, or&#xD;
             lactating, or sexually active with childbearing potential who is not using a medically&#xD;
             accepted birth control method. Male subjects who are planning a partner pregnancy&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving any live (includes attenuated) vaccination within the 8 weeks prior&#xD;
             to Baseline (eg, inactivated influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are allowed but nasal&#xD;
             influenza vaccination is not permitted). Live vaccines are not allowed during the&#xD;
             study or for 20 weeks after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received any investigational drug or experimental procedure within 90 days&#xD;
             or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to IMP administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to any components of the IMP as stated in this&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a current or past history of gastrointestinal ulceration or other&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension, angina,&#xD;
             ischemic heart disease, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, peripheral arterial&#xD;
             disease sufficient to cause symptoms, and/or requires therapy to maintain stable&#xD;
             status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an active infection (eg, sepsis, pneumonia, abscess) or has had a serious&#xD;
             infection (resulting in hospitalization or requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment)&#xD;
             within 6 weeks prior to IMP administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has a history of a positive tuberculosis (TB) test or evidence of&#xD;
             possible TB or latent TB infection at the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has concurrent acute or chronic viral hepatitis B or C or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has 12-lead ECG with changes considered to be clinically significant at&#xD;
             Screening Visit and Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has active neoplastic disease or history of neoplastic disease within 5 years&#xD;
             of Screening Visit (except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ that has been definitively treated with standard of care)&#xD;
