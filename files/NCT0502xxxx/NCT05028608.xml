  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have symptoms caused by hormonal&#xD;
      changes, such as hot flashes. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to take,&#xD;
      researchers do clinical studies to better understand its safety and what happens to the&#xD;
      treatment in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers want to learn more about a new substance called elinzanetant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elinzanetant, the study treatment, was developed to treat symptoms caused by hormonal&#xD;
      changes, such as hot flashes. Carbamazepine is a drug that is already available for doctors&#xD;
      to prescribe, for example against seizures. Midazolam is a treatment that is already&#xD;
      available for doctors to prescribe as a sedative (calming treatment) or to help people sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers will learn how much elinzanetant gets into the participants'&#xD;
      blood when taken with or without carbamazepine. They will also get to know if taking&#xD;
      elinzanetant will affect the amount of midazolam in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will all take elinzanetant as capsules, carbamazepine as tablets and&#xD;
      midazolam as a liquid by mouth. On some days, they will take only 1 treatment of midazolam or&#xD;
      carbamazepine or only elinzanetant. On other days, they will take two study treatments. On 3&#xD;
      different days during the study, the participants will take elinzanetant with midazolam,&#xD;
      elinzanetant with carbamazepine and midazolam with carbamazepine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be in the study for up to 10 weeks. But, the entire study will last&#xD;
      about 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, all of the participants will stay at the study site for 2 periods, period 1&#xD;
      with 9 overnight stays and period 2 with 22 overnight stays at the study site. In addition,&#xD;
      there will be two ambulatory visits, one before joining the study and one at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be collected. The doctors will also check the participants'&#xD;
      heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG). The participants will answer questions about&#xD;
      how they are feeling and about any medications they are taking.&#xD;
