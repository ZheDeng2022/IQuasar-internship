      This study aims to evaluate the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to detect circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Vietnam with high mortality rate. Patients&#xD;
      at early stages undergo radical gastrectomy with curative intent, but the remaining tumor&#xD;
      cells, termed as minimal residual disease (MRD), can later cause relapse. Conventional&#xD;
      methods to monitor MRD such as imaging and blood tests for biomarkers such as CEA are not&#xD;
      sensitive and specific enough. ctDNA has recently emerged as a promising noninvasive marker&#xD;
      with high accuracy to monitor MRD and detect relapse in many cancers such as breast and&#xD;
      colorectal cancers. However, its application in gastric cancer has not been extensively&#xD;
      evaluated. Therefore, this study aims to use advanced NGS technologies to detect ctDNA in&#xD;
      liquid biopsy as a biomarker to monitor MRD after radical gastrectomy.&#xD;
