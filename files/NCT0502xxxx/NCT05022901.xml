  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the study will be treated with Melphalan/HDS and will receive up to 6 total&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and effects of the treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline Phase: Screening assessments will be conducted within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
      eligibility date to determine each patient's overall eligibility and baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. These assessments will include medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), vital signs, full&#xD;
      hematology and biochemistry, Quality of Life questionnaire, radiologic assessments of&#xD;
      baseline disease status and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a history of liver surgery or major vasculature surgery, an angiogram&#xD;
      evaluation of their vasculature will be performed for compatibility for Percutaneous Hepatic&#xD;
      Perfusion (PHP) prior to confirming eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility date: This is the date on which all screening assessments have been completed and&#xD;
      the patient is determined to be eligible for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase: The first study treatment should occur within 14 days of the eligibility&#xD;
      date. Eligible patients will be treated with Melphalan/HDS 3.0 mg/kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW).&#xD;
      Melphalan/HDS treatment will be administered every 6 weeks for a total of 6 cycles with an&#xD;
      acceptable delay of another 2 weeks before the next planned treatment to allow for recovery&#xD;
      of melphalan-related toxicity, if needed. Tumor response will be assessed every 12 weeks (+ 2&#xD;
      weeks) until disease progression. Patients with progressive disease (PD) will be discontinued&#xD;
      from study treatment, and will continue to be followed until death. Melphalan/HDS treatment&#xD;
      will also be discontinued if recovery from treatment related toxicity requires more than 8&#xD;
      weeks from the last treatment. An end-of-treatment visit (EOT) will be conducted&#xD;
      approximately 6 to 8 weeks following the final study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase: Once the patient has completed the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit in&#xD;
      accordance with the schedule of events they will enter the follow-up phase. If the disease&#xD;
      has not progressed at the EOT, the patient will need to continue with disease assessment&#xD;
      visits every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) until disease progression is documented. After disease&#xD;
      progression, follow-up is to be by phone every 3 months for survival status until death.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must weigh ≥ 35 kg (due to possible size limitations with respect to&#xD;
             percutaneous catheterization of the femoral artery and vein using the Delcath Hepatic&#xD;
             Delivery System).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. 50% or less histologically or cytologically-proven ocular melanoma metastases in the&#xD;
             parenchyma of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disease in the liver must be measurable by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of limited extrahepatic disease on preoperative radiological studies is&#xD;
             acceptable if the life-threatening component of disease is in the liver. Limited&#xD;
             extrahepatic disease is defined in this protocol as follows: metastasis in bone,&#xD;
             subcutaneous, lung or lymph nodes that is amenable to resection or radiation and has a&#xD;
             defined treatment plan. Patients with extra-hepatic tumor burden which does not have a&#xD;
             defined treatment plan (i.e. monitor or is unable to be resected or radiated) must not&#xD;
             be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Scans used to determine eligibility (CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI of&#xD;
             the liver) must be performed within 28 days prior to eligibility. An MRI of the liver&#xD;
             is required at screening to validate that CT accurately reflects the extent of disease&#xD;
             in the liver. For patients with MRI intolerance, a 3-phase liver CT is to be done in&#xD;
             place of liver MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must not have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization,&#xD;
             radioembolization, or immunoembolization for their malignancy within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             treatment and must have recovered from all side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic&#xD;
             interventions except those listed in Appendix B of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients receiving anti programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy such as&#xD;
             pembrolizumab or nivolumab, or human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 blocking&#xD;
             antibody such as ipilimumab must have completed treatment 8 weeks prior to study&#xD;

             must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must have a platelet count &gt; 100,000/µL, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 gm/dL, white blood&#xD;
