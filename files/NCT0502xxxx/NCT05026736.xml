  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial evaluates the effect of sintilimab in treating patients with angiosarcoma&#xD;
      that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced), has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic), or has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as sintilimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving sintilimab may help to&#xD;
      control angiosarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of sintilimab in subjects with angiosarcoma (progression- free&#xD;
      rate PFR at 9 cycles by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), stable disease rate (SDR), progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QOL), safety and duration of response&#xD;
      (DOR) of sintilimab in subjects with angiosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the correlation between biomarkers in tumor tissue and efficacy, including but&#xD;
      not restricted to PD-L1 expression level, transcriptome sequencing, single-cell sequencing,&#xD;
      and multicolor immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the correlation between biomarkers in peripheral blood and efficacy,&#xD;
      including but not restricted to soluble PD-L1, circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      (ctDNA), and cytokine analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sintilimab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may continue to receive treatment at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, and then&#xD;
      every 60 days for up to 3 years.&#xD;
