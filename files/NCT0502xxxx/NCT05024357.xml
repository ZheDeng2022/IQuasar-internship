  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a key clinical research project approved by the Clinical Research Center of&#xD;
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi 'an Jiaotong University.Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (allo-HSCT) are routinely used in patients with philadelpha-positive lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (Ph+ALL). However, TKI maintenance therapy post-HSCT remains controversial. In this study,&#xD;
      Ph+ALL patients are enrolled and given dasatinib combined with chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      allo-HSCT. Then patients in the group A continuing to use dasatinib for 1 year is compared&#xD;
      with those in the group B receiving dasatinib for 6 months after HSCT. The measurable&#xD;
      residual disease (MRD), complete remission (CR), overall survival (OS), disease free survival&#xD;
      (DFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) will&#xD;
      be observed to determine the optimal duration of TKI maintenance therapy post-HSCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 25% of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are associated with t (9;&#xD;
      22), positive philadelphia chromosome (Ph+ ALL), in whom BCR/ABL fusion gene can be detected&#xD;
      in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Although current treatment strategies using tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib combined with chemotherapy have achieved high&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) rates, the duration of remission is short, and most Ph+ ALL patients&#xD;
      relapse within 2 years. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)&#xD;
      bridging to CR remains the only strategy to cure Ph+ ALL. However, TKI maintenance therapy&#xD;
      post-HSCT remains controversial. In this study, Ph+ALL patients are enrolled. The&#xD;
      participants will receive dasatinib combined with induction and consolidation chemotherapy to&#xD;
      obtain molecular remission and then undergo allo-HSCT. After the above treatments, the&#xD;
      patients will be randomly divided into two groups. The subjects in the group A will continue&#xD;
      to use dasatinib for 1 year, while the patients in the group B receive dasatinib for 6 months&#xD;
      post-HSCT. The measurable residual disease (MRD), CR, overall survival (OS), disease free&#xD;
      survival (DFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and the incidence of graft versus host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) will be observed to determine the optimal duration of TKI maintenance therapy&#xD;
      post-HSCT.&#xD;
