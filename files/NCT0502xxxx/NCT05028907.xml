  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Punctal stenosis is an important etiological factor that should be considered when assessing&#xD;
      patients with epiphora. Anatomically, acquired punctal stenosis is a condition in which the&#xD;
      external opening of the lacrimal canaliculus is narrowed or occluded and also can be&#xD;
      accompanied by canalicular ductal stenosis.1,2. Defining an anatomical clear cut-off value&#xD;
      for punctal stenosis is difficult due to wide variations in patients' demographics.&#xD;
      Clinically, punctal stenosis is defined as a punctum size restricting tear drainage in the&#xD;
      absence of distal tear drainage abnormalities.2 Acquired punctal stenosis can be&#xD;
      involutional, inflammatory, infectious or idiopathic.3,4 Inflammatory endogenous causes&#xD;
      include chronic blepharitis, dry eye disease and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.3 Exogenous&#xD;
      noxious stimuli may be chemical such as topical or systemic medications, or physical as&#xD;
      irradiation or mechanical. The harmful effect of topical medications such as antiglaucomatous&#xD;
      drops, dexamesathone, mitomycin-C and the systemic medications such 5-Fluorouracil or&#xD;
      paclitaxel may be related to the medication themselves, the preservatives as benzalkonium&#xD;
      chloride in the commercial preparations, or duration of treatment with those&#xD;
      medications.3,5-9 The basic ultra-structure response to those various noxious stimuli is&#xD;
      early punctal occlusion by edema which is followed by conjunctival overgrowth, keratinization&#xD;
      of punctal walls and cicatricial punctal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although spectral-domain OCT is still being widely used on the retina, its anterior segment&#xD;
      module is considered a new modality for imaging of proximal lacrimal excretory passage and&#xD;
      tears meniscus height (TMH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed the ability of using AS-OCT to differentiate between various punctal&#xD;
      causes of epiphora and improve the understanding of the lacrimal punctal structure in&#xD;
      vivo.10-12 The aim of this work is to evaluate the role of AS-OCT in evaluation the punctal&#xD;
      changes after treatment by antibiotics and steroids.&#xD;
