  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study of Phase Ib/II study to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Envafolimab combinded with Lenvatinib in the treatment of subjects with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. The primary hypothesis of this study is that subjects will have a better&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR) when treated with Envafolimab plus Lenvatinib than SOC.&#xD;
