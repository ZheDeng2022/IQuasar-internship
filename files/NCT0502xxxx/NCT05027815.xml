  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19&#xD;
      inflammatory syndrome, the administration of Treg cells is a novel treatment complementary to&#xD;
      other pharmacologic interventions that potentially can reduce lung inflammation, promote lung&#xD;
      tissue repair, and significantly improve clinical outcomes. This trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of a single IV dose of cePolyTregs given to ARDS patients with COVID-19 inflammatory&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tregs are a subset of CD4+ T cells that function to maintain immune system balance. The&#xD;
      function of Tregs in maintaining immune tolerance can be harnessed through Treg cell therapy&#xD;
      for treating various immunological diseases. Adoptive Tregs therapies have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in dozens of animal models, including models of virus-induced ARDS. This is a Phase&#xD;
      1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cePolyTregs in subjects with ARDS&#xD;
      associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study is an open-label Phase 1 study to assess&#xD;
      escalating doses of cePolyTregs administered as a single IV dose. The study will include up&#xD;
      to 3 cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects/cohort followed for a total of 12 weeks. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive standard of care treatment for COVID-19, including dexamethasone per institutional&#xD;
      guidelines and other approved therapies for ARDS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection per&#xD;
      institutional guidelines.&#xD;
