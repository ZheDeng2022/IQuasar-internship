      Almonds are a rich matrix of different nutrients with demonstrated benefits on immune system.&#xD;
      This proposal examines the effect of regular consumption of almonds on innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune system in healthy individuals with overweight regularly consuming a Western-style diet&#xD;
      and unhealthy snacks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last months, with the whole world grappling with COVID-19 and because like in many&#xD;
      other diseases, the host immune system determines the progress of COVID-19 and the severity,&#xD;
      there is a frantic race for finding treatment strategies based on current knowledge until&#xD;
      effective vaccine is developed. Therefore, the modulation of inflammatory response and&#xD;
      cytokine production using immunonutrition makes more sense than ever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The almond is a tree nut, rich in fiber, vitamin E, biotin, minerals such as magnesium and&#xD;
      phytonutrients, specifically flavonoids, plant sterols, phenolic acids and could have a&#xD;
      potential beneficial role in immune system. However, beyond its beneficial role and&#xD;
      down-lowering specific circulating cytokines in low-grade chronic inflammatory diseases, the&#xD;
      role of almond on both innate and adaptive immune system has not been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that regular consumption of almonds will contribute to&#xD;
      strengthening the immune system through the modulation of specific circulating miRNAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of almond consumption on the maturation of&#xD;
      innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, the insvestigators aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the effect of regular consumption of almonds in the context of a Western-style&#xD;
           diet on: a) innate immune system through the analysis of other blood cell populations&#xD;
           including monocytes and lymphocyte's subsets (T-cells, B-cells). b) adaptive immune&#xD;
           system assessed by: b.1) circulating inflammatory markers and b.2) ex-vivo ability for&#xD;
           peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) to produce cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c) circulating miRNAs, focusing in immune-related miRNAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether changes in miRNAs mediate the effect of almonds on ILCs activity&#xD;
           and the other innate and adaptive immune system indicators analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results would enhance understanding of the role of almonds in immune function,&#xD;
      to establish the basis of new research for the promotion of the health benefits of nuts in&#xD;
      immune-related diseases and facilitate the use of personalized nutrition to improve human&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
