  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of two different therapeutic bands in&#xD;
      symptomatic rotator cuff tendinopathy. One of the tapes was kinesio tape and the other was&#xD;
      dynamic tape. The study was in a parallel group randomized controlled trial design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to compare the effectiveness of dynamic taping and kinesio taping&#xD;
      combined with a rehabilitation program on the symptomatic shoulder in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT). The study was carried out on 60 patients who&#xD;
      applied to Muğla Training and Research Hospital Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      outpatient clinic with symptoms of RCT. The patients were divided into 3 groups by&#xD;
      randomization method. Dynamic taping was applied to the symptomatic shoulder in the first&#xD;
      group and kinesio taping was performed in the second group. The third group was the control&#xD;
      group and no taping was done. A standard rehabilitation program was applied for the&#xD;
      individuals in the whole group. Evaluations were made before and after treatment (6 weeks).&#xD;
      Evaluation parameters were acromiohumeral distance (primary outcome), shoulder joint range of&#xD;
      motion, muscle strength, proprioception measurements, and function evaluations. The&#xD;
      acromiohumeral distance was measured by the radiologist, and all other measurements and&#xD;
      treatments were performed by the physiotherapist. Standard goniometer was used for shoulder&#xD;
      joint range of motion measurement, manual muscle dynamometer was used for muscle strength&#xD;
      measurement, and digital inclinometer was used for proprioception measurement. Timed&#xD;
      arm-shoulder function test was performed for function evaluation. The arm, shoulder, and hand&#xD;
      disability (DASH) questionnaire and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) were used&#xD;
      for the self-function report. The data obtained from the research will be analyzed using the&#xD;
      SPSS program. Statistical significance level will be accepted as p&lt;0.05. In the statistical&#xD;
      difference analysis between groups, one-way ANOVA test will be used for parametric data and&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for non-parametric data.&#xD;

    <measure>Timed Functional Arm and Shoulder Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in shoulder function at 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>The test includes 3 steps. 1) Hand to head and back: this test is timed for 30 seconds. Each time the patient touches the back of his or her head, it counts as 1 repetition. 2) Wall wash outward and inward: this test is timed for 60 seconds in each direction. 3) Gallon-jug lift: this test is timed for 30 seconds. Starting counter height should be 36 inches, and the shelf should be 20 inches above the counter (56 inches off the floor). Begin with a full gallon jug on the counter. Lift the jug to touch the shelf and return to start. Every time the jug touches the shelf, it counts as 1 repetition. Record the score.</description>

    <measure>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in DASH scores at 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>DASH questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire that looks at the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities. This questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire that patients can rate difficulty and interference with daily life on a 5 point Likert scale. In DASH higher scores indicate a greater level of disability and severity, whereas, lower scores indicate a lower level of disability. The score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in WORC scores at 6 week</time_frame>
    <description>the WORC Index, is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire, evaluating the change in symptoms and functional ability, specific to a RC tendinopathy. Each question uses a visual analogue scale (VAS) - which is a straight line, representing a 100-point scale, ranging from 0-100. The maximum score (21items) is 2100 (worst possible symptoms). Zero (0) represents no symptoms at all. To make the final score more clinically friendly, some minor math is involved. The score can be reported as a percentage by subtracting the total from 2100, dividing by 2100, and multiplying by 100. This give an overall percentage. Total final WORC scores can, therefore, range from 0% ( lowest functional status level) to 100% (the highest functional status).</description>
