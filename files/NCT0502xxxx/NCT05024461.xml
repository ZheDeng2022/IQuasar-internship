  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter observational study of diagnostic test validation (Research Involving the Human&#xD;
      Person, type 3) In addition to the diagnosis by the reference method (nasopharyngeal swab),&#xD;
      the patient will be asked to provide a saliva sample via a salivary spit. The clinical&#xD;
      circumstances of the diagnosis, the age of the patient, the associated terrain (diabetes,&#xD;
      immunodepression, pregnancy) will be noted. The nasopharyngeal and saliva samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed in Cayenne and the remaining samples will be frozen and stored at the CRB before&#xD;
      being sent to the University Hospital of Caen for analysis and concordance verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possibility of repeating tests in the same person more easily due to the absence of pain and&#xD;
      thus reduce the barriers to diagnosis and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possibility of self-sampling, which could simply be sent to the laboratory, which would&#xD;
      relieve the diagnostic sites that mobilize staff and require a fairly heavy organization.&#xD;
      Avoid long waiting lines that can be an obstacle and lead to a renunciation of the diagnosis.&#xD;
