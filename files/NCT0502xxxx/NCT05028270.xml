    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in childhood, with an incidence&#xD;
      of about 1/15,000-20,000, accounting for 4% of all childhood cancers.All patients with&#xD;
      bilateral reticuloblastoma and approximately 10%-15% of children with unilateral disease have&#xD;
      germline mutations that can be passed on to their offspring.In developed countries, the&#xD;
      survival rate is close to 98%. However, due to the limitations of health care in low-income&#xD;
      countries, this proportion is much lower, about 40%. Before the 1990s, retinoblastoma was&#xD;
      mainly treated with enucleation and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). However, these&#xD;
      methods are associated with many complications, including vision loss and serious side&#xD;
      effects. At present, the first-line conservative treatment of retinoblastoma has changed from&#xD;
      EBRT and enucleation to Intravenous chemotherapy (IVC) or intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC),&#xD;
      and it has been consolidated through focal treatment. There are two different surgical&#xD;
      procedures for intra-arterial chemotherapy, namely balloon technique and microcatheter&#xD;
      technique. We observe their effects through a retrospective case-control study.&#xD;

    <description>The femoral artery is introduced after the patient is fully anesthetized. First, the 5F-VETERBRAL is introduced under the guidance of the guidance. The common carotid artery and internal carotid artery will be received laterally. After whole-body heparinization, micro-catheter and guide wire technology are used. In the figure below, the proximal end of the 4mm super-form occlusion ball is marked far away from the eye, plugged and sealed, and the guide tube is pushed around in the internal carotid artery. When the occlusion is finished, the internal carotid artery and the ophthalmic artery are not accompanied far away, and the plot is good. The guiding catheter drives the injection of drugs, topotecar, and topotecan for 5 minutes (the suction balloon is opened and blocked, and the infusion is continuous) to complete the infusion.</description>

    <description>The tip of the Marathon microcatheter is placed at the opening of the ophthalmic artery. After the contrast agent is confirmed by hand, the chemotherapeutic drugs The femoral artery is introduced after the patient is fully anesthetized. First, the 5F-VETERBRAL is introduced under the guidance of the guidance. Maphalan, carboplatin, and topotecan are injected sequentially for 30 minutes. Make sure that the tip position of the catheter is not maintained during the injection process. verb: move. After the operation is completed, the blocking balloon is pulled out under the guidance of the guide wire, the arterial sheath is removed, and the femoral artery puncture point is pressed to stop bleeding.</description>
