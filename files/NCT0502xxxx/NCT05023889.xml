      The study will consist of a baseline screening period and a 24-month treatment period.&#xD;
      Eligible patient will receive patisiran administered as an IV infusion once every 21 days for&#xD;
      a 24-month period. During the 24-month treatment period study patients will undergo&#xD;
      assessments for efficacy and/or safety as outlined in the schedule of assessments with key&#xD;
      efficacy assessments being performed prior to the first dose and proceeding as outlined in&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days administered as an IV infusion over 70 minutes (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by approximately 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion) by a controlled infusion device.&#xD;
All patients in this study will be premedicated prior to dosing with patisiran. Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.&#xD;
The first dose of study drug (week 1) will be administered under the supervision of site personnel. After the first dose of patisiran, patients should return to the site for patisiran dosing once every 21 days or receive the patisiran infusions at a local infusion center by a healthcare professional trained on the Protocol, administration of premedication, and patisiran infusion. Patient must receive a dose of interventional drug within the dosing window (±3 days).</description>
