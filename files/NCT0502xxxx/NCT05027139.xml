  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if zanidatamab when given with evorpacept (ALX148) is&#xD;
      safe and can treat patients with advanced (locally advanced [inoperable] and/or metastatic)&#xD;
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will first evaluate the safety and tolerability and establish the&#xD;
      recommended doses (RDs) of zanidatamab in combination with evorpacept (ALX148). Part 2 of the&#xD;
      study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of zanidatamab plus evorpacept&#xD;
      (ALX148) at the RD levels in indication-specific expansion cohorts.&#xD;
