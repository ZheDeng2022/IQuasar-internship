  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Manipulation of the gut microbiota through dietary modification affects brain function, with&#xD;
      improvement in patients with cognitive disorders. Combined effect of nutritional intervention&#xD;
      with Mediterranean diet and probiotics with potentially healthy growth of germ, affect the&#xD;
      evolution of mild cognitive impairment, by the modulation of components related with the axis&#xD;
      microbiota-gut-brain: neuropeptides, short-chain fatty acids, markers for oxidative stress&#xD;
      and inflammation.&#xD;
