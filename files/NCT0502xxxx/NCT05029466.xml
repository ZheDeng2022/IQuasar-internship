  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if psilocybin, an investigational drug, is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. Researchers also want to know if psilocybin can improve symptoms of depression.&#xD;
      This study will see if psilocybin is safe and well tolerated by tracking changes in suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts and behaviour, monitoring if any participants choose to stop participating in the&#xD;
      study, and measuring any serious side effects, as well as how long they take to resolve. This&#xD;
      study will also see if depression symptoms improve (or worsen) after psilocybin is&#xD;
      administered. Additional information about participants' depressive symptoms and side effects&#xD;
      will also be measured during the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of single&#xD;
      and repeat doses of psilocybin at point-of-care in persons with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depression as part of major depressive disorder or bipolar II disorder. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate the feasibility of psilocybin in adults with treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy and tolerability of psilocybin at&#xD;
      point-of-care.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility of the study based on suicidal ideation and behaviour scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be judged based on change in Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) scores. The CSSRS evaluates suicidal ideation and behaviour.

Suicidal ideation intensity score ranges from 0 (no ideation) to 25 (most severe). The presence of suicidal behaviour is rated as a binary response; the lethality of actual attempts are rated on a scale of 0 (no or very minor physical damage) to 5 (death) and the potential lethality of actual attempts are rated on a scale of 0 (behaviour not likely to result in injury) to 2 (behaviour likely to result in death despite available medical care).</description>
