    <textblock>
      This is a single center, Phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-dose, 3 treatment, 3-period,&#xD;
      6-sequence, crossover study designed to compare the PK of SMP-100 dissolved in water for oral&#xD;
      administration with SMP-100 tablets under fasting conditions, and to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      food on the bioavailability of SMP-100 tablets in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMP-100 is a novel serotonin receptor 3 (5-HT3) partial agonist. The compound is under&#xD;
      development in an oral dosage form for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome (IBS-d). The study drug also has the potential to treat chemotherapy induced nausea&#xD;
      and emesis and diarrhea due to carcinoid syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical study (study number&#xD;
      SMP-100-101) evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of orally administered&#xD;
      SMP-100 in healthy volunteers is ongoing. Regarding safety, there have been no clinically&#xD;
      relevant abnormal vital signs, ECGs, laboratory results or SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each period, subjects will receive a single 4 mg dose of SMP-100 on Day 1 (Period 1), Day&#xD;
      4 (Period 2), and Day 7 (Period 3), under fasting or fed conditions, followed by 48 hours of&#xD;
      PK and safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening visit from Day -28 to Day -2. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical site on Day -1 and will be confined until completion of the&#xD;
      assessments on Day 9. There will be a washout period of at least 72 hours between doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the PK of SMP-100 dissolved in water for oral administration with SMP-100&#xD;
           tablets under fasting conditions, following a single dose in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the bioavailability of&#xD;
           SMP-100 tablets, following a single dose in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two SMP-100 oral formulations when administered&#xD;
      to healthy subjects.&#xD;
