  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB3820 is a novel cereblon-modulating agent. Upon binding to cereblon, a substrate receptor&#xD;
      in the cullin4 E3 ligase complex, TQB3820 promotes recruitment, ubiquitination, and&#xD;
      subsequent proteasomal degradation of the hematopoietic transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1)&#xD;
      and Aiolos (IKZF3). Modulation of Aiolos and Ikaros expression has the potential to correct&#xD;
      multiple aspects of the immune dysregulation mediated by B cells.&#xD;
