  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study aims to generate real-world evidence on the overall benefits and&#xD;
      disadvantages of using Lunit INSIGHT MMG AI based CADe/x for breast cancer detection in a&#xD;
      population-based breast cancer screening program in Korea.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Several challenges have been identified in breast cancer screening: 1) Some breast&#xD;
           cancer cases not identified through screening; 2) Excessive recalls for further testing;&#xD;
           3) Low sensitivity in dense breasts; 4) Inter-reader variability. AI-based CADe/x has&#xD;
           been shown to improve radiologist performance and provides results equivalent or&#xD;
           superior to those from radiologists alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This multicenter, prospective study involves women who visit sites for breast cancer&#xD;
           screening in Korea. Women eligible for national cancer screening in the relevant year&#xD;
           who read the study participant recruitment brochure and read and sign the Participant&#xD;
           Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form will be recruited into this study.&#xD;
           Approximately 32,714 participants will be enrolled from February 2021 through December&#xD;
           2022 at five study sites in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In Korea, a single radiologist performs mammogram readings. If recall is required (per&#xD;
           usual care), further diagnostic work-up will be conducted to confirm cancer detected at&#xD;
           screening. The national cancer registry databases will be reviewed in 2026 and 2027.&#xD;
           Available findings will be recorded for all participants regardless of their screening&#xD;
           status to identify study participants with breast cancer diagnosis within one year and&#xD;
           within two years from screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In primary outcome measurement, as part of the standard screening procedure, mammograms&#xD;
           will be read and recorded by a breast radiologist without AI-CADe/x, and then with&#xD;
           AI-based CADe/x. [Set1]&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In secondary outcome measurement, mammograms from the same participants as Set 1 will be&#xD;
           read and recorded by a general radiologist without AI-based CADe/x, and then with&#xD;
           AI-based CADe/x. [Set 2] In additional secondary outcome measurement, arbitration&#xD;
           reading will be conducted by another breast radiologist without AI-based CADe/x for&#xD;
           cases in which the reading results of the two radiologists without AI-based CADe/x in&#xD;
           Set 1 and Set 2 are inconsistent. [Set 3]&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After completing the standard screening procedure in Set 1, several situational&#xD;
           comparison groups [Set2 and Set3] for comparison the diagnostic accuracy will be&#xD;
           performed independently and retrospectively The results from Set 2 and Set 3 will not&#xD;
           impact the clinical decision(s) associated with the care of the study participants.&#xD;
