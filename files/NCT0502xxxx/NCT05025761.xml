      This stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial with nested mixed methods study will&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and cost effectiveness of a personal&#xD;
      protection package to reduce malaria transmission among mobile and migrant populations (MMPs)&#xD;
      and the general population in their residing villages in Myanmar.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, the burden of malaria has fallen dramatically in the Greater Mekong&#xD;
      Subregion, with deaths falling by 95% and cases by 76% between 2012 and 2019.The declining&#xD;
      malaria burden in GMS has largely been attributed to the deployment of interventions of&#xD;
      malaria prevention tools such as long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN), and widespread&#xD;
      availability of rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin combination therapies. However,&#xD;
      residual transmission exists among high risk populations, particularly mobile and migrant&#xD;
      populations who enter forests for work. New interventions targetting these high risk groups&#xD;
      are needed if countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion are to achieve malaria elimination by&#xD;
      2030. The study will be conducted in malaria endemic areas of Myanmar which have large forest&#xD;
      going MMP populations. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness, acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a personal protection package to reduce malaria&#xD;
      transmission among mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) and the general population in their&#xD;
      residing villages in Myanmar. The personal protection package includes WHO prequalified&#xD;
      long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN), insect repellent (N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET),&#xD;
      insecticide-treated clothes (ITC), and a MMP-tailored behavioural change communication (BCC)&#xD;
      package. The study design is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial with nested&#xD;
      mixed methods study. The stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial will estimate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a personal protection package provided to forest-going MMPs (the&#xD;
      intervention) delivered by village malaria volunteers at the site (village/worksite) level on&#xD;
      reducing Plasmodium spp. infections (primary outcome). Whilst the personal protection package&#xD;
      will be provided to mobile and migrant populations in each village in a step-wise manner,&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes relating to malaria testing will be collected in all&#xD;
      consenting individuals in the village who present for malaria rapid diagnostic tests, whether&#xD;
      they are mobile and migrant people or not. The study will also include investigation of&#xD;
      antibody responses to Plasmodium spp. and mosquito vectors and molecular markers of&#xD;
      antimalarial drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be implemented between July 2021 (M1) to June 2022 (M12). The personal&#xD;
      protection package for MMPs will be implemented sequentially in a minimum of 100 villages&#xD;
      serviced by an ICMV. The villages will be grouped into 11 blocks of 9 villages, with each&#xD;
      block transitioned from control phase (before introduction of the personal protection&#xD;
      package) to intervention phase (after introduction of the personal protection package) at&#xD;
      monthly intervals in random order. This follows an initial one-month baseline period at the&#xD;
      start of the study period where all villages will not be exposed to the personal protection&#xD;
      package exclusively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this proposed stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled study, it is estimated that&#xD;
      approximately 30 RDTs per month will be tested in each study site (village/worksite) and&#xD;
      there will be 36,000 MMP tests over 12 months in 100 villages/worksites. It will be&#xD;
      undertaken yielding a relative minimum detectable difference of 40% in odds of RDT-detectable&#xD;
      malaria infection (assuming a village intraclass correlation [ICC]= 0.42 [6]; 5%&#xD;
      significance; 80% power and 1% RDT malaria prevalence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the stepped-wedged cluster randomized trial, both descriptive and primary outcome trial&#xD;
      analyses will be performed. In both analyses, sampling weights will be derived and applied in&#xD;
      analyses where village selection probabilities are not equal - possible if the achieved&#xD;
      number of villages sampled across townships varies. Furthermore, cluster robust standard&#xD;
      errors will be used in all descriptive analyses given the complex sampling design.&#xD;
      Differences in prevalence of malaria infections will be estimated across intervention and&#xD;
      control periods using generalized linear mixed modelling (e.g. logit link function and&#xD;
      binomial distribution).&#xD;
