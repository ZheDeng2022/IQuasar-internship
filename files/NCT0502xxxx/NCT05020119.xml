      The investigators aim to investigate the patient's tumor neoantigen to generate &quot;personalized&#xD;
      cancer vaccine&quot; and then to expand autologous dendritic cells-cytokine-induced killer cells&#xD;

      Cancer is the leading cause of death in the world. However, the response of traditional&#xD;
      treatments(such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or target therapy) is yet limited. In this&#xD;
      clinical trial study, the investigators will investigate the patient's tumor neoantigen to&#xD;
      generate &quot;personalized cancer vaccine&quot; and then to expand autologous dendritic&#xD;
      cells-cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIK). The autologous DC-CIK will be cultured in vitro&#xD;
      and re-infused into patients. The similar clinical trial design and immune cell preparation&#xD;
      have been recently published in international journals. Though adverse reactions (AE) have&#xD;
      been reported, and there was no cases with severe adverse events (SAE), suggesting the safety&#xD;
      of autologous immune cell therapy against cancers. The main propose of this clinical trial is&#xD;
      to improve the treatment for solid tumors. By conducting this clinical trial, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to enroll patients with refractory advanced solid tumors, and develop&#xD;
      &quot;neoantigen-expanded autologous immune cell therapy&quot;. The investigators will utilize&#xD;
      &quot;neoantigens&quot; to expand the patients' autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells into&#xD;
      DC-CIK. The enrolled patients will receive autologous DC-CIK of 10 doses within 4~5 months of&#xD;
      treatment, and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of this immune cell therapy will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
