  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to increase participation rates in cervical cancer (CCU) and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programmes in Denmark by offering home-based CCU and CRC&#xD;
      screening when attending breast cancer screening to women who are not up to date with one or&#xD;
      both screening programmes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomised public health trial will take place in Central Denmark Region (CDR)&#xD;
      targeting women attending breast cancer screening. Five breast cancer screening units serve&#xD;
      women five days a week, and all five units will be included in the study and randomised to an&#xD;
      equal amount of intervention days. On the intervention days, the other four units will serve&#xD;
      as control group, providing a randomisation ratio of 1:4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On intervention days, a research assistant will ask women aged 50-69 if they are interested&#xD;
      in having a check up on their screening status in CCU and CRC screening. If she has not&#xD;
      participated timely, she will be offered to receive a test-kit corresponding to CRC screening&#xD;
      and/or to receive a self-sample device for CCU screening (or reminded to call her general&#xD;
      practitioner (GP) to have a conventional cervical cytology sample taken).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the woman accepts a self-sample kit for CCU and/or CRC screening, she will receive it by&#xD;
      mail together with written instructions, picturebased user instructions, information on&#xD;
      national recommendation for cancer screening and a pre-paid, pre-addressed envelope for&#xD;
      returning the sample to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of the test will be sent to the women by digital mail as well as passed on to her&#xD;
      GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical management in case of a positive test result will follow national guidelines&#xD;
      corresponding to CCU and CRC screening programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the control group will receive standard screening offers according to the national&#xD;
      screening programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women entering a breast cancer screening unit in CDR on a intervention day (intervention&#xD;
      + control units) will be sent a survey asking their experience with breast cancer screening a&#xD;
      few days after breast cancer screening. The women in the intervention group will be asked&#xD;
      about the acceptability of the intervention as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6250 women must be included, of which 1250 women will be in the intervention group for CCU&#xD;
      and CRC screening, respectively.&#xD;
