  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted surgery has been successfully adopted rapidly over the last decade. Robotic&#xD;
      technology with tridimensional imaging can improve operating dexterity, visualization of&#xD;
      difficult anatomic locations. This is a prospective study aims to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the domestic surgical robot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, the subjects will be randomly divided into two groups, and the&#xD;
      urological typical surgical procedures (prostatectomy, and partial or radical nephrectomy)&#xD;
      will be performed with the endoscopic surgical instrument control system SP1000 and&#xD;
      IS3000.And the non-inferiorly comparison will be made between the surgical results of two&#xD;
      systems to verify the safety and effectiveness of the endoscopic surgical instrument control&#xD;
      system (SP1000).&#xD;
