  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an open-label, single arm phase II study of venetoclax in combination&#xD;
      with rituximab in patients over the age of 60 with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine whether the combination of venetoclax with&#xD;
      rituximab in this patient population yields a clinically acceptable proportion of overall&#xD;
      responses (ORR, assessed by PET/CT with Lugano criteria) without chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For young, fit patients with mantle cell lymphoma, intensive chemotherapy and rituximab&#xD;
      followed by ASCT is often used to achieve prolonged disease free survival. However, this&#xD;
      therapy is not curative and has not been shown to improve overall survival. For older or&#xD;
      frail patients, who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation, improved disease free&#xD;
      survival can be achieved with chemotherapy and rituximab without ASCT, but at the cost of&#xD;
      significant short and long-term toxicity. Venetoclax monotherapy has shown impressive&#xD;
      single-agent activity in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma with low rates of&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that initial therapy with venetoclax and rituximab will result in rates of&#xD;
      CR and PR that are comparable to historical rates with chemoimmunotherapy. Furthermore, this&#xD;
      regimen will have fewer side effects than traditional therapy. Investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      that patients achieving a CR will have long durations of response that will continue after&#xD;
      stopping venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will test this hypothesis with an open label, single arm phase II trial&#xD;
      with a target accrual of 40 participants. This study will include patients over age 60 who&#xD;
      are not candidates for aggressive upfront therapy . Subjects will receive venetoclax and&#xD;
      rituximab for up to 12 cycles of 4 weeks each. All patients will stop venetoclax after 12&#xD;
      cycles. Participants who have stable disease or disease progression after 4 cycles will be&#xD;
      removed from the trial in order to receive standard of care chemoimmunotherapy. Participants&#xD;
      who do not achieve a CR after 8 cycles of venetoclax and rituximab will receive 4 cycles of&#xD;
      standard of care bendamustine in addition to continuing rituximab and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first phase II study of venetoclax and rituximab alone as initial therapy for&#xD;
      mantle cell lymphoma. In the relapsed and refractory setting, venetoclax has shown high&#xD;
      activity in MCL, and as such is a promising option for a non-chemotherapy approach to upfront&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
