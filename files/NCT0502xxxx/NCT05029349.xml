  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional study to determine whether the profile of volatile&#xD;
      organic compounds (VOCs) present in exhaled air (VOLATOLOM) is reproducible in stable severe&#xD;
      COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study, all patients giving written informed consent and&#xD;
      meeting the eligibility criteria will undergo 4 visits spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit V1 will be about 45 minutes duration. The others ones (V2 to V4) will be&#xD;
      about 30 minutes duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sessions will be carried out in the Pneumology Department of the Foch Hospital,&#xD;
      volatolomics platform (Exhalomics®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhalation collection will be performed at each visit in order to perform the volatolom&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe COPD (FEV ≤ 50% of theoretical values)&#xD;
