    <textblock>
      1. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease currently affecting more than 425 million people,&#xD;
           of which one-third are people older than 65 years. In the UK, the number of people&#xD;
           currently diagnosed with diabetes surpassed 3.8 million in 2019, with someone being&#xD;
           diagnosed with the illness every two minutes (Diabetes.org figures). The prototype&#xD;
           device being tested is a non-invasive blood glucose measurement system worn on the&#xD;
           wrist. This would help people with diabetes manage their condition better and help&#xD;
           prevent complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The main objectives of the research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To determine how accurate and effective the Afon prototype non-invasive blood&#xD;
                glucose measurement system is, as compared to a gold standard invasive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To chart the Afon device's predicted blood glucose levels over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study will be done with 30-50 patients. Eligible patients will have been diagnosed&#xD;
           with diabetes (type 1 or 2) at least one year prior, be between 18 and 80 years old, and&#xD;
           with a BMI between 18-35 kg/m2. For details of the full list of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria, see accompanying documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The trial will be conducted at the Joint Clinical Research Facility (JCRF), Institute of&#xD;
           Life Science 2, Swansea University, SA2 8PP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants will attend the site for a total of 5 visits, one for screening, and four&#xD;
           study visits, no more than 7 days apart. The study will run for one year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic disease currently affecting more than 425 million people worldwide. In&#xD;
      the UK, the number of people currently diagnosed with diabetes surpassed 3.8 million in 2019,&#xD;
      with someone being diagnosed with the illness every two minutes (Diabetes.org figures).By the&#xD;
      end of this year, 4 million deaths will happen worldwide as a result of diabetes and its&#xD;
      complications. These complications include renal failure, blindness, and amputation. It is&#xD;
      well established clinically that good glycaemic control minimises the risk of long-term&#xD;
      complications and improves morbidity and mortality. Current problems with frequent blood&#xD;
      glucose testing are mainly due to patient intolerability. Many patients find finger prick&#xD;
      testing for blood glucose levels to be painful, dislike using sharp objects and seeing their&#xD;
      own blood. There is also a risk of infection, and in the long term, this practice can result&#xD;
      in damage to the finger tissue. This is because the fingers have a high concentration of&#xD;
      sensory nerve endings. Additionally, the current invasive blood glucose monitoring systems&#xD;
      suffer limitations in terms of the requirement for continuous calibration and susceptibility&#xD;
      to contamination by the growth of various living organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Afon technology device would be a gamechanger in terms of improving the quality of life&#xD;
      of millions of patients and improve their chances to manage the condition without severe&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
