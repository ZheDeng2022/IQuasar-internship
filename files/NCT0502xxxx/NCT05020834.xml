    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of FES versus TheraTogs on Gait and Balance&#xD;
      in children with hemiplegic CP. Thirty children with hemiplegic CP will be assigned randomly&#xD;
      into two groups (A &amp; B). Group A received FES by using the WalkAide foot drop stimulator&#xD;
      while group B received TheraTogs. Patients' evaluation will be carried out before and after&#xD;
      training to assess gait and balance performance.&#xD;

    <description>Gait parameters were evaluated for every child at baseline and 3 months post-intervention using the Pro-Reflex motion analysis system (Qualisys; Qualisys Inc, Goeteborg, Sweden). For the purpose of this study four commonly used and reliable gait parameters were examined: stride length, step length, velocity, cadence, and stance and swing phase percentage.</description>
