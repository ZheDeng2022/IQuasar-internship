      In this study 67 ± 5 years of age averaged and by the physician in geriatric depression&#xD;
      diagnosis was placed 38 sedentary geriatric subjects were included. Meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria geriatric individuals information, vital signs (pulse,&quot;beats /min&quot;, blood pressure,&#xD;
      &quot; mmHg &quot;, respiration number, respiratory rate,) was recorded. Depression levels, Depression&#xD;
      Outcome Scale- KOFDSS to and quality of life is Quality of Life Survey -EUROHIS WHO-QOL) were&#xD;
      evaluated. 6-week, 4 days a week aerobic exercise program was applied to geriatric&#xD;
      individuals. As aerobic exercise which included the heating and cooling cycle was started the&#xD;
      first week and 120 minutes, 160 minutes weekend out and gradually the intensity was given as&#xD;
      an exercise program to be increasing. Individuals from the 6-week program were re-evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Considering the protocol suggested in the literature and by examining exercise samples for geriatric individuals, an exercise protocol was created. The first week started with aerobic exercises with a total of 120 minutes, and the next week increased to 160 minutes . A 6-week exercise program was planned and applied 4 days a week in which the intensity was increased gradually. People 's heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory frequency exercise program implementation before and after was recorded in the evaluation form.</description>

As aerobic exercise, the first week will be RPE 4/10 for 10 minutes, the second week with RPE 4/10 12 minutes, the third week with RPE 4/10 14 minutes, the fourth week with RPE 4/10, 16 minutes, the fifth week with RPE 5/ 2 0 will be as 18 minutes sixth week RPA 10.6 will form was done 20 minutes of exercise .&#xD;
Cooling period in the RPE 2.10 will be the 5 minute turning cycling, 5 min active range of motion exercises and stretching was done.</description>
