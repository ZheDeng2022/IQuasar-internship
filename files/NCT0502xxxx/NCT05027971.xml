      Multi-center, open label, prospective study to document on-going post-market safety and&#xD;
      performance of Flexiva Pulse High Power Single-Use Laser Fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects meeting the enrollment criteria, signing the consent and undergoing the&#xD;
      lithotripsy/HoLEP procedure with the study device(s) will be followed: up to 2 months (60&#xD;
      days) post-discharge from final holmium laser lithotripsy procedure for subjects in the&#xD;
      lithotripsy cohort or up to 6 months (180 days + 60 days) post discharge from HoLEP procedure&#xD;
      for subjects in the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) cohort.&#xD;
