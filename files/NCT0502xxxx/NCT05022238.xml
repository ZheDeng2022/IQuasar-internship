  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor case management, pharmacokinetic variability and on-going transmission have fostered the&#xD;
      drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) epidemic leading to a global estimated number of &gt;500,000&#xD;
      new multidrug resistant (MDR) TB cases per year, of which roughly 10% are extensively drug&#xD;
      resistant (XDR). Namibia is a high TB burden country with an incidence rate of 446/100,000 in&#xD;
      2016; about 11,000 new cases per year. 3.9% of new cases and 8.7% of previously treated cases&#xD;
      have MDR-TB. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has recently been applied to interrogate the&#xD;
      complete genetic code of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. WGS can be used to infer&#xD;
      relationships between identified strains as well as determine genomic variations involved in&#xD;
      resistance development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the H3TB study are to: (i) characterise the DR-TB epidemic, in terms of&#xD;
      clinical, epidemiological, geospatial, social network and laboratory data, to identify&#xD;
      transmission hotspots in three regions of Namibia, (ii) evaluate the feasibility of targeted&#xD;
      case finding intervention strategies to improve DR-TB control in highly affected populations&#xD;
      and (iii) develop a transmission model to investigate the potential impact of the case&#xD;
      finding intervention strategies on DR-TB incidence in Namibia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective surveillance study started in January 2020, which includes all DR-TB cases in&#xD;
      Namibia, and which will nest H3TB. Data collection tools and other study implementation tools&#xD;
      have been designed and implemented. The study team is working in close collaboration with the&#xD;
      National Institute of Pathology, where all DR-TB cases from the country are registered, to&#xD;
      ensure all possible cases are captured. This is important for the identification of&#xD;
      transmission hotspots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After HREC and MOHSS approval, individuals with GeneXpert® MTB/RIF rifampicin-resistant&#xD;
      samples and a positive Mtb culture from three regions in Namibia will be included in a&#xD;
      transmission hotspot identification study. Preliminary data have shown that DR-TB clusters&#xD;
      exist in these regions. Clinical, epidemiological, geospatial, social network and laboratory&#xD;
      data (GeneXpert® MTB/RIF, culture, drug sensitivity tests) will be collected. WGS capacity&#xD;
      has been established at the UNAM research laboratory, where WGS will be performed on the&#xD;
      samples of H3TB participants; results will be validated at the Research Center Borstel in&#xD;
      Germany. These study results in conjunction with a systematic review and meta-analysis will&#xD;
      inform the design of case finding interventions which will be evaluated through a&#xD;
      mixed-methods feasibility study conducted at high transmission areas (hotspots, households&#xD;
      and hospitals). Data from these studies and the TB programme will be used to develop the&#xD;
      model which will include a health economics component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will strengthen DR-TB diagnosis, surveillance and control, inform DR-TB case&#xD;
      finding policy in Namibia and regionally, inform resource allocation by identifying high&#xD;
      transmission areas and create preliminary data to design a large scale DR-TB case finding&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
