      This is a pivotal, prospective active-controlled, randomized, double blinded (blinded&#xD;
      evaluator and subject), intra-individual split-face comparison, non-inferiority study of DKL&#xD;
      crosslinked sodium hyaluronate 26 versus Juvederm Voluma™ after treatment of subcutaneous to&#xD;
      upper-periostea tissue, or deep dermis implantation cheek augmentation and age-related&#xD;
      facial-volume deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized and treated. Subjects will come to the research&#xD;
      clinic for up to 6 visits, including a screening/baseline visit and up to 5 follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Screening eligible subjects (males and females aged 18 to 65 years) will be randomized as&#xD;
      to which side of the midface will be treated with the investigational device and which side&#xD;
      will be treated with the comparator device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will undergo baseline assessments of Medicis Midface Volume Scale (MMVS) by the&#xD;
      evaluating investigator and have baseline two-dimensional (2D) photos taken, prior to&#xD;
      treatment with the investigational device and comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be performed by an unblinded treating investigator. Following treatment, the&#xD;
      subjects will complete a subject eDiary in which they will assess pre-defined treatment&#xD;
      related events experienced during the first 14 days after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional visits will take place 1, 3, 6 and 9 months after the treatment. During these&#xD;
      visits the subjects will undergo evaluations by an evaluating investigator blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment allocation. Assessments will include photography, MMVS and Global Aesthetic&#xD;
      Improvement Scale (GAIS). The subjects will also evaluate treatment outcome using the GAIS&#xD;
      and complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire. The investigator will record any adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) that have occurred and will note their severity and relationship to the injected&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional touch-up treatment will be performed one month after the initial treatment at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating investigator. Subjects requiring touch-up will receive touch-up&#xD;
      according to the original randomization scheme, i.e. the investigational device and&#xD;
      comparator product will be injected to the same midface side according to the randomization&#xD;
      scheme. Following touch-up, these subjects will be asked to complete a subject eDiary for&#xD;
      assessment of pre-defined treatment related events experienced 14 days after the injection.&#xD;
      Subjects receiving touch-up will attend an additional evaluation visit 1 month after touch-up&#xD;
      (in addition to other visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating investigators will complete a usability questionnaire.&#xD;
