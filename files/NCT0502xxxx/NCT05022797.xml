  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive subset of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in patients with NHL is a serious&#xD;
      complication. The outcome of patients with CNS relapse is extremely poor, with a median&#xD;
      survival of 4-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to reduce CNS relapse in high-risk patients is the use of systemic high-dose&#xD;
      intravenous (iv) methotrexate (HMTX) chemotherapy. Currently available methods of MTX&#xD;
      clearance, including dialysis-based methods, have shown limited efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucarpidase hydrolyses MTX to inactive metabolites that are partially metabolised by the&#xD;
      liver, thus providing an alternative route of limiting renal excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of Glucarpidase could prevent MTX toxicity as a whole as well as the&#xD;
      following consequences. The aim of this study is to analyse the prophylactic effect of 2,000&#xD;
      units of glucarpidase administered after 12 hours of HDMTX on MTX clearance and on the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of MTX-related toxicity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucarpidase hydrolyzes the terminal glutamate residue from MTX to inactive metabolites&#xD;
      [4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) and glutamic acid] which are partially&#xD;
      metabolized by the liver, thus providing an alternative route of limitation to renal&#xD;
      excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of Glucarpidase cause a clinically important 99% or greater sustained MTX&#xD;
      reduction being immediate in most patients, 87% of them experiencing a ≥ 95% reduction in&#xD;
      serum MTX concentration at a median of 15 min post-Glucarpidase Early administration of&#xD;
      Glucarpidase could avoid MTX toxicity as whole as well as the following consequences. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to analyze the prophylactic effect of 2,000 unit Glucarpidase administered&#xD;
      after 12 hour of HDMTX on the MTX clearance and on the incidence and severity of MTX&#xD;
      related-toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to normal clinical practice, patients will receive for curative intent rituximab&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) by standard protocol on a&#xD;
      21-day cycle (a total of 6 cycles), plus 3 infusion of systemic intravenous MTX at a dose of&#xD;
      3 g/m2 for CNS prophylaxis (HDMTX) at cycles 1, 3 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucarpidase will be capped at 2,000 units per dose (in two vials of 1,000 units/vial) given&#xD;
      as a single intravenous (IV) bolus injection over 5 minutes. Glucarpidase will be&#xD;
      administered 12 hours following each HDMTX at cycles 1, 3 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical laboratory evaluation of Hematology and Biochemistry will be conducted at each step&#xD;
      of this study, according to the local laboratory method, to determine occurrences of adverse&#xD;
      events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) following the Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to standard practice, the blood MTX levels will be monitored according to the local&#xD;
      laboratory method, already in place for this purpose. In addition, blood samples for analysis&#xD;
      of MTX levels by LC-MS/MS should be drawn at the different time-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the pharmacokinetic study of MTX clearance includes a quantification of MTX plasma&#xD;
      level before and after Glucarpidase administration, assessed by Liquid chromatography-tandem&#xD;
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis performed by Eurofins|ADME Bioanalyses. Collection&#xD;
      times are defined as described:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0 is the time 12 hours after the MTX infusion starts, with reference to T0. As previously&#xD;
      mentioned, plasma MTX levels will be measured at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0 (pre-Glucarpidase i.v. injection) It will be considered maximum plasma MTX level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0+15 minutes (15 minutes after the end of Glucarpidase administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0+6hrs (6 hours after Glucarpidase is given)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0+ 12 hrs (12 hours after Glucarpidase is given)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0+ 24hrs (24 hours after Glucarpidase is given Antibodies anti-Glucarpidase (ADA) will&#xD;
           be assessed 12 hours after the MTX infusions starts before Glucarpidase administration&#xD;
           (reference to T0) and at the follow-up visit month 3 (after the end of RCHOP treatment).&#xD;
           In case of positively response for antibodies at any time-point, the evaluation of&#xD;
           immune response to Glucarpidase includes a quantification of the Glucarpidase&#xD;
           immunogenicity assessed by a neutralization assay performed by Eurofins|ADMEBioanalyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be conducted based on the available data, without using techniques&#xD;
      for inputting missing values, but describing the number of missing values for each analysis.&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be performed at a significance level of α = 0.05, unless&#xD;
      specifically stated otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be assessed by a descriptive analysis of MTX levels: - As a&#xD;
      categorical variable: &gt;95% reduction of MTX (yes/no) after 6 hours after administration of&#xD;
      2,000 units of Glucarpidase. In addition, co-primary outcomes will be assessed by a&#xD;
      descriptive analysis of MTX levels: - As a numerical variable: MTX in µmol/L before and after&#xD;
      15 minutes, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after administration of 2,000 units of&#xD;
      Glucarpidase. - As a numerical variable: MTX change from baseline in µmol/L after 15 minutes,&#xD;
      6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after administration of 2,000 units of Glucarpidase. - As a&#xD;
      categorical variable: &gt;95% reduction of MTX (yes/no) after 15 minutes, 12 hours and 24 hours&#xD;
      after administration of 2,000 units of Glucarpidase.&#xD;
