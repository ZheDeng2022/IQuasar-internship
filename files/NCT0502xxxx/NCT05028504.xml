    <description>Penpulimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), which prevents PD-1 from binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 receptors on tumor cell surface, restores T cell activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors.</description>
