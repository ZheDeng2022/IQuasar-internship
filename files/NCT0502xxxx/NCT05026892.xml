  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Factors associated with severe forms of COVID-19 infection in patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      rheumatic diseases (IRD) or Autoimmune Diseases (AID) are unknown. This unprecedented&#xD;
      situation leads to empirical and potentially erroneous advice and recommendations for care.&#xD;
      Identifying factors associated with severity, in the context of this pandemic, which is&#xD;
      expected to last many months, and possibly years, is crucial for future patients. The&#xD;
      objective of this work is to identify the factors associated with the occurrence of severe&#xD;
      forms of COVID-19 infection in patients with IRD or AID, by combining analysis of 2 large&#xD;
      databases.&#xD;
