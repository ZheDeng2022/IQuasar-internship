    <textblock>
      This research study involves the study of TriPRIL CAR T Cells for treating people with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and to understand the side effects when treated with&#xD;
      TriPRIL CAR T Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the study drugs:.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TriPRIL CAR T Cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide: Standardly used chemotherapy drugs as part of&#xD;
           lymphodepleting process&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, non-randomized, open label, single-site Phase 1 study of TriPRIL CAR T&#xD;
      Cells as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A (Dose Escalation) : The investigators are looking to find the highest dose of the&#xD;
           study intervention that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side&#xD;
           effects, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose&#xD;
           of the study intervention. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who&#xD;
           have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated Once determined, this&#xD;
           highest dose will then be used in the dose expansion part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B (Expansion Cohort):Participants will be treated at the respective dose as&#xD;
           determined during Part A (Dose Escalation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TriPRIL CAR T Cells is an investigational treatment that uses a person's own immune cells,&#xD;
      called T cells, to try to kill their cancerous cells. T cells fight infections and can also&#xD;
      kill cancer cells in some cases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved&#xD;
      TriPRIL CAR T Cells as a treatment for any disease.This is the first time that TriPRIL CAR T&#xD;
      Cells will be given to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive one infusion of the study treatment and will be followed for up to&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 18 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
