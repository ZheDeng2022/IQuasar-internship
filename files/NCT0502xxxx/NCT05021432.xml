  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of literature in studying the comparative effects of Virtual Reality and&#xD;
      Circuit training in elderly population for fall prevention. This study will also analyze the&#xD;
      effects of the comparative intervention on Gait, Balance and Cognition. This will also deduce&#xD;
      the impact of Virtual reality and Circuit training on Quality of Life QOL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the individual ages, numerous physical and functional alterations occur especially&#xD;
      frailty, disturbed body balance, physical and cognitive declines, impaired gait hence leading&#xD;
      to falls among the elderly population. Fall is defined as an event in which an individual&#xD;
      unintentionally loses balance and inadvertently coming to rest on ground or lower surface.&#xD;
      While Balance is the ability to maintain the center of mass on the base of support (BOS)&#xD;
      without causing a fall. According to WHO survey, falls are the second leading cause of&#xD;
      accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide. Approximately 40% of older adults&#xD;
      &gt;65years fall at least once a year and 10-20% of these falls results in hospitalizations&#xD;
      which leads to poor Quality of Life. Women are more prone for age specific fall rates as&#xD;
      compared to men. Cognition is referred to as &quot;The mental action or process of acquiring&#xD;
      knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses&quot;. Optimum cognitive&#xD;
      levels are important for successful aging and any deficits should be monitored. Altered&#xD;
      cognition affects the Activities of Daily living (ADL), causes disabilities and directly&#xD;
      impacts the Quality of Life. A study by Ray et al, deduced that Cognitive training&#xD;
      significantly increased the Gait speed and improved the Timed up and go test values, hence&#xD;
      Cognitive training slows degradation of balance and improves gait while distracted, rendering&#xD;
      it a promising approach to falls prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), evaluated that risk of falls increases&#xD;
      with age and include multiple factors: Balance and gait deficits, cognitive impairments,&#xD;
      medications, frailty, fear of falling, vision and environmental hazard. USPSTF recommends&#xD;
      multifactorial interventions to address the balance and fall related issues among elderly.&#xD;
      These protocols include improving Balance and gait, improving cognition, environmental&#xD;
      alterations, balanced diet and nutrition along with appropriate medications. Adequate&#xD;
      exercises helps to improve general body conditioning to overcome the deteriorating effects of&#xD;
      aging hence, better Quality of life QOL. Previously it has been reported that a number of&#xD;
      specific approaches are useful in improving balance, gait and cognition as compared to&#xD;
      general conventional therapies: they include Virtual Reality, Goal oriented training,&#xD;
      Task-oriented training, Kinect training and Visual feedback, Motivational interventions with&#xD;
      active participations and Focused repetitive training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the technological advancement has occurred in recent years, &quot;Virtual Reality&quot; is being&#xD;
      incorporated in the PT management sessions to minimize the limitations in the existing&#xD;
      interventions and hence improving the deficits. VR training refers to interactive&#xD;
      stimulations enabling the user to experience the virtual environment similar to reality by&#xD;
      incorporating computer hardware and software. In comparison to home-based exercise plans, VR&#xD;
      training enhances motivation by introducing practical gaming element. A Study conducted by on&#xD;
      elderly 60-85yrs and they assessed the effects of Wifiit VR games and found that the scores&#xD;
      of body Center of pressure-COP movement area (Romberg test) with eyes open and eyes closed&#xD;
      improved among experimental group individuals after 8 weeks of trials hence improved Balance.&#xD;
      Likewise as reported , VR game exercises improves balance and gait in elderly over 65 yrs of&#xD;
      age - increases the step length while average Sway time and Time up and go test TUG both&#xD;
      decreased towards normal as compared to conventional Ball exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task oriented Circuit training CT is a series of systematically devised protocol, which&#xD;
      embodies multiple endurance and strength training parameters with moderate and high&#xD;
      intensities and sufficient repetitions of functional tasks. As reported that Circuit training&#xD;
      improves the partial O2 concentration, Respiratory rate-RR, HR hence overall cardiac&#xD;
      endurance and physical functioning. CT also helps in maintenance of functional Quality of&#xD;
      life. Several studies have reported that Virtual Reality and Task-oriented circuit training&#xD;
      also assists in motor and balance recovery among the stroke and CP. As documented by Lee et&#xD;
      al,(13) they compared the effects of VR against CT among the stroke patients and concluded&#xD;
      that static balance and Functional reach test outcomes were higher in VR group as compared to&#xD;
      CT group hence making Virtual Reality more feasible for balance training. A study concluded&#xD;
      that on older adults and deduced that VR training causes improvement in hip muscle strength&#xD;
      of the extensors, flexors, adductors, and abductors after 8 weeks along with greater ground&#xD;
      reaction force on the backward stepping test (with eyes opened and closed) and the crossover&#xD;
      stepping test( with eyes open and closed).&#xD;

    <description>The Short Form Health survey questionnaire SF-12 is a preferable instrument for use among the elderly population in order to calculate the Quality of Life.wo summary scores are reported from the SF-12 - a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 points above or below 50, corresponds to one standard deviation away from the average.
