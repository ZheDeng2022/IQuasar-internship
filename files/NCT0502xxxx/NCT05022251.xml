  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar discectomy (i.e. surgically removing a hernia) is frequently performed in Belgium to&#xD;
      treat lumbar radiculopathy. Every year &gt;12,000 interventions are performed with variable&#xD;
      long-term results. The treatment success of this procedure varies and up to 41% of the&#xD;
      patients report post-operative persistent pain complaints, and consequently suffer from&#xD;
      failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). Chronic complaints in FBSS following lumbar discectomy&#xD;
      are usually treated with symptomatic interventions (including painkillers, neuromodulation,&#xD;
      etc), rather than from a biopsychosocial perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to develop a focused and effective treatment strategy, it is crucial to first gain&#xD;
      insight into how persons with persistent complaints after lumbar discectomy differ from those&#xD;
      without persistent symptoms. Different known contributing factors entail type of surgery,&#xD;
      muscle and psychosocial impairments. Although in scientific and clinical literature it is&#xD;
      assumed that dysfunctional pain processing also plays an important mechanistic role in FBSS,&#xD;
      there is a lack of research to support this. However, this knowledge is crucial to depict the&#xD;
      full mechanistic picture of pain generators and potentiators in FBSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we will examine whether residual complaints persisting following lumbar discectomy&#xD;
      can be accounted for by underlying dysfunctional pain processing and whether a clinical&#xD;
      classification algorithm can be used to identify the predominant pain mechanism in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
