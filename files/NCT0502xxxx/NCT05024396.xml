      The primary objective is to test intratester and intertester reliability of maximum jump&#xD;
      height using the sensor Orthelligent Pro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to test the concurrent validity of maximum jump height measured&#xD;
      with the Orthelligent Pro compared to the gold standard which is the force plate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In everyday physiotherapy practice, there is often no budget for expensive measuring&#xD;
      instruments. Thus, devices such as a force plate are rarely available. Physiotherapists are&#xD;
      always looking for inexpensive, practical and portable measuring instruments to evaluate&#xD;
      therapy outcomes and to make reliable statements about the time for Return to Sport. Maximum&#xD;
      jump height is a performance-determining factor in various jump-intensive game sports. In&#xD;
      addition, the jump height serves as an important criterion to decide when an athlete can&#xD;
      return to his usual sport after an injury. There is a new sensor on the market that measures&#xD;
      jump height. This sensor is called Orthelligent Pro. It is shown to be a cost-effective and&#xD;
      feasible measurement method for return to sport in physical therapy practice. So far,&#xD;
      validity and reliability has never been tested. Therefore, this study aims to test the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of the Orthelligent Pro for the measurement of maximum jump height.&#xD;
      Two visits will take place 1-2 weeks apart. At the first visit, participants will complete&#xD;
      2x3 single-leg countermovement jumps measured by two testers each. At the second visit, three&#xD;
      jumps are completed measured by the first tester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the intra-and intertester reliability of maximum jump&#xD;
      height using Orthelligent Pro. The secondary objective is to test the concurrent validity of&#xD;
      maximum jump height measured with the Orthelligent Pro compared with the gold standard which&#xD;
      is the force plate. The primary and secondary endpoints are maximum jump height measured in&#xD;
      centimeters.&#xD;
