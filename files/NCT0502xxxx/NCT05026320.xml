  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a different way to treat people who have an injury to their&#xD;
      muscles, ligaments, or tendons in their legs or feet. This is known as a &quot;soft tissue&quot;&#xD;
      injury. Before a treatment is available to all patients, researchers study it in trials to&#xD;
      better understand its safety and how well it works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with soft tissue injuries can have pain, swelling, and bruising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers want to learn more about the trial treatment, BAYH006689, in&#xD;
      participants with a soft tissue injury to their legs or feet. BAYH006689 is a naproxen gel&#xD;
      that is used for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints. The&#xD;
      researchers will learn more about how BAYH006689 works and how safe it is in these&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include about 100 male and female participants between the ages of 18 and 60.&#xD;
      All the participants will have a soft tissue injury to their legs or feet that was caused by&#xD;
      playing sports. The injury will have happened within 3 hours of joining the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will use a computer program to randomly choose what treatment each&#xD;
      participant will receive. This will help make sure the treatments are chosen fairly and that&#xD;
      comparing the results of the treatments is as accurate as possible. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomly chosen to be in 1 of 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: 4 grams (g) of BAYH006689&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: 4 g of a diclofenac diethylamine gel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: 4 g of a placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any medicine in it. Diclofenac&#xD;
      diethylamine gel is a treatment already available for doctors to be recommended to people&#xD;
      with soft tissue injuries. The participants will receive their treatment once in the evening&#xD;
      on Day 1 and then 2 times a day for 4 days. The participants will receive their final dose in&#xD;
      the morning of Day 6. The doctors will apply the treatment to the participants' skin where&#xD;
      the injury is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants must be present at the clinic site 11 times over six days: once on Day 1 and&#xD;
      twice daily on Days 2-6. During the trial, the doctors will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the participants' overall health and ask if they have any medical problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  do physical examinations to check the participants' injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use a device to see how tender and sore the participants' injuries are&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers will study how tender the participants' injuries are after 3&#xD;
      days and at other time points over the 6 day follow-up period. They will also study how many&#xD;
      participants have medical problems during the trial.&#xD;

Algometry will be performed at baseline and at each study visit. Algometric measurements will be performed using a calibrated caliper with digital pressure recording). Increases in pressure during measurement will be kept constant at 10 N/cm2/s. The site of measurement will be marked with a water resistant marker, and measurements will be repeated at the same site. The measurements will be performed in such a way that the patient and the investigator cannot read the actual pressure exerted (covered display). The device stores the last exerted pressure, which is then recorded on the case report form. A tenderness reaction is defined as the pressure that, under the above conditions, produced a painful sensation.</description>
