    <primary_purpose>Health Services Research</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Following the stress echocardiogram examination, participants will follow the care pathway determined by the clinical team managing their care. If the participant is assigned to the study intervention arm the EchoGo report will inform this decision making process.&#xD;
In order to minimise bias in any outcome assessment clinicians will be asked not to share the details of the EchoGo report received for participants within the intervention arm with the participant or with colleagues who may undertake future investigations eg: angiography.If a clinician subsequently considers there is a clinical need to know the details of the EchoGo report this can be made available at the discretion of the study team.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigate if EchoGo plus standard care is non-inferior to standard care alone in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease following stress echocardiogram (SE)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post stress echo</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome shall be measured through the assessment of appropriate clinical management at 6 months following stress echocardiogram.&#xD;
Appropriate management will be defined as a composite of&#xD;
coronary angiography that demonstrates severe coronary disease fulfilling clinical care guidelines for revascularisation or&#xD;
decision for medical management/reassurance without unanticipated serious adverse cardiac events Outcome data will be collected from participant's medical records at 3 and 6 months.</description>
