  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulse oximetry screening (POS) for critical congenital heart diseases (CCHD) could identify&#xD;
      90% of these infants. However, this approach is not designed to detect cardiac defects&#xD;
      without hypoxemia, especially congenital malformations of aorta (CMoA). More than 60% of CMoA&#xD;
      was late diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants with CMoA were supposed to present with blood pressure (BP) gradient between four&#xD;
      limbs. But a large sample size retrospective study of four-limb BP screening showed a&#xD;
      negative result. The possible reason is that this study ran in population with a very low&#xD;
      risk of CMoA. Whether four-limb BPs measurement could be used in infants with high risk of&#xD;
      congenital malformation of aorta is still to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators retrospectively collected four-limb BPs, which was prospectively measured,&#xD;
      in infants with high risk of CMoA. These data were divided into two groups, the discovery&#xD;
      group and the validation group. The best cutoff of four-limb BP gradient was generated by&#xD;
      Youden Index. The BP gradients by age were analyzed. Pre-operative hypotension and&#xD;
      post-operative hypertension were also analyzed.&#xD;

        Infants admitted to the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital between January 1st, 2013&#xD;
        and December 31st, 2019, who were suspected as having congenital heart disease, were&#xD;
        enrolled in the study. Four-limb BPs in infants of confirmed or suspected CCHD admitted at&#xD;
        our hospital were prospectively collected at admission following the Pediatric Department&#xD;
        protocol for CCHD infants in which all infants with high risk of CCHD, defined as confirmed&#xD;
        or suspected CCHD by clinical teams, were screened by measuring four-limb BPs by&#xD;
        certificated nurses. Suspected CCHD was defined as unreasonable low SpO2, cyanosis, murmur,&#xD;
        suspected CHD by prenatal ultrasound or postnatal echocardiography at other hospitals, and&#xD;
        unexplained poor cardiac output.&#xD;
