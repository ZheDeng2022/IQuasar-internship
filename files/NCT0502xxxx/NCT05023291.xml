  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main risks for recurrence in patients with pancreatic cancer is incomplete surgery&#xD;
      of the primary tumor. During the operation, the surgeon bases himself for this on imaging and&#xD;
      peroperative vision. Unfortunately, this is not always sufficient and it is sometimes&#xD;
      determined after surgery that the cutting edges are not free of tumor cells. Research has&#xD;
      already shown that there is a significantly better survival when a margin of at least 1 mm is&#xD;
      maintained between the macroscopic tumor and the cut surface. It is therefore important to&#xD;
      remove the tumor as completely as possible without the risk of residual tissue and with a&#xD;
      sufficiently wide margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only method that can currently be used to determine during surgery if the tumor has been&#xD;
      completely removed is to use &quot;frozen sections&quot;. With a frozen section, the surgical piece is&#xD;
      sent to the pathology department during the operation, where sections are taken from the&#xD;
      edges. These are frozen in nitrogen and immediately viewed by a pathologist. If the cut edge&#xD;
      is positive, this will be passed on to the surgeon who will take a wider resection if&#xD;
      possible. Unfortunately, this method is time consuming and labor intensive. The evaluation of&#xD;
      these cut edges on frozen section is not easy and requires a lot of experience. The&#xD;
      percentage of false negative reviews for frozen section is not high, but it is true that it&#xD;
      is not non-existent either. In addition, it is not possible to evaluate all cleavage surfaces&#xD;
      peroperatively. This is currently happening for the distal pancreatic cutting edge and the&#xD;
      bile duct cutting edge, but not, for example, for the posterior pancreatic surface and for&#xD;
      the surface of the groove in which the superior mesenteric vein runs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of peroperative imaging in the form of 18F-FDG PET-CT scan of the tumor would be a&#xD;
      clear asset for this. This would not only be faster than frozen sections, but also provide a&#xD;
      full 3-dimensional image of the extracted specimen, which may provide more insights than 2D&#xD;
      frozen sections. The ultimate goal of this study is to bring the high resolution PET-CT&#xD;
      system into the operating theater. For example, during the operation, in the operating&#xD;
      theater itself, it could be determined where residual tumor tissue would be present and then&#xD;
      performed a wider resection in order to avoid a positive margin status.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer removal.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to see whether all tumor tissue has been removed in this patient&#xD;
      group during the removal of the tumor. This will be done with the help of a high resolution&#xD;
      PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography - Computer Tomography) system, developed by the Faculty&#xD;
      of Engineering, UGent, and commercialized by Xeos (spin-off from Ghent University). This&#xD;
      system is the compact (and transportable version) of the standard PET-CT and was initially&#xD;
      developed for imaging small laboratory animals, typically mice, for which a particularly high&#xD;
      resolution is required. In this study, the high-resolution PET-CT system will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the cutting edges after tumor resection. The goal is to evaluate the distance of the&#xD;
      tumor cells from the cutting edges of the surgical piece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient receives an intravenous injection of radiolabeled sugar (18F-FDG). 18F-FDG is the&#xD;
      standard PET tracer for diagnostic PET-CT research. This standard dose will always be&#xD;
      calculated according to the formula: 3.7 x body weight + 37 Mbq. The injection will be&#xD;
      carried out by a trained &quot;helper&quot; under article 53.2 of the Royal Decree of 30/08/2001. This&#xD;
      injection is always carried out under the responsibility of Dr. Kathia De Man or Dr. Bliede&#xD;
      Van den Broeck as a recognized and licensed nuclear medicine doctor. The location of the&#xD;
      injection will depend on the logistical possibilities of the day of operation. Due to the&#xD;
      radioactive decay of the molecule, the optimal moment of injection of this radiolabeled sugar&#xD;
      is best as short as possible before scanning the tumor. If possible, a &quot;helper&quot; will&#xD;
      transport the radiolabelled sugar to the operating theater (OR) and the injection will be&#xD;
      performed in the OR itself. If this option does not exist, the injection will be performed at&#xD;
      the nuclear medicine department of UZ Gent, after which the injected patient will be&#xD;
      immediately taken to the OR. Based on the natural decay of the radioactivity, the results of&#xD;
      both injection times can be compared using the time of injection, injected dose and time of&#xD;
      scan. The data collected during the study will allow to calculate post-hoc what the ideal&#xD;
      dose of 18F-FDG is for this indication, i.e. the lowest possible dose for the patient, which&#xD;
      can still be optimally measured by the scanner . The ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable)&#xD;
      principle always applies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery to remove the pancreatic tumor follows the standard procedure. After removal, the&#xD;
      surgical piece is first taken to the anatomopathology department. Frozen sections will be&#xD;
      taken and analyzed directly for intake by tumor cells. Immediate feedback on this is given to&#xD;
      the surgeon in the OR, as is done within the standard procedure. After taking the frozen&#xD;
      sections, the rest of the specimen is taken to the &quot;INFINITY&quot; lab on the UZ Gent campus. Here&#xD;
      a high-resolution PET-CT scan is performed on the surgical piece. After the PET-CT scan, the&#xD;
      surgical piece is returned to the pathological anatomy department for further standard&#xD;
      pathological evaluation. No information about the PET-CT results will be given to the surgeon&#xD;
      during surgery so as not to interfere with the standard surgical procedure. The results of&#xD;
      the high resolution PET-CT scan will be correlated post-hoc with the routine&#xD;
      histopathological results of the tumor specimen, which is considered the gold standard.&#xD;
