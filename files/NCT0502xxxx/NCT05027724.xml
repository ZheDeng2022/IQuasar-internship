  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary research from our group indicates that up to half of COVID-19 patients are&#xD;
      experiencing symptoms consistent with severe fatigue a median of 10 weeks after their initial&#xD;
      illness, while almost one third of those previously employed have not returned to work. At&#xD;
      present, most clinical and research measurements of fatigue have relied upon self-reported&#xD;
      perception of sensations such as exhaustion or weariness. Using such tools, there is an&#xD;
      inherent challenge for clinicians in differentiating between patients who are experiencing&#xD;
      fatigue at a psychosocial level, versus those who are actively physiologically and&#xD;
      neurocognitively deconditioned. The TROPIC study will use our existing clinical expertise and&#xD;
      technology assisted solutions to address features of post-COVID-19 fatigue by quantifying&#xD;
      physiological signatures of adverse sequelae in adult patients previously diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19, who are now COVID-19 negative. Our suite of assessments will encompass four&#xD;
      systems; physical deconditioning, orthostatic instability, neurocognitive deficits and&#xD;
      respiratory sequelae. This will not only inform accurate objective diagnostics of&#xD;
      post-COVID-19 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but will also guide clinicians in directing the most&#xD;
      appropriate therapeutic interventions with maximum efficacy and specificity, bringing not&#xD;
      only patient-related but also health system and economic benefits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: At the time of writing, over 214 million people globally are infected with the&#xD;
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is estimated that up to 50%&#xD;
      of people are experiencing debilitating levels of fatigue months after recovering from the&#xD;
      acute phase of COVID-19, known as post COVID-19 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The most&#xD;
      challenging aspect in the management of CFS for clinicians is the lack of objective&#xD;
      measurement tools. At present, most clinical and research measurements of fatigue have relied&#xD;
      upon self-reported perceptions of sensations such as exhaustion or weariness. We believe that&#xD;
      an objective, technology-based assessment of this complex condition is required for the&#xD;
      quantification of complex multi-system dynamic physiological signals in order to guide&#xD;
      clinicians in directing targeted valuable resources towards therapeutic interventions with&#xD;
      specificity and rigour to those patients who are most in need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of the TROPIC study is to identify bio- signals and contributing factors in the&#xD;
      development of post-Covid-19 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome using a suite of technology-assisted&#xD;
      assessment techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TROPIC STUDY PARTICULARS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be successful recruitment and completion of data collection of 100&#xD;
      participants in the TROPIC cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Assessments will take place in the Falls and Syncope Unit and Clinical Research&#xD;
      Facility of St James's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants will be recruited from five sources; (i) the Robert Mayne Day&#xD;
      Hospital, (ii) the Falls and Syncope Unit, (iii) Participants from earlier post COVID-19&#xD;
      Fatigue research in SJH who have consented to be contacted for further studies, (iv) staff&#xD;
      who contracted COVID-19, and (v) the Post COVID-19 outpatient (OPD) Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be aged 18 years or older, have a history of COVID-19 and be free of&#xD;
      exclusion criteria outlined in later sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis: Participants will be invited for one assessment session to St&#xD;
      James's Hospital (SJH), where they will undergo a series of neurocardiovascular,&#xD;
      neurocognitive and physical performance tests, outlined in more detail in later sections.&#xD;
