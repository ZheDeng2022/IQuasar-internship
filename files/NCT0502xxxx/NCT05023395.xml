      Primary objective: is evaluation of the investigational product's safety and evaluation of&#xD;
      its effect, in combination with antimicrobial treatment, on urine culture (microbiological&#xD;
      cure, no microbial growth on 24-48 hrs culture). The secondary objective: is evaluation of&#xD;
      the investigational product's effect, in combination with antimicrobial treatment, on disease&#xD;
      related symptoms (Clinical cure, disappearance of symptoms and signs).&#xD;

      Design: Randomized, Double blind, Placebo controlled multicenter study. Recurrent urinary&#xD;
      tract infection patients will blindly receive MEE-HU Medicus, or matching placebo, orally,&#xD;
      daily, for 10 days, adjunct to the empirical antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Male and female patients over 18 years old diagnosed with recurrent urinary tract&#xD;
      infection. Sample Size: 200 patients, 100 from each center.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be assigned to receive oral MEE-HU Medicus with the empirical antibiotic. A study pharmacist will prepare visually matched packages in identical, sequentially numbered treatment packs according to a previously done computer-generated randomization list, using block randomization with variable blocks of length 4 and 6. To be dispended, in sequential order, as participants will be recruited. All participants, enrolling physicians and investigators will be blinded to the treatment allocations. Attending physicians will be responsible for enrolling the participants and ensuring that the study medications are given from the appropriate treatment pack. Selection bias is minimized by randomization, while performance bias is minimized by blinding.</description>
