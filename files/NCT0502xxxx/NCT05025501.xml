  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD in preschoolers has become established as a valid psychiatric disorder with&#xD;
      characterized core deficits of executive function (EF). The EF impairments occurred in&#xD;
      preschool period could persist to childhood, adolescent and adulthood, causing extensive and&#xD;
      deep damage of individual's academic and career achievement, social function, and peer&#xD;
      relationship. Although medication showed significant effectiveness in controlling the core&#xD;
      symptoms of ADHD, it failed to help patients master compensatory strategies to cope with&#xD;
      functional impairments in learning and life events. The family intervention program for&#xD;
      school-age ADHD children is still rare, and it is a blank field in China. At present, most of&#xD;
      these related studies have not integrated task training in realistic scenarios with parent&#xD;
      training, and lack of randomized and controlled Settings, which makes the effect of&#xD;
      intervention less convincing. Therefore, the investigators conduct this randomized and&#xD;
      controlled study to find out the therapeutic efficacy of Family-based Executive Function&#xD;
      Training for Schoolage Children with ADHD, and follow the subjects to observe whether the&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy would persist. In the mean time, the investigators also observe the&#xD;
      factors which can influence the therapeutic efficacy. The goal of this study is to provide a&#xD;
      new treatment approach for schoolage children with ADHD, which could facilitate the EF&#xD;
      developing well to achieve better outcome.&#xD;
