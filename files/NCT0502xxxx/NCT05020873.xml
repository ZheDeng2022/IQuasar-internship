  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm observational non-interventional study (NIS),&#xD;
      which will be conducted in various countries in the Middle East and India.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to collect information on the utilization and effectiveness of&#xD;
      crizanlizumab treatment in SCD patients under routine clinical practice conditions, to which&#xD;
      the physician has made an independent decision to prescribe crizanlizumab.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized rate of healthcare visit and home-managed (VOCs) requiring a medical facility visit</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized rate of VOCs is defined as the total number of pain crises for a patient occurring from the date of initial infusion with crizanlizumab (commercially available) to the last contact date of the study end date Ã— 365 divided by the number of days during that same time period.&#xD;
This calculation accounts for early dropouts or lost to follow-up by extrapolating the VOC rate of every patient to 1 year.</description>
