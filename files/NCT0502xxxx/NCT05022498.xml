  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the reproducibility of postprandial coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) risk marker and sleep responses to acute exercise bouts and to quantify the&#xD;
      magnitude of individual variability in responses using a replicated crossover design.&#xD;
      Healthy, recreationally active men will complete two identical rest control and two identical&#xD;
      exercise (60 min at 60% maximum oxygen uptake) conditions in randomised sequences. Fasting&#xD;
      and postprandial venous blood samples, arterial blood pressure and arterial stiffness&#xD;
      measurements will be taken at pre-determined intervals, and sleep duration and quality will&#xD;
      be assessed. Reproducibility and individual variability will be examined using bivariate&#xD;
      correlations and linear mixed modelling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single bouts of exercise reduce circulating concentrations of postprandial triacylglycerol -&#xD;
      an established independent risk marker for coronary heart disease (CHD). The exercise-induced&#xD;
      reduction in postprandial triacylglycerol concentrations has been shown to coincide with&#xD;
      transient changes in other CHD risk markers, including reductions in postprandial insulin,&#xD;
      interleukin-6, arterial stiffness and resting arterial blood pressure, and exercise may also&#xD;
      promote sleep duration and quality. Individual variability in these responses is suspected&#xD;
      but has not been examined using robust designs and appropriate statistical models. A recent&#xD;
      approach to quantify individual variability in the intervention response involves quantifying&#xD;
      the participant-by-condition interaction from replicated intervention and comparator arms.&#xD;
      Using this approach (the replicated crossover design), the present study will (i) examine&#xD;
      whether the postprandial CHD risk marker and sleep responses to acute exercise are&#xD;
      reproducible on repeated occasions; and (ii) determine whether there is true individual&#xD;
      variability in postprandial CHD risk marker and sleep responses to acute exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 healthy, recreationally active men will be recruited. Participants will&#xD;
      undertake a preliminary measures visit (visit 1) to confirm eligibility, to undergo&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements and to determine maximum oxygen uptake. Participants will&#xD;
      complete four, 2-day experimental conditions in randomised sequences separated by at least&#xD;
      one week: two identical control and two identical exercise conditions. On day 1 (visits 2, 4,&#xD;
      6 and 8), participants will arrive fasted at 08:00 and a baseline blood sample, blood&#xD;
      pressure and arterial stiffness measurement will be taken. Participants will consume a&#xD;
      standardised high fat breakfast at 08:45 (0 h) and lunch at 12:45 (4 h). A second arterial&#xD;
      stiffness measurement will be taken at 16:45 (8 h). The two control and two exercise&#xD;
      conditions will be identical, except that participants will be asked to exercise on the&#xD;
      treadmill for 60 minutes at 60% of their maximum oxygen uptake at 15:15 (6.5 h) in both&#xD;
      exercise conditions. On day 2 (visits 3, 5, 7 and 9), participants will arrive fasted at&#xD;
      08:00 and will rest in the laboratory throughout the day in the two control and two exercise&#xD;
      conditions. Participants will consume a standardised breakfast at 08:45 (0 h) and a&#xD;
      standardised lunch at 12:45 (4 h). Venous blood samples will be collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h. Resting arterial blood pressure will be measured at hourly&#xD;
      intervals. Arterial stiffness will be measured at 0, 2.5 and 5 h. Sleep duration and quality&#xD;
      will be assessed for three nights before and two nights after visits 3, 5, 7 and 9 using a&#xD;
      triaxial actigraphy watch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility and individual variability will be explored by correlating the two sets of&#xD;
      response differences between exercise and control conditions. Within-participant&#xD;
      covariate-adjusted linear mixed models will be used to quantify participant-by-condition&#xD;
      interactions. It is hypothesised that (i) control-adjusted postprandial CHD risk marker and&#xD;
      sleep responses to acute exercise will be reproducible; and (ii) true interindividual&#xD;
      variability will exist in postprandial CHD risk marker and sleep responses to acute exercise&#xD;
      beyond any random within-subject variation.&#xD;
