  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over pilot study comparing the effects of&#xD;
      ingesting oats containing high molecular weight β-glucan in reducing blood pressure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study will consist of 2 study periods: one treatment period and one control period.&#xD;
      The treatment period will provide food products made from oats containing a total of 4 grams&#xD;
      per day high molecular weight (HMW) oat β-glucan, whereas, the control period will provide&#xD;
      food products made primarily from wheat with no β-glucan. The study will be located at the&#xD;
      Chronic Disease Innovation Centre in Seven Oaks General Hospital, Winnipeg, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of ingestion of HMW oat&#xD;
      β-glucan on ambulatory blood pressure. Participants will be asked to wear an ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor for 24 hours per day for 3 consecutive days at the beginning and end of each&#xD;
      treatment period. This device automatically measures blood pressure every 15-30 minutes&#xD;
      during the day and 30 to 60 minutes during the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed to be conducted virtually. Participants will consent to receive&#xD;
      both treatment and control over two 4-week periods online. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to different orders of treatment, with a 4 week wash out period in between.&#xD;
