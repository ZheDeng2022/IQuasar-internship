  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coordinated control between the bilateral ankles plays an important role in daily life&#xD;
      functions such as walking and balance. The central nervous system damage caused by stroke, in&#xD;
      addition to the limitation of the ankle movement on the hemiplegic side and the deterioration&#xD;
      of the movement ability, It will seriously affect the coordinated control performance between&#xD;
      the bilateral ankle joints, which will cause the majority of stroke patients to have barriers&#xD;
      to walking function, and increase the patient's daily care depending on the caregiver.&#xD;
      However, there is currently no research on stroke patients, the development of a coordinated&#xD;
      control evaluation method with bilateral ankle joints, the use of load-bearing state&#xD;
      simulation similar to the real-life bilateral ankle and foot coordination control&#xD;
      performance, the establishment of clinical value of bilateral ankle Coordinating the&#xD;
      performance parameters of the control evaluation; thus, the clinical doctors can not&#xD;
      accurately understand the degree of defect in the bilateral foot and ankle coordination&#xD;
      control of the stroke patients, and explore the influence of the bilateral ankle-foot&#xD;
      coordination control defect on the daily life function of the stroke patients, and even&#xD;
      cannot be based on the evaluation results. The clinical parameters, combined with visual&#xD;
      feedback and bilateral rehabilitation advantages of rehabilitation training program, improve&#xD;
      the bilateral ankle joint coordination control ability and lower limb function of stroke&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish an assessment system that can&#xD;
      be used to measure the performance of bilateral ankle joint coordination control, to&#xD;
      understand the degree of injury in bilateral ankle and foot coordination control, and to&#xD;
      analyze the biped coordination parameters and clinical gait performance. The characteristics,&#xD;
      and then the design of a double-sided rehabilitation training program combined with visual&#xD;
      feedback, is used to improve the bilateral ankle joint coordination control performance and&#xD;
      lower limb movement function of stroke patients.&#xD;

    <description>The foot (affected foot) first moves to 10° plantar flexion, and the other foot moves to 10° dorsiflexion for 10 seconds; then one foot gradually moves from 10° plantar flexion to 10° dorsiflexion, and the other foot moves from dorsiflexion 10° °Move to 10° plantar flexion.The &quot;alternating time&quot; and &quot;alternating angle&quot; values for coordination of bilateral ankles were calculated. To enable comparison of the alternating time and alternating angle applied for each subject, the data units were normalized as a percentage. We calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) values for the &quot;alternating time&quot; and &quot;alternating angle&quot;from the non-dominant (non-paretic) ankle to the dominant (paretic) ankle. This revealed the overall variation in alternating time and alternating angle on the coordination control of individuals in this study.</description>

    <measure>Lower Extremity motor control of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>most widely used assessment of paretic limb motor impairment for persons with stroke.Scoring is based on direct observation of performance. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total scale score is 34.</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Test (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A representative method for assessing the balance ability of stroke patients. Patients receive a score from 0-4 on their ability to meet these balance dimensions. A global score can be calculated out of 56. A score of 0 represents an inability to complete the item, and a score of 56 represents the ability to independently complete the item.</description>

    <measure>Time Up and Go Test (Time Up and Go, TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine fall risk and measure the progress of balance, sit to stand and walking.The individual must stand up from a chair (which should not be leaned up against a wall), walk a distance of 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down. The score consists of the time taken to complete the test activity, in seconds and ≥12 seconds to complete the TUG is at risk for falling.</description>
