  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current trial is to evaluate a novel e-health platform. Overall&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants who receive Plan Well Guide (PWG) 2.0 will make more progress in&#xD;
      their 'preparations' as measured by &quot;Preparedness for the Future Questionnaire (PREP FQ)&quot; at&#xD;
      6 months and, consequently, experience greater improvements in their psychological well-being&#xD;
      (PWB), health status, and life satisfaction at 12 months compared to participants receiving&#xD;
      PWG 1.0 (Advance Serious Illness module only). Study Design: The investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a multi-site randomized trial to evaluate a novel e-health platform. Overall&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants who receive Plan Well Guide (PWG) 2.0 will make more progress in&#xD;
      their 'preparations' as measured by &quot;Preparedness for the Future Questionnaire (PREP FQ)&quot; at&#xD;
      6months and, consequently, experience greater improvements in their psychological well-being&#xD;
      (PWB), health status, and life satisfaction at 12 months compared to participants receiving&#xD;
      PWG 1.0 (Advance Serious Illness module only).Study Design: We propose to conduct a&#xD;
      multi-site randomized trial. Setting: Several sites in Lethbridge Alberta. a sample of&#xD;
      primary care clinics as well as recruit online participants. Study Population: THe&#xD;
      investigators plan to include interested participants that are aged between 40 to 70 years of&#xD;
      age. We will exclude participants that don't speak English or do not have internet&#xD;
      access/email addresses, and already have a high PWB score. Study Intervention: Eligible&#xD;
      participants will then be randomly allocated to 2 groups: PWG 1.0 or PWG 2.0.Outcomes: The&#xD;
      primary outcome for this trial will be an overall score of PWB questionnaire; key secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include PWB domain scores, SF-12,single-item rating of life satisfaction, all&#xD;
      measured at 6 and 12 months. Additional outcomes include 'days off work' and health care&#xD;
      utilization. Significance: This study will be the first large multi-centre trial examining&#xD;
      the effects of a novel e-health platform aimed at improving people's psychological well-being&#xD;
      and health status as well as their preparedness for serious illness decision-making during&#xD;
      this time of a global pandemic. Results of this trial will likely affect the state of&#xD;
      preparedness of individuals, and if wide disseminated, may have a dramatic effect on the&#xD;
      health and well-being of a broad segment of the population.&#xD;
