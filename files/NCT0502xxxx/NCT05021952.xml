  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the use of mobile health is increasing for the purpose of managing prognosis such&#xD;
      as recurrence, survival and quality of life by using a wearable smart band and a smartphone&#xD;
      application. In the era of the 4th revolution, mobile health for the purpose of comprehensive&#xD;
      prognosis for cancer patients is becoming a very good tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to confirm the clinical significance of short-term and temporary health care&#xD;
      through a mobile application and a smart band during the treatment process for cancer&#xD;
      patients, but the study is insufficient to generalize the number of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, for prostate cancer patients who need prognosis management after surgery, we will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of a mobile application using a smart band which has a modular&#xD;
      structure reflecting the treatment method and treatment process after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study targets patients who underwent prostate cancer surgery. An intervention group&#xD;
      (App+IoT device) uses a smart care application for 12 months. This application was tailored&#xD;
      for prostate cancer patients and created by reflecting the treatment process after surgery.&#xD;
      And they also uses a wearable smart band for 12 months. Control group is provided general&#xD;
      education through the hospital brochure. Evaluation will be conducted 2-3days after surgery&#xD;
      (before discharge), and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;

The maximum score for this part is equal to 14. A score equal to or higher than 12 indicates that the subject under study has an acceptable nutritional status thus excluding malnutrition and/or malnutrition risk, meanwhile, a score ≤ 11 implicates to proceed with the complete version of the MNA (MNA-LF). This version consists of 12 additional items and provides a maximum possible overall assessment of 30 scores: a score of fewer than 17 indicates malnutrition, a score of 17-23.5 indicates a risk for malnutrition and a score higher 23.5 indicates well-nourishment.</description>
