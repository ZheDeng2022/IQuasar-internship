  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All pregnant women who performed an OGTT following Italian Guidelines and then delivered at&#xD;
      our University Hospital from march 2020 to march 2021 were prospectively enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Primary outcome of the study was the number of women to whom was diagnosed GDM with&#xD;
      only the fasting glucose value (≥ 92 mg/dl), following Italian Diabetes Societies&#xD;
      recommendations for COVID 19 pandemic period. In the same time, we prospectively collected&#xD;
      the data of women who became diabetic following the criteria of WHO 1999 (fast glucose value&#xD;
      ≥ 120 mg/dl, 2 hours later ≥ 140 mg/dl) still in use in some large countries like India. From&#xD;
      the clinical charts, we reported the distribution of risk factors for GDM (maternal age ≥ 35&#xD;
      years, family history for diabetes type 2, ethnia, BMI ≥ 25, previous GDM) and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, macrosomia, intrauterine growth&#xD;
      restriction and Caesarean section in emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be compared between the 2 groups consisting in those diagnosed with only&#xD;
      IADPSG criteria versus those diagnosed with only WHO '99 criteria.&#xD;
