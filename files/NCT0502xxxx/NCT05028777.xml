    <textblock>
      The investigators' primary objective is to assess whether a difference in the occurrence of&#xD;
      bleeding events exist between patients with LVT treated with DOACs as compared to those&#xD;
      treated with VKAs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Left ventricular thrombus (LVT) is a well-known complication of left ventricle (LV) systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction that can be seen in acute systolic dysfunction, i.e. induced by an acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (AMI) or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and in chronic heart failure with&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), whatever the cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in the management of AMI, particularly with the implementation of primary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), have led to a striking reduction in the occurrence&#xD;
      of LVT in patients with AMI from about 30% in the thrombolytic era to about 4% nowadays,&#xD;
      according to echocardiographic assessment. On the other hand prognosis of patients with LVT&#xD;
      didn't change over time: mortality and risk of embolic events associated with this condition&#xD;
      are still high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited amount of evidence shows that oral anticoagulation is associated in the majority of&#xD;
      patients with both resolution of LVT and reduction in ischemic events. This benefit comes at&#xD;
      the cost of bleeding complications, which have been demonstrated to impact on mortality,&#xD;
      especially in patients after AMI receiving an oral anticoagulant on top of a dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy (so-called triple antithrombotic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current European and American guidelines on treatment of myocardial infarction with&#xD;
      ST-elevation do not make strong recommendations for the management of LVT, whereas guidelines&#xD;
      on treatment of heart failure do not give any. The European Society of Cardiology recommends&#xD;
      an anticoagulation treatment for up to 6 months from diagnosis in case of LVT thrombus after&#xD;
      AMI and the decision to continue the therapy after 6 months should be taken on the basis of&#xD;
      echocardiographic follow-up (class IIa level of evidence C). The American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology and American Heart Association (AHA) gives a similar recommendation (IIaC),&#xD;
      however specifically mentioning vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and a target INR (international&#xD;
      normalized ratio) 2.0-2.5 for 3 months on top of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). They also&#xD;
      propose to consider an anticoagulant therapy for patients with severe anterior wall motion&#xD;
      after STEMI but without LVT (IIbC). The AHA and American Stroke Association published in 2014&#xD;
      their last recommendations for secondary stroke prevention, which are in line with the above&#xD;
      mentioned guidelines. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are mentioned as an alternative to&#xD;
      VKAs (IIbC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All guidelines agree that DOACs for LVT treatment cannot be recommended as first-line therapy&#xD;
      because of the scarce evidence, based on case reports small case series and only one large&#xD;
      retrospective study (RED VELVT study, published on April 22, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in clinical practice because of the establishment of DOACs over VKAs as first-line&#xD;
      therapy to prevent embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, those are prescribed&#xD;
      off-label to a significant number of patients with LVT. DOACs, as compared to VKAs, showed a&#xD;
      greater efficacy regarding prevention of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and systemic embolic&#xD;
      events in atrial fibrillation, but an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleedings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of thrombus formation in a left ventricle with regional wall motion&#xD;
      abnormalities and in left atrium with atrial fibrillation is very similar and it implies a&#xD;
      blood stasis as main mechanism. Thus one could expect that DOACs, which have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be superior to VKAs in term of prevention of embolic events in atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, have a similar effect on treatment of LVT. However, the first large&#xD;
      retrospective study including 541 patients with LVT, of which 421 treated with&#xD;
      anticoagulation showed an increased risk of embolic events at 1 year among patients with LVT&#xD;
      treated with DOACs as compared to those on VKAs; occurrence of bleeding events was not&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside the above mentioned uncertainty concerning duration and type of treatment (VKAs versus&#xD;
      DOACs) in LVT, there are also some issues concerning the imaging modality used for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of LVT. Several studies comparing the diagnostic performance of transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography (TTE) versus cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed a roughly 30%&#xD;
      sensitivity of TTE when taking delayed-enhancement CMR (DE-CMR) as gold standard. With the&#xD;
      growing use of CMR, an increasing number of patients are diagnosed with small left&#xD;
      ventricular thrombi, which would have been missed in usual clinical practice and which seem&#xD;
      to be associated with an embolic risk similar to thrombi detected by TTE.&#xD;
