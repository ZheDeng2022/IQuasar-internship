  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility and pilot study. Though large-scale online neurocognitive testing is&#xD;
      increasingly being done in psychiatry, there are no such efforts in Parkinson's research.&#xD;
      Thus a large part of this pilot study will be to demonstrate feasibility and reliability, and&#xD;
      use this experience to develop a feasible protocol for ongoing research. The specific&#xD;
      short-term objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the feasibility of performing large-scale deep cognitive phenotyping using&#xD;
           online cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate that online neurocognitive testing is valid and reliable in a smaller&#xD;
           sample of locally recruited participants tested both in-lab and online.&#xD;

    <description>We are assessing several cognitive domains and have made minor adaptations (reducing the total number of trials or lengthening response windows) to several standard neuropsychology tests including measures of executive function, working memory, visuospatial function, declarative memory, reward processing, response inhibition.&#xD;
Overall, the tests we use follow a standard set-up: participants are shown stimuli on the screen and are asked to provide a response using either a keyboard or a mouse, based on a specific set of instructions. We always provide a detailed set of on-screen instructions and a practice phase. In some cases, information about performance is provided in the form of points, in other cases, none is provided.</description>
