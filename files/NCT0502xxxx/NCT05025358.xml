  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of LP-118 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies, including solid tumors and B-cell lymphomas. LP-118 is a BCL-2/BCL-XL small&#xD;
      molecule inhibitor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LP-118 is an oral selective BCL-2 inhibitor with tuned BCL-XL activity, aiming to improve&#xD;
      antitumor efficacy and reduce the risk of thrombocytopenia. Clinical development of LP-118&#xD;
      includes targeting of relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies and solid tumors.&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study of LP-118 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced malignancies, including advanced/metastatic solid tumors and relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      B-cell lymphomas, to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics profile and&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor efficacy. Upon completion of the Phase 1 dose escalation study and&#xD;
      establishment of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), the dose&#xD;
      expansion study will be implemented in patients with protocol designated type of disease.&#xD;
