  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study aims to develop and test a patient video educational tool, an&#xD;
      interactive Mobile Doctor (iMD), that can be integrated in radiation oncology setting to&#xD;
      effectively engage cancer patients receiving treatment at University of California, San&#xD;
      Francisco (UCSF) to facilitate smoking cessation and maintaining smoking abstinence in the&#xD;
      context of their radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first to address tobacco use among can patients receiving radiation therapy&#xD;
      that targets both tobacco cessation (current users) and maintaining abstinence (former users&#xD;
      who have recently quit).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interactive Mobile Doctor (iMD) is an interactive video educational program that delivers&#xD;
      tailored messages in response to participants' input, generates a summary report providing&#xD;
      tobacco use status and cessation resources and solicits participants' interest in receiving&#xD;
      referral or information to tobacco cessation resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the interactive Mobile Doctor (iMD), an&#xD;
      interactive patient education tool, utilizing patient-centered and interactive technology&#xD;
      approaches to target cancer patients who report using tobacco within the past 12 months and&#xD;
      are initiating or receiving radiation therapy for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of iMD on tobacco abstinence when compared to the control&#xD;
      (assessment + resource information only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate impacts of iMD on referral requests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either the iMD or Control Group in a 1:1 ratio, stratified&#xD;
      by tobacco use status within past 30 days (current vs former tobacco users), to the iMD&#xD;
      intervention or the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      iMD Intervention Participants: Participants receive up to a total of 3 iMD sessions prior to&#xD;
      their completion of radiation therapy (RT). The iMD session will take about 10-15 minutes and&#xD;
      will include: 1) computerized assessments(tobacco use in past 12 months and in past 30 days;&#xD;
      types of tobacco used, time to first cigarette or tobacco use, cigarettes used per day on a&#xD;
      typical day of use, readiness for quitting, and concerns about quitting smoking) that will be&#xD;
      delivered on the screen via text with accompanying audio and participants will respond&#xD;
      directly on the tablet 2) tailored videos that deliver messages specific to patient's&#xD;
      responses to selected assessment questions, including addressing misconceptions of being too&#xD;
      late to quit smoking after cancer diagnosis, which could be a barrier for quitting smoking,&#xD;
      or tobacco-free is not necessary after completion of RT; and 3) a summary printout, the iMD&#xD;
      Summary Reported generated at the end of each iMD session will provide a summary of a&#xD;
      participant's RT completion status or anticipated completion date, tobacco use status, plans&#xD;
      for quitting or commitment to abstinence, key messages addressing participants' concerns and&#xD;
      uniform resource locator (URL)s of the videos watched, California Smokers' Helpline website&#xD;
      and telephone numbers, and interest to be contacted by a tobacco treatment specialist or in&#xD;
      receiving for tobacco use, referred to tobacco treatment resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Participants: Participants will undergo the assessment questions. Instead of&#xD;
      viewing and participating in the interactive video education about tobacco cessation or&#xD;
      tobacco-free living, will participants receive a handout containing tobacco cessation&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up for 3 month after their first visit.&#xD;
