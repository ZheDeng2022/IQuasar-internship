  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current protocol, we propose a study to evaluate a novel, combined esophageal&#xD;
      sponge-methylation biomarker strategy for the early detection of esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (ESCC) as well as its precursor, esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD). This strategy&#xD;
      leverages the 'EsophaCap', a swallowable, retrievable sponge, with subsequent evaluation of&#xD;
      the sample using a novel molecular biomarker assay. This biomarker assay evaluates&#xD;
      methylation levels in three genes, which have been shown to differ significantly between ESCC&#xD;
      cases and controls in pilot studies. Detection of methylation markers highly associated with&#xD;
      ESCC could help identify patients with concurrent ESCC or at high risk of imminently&#xD;
      developing this condition. If successful, this strategy could result in a paradigm shift for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer control strategies in Tanzania and other high-incidence ESCC regions&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic strategy combining esophageal&#xD;
      sponge sampling with the 'EsophaCap' sponge device with the EsoCAN assay, a novel molecular&#xD;
      biomarker assay, among patients with histologically-confirmed ESCC and controls.&#xD;

      sponge sampling with the 'EsophaCap' sponge device with the EsoCAN assay, among patients with&#xD;
      histologically-confirmed ESD and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of 'EsophaCap' a swallowable and retrievable&#xD;

      histologically-confirmed ESCC and controls.&#xD;
