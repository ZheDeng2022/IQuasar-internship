  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide data on the immune response and safety of administering&#xD;
      vaccines to relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) participants taking ozanimod compared to&#xD;
      controls taking interferon-beta's or receiving no disease modifying therapies (DMTs). The&#xD;
      data of this study will support the labels for ozanimod in multiple sclerosis (MS) because&#xD;
      the effect of ozanimod on the vaccination response of MS participants is of interest to&#xD;
      participants and prescribers.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with serologic response to tetanus toxoid</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by comparing the anti-tetanus toxoid immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers at 4 weeks post-vaccination compared to the pre-vaccination titers. Participants with a pre-vaccination IgG antibody titer level ≤ 0.10 IU/mL will have a serologic response if post-vaccination titer levels are ≥ 0.40 IU/mL. To demonstrate a serologic response if pre-vaccination titer levels are &gt; 0.10 IU/mL and ≤ 2.7 IU/mL, participants will have at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titers. If participants have a pre-vaccination titer level &gt; 2.7 IU/mL, they will have at least a 2-fold increase in titers to demonstrate a response.</description>

    <measure>Safety of concomitant vaccine administration in participants taking ozanimod</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>A Safety Adverse Event (SAE) or Adverse Event (AE) incidence is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>
