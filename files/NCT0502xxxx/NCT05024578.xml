      This study aims to better delineate profiles of insomnia subtypes in people with and without&#xD;
      depression or PTSD across simultaneous EEG, heart rate, and body temperature monitoring over&#xD;
      multiple days in the natural sleeping environment. Using ambulatory EEG headbands, we also&#xD;
      aim to compare the influence of auditory stimulation on slow waves and related objective and&#xD;
      subjective sleep measures, as well as mental well-being, daytime fatigue, and cognitive&#xD;
      performance in healthy sleepers and people with symptoms of insomnia (with and without&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities). This is a double-blind randomized control trial. The overall&#xD;
      protocol includes a web-based screening interview and home-based data collection spanning&#xD;
      over 5 weeks. A subset of participants will be invited for in-lab monitoring via 3 overnight&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;

      1. Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insomnia is estimated to be the most prevalent sleep disorder, with nearly 10% of the&#xD;
           general population meeting diagnostic criteria. Extensive work is still being deployed&#xD;
           to better delineate the multiple subtypes of insomnia, and major gains are to be made&#xD;
           using multi-domain physiological monitoring to deepen our understanding of this&#xD;
           heterogeneous disease. Some individuals with insomnia show low levels of slow wave sleep&#xD;
           (SWS). Novel devices which can be used in the field over multiple days now enable longer&#xD;
           term monitoring of EEG features such as sleep slow waves to assess not only&#xD;
           inter-individual variability, but also intra-individual variability, a phenomenon of&#xD;
           high importance to assess the stability of slow wave abnormalities in insomnia subtypes.&#xD;
           Recent findings show that carefully timed auditory stimulation can increase sleep slow&#xD;
           waves. Whether such auditory stimulation can potentiate slow waves in people with&#xD;
           insomnia symptoms remains to be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, sleep architecture and quantitative EEG measures undergo significant&#xD;
           alterations in many people with insomnia. Insomnia is notably linked to prolonged sleep&#xD;
           onset latency, short total sleep time, numerous nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep&#xD;
           efficiency and low amounts of SWS. For instance, it is estimated that people with&#xD;
           chronic insomnia spend 20 minutes less in SWS per night compared to good sleepers.&#xD;
           Individuals with insomnia have also been reported to have less slow wave activity (SWA;&#xD;
           lower spectral power in the delta frequency range), with a shift towards elevated high&#xD;
           frequency EEG activity, a potential physiological marker of increased cortical arousal.&#xD;
           SWS and SWA are thought to be reflective of sleep depth and to play a central role in&#xD;
           sleep maintenance and restorative sleep functions. SWS/SWA alteration may thus represent&#xD;
           one of the factors contributing to the lower awakening threshold of people with insomnia&#xD;
           and to some of their daytime symptoms, including cognitive difficulties and significant&#xD;
           daytime fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Of note, it has been proposed that SWS abnormalities in insomnia may result in part from&#xD;
           dysfunctions in thermoregulatory processes, especially around sleep onset. Autonomic&#xD;
           alterations are also visible through elevated heart rate and abnormally low heart rate&#xD;
           variability in people with insomnia. Yet very little is known about how daily changes in&#xD;
           body temperature and heart rate are related to SWS/SWA dynamics in people with insomnia.&#xD;
           There is thus a need for simultaneous ambulatory monitoring across potentially&#xD;
           interacting physiological systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enhancement of Slow Oscillations Recent studies demonstrated that slow oscillations&#xD;
           (SO), a SWA component in lower frequencies (&lt;1Hz), can also be increased with auditory&#xD;
           stimulation. For instance, 50ms pink noise pulses administered during SWS, specifically&#xD;
           during the ascending phase of the SO detected in the frontal cortex, increased SO&#xD;
           activity. The ascending phase of the SO reflects the depolarization of the cell membrane&#xD;
           and increased excitability of the neural network. Further studies confirmed these&#xD;
           findings, notably reporting that this may translate across the SWA spectrum. EEG&#xD;
           headbands are ambulatory devices for EEG recording capable of stimulation that is&#xD;
           phase-locked to SOs. A recent double-blind randomized sham-controlled study using a beta&#xD;
           version of these devices in health adults reported a 0.70 specificity and 0.90&#xD;
           sensitivity to automatically detect N3 sleep (as compared to expert human scoring) and&#xD;
           rather effective real-time closed-loop detection and stimulation in the SO ascending&#xD;
           phase. This yielded an 11-43% increase in spectral power within the delta frequency band&#xD;
           during the 4 seconds following stimulations. Importantly, this effect persisted over a&#xD;
           sustained period of 10 consecutive nights of stimulation, suggesting no major sign of&#xD;
           desensitization over this period. Whether such auditory stimulation can also potentiate&#xD;
           slow waves in people with insomnia symptoms remains to be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential Modulators of Insomnia Symptoms and Slow wave sleep Insomnia is not a&#xD;
           homogeneous syndrome and can be characterized by a range of different physiological and&#xD;
           psychological profiles. For instance, evidence suggests that people with insomnia who&#xD;
           underestimate their sleep durations (&quot;subjective&quot; insomnia subtype) have more SWA&#xD;
           reductions than those with objective short sleep durations (&quot;objective&quot; insomnia&#xD;
           subtype). In addition, SWS potentiation may not have noticeable impacts in individuals&#xD;
           with insomnia with more prominent sleep initiation difficulties (initial insomnia), and&#xD;
           there may be little effects to those with early morning awakenings (terminal insomnia)&#xD;
           since SWS occurs mostly in the first portion of the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Importantly, there are indications that the symptomatic profiles defining some of these&#xD;
           insomnia subtypes may vary across time. While this type of work was mostly based on&#xD;
           subjective self-reported measures, few studies have reported data about the stability of&#xD;
           objective sleep EEG and other physiological features across insomnia subtypes, reporting&#xD;
           relative short term stability but possible inter-subtype variability. This limits our&#xD;
           understanding of the multiple pathophysiological factors involved in the maintenance of&#xD;
           insomnia, with central implications for the daily management of this chronic illness.&#xD;
           New wearable technologies are creating an unprecedented opportunity to fill in this&#xD;
           knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Slow Oscillations in Insomnia and Comorbid Mental Disorders Insomnia is highly comorbid&#xD;
           with mental disorders. In fact, studies have found that those suffering from sleep&#xD;
           disturbances are more psychologically aroused, perceive their lives as more stressful,&#xD;
           and use emotion-based coping strategies more than do good sleepers. Since there are&#xD;
           reports of SWS/SWA dysregulation in people with depression or post-traumatic stress&#xD;
           disorder (PTSD), there may be some interactions between these mental disorders and&#xD;
           insomnia on these sleep EEG features. One common feature of insomnia, depression and&#xD;
           PTSD is the deregulation of the stress system leading to increased autonomic activation.&#xD;
           This is notably reflected by elevated blood pressure and heart rate, reduced heart rate&#xD;
           variability, faster breathing rate, increased skin conductance and abnormal temperature&#xD;
           regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Possible Benefits of Slow Oscillation Potentiation for Cognitive Functions SWS/SWA and&#xD;
           SO are known to play an important role in cognition, notably in terms of memory&#xD;
           functions. For instance, low SWS has been shown to disrupt memory consolidation. It has&#xD;
           been shown that SWS enhancement during sleep can facilitate declarative memory&#xD;
           consolidation. Considering the memory difficulties commonly reported by individuals with&#xD;
           insomnia and the observed alterations in sleep-related memory consolidation in this&#xD;
           population, there is a need to investigate whether SO potentiation during sleep may&#xD;
           impact daily cognitive performance in people with and without insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Objectives A) To better delineate profiles of insomnia subtypes in people with and&#xD;
           without depression or PTSD across simultaneous EEG, heart rate, skin conductance, and&#xD;
           body temperature monitoring over multiple days in the natural sleeping environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B) To compare the influence of auditory stimulation on SO and related objective and&#xD;
           subjective sleep measures, as well as mental well-being, daytime fatigue, and cognitive&#xD;
           performance in healthy sleepers and people with symptoms of insomnia (with and without&#xD;
           psychiatric comorbidities).&#xD;
&#xD;
           C) To run exploratory analyses to determine if individual SO sensitivity to sound&#xD;
           stimulation during sleep relates to auditory event-related potentials in the wake state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 General Overview This study integrates 2 design frameworks: a) observational design (Aim&#xD;
      A), and b) crossover design (Aims B and C). A crossover design was chosen to reduce the&#xD;
      influence of confounding covariates because each participant serves as her/his own control.&#xD;
      Optimal crossover designs are statistically efficient and require fewer participants than&#xD;
      cross-sectional designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall protocol includes a web-based screening interview and home-based data collection&#xD;
      spanning over 5 weeks. A subset of participants will be invited for in-lab monitoring via 3&#xD;
      overnight visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Recruitment, initial consent and screening Participants will be recruited from 3 sites:&#xD;
      The Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (ROMHC), the Insomnia Clinic of the Center for Advanced&#xD;
      Research in Sleep Medicine, and the CERVO Brain Research Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will also be achieved through institutional 'Permission to contact&quot; registries,&#xD;
      as well as through external recruitment with advertisements distributed via web-based&#xD;
      platforms (e.g., institutional websites (e.g. www.theroyal.ca), sleeponitcanada.ca, the&#xD;
      eMentalHealth Research Study Directory (www.ementalhealth.ca), related web Kijiji, Facebook&#xD;
      and twitter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.1 Contact pathways: A. &quot;Clinician referral&quot; pathway Clinicians from any of the study&#xD;
      sites identify patients they would like to refer to the study, get the patients to fill out&#xD;
      the institution-specific &quot;Permission to be contacted form&quot;, and send this form to the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. &quot;Consent to be contacted&quot; pathway ROMHC programs and external collaborators have an&#xD;
      existing list of people who consented to be contacted for research. These individuals will be&#xD;
      contacted by the research team by phone or email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. &quot;Direct contact&quot; pathway Potential participants reach out directly to the research team&#xD;
      after seeing advertisements or hearing about the study by word of mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all pathways, these procedures will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A research assistant will contact potential participants by email to send them a summary&#xD;
           of the study and a link to complete an anonymous online screening form for the first set&#xD;
           of eligibility criteria on a secured web platform (Qualtrics, www.qualtrics.com; license&#xD;
           held via the University of Ottawa) and a unique identification code. The first question&#xD;
           of this online form will be asking participants to confirm they consent to take part to&#xD;
           the screening process. This will be documented in the screening database. The second&#xD;
           question of this online screening form will ask participants to insert their unique&#xD;
           anonymous research code. This screening form will include the WHO-ASSIST item 2, Sleep&#xD;
           Disorders Symptoms Checklist-25, Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI), Primary Care PTSD&#xD;
           Screen (PC-PTSD), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and should take between 10 and 15&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the questionnaires indicate that the first set of eligibility criteria are met, the&#xD;
           participant will be invited for the second and last screening step: a screening phone&#xD;
           interview (based on the M.I.N.I. without the suicidality module). This interview should&#xD;
           last for about 15-45 minutes. Before the start of the interview, the research assistant&#xD;
           will confirm verbal consent to pursue the screening process. This will also be&#xD;
           documented in the screening database. If the potential participant does not meet the&#xD;
           last set of eligibility criteria assessed via the phone interview, the study will be&#xD;
           terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.2 Ongoing Consent Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants found to be eligible after the screening phone interview, the research&#xD;
      assistant will summarize the next steps of the study verbally and address any questions or&#xD;
      concerns that participants may have at the end of the phone interview. Special care will be&#xD;
      given to ensure that participants understand that their participation is entirely voluntary&#xD;
      and that they can withdraw from the study at any stage (without any consequence on the&#xD;
      treatment(s) they receive at the specific study site or their relationship with any of the&#xD;
      clinicians at that study site). Eligible participants will be sent an electronic form&#xD;
      containing the information and consent form (ICF) and will have as much time as they need to&#xD;
      read it at home before enrolling in the study. As part of that same electronic form, they&#xD;
      will confirm consent by ticking consent boxes and entering their full name. This information&#xD;
      will be stored in a consent database showing the participant's full name and consent date,&#xD;
      which will be kept on restricted access folders on the ROMHC's server in separate files than&#xD;
      the research data. This online consent form was created based on published guidelines from&#xD;
      peer-reviewed articles. Ongoing consent will also be obtained electronically at the follow-up&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Data collection and management&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.1. Baseline assessment At the end of the screening interview and after obtaining verbal&#xD;
      consent to enroll in the study, eligible participants will be asked additional questions&#xD;
      about the course of their mental disorders, including age at onset and duration of longest&#xD;
      episode (inspired from the Diagnostic interview for genetic studies), as well as the&#xD;
      proportion of time with PTSD and/or depressive symptoms over the past 1, 5 and 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a package with the equipment to start ambulatory measurements.&#xD;
      Until the pandemic situation resolves, participants will have the option to come to the ROMHC&#xD;
      for curbside pick-up in strict conditions respecting physical distancing (i.e. both&#xD;
      participant and staff will be masked, staff will put the package directly in the trunk&#xD;
      without coming in close contact with the participant) or to get a courier delivery with all&#xD;
      mail and mail back costs covered by the research team. The Royal Logo or name will not appear&#xD;
      on the package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 1 week of monitoring at home using the EEG headband device&#xD;
      (DREEM2, Dreem, Paris, France; used for monitoring purpose only, no stimulation at baseline),&#xD;
      an elastic chest belt to measure heart rate (Zephyr Bioharness), and a small sensor fixed on&#xD;
      the abdomen using hypo-allergic tape to monitor skin temperature (i-button). During this&#xD;
      period, participants will fill a sleep log (containing the core elements of the ''Consensus&#xD;
      Sleep Diary''). Participants will be instructed on how to use this equipment on brief&#xD;
      pre-recorded online videos. They will be asked to liaise with the research team if they have&#xD;
      any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the seventh (last) day of the ambulatory monitoring period, participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to fill out a battery of questionnaires through a secure web-based platform (Qualtrics)&#xD;
      using an anonymous research code. This will take about 1 hour to complete and will inquire&#xD;
      about general demographic and clinical information, sleep, daytime functioning, mental health&#xD;
      (please see table 1). They will also complete a 40-60 minute online neuropsychological&#xD;
      battery (Cambridge Brain Sciences; https://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/science/tasks).&#xD;
      They will also complete two 18-minute resting state EEG recordings: i) 30 minutes before&#xD;
      sleep on the evening of the seventh day, and ii) 30 minutes after waking up on the following&#xD;
      morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the consent process, participants who are clients from the ROMHC, the Insomnia&#xD;
      Clinic of the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, or the CERVO Brain Research&#xD;
      Centre will have the option of granting the research team access to their medical chart to&#xD;
      document diagnostic information and data from their clinical sleep assessments (results from&#xD;
      their questionnaires, overnight sleep study data, diagnoses and treatment plan) were&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.2. Experimental conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take part in two experimental conditions separated by one week in a&#xD;
      randomized order: seven days of ambulatory monitoring with auditory stimulation, seven days&#xD;
      of ambulatory monitoring without auditory stimulation. Participants, care providers, and all&#xD;
      researchers involved in data collection or processing will be blinded to the order of these&#xD;
      experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the final day of each experimental condition and before the start of the second&#xD;
      experimental condition, participants will be asked to fill out a subset of the online&#xD;
      questionnaires about sleep, daytime functioning, and mental health which should take about 30&#xD;
      minutes to complete (please see table 1). They will also complete an alternate form of the&#xD;
      online neuropsychological battery (Cambridge Brain Sciences) and a 10-minute resting state&#xD;
      EEG recording 30 minutes before their habitual bedtime and after their habitual wake times&#xD;
      (to allow for the dissipation of morning sleep inertia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization process will consist of a computer-generated random listing of the two&#xD;
      potential sequential orders of the experimental conditions, stratified by sex and diagnostic&#xD;
      group. This will be managed by a research collaborator who will not have any contact with the&#xD;
      study participants and who will not be directly involved in data processing. This research&#xD;
      collaborator will label the placebo and active devices with the participant ID codes and&#xD;
      order of use for blinded distribution. Since there are no potential risks for the active&#xD;
      condition, we do not expect having to break the blinding codes in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the active experimental condition, participants will complete 1 week of SO stimulation&#xD;
      with the EEG headband monitor (DREEM2, Dreem, Paris, France) in the form of auditory stimuli&#xD;
      (100ms pink noise pulses, i.e., below the waking threshold as established in prior work) sent&#xD;
      on the ascending phase of the SO during N3 sleep. In the placebo condition, participants will&#xD;
      complete 1 week of EEG headband monitoring without auditory stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics and robustness of event-related potentials triggered by the auditory&#xD;
      stimulations during sleep will be collected, in addition to the spectral power in the SO and&#xD;
      delta frequency ranges in the 4 seconds following the initial stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.3 Follow-up measures One week after the last experimental condition, participants will&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires (10 to 20 minutes) to track potential changes in sleep and mental&#xD;
      health (please see table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.4. In-lab overnight recordings (when allowed by Public Health Directives) A subgroup of&#xD;
      participants (n=40, 10 per group as defined in section 5) will be invited for 3 nights of&#xD;
      in-lab standard polysomnography. This will enable to compare the detection of N3 sleep by the&#xD;
      ambulatory EEG headband with the gold standard of sleep measurements and to monitor the&#xD;
      effects of the stimulation on more extensive brain regions than the ones covered by the&#xD;
      ambulatory EEG headband.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the optional overnight in-lab recordings, participants will be asked not to refrain&#xD;
      from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking any naps or drinking alcohol on the day of their visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having coffee, tea, energy drinks Coke/Pepsi or chocolate (i.e. anything that contains&#xD;
           caffeine) as of midday on the day of their visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consuming any recreational drugs until the end of their last appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first night will be conducted at baseline and will serve as an adaptation night in order&#xD;
      to get rid of the &quot;first night effect&quot;. At the start of each experimental condition, the same&#xD;
      subgroup will be re-invited to the sleep laboratory for a night of standard polysomnography&#xD;
      concurrent with active/placebo auditory stimulations delivered with the same device used in&#xD;
      the experimental condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these in lab visits, participants will arrive about 2 hours before habitual sleep&#xD;
      time and leave about 45 minutes after their usual wake-up time. In addition to the use of an&#xD;
      EEG headband device (active or placebo depending on the experimental condition), electrodes&#xD;
      will be placed on the scalp according to the 10-20 system with: 11 scalp EEG channels (Fp1-2,&#xD;
      F3-4, C3-Z-4, P3-4, O1-2), ground and reference channels, right and left EOG, 2 chin EMG and&#xD;
      2 ECG channels. On the first night only, to document the presence of sleep-related&#xD;
      respiratory disorders and periodic leg movements. Respiration will be monitored with an&#xD;
      airflow cannula (pressure transducer), nasal-oral thermistor, respiratory effort via thoracic&#xD;
      and abdominal respiratory belts, and blood oxygen saturation via an oximeter probe on the&#xD;
      finger. On the experimental nights (second and third nights), skin conductance will be&#xD;
      continuously recorded using a monitor attached on the finger and body temperature will be&#xD;
      monitored with five small sensors (i-buttons) fixed on the skin with hypoallergenic sticky&#xD;
      tape (located on the neck, hand, abdomen, thigh, and foot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the sleep episode, in the wake state, participants will undergo a 10-minute&#xD;
      resting state EEG recording and event-related potentials (ERP) recordings. To characterise&#xD;
      wake state brain responses to auditory stimuli similar to the stimuli used in the sleep&#xD;
      experimental manipulation, ERP recordings will involve: i) a ~20-minute auditory oddball task&#xD;
      using deviant stimuli with the same physical properties as the 100 ms pink noise used for&#xD;
      sleep-based SO potentiation, and ii) a ~20-minute Fast/Slow task with the same stimuli. The&#xD;
      Fast/Slow paradigm counts two conditions, 1) long pink noise presented with fast&#xD;
      inter-stimuli intervals (ISI), 2) short pink noise presented with slow ISI. In this paradigm,&#xD;
      the slower condition taps into frontal lobe functions while the fast condition does not,&#xD;
      therefore enabling the assessment of frontal functions, a cortical region of high relevance&#xD;
      for sleep slow waves. All tasks will involve the passive listening of sounds through&#xD;
      headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be asked to go to sleep and be woken up at their habitual wake times.&#xD;
      Sleep stage scoring will be manually performed by sleep technologists in accordance with the&#xD;
      clinical scoring guidelines established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.3. Debriefing At the end of the last experimental condition, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to fill out questionnaires about expectations surrounding the experimental conditions. Once&#xD;
      this is completed, they will receive a debriefing email about the order of the two&#xD;
      experimental conditions (sent by the research assistant responsible for randomization to keep&#xD;
      other research staff blind).&#xD;

    <description>Percentage of sound stimulation delivered in the ascending phase of a slow oscillation. (The intervention is a closed-loop system reading the electroencephalogram in order to anticipate the detection of slow oscillations, once a slow oscillation is predicted, the system will deliver a sound stimulation at a time targeting the ascending phase of the oscillation. Since this is based on complex and delicate calculations, a certain degree of errors is to be expected. This outcome thus will quantify the proportion of stimulation correctly falling within the target time frame, i.e. the ascending phase of a slow oscillation.)</description>
