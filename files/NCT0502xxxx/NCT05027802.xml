  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      palovarotene in adult and paediatric participants with FOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is also to ensure treatment continuity to participants who have&#xD;
      completed one of the parent studies (Study PVO-1A-301, Study PVO-1A-202 and Study PVO-1A-204)&#xD;
      and who, in the investigator's judgement, may benefit from palovarotene therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has completed the EOS or End of Treatment Visit of Study PVO-1A-301 or&#xD;
             PVO-1A-202 (PVO-1A-202 Parts C and D correspond to Study PVO-1A-204 in France). There&#xD;
             must be a current parent study signed ICF form for the participant to be eligible for&#xD;
             Study CLIN-60120-452.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be ≥14 years of age (aligned with the age of treated participants in&#xD;
             the ongoing parent studies PVO-1A-301 and PVO-1A-202/PVO-1A-204) and qualify as 100%&#xD;
             skeletally mature (if &lt;18 years, based on assessments carried out at parent EOS Visit;&#xD;
             if ≥18 years, automatically considered 100% skeletally mature) or have reached final&#xD;
             adult height based on investigator's assessment, at the time the Study CLIN- 60120-452&#xD;
             informed consent is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to retinoids, gelatin, lactose (note that&#xD;

             metabolic, ophthalmologic, immunologic, psychiatric, or other significant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intercurrent known or suspected non-healed fracture at any location;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical condition/clinically significant abnormalities that would expose the&#xD;
             participant to undue risk or interfere with study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amylase or lipase &gt;2× above the upper limit of normal (ULN) or with a history of&#xD;
             chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5× ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting triglycerides &gt;400 mg/dL with or without therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suicidal ideation (type 4 or 5) or any suicidal behaviour within the past month as&#xD;
             defined by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).&#xD;

             carotene, or herbal preparations, fish oil, and unable or unwilling to discontinue use&#xD;
             of these products during palovarotene treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to synthetic oral retinoids other than palovarotene within 4 weeks of the&#xD;
             Inclusion Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with tetracycline or any tetracycline derivatives due to the&#xD;
             potential increased risk of pseudotumor cerebri.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of concomitant medications that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome&#xD;
             P450 (CYP450) 3A4 activity; or kinase inhibitors such as imatinib.&#xD;
