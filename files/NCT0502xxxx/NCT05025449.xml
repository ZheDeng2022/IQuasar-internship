  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam is widely used and accepted as&#xD;
      part of advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol, but its low sensitivity for identifying&#xD;
      solid organ injury in the absence of hemoperitoneum is a significant limitation.&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has the potential to significantly enhance the evaluation&#xD;
      of the trauma patient with acute intra-abdominal injury through the use of intravascular&#xD;
      microbubbles that allow direct visualization of lacerations to solid organs. European studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that ultrasound contrast markedly improves the sensitivity of ultrasound in&#xD;
      detecting solid organ injury, when the exam is performed in the radiology suite. The&#xD;
      researchers hypothesize that the bubble-enhanced FAST or BEFAST exam will be more sensitive&#xD;
      than traditional FAST for identification of solid organ injury in hemodynamically stable&#xD;
      blunt abdominal trauma patients when performed by emergency providers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blunt abdominal trauma, whether from motor vehicle crash, assault, fall, or recreational&#xD;
      injury, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. According to the 2016 National Trauma&#xD;
      Database, 12% of all patients with trauma admissions had abdominal trauma, the majority of&#xD;
      which is blunt. The diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury due to blunt abdominal trauma can be&#xD;
      challenging. The physical exam is unreliable in patients with altered mental status or with&#xD;
      impairment due to drugs or alcohol. While computed tomography (CT) can rapidly and accurately&#xD;
      diagnose injury, emergency physicians have raised concerns that the use of CT has become&#xD;
      overly liberal. The risks of overutilization of CT in hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal&#xD;
      trauma include increased health care costs, lengthy stays in the emergency department, risks&#xD;
      of contrast-induced nephropathy and radiation-induced malignancy, and patient anxiety when&#xD;
      &quot;incidentalomas&quot; are discovered that need extensive and often unnecessary workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam is widely used and accepted as&#xD;
      part of the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol, but its low sensitivity for&#xD;
      identifying solid organ injury in the absence of hemoperitoneum is a significant limitation.&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has the potential to significantly enhance the evaluation&#xD;
      of the trauma patient with acute intra-abdominal injury through the use of intravascular&#xD;
      microbubbles that allow direct visualization of lacerations to solid organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Lumason (sulfur hexafluoride&#xD;
      lipid-type A microsphere) for characterization of focal liver lesions with CEUS in both adult&#xD;
      and pediatric patients, opening new areas of research in the United States. Lumason is a&#xD;
      second generation contrast agent that is more stable than previous ultrasound contrast agents&#xD;
      and does not require refrigeration. Although approved for intravascular and intravesical use,&#xD;
      Lumason's use in a trauma exam is off-label in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants provide informed consent, a baseline FAST exam will be performed and&#xD;
      documented. This exam will be distinct from the initial ATLS resuscitation FAST in order to&#xD;
      avoid any interference in the trauma evaluation. If not already placed, an intravenous line&#xD;
      will be established according to standard practice for trauma patients. Following the FAST&#xD;
      exam, a bubble-enhanced FAST (BEFAST) exam will be performed using Lumason as the contrast&#xD;
      agent. As part of the standard of care, participants will have a CT exam performed within 24&#xD;
      hours, which will provide the gold standard for diagnosis of solid organ trauma.&#xD;

    <description>Following the FAST exam and using the same machine, a BEFAST exam will be performed using a low mechanical index setting in contrast-specific imaging mode. A 2.4 mL IV dose of Lumason will be injected into the subject's IV, followed by saline flush. The contrast will be injected once for the right side of the body, and once for the left side of the body looking for disruptions in the normal enhancement pattern and evidence of active bleeding. Contrast may be redosed if images are inadequate or incomplete. To examine the right side of the body: the liver will be imaged first in arterial phase, followed by the right kidney, before returning to image the liver in venous phase. To examine the left side of the body: the pancreas will be imaged first, followed by the kidney and the spleen. The investigator will note evidence of solid organ injury, free fluid, or active extravasation on both sides of the body; lacerations will be graded by AAST criteria.</description>
