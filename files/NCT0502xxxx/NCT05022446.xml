      This study investigates the changes in practice by pulmonary procedural programs across the&#xD;
      United States as they faced the coronavirus pandemic. Information gathered from this study&#xD;
      may help guide pulmonary programs on a wider scale and improve their practice. The study may&#xD;
      also help researchers understand where they should focus research efforts to better respond&#xD;
      to a pandemic in the future.&#xD;
