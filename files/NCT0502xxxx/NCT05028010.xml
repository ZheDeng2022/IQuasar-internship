  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Maternal and child nutrition is a lingering public health concern, affecting the&#xD;
      lives of the most vulnerable individuals, in particular mothers and children. To counteract&#xD;
      the burden, the Ethiopian government has applied various strategies, including incorporating&#xD;
      the promotion of nutrition as one package of primary health care provided by the health&#xD;
      extension workers (HEWs). However, the provider's knowledge, promotion skill, and competency&#xD;
      for promoting maternal and child nutrition have not been examined. Moreover, health extension&#xD;
      workers have been promoting using the traditional model of education and indicating the need&#xD;
      for continuous professional development to strengthen the workforce. Thus, the study is aimed&#xD;
      to assess and enhance the health extension worker's capacity in promoting maternal and child&#xD;
      nutrition through comprehensive and evidence-based capacity-building training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A quasi-experimental study will be employed among 92 health extension workers. A&#xD;
      baseline study, involving both qualitative and quantitative studies will be conducted to&#xD;
      identify the gaps in maternal and child nutrition promotion. The knowledge, promotion as well&#xD;
      as counseling skills of the HEWs will be assessed using a self-administered questionnaire and&#xD;
      observational checklist, respectively. The intervention will involve training, supportive&#xD;
      supervision, and coaching in a real environment. A four-day training will be given, which&#xD;
      will be followed by supportive supervision of expert supervisors. Further, the greet, ask,&#xD;
      listen, identify, discuss, recommend, and agree counseling model with Pender's health&#xD;
      promotion model will be applied to enhance HEWs promotion skill. A post-test aimed at&#xD;
      assessing the knowledge and counseling competency will be conducted and the pretest and&#xD;
      posttest results will be compared using a t-test. Factors affecting both knowledge and&#xD;
      counseling capacity will be assessed using binary logistic and linear regression,&#xD;
      respectively. Similarly, a qualitative study will be used to explore promotion skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Given there are problems associated with the knowledge and counseling skills of&#xD;
      HEWs in Ethiopia, nutrition education using a well-designed and comprehensive strategy would&#xD;
      bring a positive impact on professionals' promotion capacity thereby improving&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers' behavior regarding child and maternal nutrition. The evidence will also&#xD;
      enforce nutrition programmers and the Amhara regional health bureau to end maternal and child&#xD;
      undernutrition.&#xD;
