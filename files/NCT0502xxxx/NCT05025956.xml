  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to explore the possible benefit of administration of Fisetin, (a senolytic&#xD;
      agent) to improve the benefit of Platelet-Rich Plasma and losartan for treatment of&#xD;
      femoroacetabular impingement and labral tear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that giving Fisetin, a senolytic agent, will improve the benefit of PRP by&#xD;
      eliminating senescent cells and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), known to&#xD;
      exist in PRP. The main objectives of this study are to determine if pre- and post-operative&#xD;
      administration of a senolytic agent will improve the beneficial effects of PRP when used in&#xD;
      conjunction with surgical treatment of FAI and/or labral tear, to determine whether pre- and&#xD;
      postoperative administration of Fisetin is associated with adverse events, and to determine&#xD;
      if pre- and post-operative administration of Fisetin leads to a decrease in systemic&#xD;
      senescence, serum SASP, and fibrotic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from femoroacetabular impingement and labral tear, who are planning to&#xD;
      undergo hip arthroscopy combined with standard of care intra-operative PRP injection and&#xD;
      post-operative losartan administration will be recruited from the clinical practice of the&#xD;
      Principal Clinical Investigator or his designee at The Steadman Clinic (TSC).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo control clinical trial is&#xD;
      proposed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a senolytic agent (Fisetin) to improve the&#xD;
      benefits of standard of care platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection and antifibrotic medication&#xD;
      (Losartan) in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for treatment of femoroacetabular&#xD;
      impingement (FAI) and/or labral tear (LT).&#xD;
