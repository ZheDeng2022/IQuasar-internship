      This study will occur in two non-dispensing phases: Phase 1 is a non-randomized, non-masked,&#xD;
      non-dispensing study where subjects will wear their own contact lenses for approximately 1&#xD;
      hour. Phase 2 is a controlled, randomized, double-masked, contralateral non-dispensing study&#xD;
      where the study lenses will be worn in a daily wear modality for approximately 3 hours.&#xD;

                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  in both eyes in a daily reusable or daily disposable wear modality (i.e. not&#xD;
                  extended wear modality). Habitual wear is defined as a minimum of 6 hours of wear&#xD;
                  per day, for a minimum of 5 days per week during the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Possess a wearable pair of spectacles that provide correction for distance&#xD;
                  vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Habitual spherical contact lens powers must be between -1.00 D and -6.00 D&#xD;
                  (inclusive) in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. For Phase I, habitual contact lenses must provide at least 20/20 acuity OD and&#xD;
                  OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. For Phase II, the spherical equivalent of the subject's vertex-corrected distance&#xD;
                  refraction must be between -1.00 D and -6.00 D (inclusive) in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. For Phase II, the magnitude of the cylindrical component of the subject's&#xD;
                  vertex-corrected distance refraction must be between 0.00 D and 1.00 D&#xD;
                  (inclusive) in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. For Phase II, the best corrected, monocular, distance visual acuity must be 20/25&#xD;

                  abnormalities or bulbar injection) or other corneal or ocular disease or&#xD;
                  abnormalities that contraindicate contact lens wear or may otherwise compromise&#xD;
                  study endpoints (including entropion, ectropion, chalazia, recurrent styes,&#xD;

&#xD;
              13. Have signs of a contact lens-related corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past&#xD;
                  peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar).&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Have a history of eyelid injury, surgery or procedure that resulted in abnormal&#xD;
                  eyelid position or movement.&#xD;
