  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized, multi-center, double blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the&#xD;
      chemopreventive impact of atorvastatin (20 mg oral) vs placebo in up to 60 adults with&#xD;
      advanced fibrosis at high risk of developing HCC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to investigate the chemopreventive efficacy of atorvastatin (20 mg) on&#xD;
      HCC risk compared to placebo in adults with advanced fibrosis (i.e. METAVIR fibrosis stage&#xD;
      3-4) and high-risk PLS (defined by pre-randomization liver biopsy). HCC risk will be measured&#xD;
      by changes in prognostic liver signature (PLS) risk score after oral administration of&#xD;
      atorvastatin for 1 year with up to 5 years post-treatment of chart monitoring.&#xD;
