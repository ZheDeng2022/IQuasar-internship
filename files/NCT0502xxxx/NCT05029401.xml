      Study DMX-IB 201 is a Phase 1/2a study of ibogaine consisting of an initial single ascending&#xD;
      dose escalation stage to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or treat-to-target dose&#xD;
      (TTD) in healthy volunteers, followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof&#xD;
      of concept stage to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the selected dose in&#xD;
      opioid-dependent patients who seek medically supervised opioid withdrawal&#xD;
