  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Hong Kong, 7% of adolescents are diagnosed with anxiety disorders and one in every four&#xD;
      secondary school students reports clinical-level anxiety symptoms. However, the vast majority&#xD;
      (65%) of them do not access services. Long waitlists in public services, the high cost of&#xD;
      private services, or the fear of being stigmatized in school can hinder access to services.&#xD;
      The high prevalence of anxiety and low intervention uptake indicates that there is a need to&#xD;
      develop timely, scalable, and potent interventions suitable for adolescents. Growth mindset&#xD;
      single-session interventions (SSIs) have the potential to be scalable interventions for&#xD;
      diagnosable or subclinical psychopathology in adolescents. The key mechanism of effective&#xD;
      SSIs is to provide precise intervention on the key aspect to trigger sudden gains and symptom&#xD;
      reduction. The principal investigator's previous project (2019-2020) found a fixed mindset of&#xD;
      negative emotion more closely related to anxiety than was a fixed mindset of personality. The&#xD;
      findings provide strong support that intervention targeted on the fixed mindset of negative&#xD;
      emotion can be a more precise intervention for adolescent anxiety than the existing SSI on&#xD;
      growth mindset of personality (SSI-GP). The proposed study is to develop The Single-session&#xD;
      Intervention of Growth Mindset for Anxiety (SIGMA) to teach adolescents that negative&#xD;
      emotions can change and to compare its effectiveness in reducing anxiety to SSI-GP and an&#xD;
      active control group with a three-arm randomized control trial. Adolescents (N=549, ages&#xD;
      12-16) from secondary schools will be randomised to one of three intervention conditions: the&#xD;
      SIGMA, SSI-GP, or active control. All programs are approximately 40 minutes in length and&#xD;
      self-administered by youth. Adolescents will be assessed for their anxiety symptoms (primary&#xD;
      outcome), perceived control, hopelessness, and attitude towards help-seeking at&#xD;
      pre-intervention, and 2-week and 8-week follow-up. A pilot test has confirmed the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of SIGMA among adolescents. The investigators hypothesised that SIGMA and&#xD;
      SSI-GP will result in a larger reduction in anxiety symptoms than the control intervention at&#xD;
      the end of treatment and follow-up period. The investigators also predict SIGMA will have a&#xD;
      greater effect than SSI-GP. Intention-to-treat principle and linear regression-based maximum&#xD;
      likelihood multi-level models will be used for data analysis. The project brings together&#xD;
      experts in mindset research, local social work, web-based intervention, statistics, youth&#xD;
      mental health studies, and psychiatry. This study will provide evidence on what matters in&#xD;
      growth mindset interventions for adolescent anxiety and serve as a scalable and accessible&#xD;
      intervention to improve the well-being of young people.&#xD;

    <description>The SIGMA intervention group will adapt the SSI-GP protocol in two ways: (a) by introducing the growth mindset of emotions rather than personality and (b) providing an experiential process of negative emotion change. SIGMA also consists of five components: (a) an introduction to emotions and the brain for conveying a scientific understanding of emotion and growth mindset of negative emotions; (b) stories and testimonials from high-school-aged youths who described their beliefs that people's negative emotion states (e.g., anxiety, depression, and stress) are malleable, and how these mindsets influence their coping with anxiety; (c) emotion changing experience induced by short videos; (d) common questions and misconceptions about growth mindset; and (e) self-persuasion writing exercises in which the participants write notes to younger students about the growth mindset of emotion.</description>

    <description>The SSI-GP intervention group will use the intervention protocol of Project Personality (https://osf.io/a9uv2/). The investigators will translate it into Chinese using bilingual native English and Chinese speakers. The key potent elements of SSI-GP consist of five components [17, 40, 41]: (a) an introduction to the brain about the potential of neuroplasticity and behavioural change; (b) written testimonials from older, high-school-aged youths of their belief in change of personality; (c) additional vignettes written by older youths about how growth mindset of personality helped them succeed following setbacks; (d) overview of common questions and misconceptions about growth mindset; and (e) an exercise of writing notes to younger students about the malleability of people's personality traits.</description>

    <description>The control condition will be a structurally similar web-based session of supportive therapy. The goals of supportive therapy are to encourage the client to identify and express feelings and to share their emotions-both positive and negative-with close others. ST group does not teach or emphasize specific skills or beliefs. The active control group includes the same number of reading and writing activities as do the SIGMA and SSI-GP interventions. Also, to mirror the intervention groups as closely as possible, supportive therapy will include vignettes written by older, high-school-aged youths, who describe times when they benefited from sharing their feelings with friends or family members.</description>

    <description>This proposed study will use a three-arm, parallel group, randomized control trial design to evaluate the efficacy of SIGMA compared to both a web-based growth mindset SSI (SSI-GP) and an active web-based control programme. The concurrent parallel group structure assures that the different groups take part in their respective intervention at the same time.</description>
