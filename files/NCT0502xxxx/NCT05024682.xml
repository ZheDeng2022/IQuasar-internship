  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relatively complex anatomical structure of the pelvis has been a focus of study in the&#xD;
      medical field. The diagnosis of the causes of chronic pelvic pain is usually a complicated&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pudendal neuralgia is a syndrome that is characterized by pelvic pain, including bowel,&#xD;
      bladder regional pain or discomfort, sexual dysfunction, severe burning sensations and&#xD;
      needle-like pain, which are aggravated when seated and relieved after standing. pudendal&#xD;
      neuralgias are induced by pudendal nerve damage The mechanism of PRF has been studied&#xD;
      repeatedly. It has been verified that PRF has definite safe treatment range, but during the&#xD;
      PRF treatment, the tissue surrounding the electrode may have some degree of change and so it&#xD;
      is difficult to assess any actual damage.7 Based on electric field intensity, PRF can&#xD;
      actually produce tissue changes observable as in vitro changes to ultrastructure in&#xD;
      early-phase histologic study. These biological changes were converted to biological effect to&#xD;
      alleviate neuropathic pain in animal models.&#xD;

    <description>After connecting the electrode and the PRF needle, the interventionist determined whether the pudendal nerve innervation produced paresthesia in the sensory stimulation test with a frequency of 50 Hz, pulse width of 1 ms and a voltage of 0.3-0.5 V. Thereafter, the radiofrequency ablation therapy was performed in 42°C, 120 seconds pulse mode which consisted of four cycles (8 minutes)</description>
