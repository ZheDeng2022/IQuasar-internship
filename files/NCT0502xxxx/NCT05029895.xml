  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD; also known as atopic eczema) is an inflammatory skin disease. The&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of upadacitinib for AD has been well-documented in previous studies,&#xD;
      however, these studies included a limited number of adolescent patients in Japan. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this observational study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      upadacitinib in adolescent AD participants age 12 to &lt;18 years old in Japan in the real-world&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upadacitinib is an approved drug being developed for the treatment of AD in adolescents in&#xD;
      Japan. Around 170 participants age 12 to &lt;18 who are prescribed upadacitinib for the&#xD;
      treatment of AD in routine clinical practice will be enrolled at multiple sites in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral upadacitinib as prescribed by their physician. Data from these&#xD;
      participants will be collected for approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard&#xD;
      of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital&#xD;
      or clinic and will be asked to provide additional information by questionnaire at each visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reporting an Adverse Event (AE)/Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) including Safety Specification</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE/ADR is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. Safety specification is defined as: serious infections (including TB, pneumonia, pneumocystis pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage and opportunistic infections), herpes zoster, VTE (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus), gastrointestinal perforation, hepatic function disorder, Interstitial lung disease, neutrophil count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased and hemoglobin decreased, hepatitis B virus reactivation, malignancies, major adverse cardiac events, rhabdomyolysis and myopathy, and renal impairment, and safety in pediatric patients and weighing &lt;40 kg.</description>

    <description>An AE/ADR is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious AE (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent AEs/treatment-emergent SAEs (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug.</description>
