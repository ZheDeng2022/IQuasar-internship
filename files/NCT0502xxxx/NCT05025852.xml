  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of diabetes in pregnancy is rising, with rates of 1 in 7 pregnancies globally.&#xD;
      Metformin is used for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) outside of pregnancy and is now increasingly&#xD;
      prescribed during pregnancy. There are some concerns as metformin crosses the placenta and&#xD;
      effects on offspring exposed during pregnancy are unknown. Animal and human evidence indicate&#xD;
      that metformin may create an atypical in-utero environment similar to under-nutrition which&#xD;
      has been associated with adult obesity. This is supported by studies in children of mothers&#xD;
      treated with metformin in other populations where an increase in childhood obesity was found&#xD;
      at 4-9 years of age. We now have evidence from the MiTy trial, that offspring of&#xD;
      metformin-exposed women with T2DM have less large infants and are less adipose at birth, but&#xD;
      are also more likely to be small for gestational age (SGA). These effects could lead to&#xD;
      benefit or harm in the long-term. Offspring of MiTy mothers are currently being followed up&#xD;
      to 2 years. Given that long-term effects may not be evident until 5 years of age, it is&#xD;
      imperative to follow these children longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals/Research Aims:To determine whether in-utero exposure to metformin, in offspring of&#xD;
      women with T2DM, is beneficial or harmful in the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions: 1. In offspring of women with T2DM, how does treatment with metformin&#xD;
      during pregnancy affect a) adiposity b) growth over time c) metabolic syndrome d) cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral measures:2. What factors predict altered childhood adiposity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance in these offspring?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Body mass index (BMI) z-score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: 1) other measures of adiposity (i.e. skinfolds, 2) growth over time 3)&#xD;
      measures of insulin resistance 4) adipocytokines 5)neurodevelopment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes Given these increasing concerns, this study will inform the best treatment&#xD;
      for pregnant mothers with diabetes by studying the long-term outcomes of children exposed to&#xD;
      metformin during pregnancy.&#xD;
