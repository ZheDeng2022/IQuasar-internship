    <textblock>
      Opioid overuse is a widespread public health crisis in the United States with increasing&#xD;
      rates of addiction and overdose deaths from prescription opioids. Reducing the need for&#xD;
      opiate analgesics in the post-operative setting has become a high priority in minimizing&#xD;
      long-term opioid use in surgical patients. This study will serve to demonstrate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the addition of regional analgesic techniques in reducing post-operative opioid&#xD;
      requirements in patients undergoing common lumbar spinal surgical procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid abuse and misuse remain a public health crisis in the United States, notably in&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain from degenerative spine disease. Perioperative pain management for&#xD;
      patients undergoing spinal surgery remains largely reliant on opioid medications, with&#xD;
      several known adverse effects including, but not limited to delirium, postoperative urinary&#xD;
      retention (POUR), constipation and nausea. These side effects contribute to increased&#xD;
      hospital length of stay (LOS) with increased incidence of overall in-hospital complications,&#xD;
      perioperative costs, and increased rates of opioid habituation and addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependence on prescription opioids has been associated with wide-ranging social and economic&#xD;
      consequences including increased opioid overdose resulting in death, growing opioid-related&#xD;
      incarcerations, and spiraling opioid-related healthcare cost from treatment of addiction,&#xD;
      opioid-related mental health issues, and debilitating chronic pain. Long-term requirements&#xD;
      for opioid medications may be associated with the use of higher doses of opioids in the&#xD;
      perioperative period for patients undergoing invasive surgery for spinal degenerative&#xD;
      conditions. Studies have demonstrated that patients who consume fewer opioids for 30 days&#xD;
      after surgery are less likely to progress to become chronic opioid users. Regional analgesic&#xD;
      techniques have shown promise in decreasing post-operative pain and opioid requirements in&#xD;
      thoracic and abdominal surgery but difficulties with post-operative neurological assessments&#xD;
      have limited their use in spinal surgery. Inter-fascial plane blocks, however, have emerged&#xD;
      as a safe and potentially useful regional analgesic technique to mitigate the pain-inducing&#xD;
      effects of posterior spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector Spinae Plane Blocks (ESPBs), specifically, involve ultra-sound guided injection of&#xD;
      local anesthetic (LA) posteriorly beneath the erector spinae muscles resulting in&#xD;
      longitudinal and ventrolateral spread of the anesthetic into the paravertebral space where&#xD;
      the ventral and dorsal rami of the spinal nerves are located thereby inducing a multi-level&#xD;
      analgesic effect. Depending upon the LA used, this effect may last for 4 to 36 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will examine the efficacy of preoperative ESPBs in reducing post-operative&#xD;
      opioid utilization and its associated complications specifically after minimally invasive&#xD;
      (MIS) lumbar spine surgery including both decompressive and instrumented fusion procedures.&#xD;
      The guiding principle of MIS spine surgery is reduction of iatrogenic injury by utilizing&#xD;
      muscle dilating approaches and tubular retractors rather than conventional open,&#xD;
      subperiosteal muscle stripping techniques. The latter typically results in muscle denervation&#xD;
      and devascularization as well as postoperative muscle atrophy and dead space creation that&#xD;
      increase postoperative pain, muscle dysfunction, prolonged recovery times and complications.&#xD;
      Since MIS spinal surgical procedures preserve normal paraspinal musculature compared to open&#xD;
      surgery, the magnitude of effect of ESPBs may actually be more pronounced in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by conducting this investigation within the rigor of a&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, the results will definitively&#xD;
      demonstrate that the addition of regional analgesia in the form of ESPB during MIS lumbar&#xD;
      spine surgery will 1) reduce post-operative opioid consumption and 2) reduce opioid-related&#xD;
      complications and hospital LOS but 3) have no adverse effects on postoperative pain control.&#xD;
