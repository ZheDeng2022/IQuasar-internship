  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to further develop and evaluate a computerized cognitive-training&#xD;
      program designed to extend older adults' functional independence and reduce accidental falls&#xD;
      (i.e., reduce factors that contribute to fall risk; including cognitive abilities/executive&#xD;
      functions). This intervention may benefit a large population of vulnerable older adults with&#xD;
      elevated fall risk and lack of long-term viable treatment options.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will employ a single arm study open label usability/feasibility study&#xD;
      comprised of a computerized training program that targets core executive functions (working&#xD;
      memory, inhibition), speed of processing and sustained attention, and is grounded on design&#xD;
      principles that drive adaptive brain plasticity to improve cognitive function and bolster&#xD;
      functional abilities in older adults with an elevated fall risk.&#xD;

    <description>The scoring for this answer is based on a 0 to 10 scale. Those who respond with a score of 9 to 10 are called Promoters, and are considered likely to exhibit value-creating behaviors, such as making more positive referrals to other potential program participants. Those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors, and they are believed to be less likely to exhibit the value-creating behaviors. Responses of 7 and 8 are labeled Passives, and their behavior falls between Promoters and Detractors. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. For purposes of calculating a Net Promoter Score, Passives count toward the total number of respondents, thus decreasing the percentage of detractors and promoters and pushing the net score toward 0.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants who are 65 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant with at least one self-reported fall within the last 1 year or a&#xD;
             self-reported balance impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with a score â‰¥ 19 on the telephone-administered Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
             Assessment (T-MoCA; without the visual elements).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants who are fluent English speakers from the age of 12, per self-report, to&#xD;
             ensure reasonable neuropsychological results on key assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must have adequate sensorimotor capacity to perform the program, including&#xD;
             visual capacity adequate to read from a computer screen at a normal viewing distance,&#xD;
             auditory capacity adequate to understand normal speech, and motor capacity adequate to&#xD;
             control a computer mouse or a tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants who have a severe walking or balance impairment, not associated solely&#xD;
             with cognitive decline (self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with vertigo (self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with an uncorrected visual acuity of less than 20/80&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with untreated psychiatric conditions, including substance&#xD;
             abuse/dependence disorders, recent hospitalization, ongoing chemotherapy or other&#xD;
             cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants with medical illnesses, injuries or conditions predisposing to imminent&#xD;
             functional and/or cognitive decline (e.g. multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain&#xD;
             injury, dementia, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants enrolled in a concurrent clinical trial involving an intervention&#xD;
             targeting physical functioning to prevent falls; investigational pharmaceutical;&#xD;
             nutraceutical; medical device; or behavioral treatment that could affect the outcome&#xD;
             of this study. However, participation in standard treatments (e.g., occupational&#xD;
             therapy) or use of prescribed medications (e.g., anti-depressants) is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants using computer-based cognitive training programs or has used it within a&#xD;
             month of the consent date. Participants who answered 'yes' to questions 5 (Active&#xD;
             Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent) on the Columbia-Suicide Severity&#xD;
             Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or 'yes' to any of the suicide-related behaviors (actual&#xD;
             attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory act or behavior) on the&#xD;
             C-SSRS &quot;Suicidal Behavior&quot; if the ideation or behavior occurred within 2 months from&#xD;
             Participant's date of consent.&#xD;
