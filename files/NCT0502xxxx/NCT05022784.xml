      This is a non-interventional cohort study using existing administrative data from the U.S.&#xD;
      Medicare program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of adherence trajectories of nintedanib among Idiopathic Pulmonary&#xD;
           Fibrosis (IPF) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding characteristics of patients within each nintedanib adherence trajectory&#xD;
           among IPF patients.&#xD;
