      The study was conducted to determine the effect of visceral manipulation on menstrual&#xD;
      irregularities and hormonal profile in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Thirty women&#xD;
      were randomly and equally assigned into the group (A) (Control group), who received a low&#xD;
      caloric diet (1200 Kcal/day) only for 3 months, and the group (B) (Study group), who received&#xD;
      visceral manipulation to the pelvic organs and the related structures in addition to the same&#xD;
      low-calorie diet as the group (A). Evaluations pre and post-study were done for body weight,&#xD;
      BMI, female reproductive hormones, and menstruation-related problems.&#xD;

      The current study was conducted to determine the effect of visceral manipulation on menstrual&#xD;
      irregularities and hormonal profile in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Thirty&#xD;
      women having PCOS were chosen from the outpatient clinic of the faculty of physical therapy,&#xD;
      Cairo University. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups equal in number. Group (A)&#xD;
      (Control group), 15 PCOS women received a low caloric diet (1200 Kcal/day) for 3 months,&#xD;
      while group (B) (Study group), 15 PCOS women received visceral manipulation to the pelvic&#xD;
      organs and the related structures (8 sessions, once per week in the first month then once&#xD;
      every other week for two months) in addition to the same low-calorie diet as the group (A).&#xD;
      Evaluations pre and post-study for body weight, body mass index, female reproductive hormones&#xD;
      [luteinizinghormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH/FSH ratio] and&#xD;
      menstruation-related problems were done by weight- height scale, blood analysis, and&#xD;
      menstruation-specific domain of polycystic ovary syndrome health-related quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire (PCOSQ), respectively.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Polycystic ovarian women were assigned to either group (A), receiving a low-calorie diet for three months, or group (B), receiving the same diet as group (A) together with visceral manipulation of the pelvic organs and their related structures for the same study period (three months).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>an independent researcher assigned the participants to one of the two study groups, by opening sealed envelopes containing serially ordered numbers. An independent assessor analyzed the patients' blood samples for hormonal profile and another assessor blinded to patients' allocation interviewed the patients for the questionnaire and assessed the weight.</masking_description>
