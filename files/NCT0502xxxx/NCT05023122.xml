  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of bony fusion is a dynamic bone remodeling process and a variety of risk factors&#xD;
      have been identified to contribute to pseudoarthrosis.Vitamin D deficiency has been reported&#xD;
      to be associated with more pseudoarthrosis, prolonged time to fusion, and poorer spine&#xD;
      function and quality of life after spinal fusion.However, as the review article presented, it&#xD;
      lacks high-quality evidence to investigate the role of vitamin D supplements in spinal&#xD;
      fusion. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      oral vitamin D supplements on fusion outcomes in patients receiving elective lumbar spinal&#xD;
      fusion.&#xD;

    <measure>spine function at postoperative 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>postoperative 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spine function was evaluated using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), which contains 10 patient-completed questions addressing spinal function. Each question is presented as 6-point Likert scales from 0 to 5 (0 = best outcome, 5 = worst outcome). The overall ODI score ranges from 0% to 100% and a lower score indicates better function.</description>
