  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluoride foam and fluoride varnish are effectiveness in prevention deciduous dental caries.&#xD;
      However, the relative clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these two interventions are&#xD;
      uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the relative clinical effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of fluoride foam and fluoride varnish in preventing dental caries in the&#xD;
      primary teeth of preschool children with high caries risk.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This 24-month randomized clinical trial aims to compare the clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of topical fluoride application of fluoride foam and fluoride varnish in&#xD;
      preventing dental caries in the primary teeth of preschool children with high caries risk in&#xD;
      Harbin,Heilongjiang Province,China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preschool children (3-4 years) with high caries risk will be invited to participant in this&#xD;
      study. An invitation letter will be sent to the parents explaining the purpose and procedures&#xD;
      of this study.Parental concent will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be randomly divided into three groups: the control group-no intervention;&#xD;
      the intervention group 1 - applications of 1.23% fluoride foam every 6 months; the&#xD;
      intervention group 2- applications of 2.26% fluoride varnish every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental clinical examination of the children will be performed at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study,12 months and 24 months later.The dental examiners will receive unified training and&#xD;
      consistency test of dental caries survey.Only when the Kappa value reached 0.8 can oral&#xD;
      examiners participate in the oral examination.Dental caries condition will be recorded.&#xD;
      Approximately 5% of children will be re-examined to determine the reliability of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The status of any possible side/adverse effects will be recorded in the follow-up&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of the study will be analysed by SPSS Statistical Analysis Software.The differences&#xD;
      among the groups will be calculated and compared. And p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
