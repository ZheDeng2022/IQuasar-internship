      This study aims to compare the clinical performance of two daily disposable toric contact&#xD;
      lenses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-centre, randomised, open-label, crossover, bilateral study, controlled&#xD;
      by cross-comparison. Up to 55 subjects will use each lens type for a week in random sequence.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits for each lens will be performed after one week of wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenses will be worn on a daily wear, daily disposable wear schedule.&#xD;

             Statement of Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They currently wear soft contact lenses or have done so in the past two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have a spherical component of their contact lens prescription between Plano to -&#xD;
             6.00DS (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They have a cylindrical component of their contact lens prescription between -0.75DC&#xD;
             and -2.50DC (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. They can be satisfactorily fitted with the study lens types.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. At dispensing, they can attain at least 6/12 distance high contrast visual acuity in&#xD;
             each eye with the study lenses within the available power range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They are willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least five days per week and for&#xD;
             at least eight hours per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. They own a wearable pair of spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. They agree not to participate in other clinical research while enrolled on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They have a systemic disorder, which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They are aphakic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or&#xD;
             have keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. They are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They have eye or health conditions including immunosuppressive or infectious diseases,&#xD;
             which would, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicate contact lens wear or&#xD;
             pose a risk to study personnel; or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. They are currently wearing one of the study contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or&#xD;
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.&#xD;
