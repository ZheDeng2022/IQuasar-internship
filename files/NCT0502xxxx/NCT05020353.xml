      Oral fluid based HIV Self-testing (HIVST) provides another innovative and simple option to&#xD;
      increase opportunities for HIV testing. At-home testing for HIV using oral fluid has been FDA&#xD;
      approved and in use in the USA since 2012, and studies have also shown that interest and&#xD;
      acceptability of HIVST with oral fluid is high in other global settings. However data for&#xD;
      oral fluid based HIVST within key populations and those at high risk for HIV infection in&#xD;
      Canada is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves around 900 persons who are non-healthcare professionals and inexperienced&#xD;
      in HIV self-testing (intended users) and are presenting at clinic sites across Canada for HIV&#xD;
      testing. It will evaluate the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity), usability (persons&#xD;
      performs test correctly) and readability (persons successfully interpret test results) of the&#xD;
      OraQuick® HIV Self-Test when performed by persons representing intended users living in&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final report of study results will be provided to the Test manufacturer for inclusion in&#xD;
      the Health Canada license application process.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-testing for HIV is an approach with the potential to increase the access, uptake and&#xD;
      frequency of HIV testing for those who may not otherwise test and remain undiagnosed. There&#xD;
      is increasing evidence showing the acceptability and usability of HIV self-testing (HIVST) in&#xD;
      various key populations. In 2016 the World Health Organization recommended HIVST as an&#xD;
      alternative option to complement existing HIV testing opportunities. Since then, HIVST use&#xD;
      has been scaling up rapidly; for example, Canada's first blood-based (fingerstick) HIV&#xD;
      self-test was licensed for use in November 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral fluid based HIVST provides another innovative and simple option to increase&#xD;
      opportunities for HIV testing. At-home testing for HIV using oral fluid has been FDA approved&#xD;
      and in use in the USA since 2012, and studies have also shown that interest and acceptability&#xD;
      of HIVST with oral fluid is high in other global settings. However data for oral fluid based&#xD;
      HIVST within key populations and those at high risk for HIV infection in Canada is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having a licensed oral fluid HIV self-test in addition to the licensed blood-based HIV&#xD;
      self-test will allow individuals to choose what is best for them and increase the potential&#xD;
      to reach the undiagnosed living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the accuracy, usability (persons performs test correctly) and&#xD;
      readability (persons successfully interpret test results) of the OraQuick® HIV Self-Test when&#xD;
      performed by persons representing intended users living in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OraQuick Self-test as performed by intended users (non-healthcare professional and&#xD;
      inexperienced in HIV self-testing) will meet or exceed the accuracy, usability and label&#xD;
      comprehension requirements from Health Canada for license as a Class IV in vitro diagnostic&#xD;
      device for Canadian market entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed around the requirements set out in the Health Canada Guidance&#xD;
      Document: &quot;Guidance for Manufacturers of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Rapid Diagnostic&#xD;
      Tests (RDT's) for Use at Point of Care or Self Testing, 2017&quot;. It is an investigational&#xD;
      device trial designed as a cross-sectional study which employs observational and&#xD;
      interview-based methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population requirements published by Health Canada stipulates that the prospective&#xD;
      study include: 900 lay persons with unknown HIV status including 400 persons at risk for HIV&#xD;
      infection (e.g. intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, etc.). Self-reported&#xD;
      practices or behaviour will be used to define those at high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 900 participants (non-healthcare professional and inexperienced in HIV&#xD;
      self-testing) will read the instructions for use and conduct the OraQuick® HIV Self-Test.&#xD;
      They will not be provided any training prior to use of the test. A trained healthcare&#xD;
      provider or researcher (trained Observer) will watch, and document use of the test and&#xD;
      independently read the participants self-test result. The participants will then complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire to share their opinion on usability and label comprehension of this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 400 (of the 900) participants will also be provided five mock devices with&#xD;
      different results and asked to interpret those results i.e. strong positive; weak positive,&#xD;
      negative, invalid with no control and no test line, and invalid with no control and a&#xD;
      positive test line. This will evaluate readability of this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also have a venous blood sample collected for testing of plasma at a&#xD;
      central laboratory with a 4th generation (Ag/Ab combo) HIV enzyme immunoassay that will serve&#xD;
      as the comparator method (laboratory reference testing). All self-tests will be confirmed&#xD;
      using a Canadian standard HIV testing algorithm. The sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      self-test result will be calculated relative to the &quot;clinical truth&quot; of the participants' HIV&#xD;
      status determined by the confirmatory test process, where applicable. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to return to the clinic for a follow-up visit, two (2) weeks after self-testing to&#xD;
      obtain their laboratory test results which will be their official result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited to the study when they come in for voluntary HIV testing (e.g.&#xD;
      POC testing) at a minimum of 3 study sites (different geographic locations). If persons&#xD;
      consent to participating, all those enrolled will voluntarily complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      (collecting demographics and HIV medical history information) and then provide their venous&#xD;
      whole blood sample (for standard of care, laboratory confirmatory testing and comparator&#xD;
      method), complete the OraQuick® HIV Self-Test (read test instructions, sample collection,&#xD;
      sample testing, result interpretation), complete mock result interpretation, and complete&#xD;
      questionnaires - Visit 1 (day 1; about 60 minutes). All patients will be instructed to return&#xD;
      to the clinic for a follow-up visit two (2) weeks later to obtain their laboratory test&#xD;
      results (Visit 2; about 15 - 60 minutes), post -test counselling, and to be linked to&#xD;
      appropriate care depending on the test results..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may also have a point-of-care (POC) test conducted on site as part of the clinic's&#xD;
      standard of care testing, outside of the protocol and after all study procedures for Visit 1&#xD;
      are completed.&#xD;
