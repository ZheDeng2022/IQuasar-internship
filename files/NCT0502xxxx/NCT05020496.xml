  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine novel mechanisms for ultraviolet light&#xD;
      (UV)-induced suppression of the immune system in human subjects and to improve understanding&#xD;
      of UV-induced skin carcinogenesis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sunlight is the major environmental agent to which the skin is exposed. Injudicious exposure&#xD;
      to wavelengths in the ultraviolet spectrum can lead to sunburn, aging of the skin, skin&#xD;
      cancer and a variety of photosensitivity diseases, many of which have an immunologic&#xD;
      pathogenesis. American Cancer Society acknowledges that most skin cancers are a direct result&#xD;
      of exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight. Skin cancer has also been linked to&#xD;
      exposure to some artificial sources of UV rays (indoor tanning, welding and metal work, and&#xD;
      phototherapy). UV, in addition to producing mutant cells, also impairs host cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune responses that have evolved to identify and eradicate the mutant cells before they&#xD;
      develop into clinically apparent malignancies. In fact, organ transplant recipients who are&#xD;
      treated with immunosuppressive medications have a greatly increased risk (up to 100 times) of&#xD;
      UV induced skin cancers and the tumors that do develop behave more aggressively. Triggering&#xD;
      receptor expressed on myeloid cells (Trem)-1 is highly expressed by myeloid cells in human&#xD;
      infectious and inflammatory diseases and is associated with poor prognosis of cancer&#xD;
      patients. However, most studies have focused on Trem1 mediated effects on innate immune cells&#xD;
      such as neutrophils in inflammatory reactions. Little is known about whether and how Trem1&#xD;
      regulates the adaptive immunity, especially the activity of antigen presenting cells (APC) to&#xD;
      regulate the activation and function of antigen specific T cells. Our study will demonstrate&#xD;
      a novel mechanism for Trem1 signaling in T cell mediated immune responses and&#xD;
      photocarcinogenesis in skin. Different biological parameters in UV exposed skin tissues will&#xD;
      be analyzed, which are crucial for UV-induced DNA damage, erythema, and immune suppressive&#xD;
      effects that have been directly associated with photoimmunology and implicated in the risk of&#xD;
      skin cancer. These will correlated with the responsiveness of allergen induced contact&#xD;
      hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be stratified based on gender and then randomly assigned to: 1) Control 2)&#xD;
      Non-UVB, or 3) UVB groups. The primary endpoint for the study will be the CHS evaluation on&#xD;
      day 34.The Control group no DPCP (Group 1) will serve as a negative control while the UVB &amp;&#xD;
      diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) group (Group 2) will serves as a positive control for&#xD;
      measurement of response to irritant (contact hypersensitivity = CHS). Subjects in the UVB,&#xD;
      DPCP, and Biopsy group (Group 3), who have no more than one standard deviation above the mean&#xD;
      of CHS from the negative Control group, will be considered as Non-responders.&#xD;

    <description>First application: This group of the study will take approximately 2 days and requires 2 visits. At the first visit, a patch of the contact sensitizer or irritant, diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) will be applied to a two-inch square area of the skin over the upper inner arm. DPCP is available clinically and is used by dermatologists for the immunotherapy of alopecia areata and warts. The second visit will be 48 hours after the DPCP treatment. At this visit, the skin thickness will be measured using a simple spring-loaded caliper.&#xD;
Second application: Various DPCP doses will be applied to filter-paper-lined, 8-mm Finn Chambers as 10 μL of the appropriate concentration of DPCP in acetone to give the required dose range, increasing by 60% increments. The doses will be 1·24, 1·98, 3·17, 5·1 and 8·12 μg cm-2. In addition, a vehicle control patch loaded with 10 μL of acetone will be applied. Patches will be removed exactly 6 h after second application.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group of the study will take 5 visits. At the first visit, six two-inch area squares of the skin on the left upper buttock will be exposed once to increasing doses of UV light.&#xD;
The second visit will be 24 hours after UV exposure, when redness of the skin will be measured.&#xD;
The third visit will be on the 11th day, when skin sites on the right upper buttock will be topically treated with DPCP for first application.&#xD;
First application: A single dose of DPCP will be placed on the upper buttock for 48 hours.&#xD;
The fourth visit will be four weeks after the first application of DPCP, when DPCP will be re-applied on the right upper inner arm with the same agent.&#xD;
Second application: The DPCP doses will be applied to patches, which will be removed exactly 6 h after second application.&#xD;
The fifth and final visit will be 48 hours after the second DPCP treatment, when skin thickness will be measured using a simple spring-loaded caliper.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group of the study will require 10 visits.&#xD;
First and second visits will be similar to those of Group 1.&#xD;
The third visit will be on the 8th day, when participants will have two marked skin sites exposed to UV at 2 minimal erythemal dose (MED) on 4 days (day 8-11).&#xD;
After last UV exposure (11th day), one UV exposed skin site will be topically treated with a patch of DPCP.&#xD;
First application: A single dose of DPCP will be placed on the upper buttock for 48 hours.&#xD;
The seventh visit will be on the 12th day, when two skin biopsies will be taken, one from a non-UV exposed skin area and the other biopsy from the UV exposed skin site.&#xD;
The ninth visit will be four weeks after the first application with DPCP, participants will have DPCP re-applied on the upper inner arm.&#xD;
Second application: The DPCP doses will be applied to patches, which will be removed from skin exactly 6 h after second application.&#xD;
The tenth visit will be 48 hours after the DPCP treatment.</description>
