  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the gut microbiome (i.e. bacteria, viruses, and fungi&#xD;
      that reside in the gut) of people undergoing abdominal surgery, evaluate whether specific&#xD;
      diets can change the gut microbiome, and, if so, whether those changes translate into better&#xD;
      surgical outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Standard of care: patients undergoing major abdominal colorectal surgery are sometimes&#xD;
      advised to eat healthfully prior to surgery, but without more specific recommendations&#xD;
      regarding their diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening: eligible patients will be identified through screening the clinic schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enrollment: in person or remotely, after the patient is determined to require major&#xD;
           abdominal surgery, they will be invited to participate in the study. If they consent to&#xD;
           participate, they will be randomized to receive either low-fat/high-fiber diet,&#xD;
           high-fermented diet, or continue with their normal diet for 10 days prior to the&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention: at baseline, data will be collected regarding clinical information of the&#xD;
           patients (age, body mass index, comorbidities, medications or supplements, physical&#xD;
           activity levels, antibiotic or probiotic use in the past six months), and baseline&#xD;
           dietary pattern, which will be evaluated through application of a validated Food&#xD;
           Frequency Questionnaire. Patients in the intervention arms (low- fat/high-fiber diet or&#xD;
           high-fermented diet) will receive all their meals for the 10 days preceding surgery.&#xD;
           Patients in the control arm will receive a $25 grocery voucher Adherence to the diet&#xD;
           will be checked daily through a digital application (SmartIntakeÂ®), which collects and&#xD;
           analyzes data through the Remote Food Photography Method. Stool samples will be&#xD;
           collected in five moments: at the beginning of the study, after the 10-day dietary&#xD;
           intervention, during surgery, upon the first bowel movement after surgery, and between&#xD;
           21-30 days after surgery. The stool samples will be sent for analysis of the microbiome.&#xD;
           A fragment of the resected bowel will also be sent for analysis of the microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Closeout: After surgery, all patients will receive the same standard dietary protocol&#xD;
           and care, and will be followed for 30 days without any further intervention.&#xD;
