    <textblock>
      Our main aim for this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome comparisons between sural&#xD;
      artery and Supramalleolar flap in the reconstruction of extensive defects of non-weight&#xD;
      bearing regions of foot and ankle. The patients' information were collected through medical&#xD;
      records and analyzed through SPSS&#xD;

      In this article we intend to present our experience comparing a series of the two types of&#xD;
      flaps in terms of viability, coverage of defect, cosmetic appearance, and functions of foot&#xD;
      and ankle based on self-designed Tool . This Tool contains 4 parameters i.e., Activity of&#xD;
      daily living, coverage of defect, cosmetic appearance of Skin post flap, and Weight bearing&#xD;
      status. A score was given to each parameter and on the basis of these scores, Long term&#xD;
      outcome were analyzed of each patient&#xD;

        Data of all those patients was collected who underwent reconstruction of soft tissue&#xD;
        defects of foot and ankle with Supramalleolar and sural artery flaps between 1996 and 2020.&#xD;
        The data of these patients were collected from the Hospital inpatient management system and&#xD;
        review of medical records through a structured proforma that included demographic&#xD;
        variables, cause of soft tissue defects (secondary to open fractures, following debridement&#xD;
        of chronic infected wounds, tumor excision and defects following release of scar&#xD;
        contractures), side of defects, size and type of flap (supramalleolar or sural artery),&#xD;
        complications and long-term outcome of the flap.&#xD;
