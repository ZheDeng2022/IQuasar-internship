    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial. During this study, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) and mRNA&#xD;
      COVID vaccine either simultaneously or sequentially, 14 days apart. A second dose of mRNA&#xD;
      COVID vaccine will be administered either 3 or 4 weeks following the first dose, depending&#xD;
      upon the mRNA COVID vaccine received for participants receiving their initial dose of mRNA&#xD;
      COVID vaccine. For those receiving a third dose of mRNA COVID vaccine, there will not be a&#xD;
      second dose. Solicited symptoms of reactogenicity will be assessed on vaccination day and&#xD;
      daily during the 7 days following each Vaccination Visit using either electronic or paper&#xD;
      symptoms diaries, depending on study participant preference. Quality of life data will be&#xD;
      collected using electronic or paper diaries on day of Vaccination Visit 1 and daily during&#xD;
      the 7 days following the visit. Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest&#xD;
      will be collected throughout the duration of the study. Serum samples from participants will&#xD;
      be collected for determination of COVID-19 seropositivity at baseline. Serum samples will be&#xD;
      taken throughout the study to determine IIV4 immunogenicity and for potential future studies.&#xD;
