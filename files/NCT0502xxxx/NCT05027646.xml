  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the BE and adhesion properties of granisetron transdermal&#xD;
      patches manufactured at 2 different sites. The study has been designed in accordance with the&#xD;
      FDA Guidance for Industry. Bioequivalence will be based on the Cmax and AUC to determine the&#xD;
      peak and total drug exposure, respectively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, 2-part, open-label, crossover study in healthy subjects&#xD;
      to establish bioequivalence (Part 1) and evaluate adhesion (Part 2) between granisetron&#xD;
      transdermal patches manufactured at 2 different sites (Sancuso [test] and Sancuso&#xD;
      [reference]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each part of the study will consist of a screening period, check-in days, treatment periods,&#xD;
      washout period (Part 1 only), and an end-of-study visit. The duration of subject&#xD;
      participation, excluding screening, for Part 1 is approximately 39 days and for Part 2 is&#xD;
      approximately 17 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion of the patch to the skin is assessed by the FDA 0-4 scoring system. The scoring for adhesion is: 0 = ≥ 90% adhered (essentially no lift off the skin), 1 = ≥ 75% to &lt; 90% adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin), 2 = ≥ 50% to &lt; 75% adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin), 3 = &gt; 0% to &lt; 50% adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off), and 4 = 0% adhered (patched completely off the skin). Adhesion is assessed daily when patches are insitu. The mean adhesion score will be derived from its individual adhesion scores at each assessment time point, averaged across all the equally spaced time points (except baseline timepoint). Difference in mean adhesion score between test and reference transdermal patches will be compared using a mixed-model analysis of variance.</description>

    <measure>Adhesion performance score (FDA Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion of the patch to the skin is assessed by the FDA 0-4 scoring system. The scoring for adhesion is: 0 = ≥ 90% adhered (essentially no lift off the skin), 1 = ≥ 75% to &lt; 90% adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin), 2 = ≥ 50% to &lt; 75% adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin), 3 = &gt; 0% to &lt; 50% adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off), and 4 = 0% adhered (patched completely off the skin). Adhesion is assessed daily when patches are insitu. Proportion of subjects with adhesion performance score of interest will be compared between the test and reference transdermal patches. Time to mean adhesion score more than or equal to 2 will be investigated graphically if data warrant.</description>
