  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients experience pain after their knee replacement surgery - and some may continue to&#xD;
      experience persistent pain long after their knee replacement surgery. Traditional pain&#xD;
      management strategies reply on pain medication such as opioids for pain control. However,&#xD;
      these drugs do not work well for pain associated with movement or the the nerve pain&#xD;
      (tingling, electrical sensations) after surgery. In addition, opioids are associated with&#xD;
      significant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, depression,&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction and risk of persistent opioid use. Neuropathic pain medications, such&#xD;
      as venlafaxine are effective in managing nerve pain. Recent studies also support its&#xD;
      potential role in acute pain management. Here, we propose a prospective randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial 1) to evaluate the efficacy of Venlafaxine in reducing pain intensity and opioid&#xD;
      consumption at post-operative day 1 (POD1) and 1- week after surgery, and 2) to examine&#xD;
      whether the use of Venlafaxine will reduce the incidents of chronic postsurgical pain in TKA&#xD;
      patients at 3-month time point.&#xD;

      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either Venlafaxine&#xD;
      extended release (ER) 37.5 mg/d or a placebo on the day of surgery and continue the treatment&#xD;
      for 7 days after surgery. The primary outcomes include pain severity score (numeric rating&#xD;
      scale, NRS) and consumption of morphine miligram equivalent (MME) at 24 hours. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome will measure MME and NRS at postoperative day 7. In addition, the disability scale&#xD;
      and perceived function 3 months after surgery will be compared to the baseline level by using&#xD;
      PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System)10 Global Health, KOOS, JR.&#xD;
      (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Short Form), and VR-12 (Veterans RAND 12 Item&#xD;
      Health Survey) Scale.&#xD;

    <description>Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score short form, veterans RAND 12 (VR12) item health survey. The results of the VR-12 are summarized as two scores - a Mental Component Score (MCS) and a Physical Component Score (PCS). The United States population average PCS and MCS are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Therefore, each increment of 10 points above or below 50 corresponds to one standard deviation away from the population average.</description>
