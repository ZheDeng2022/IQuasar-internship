  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neurosurgical standard of care for treating a patient with a tumor invading hand primary&#xD;
      motor cortex (M1) includes performing a craniotomy with intraoperative direct electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (DES) mapping and to resect as much tumor as possible without a resultant&#xD;
      permanent neurological deficit. However, the subjective nature of current intraoperative hand&#xD;
      motor assessments do not offer a comprehensive understanding of how hand strength and&#xD;
      function may be impacted by resection. Additionally, there is a paucity of data to inform how&#xD;
      altering DES parameters may effect motor mapping. Here, the investigators seek to demonstrate&#xD;
      a feasible, standardized protocol to quantitatively assess hand strength and function and&#xD;
      systematically assess several stimulation parameters to improve intraoperative measurements&#xD;
      and better understand how cortical stimulation interacts with underlying neural function.&#xD;
