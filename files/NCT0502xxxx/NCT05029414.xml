    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is one of the main causes of disability and loss of quality&#xD;
      adjusted life years. This study is to analyze whether endovascular therapy (EVT) in addition&#xD;
      to best medical treatment (BMT) reduces the degree of disability and dependency in daily&#xD;
      activities after a Medium Vessel Occlusion (MeVO) stroke compared to BMT alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is one of the main causes of death and disability and thereby the&#xD;
      third leading cause of loss of quality adjusted life years. For patients with an AIS due to&#xD;
      an occlusion of the large vessels of the anterior circulation, endovascular therapy (EVT) has&#xD;
      become a treatment standard. 20-40% of all AIS patients have occlusions of smaller vessels&#xD;
      and present with a more distal isolated Medium Vessel Occlusion (MeVO). The primary objective&#xD;
      of this randomized trial is to determine whether patients experiencing an AIS due to an&#xD;
      isolated medium vessel occlusion have superior functional outcome (measured with the Modified&#xD;
      Rankin Scale &quot;mRS&quot; at 90 days) when treated with EVT plus best medical treatment (BMT)&#xD;
      compared to patients treated with BMT alone. In this trial, all commercially available,&#xD;
      CE-certified revascularisation devices (i.e. stent-retriever, aspiration catheters and&#xD;
      balloon guide catheters) can be used for EVT. All established techniques for the endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of AIS patients are permitted and all decisions regarding treatment technique and&#xD;
      choice of devices and/or medications are made solely by the treating physician.&#xD;

    <measure>Degree of dependency and disability in everyday life (measured with the mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 90 days (± 14 days) after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the degree of dependency and disability in everyday life (measured with the mRS) at 90 days. The mRS is the standard tool to assess neurological outcome in trials with acute severe brain disease. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms (= 0) to death (= 6).</description>

    <measure>Change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post-randomization (+/- 6 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is made up of 11 different elements that evaluate specific ability. The score for each ability is a number between 0 and 4, 0 being normal functioning and 4 being completely impaired. The patient's NIHSS score is calculated by adding the number for each element of the scale; 42 is the highest score possible. In the NIHSS, the higher the score, the more impaired a stroke patient is.</description>
