      The 8-week, Prospective, Randomized controlled of IntraDermal administration of Comirnaty® 6&#xD;
      microgram compare to Intramuscular Comirnaty® 30 microgram by 28 days interval Efficacy Study&#xD;
      in 4 groups of healthy volunteer ( 1 people who complete sinovac vaccination 2 people who&#xD;
      received 1 dosage of AstraZeneca vaccine 3 naive vaccination 4 any other vaccination not in&#xD;
      1-3 with anti Spike antibody less than 650 AU/ ml) . Comparison of antibody level and T cell&#xD;
      response to SAR-CoV-2 antigen in vitro after 28 day post vaccination is primary outcome and&#xD;
      the side effect as well as infection rate in 8 weeks is secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      The 8-week, Prospective, Randomized controlled of IntraDermal administration of Comirnaty® 6&#xD;
      microgram compare to Intramuscular Comirnaty® 30 microgram by 28 days interval Efficacy Study&#xD;
      in healthy volunteer.To compare the AntiSpike antibody, ( Anti RBD ) neutralized antibody (&#xD;
      if possible) of SAR-CoV-2 and T-cell response after injection with Intradermal Comirnaty® 6&#xD;
      microgram versus Intramuscular Comirnaty® 30 microgram by 28 days interval in healthy&#xD;
      volunteer in various immunological background groups.1000 patients with or with out&#xD;
      vaccinated and with our without history of previous COVID-19 infection (in various&#xD;
      immunological background ) will be recruited and received Comirnaty® 6 microgram versus&#xD;
      Intramuscular Comirnaty® 30 microgram by 28 days interval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signed informed consent by any patient capable of giving consent, or, when the patient&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Able to follow up the vaccination schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient with known hypersensitivity or intolerance to Comirnaty® or Polyethylene glycol&#xD;
           (PEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient with previous receiveing mRNA vaccine ( Pfizer, Moderna or other).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregnancy with gestational age less than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient with History of immunosuppessive drug ( oral , IV, IM ) of which discontinue&#xD;
           less than 6 month or any immunological abnormality which impact to Antibody production&#xD;
           and T cell function ( eg hypergammaglobulinemia, active immne deficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient with previous used of Intravenous immunoglobulin in previous 6 month&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient with history of abnormal coagulation or contraindication for intramuscular&#xD;
           injection or intradermal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient with end stage disease or disease with life expectancy less than 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient with previous use of medication interfere with serum interferon other cytokine&#xD;
           system or disease with cytokine abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patient with history of abnormal platelet or platelet dysfunction, blood coagulopathy&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis or systemic tuberculosis, atypical non&#xD;
           mycobacterium tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy: To compare the AntiSpike antibody, ( Anti RBD ) neutralized antibody ( if&#xD;
      possible) of SAR-CoV-2 and T-cell response after injection with Intradermal Comirnaty® 6&#xD;
      microgram versus Intramuscular Comirnaty® 30 microgram by 28 days interval in healthy&#xD;
      volunteer in various immunological background groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy: Comparesion of infection rate in each arm.&#xD;
