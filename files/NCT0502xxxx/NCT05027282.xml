  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of up to 30 subjects designed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a non-ablative fractional laser combination wavelength treatment for general&#xD;
      resurfacing of photoaged skin. All study subjects will be treated on the whole face with the&#xD;
      CLEAR + BRILLIANT TOUCH(R) 1440-nm and 1927-nm handpieces. Subjects will be treated with a&#xD;
      consecutive series of four (4) treatments spaced 1 month apart, along with follow-up study&#xD;
      visits at one (1) and three (3) months after final treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Improvement in the appearance of at least one measurement of photoaging damage (fine wrinkles, skin texture, dyschromia/pigment, skin radiance, pore size or overall appearance), each assessed by the investigator using the quartile improvement score comparing standard 2D baseline photograph captured via Canfield VISIA CA system. The Quartile Improvement Score ranges from 0 to 4, with 0 = 0%, 1 = 1% to 25%, 2 = 26% to 50%, 3 = 51% to 75%, and 4 = 76% to 100% improvement. Higher scores indicated greater improvement.</description>
