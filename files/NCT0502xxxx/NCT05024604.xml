      Hysteroscopic findings in women using progesterone only pills (minipills) :A Prospective&#xD;
      cohort study. versus women not using any hormonal therapy ,Office hysteroscopy would be&#xD;
      conducted outside of the formal operating theater setting in an appropriately sized,&#xD;
      equipped, and staffed treatment room with adjoining, private changing facilities and toilet.&#xD;
      As the patient is aware of everything that is going on, it is advisable to organize a relaxed&#xD;
      setting, using a protected space with a comfortable seat, Uterine distension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When performing diagnostic hysteroscopic procedures, it is best if a non-viscous, physiologic&#xD;
      solution is used i.e. Saline or Lactated Ringers as opposed to CO2 gas. CO2 is commonly used&#xD;
      for diagnostic hysteroscopy but is difficult to use in the presence of blood or mucous.&#xD;
      Adequate distention pressures (50-70 mmHG) can be achieved in the office by the use of&#xD;
      gravity or a pressure bags. Most office based procedures are of short duration and no more&#xD;
      than 2 liters of solution should be utilized. In this situation, it is not necessary to&#xD;
      monitor fluid inflow, outflow and deficits in the office setting. The standard access&#xD;
      approach to the cervix involves placing a speculum within the vagina (preferably side&#xD;
      opening), placing single tenaculum on the anterior lip of the cervix, injecting the cervix&#xD;
      with local anaesthesia (if necessary), and placing the rigid continuous flow hysteroscope&#xD;
      within the cervical canal. In most patients, including nulliparous and post menopausal&#xD;
      patients, it is not necessary to dilate the cervix prior to insertion. Once the hysteroscope&#xD;
      is within the cervical canal, the speculum should be removed, the fluid flow is begun and the&#xD;
      hysteroscope is advanced through the cervical canal and into the uterine cavity under direct&#xD;
      visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endometrium will be inspected by outpatient hysteroscopy The following observations made&#xD;
      at hysteroscopy, and reviewed in detail from the video record of the examination Glandular&#xD;
      and stromal changes The color, thickness, texture and regularity of the endometrial stroma&#xD;
      would be assessed during hysteroscopy Superficial vascular density Endometrial vascular&#xD;
      density would be assessed at hysteroscopy by direct inspection of the blood vessels, and&#xD;
      graded according to the abundance of superficial vessels observed. Superficial vascular&#xD;
      density would be reassessed after uterine collapse and Re distention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular morphology The shape and configuration of superficial and deep endometrial vessels&#xD;
      would be assessed at hysteroscopy. The presence of regular and irregular (neo vascular and&#xD;
      mosaic) vascular patterns in superficial and deep vessels would be recorded and graded. The&#xD;
      presence of petechiae and ecchymosis would be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the above values were regraded after collapse and re distention of the uterus, provided&#xD;
      that a clear view of the endometrium could be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular distribution The distribution of superficial and deep vasculature in the endometrium&#xD;
      would be inspected and graded as even' or 'patchy'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial biopsies biopsies would be taken at each hysteroscopy. A small amount of&#xD;
      endometrial tissue was obtained under direct vision using the biopsy curette (novak curette).&#xD;
      also a detailed comment by the examiner would be given regarding the uterine ostium of the&#xD;
      fallopian tube &amp; any changes in the cervical canal and the cervical secretions any abnormal&#xD;
      findings or pathology would be mentioned also .&#xD;
