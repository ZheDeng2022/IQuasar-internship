    <textblock>
      AURORAX-0093A (AUR93A) is a pilot cohort observational study that will explore the use of&#xD;
      urine and plasma glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to prognosticate muscle-invasive bladder cancer&#xD;
      (MIBC) patients elected for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are around 200 000 cases of bladder cancer (BCa) in the EU every year. Of these, about&#xD;
      25% are diagnosed at a late stage wherein cancer has invaded the muscular wall. The survival&#xD;
      of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) largely depends on the response to&#xD;
      disease management, which in turn is likely dependent on the biology underlying different&#xD;
      subtypes of MIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment is radical cystectomy (RC) and eligible patients are offered&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, only 30% of these patients report a complete&#xD;
      response. Even though the response to NAC is likely correlated to the underlying tumor&#xD;
      biology (for example, the TP53-like MIBC subtype is associated with a higher frequency of&#xD;
      resistance to NAC), there are today no approved biomarkers to select patients likely to&#xD;
      benefit from NAC. This information could in turn translate into more precise and personalized&#xD;
      treatment for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a proof-of-concept prospective study, we discovered that the profiling of urine and plasma&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) could be useful for the diagnosis and prognosis of BCa. AUR93A is a&#xD;
      prospective single-arm cohort exploratory study. At least 76 patients with MIBC and elected&#xD;
      for NAC will be included in this study and it is assumed that 30% will experience complete&#xD;
      response at the post-operative visit. The goal is to correlate baseline (pre-NAC) GAGs to&#xD;
      complete response rate (CRR) after RC and recurrence-free survival (RFS).&#xD;

        The study will enroll patients with MIBC elected for NAC, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MIBC: pathologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with the&#xD;
             invasion of the bladder muscular wall and no evidence of regional or distal metastases&#xD;
             (T2-T4a cN0MO)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder&#xD;
             (mixed histology tumors allowed if transitional cell histology is predominant [50%+]&#xD;
             histology)&#xD;
