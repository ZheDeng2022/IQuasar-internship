  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the bioequivalence of a New Paracetamol Oral&#xD;
      Suspension 24 milligram/milliliter (mg/ml) with that of an already approved Paracetamol (24&#xD;
      mg/ml) Oral Suspension (Panadol Baby &amp; Infant) when administered to healthy volunteers under&#xD;
      fasting condition. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from plasma concentration&#xD;
      data. The rate and extent of absorption of the formulations will be compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a 2-arm, single center, single dose, open-label, randomized, two-sequence, two&#xD;
      period crossover, bioequivalence study in healthy adult participants. Participants will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility within 15 days prior to dosing. Participants will receive each of&#xD;
      the two study treatments in fasted state during a 6-day (5-overnight stay) residential period&#xD;
      at the study site. Participants will receive both treatment regimens in a randomized order&#xD;
      with a 72-hour washout period between each dose. During each treatment period, a total of 21&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected which will include a pre-dose blood sample 1 hour before&#xD;
      dosing and 20 post-dose blood samples at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 90, 120, 150, 180&#xD;
      minutes, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 hours, for bioanalytical analyses of paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs, clinical safety laboratory tests and monitoring of adverse events will be used&#xD;
      to assess the safety and tolerability of the study products.&#xD;
