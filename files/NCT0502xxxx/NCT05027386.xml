  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival rate of recurrent and refractory pediatric neuroblastoma is low and the&#xD;
      prognosis is poor. Apatinib mesylate is a highly selective small-molecule vasoendothelial&#xD;
      growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Apatinib mesylate has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe and effective in recurrent or refractory pediatric neuroblastoma in Sun&#xD;
      Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Apatinib mesylate combined with IT regimen is expected to&#xD;
      further improve the efficacy and survival rate of recurrent or refractory pediatric&#xD;
      neuroblastoma.&#xD;
