  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the safety profile of danavorexton when it is administered with anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to learn what effect danavorexton has on anesthetized adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, participants will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of danavorexton or a&#xD;
      placebo after participants have been anesthetized for about 40 minutes. Clinic doctors will&#xD;
      arrange a follow-up visit by phone or video on Day 7.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called danavorexton or TAK-925. Danavorexton is being&#xD;
      tested to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) in healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 28 participants. This study consists of 4 cohorts:&#xD;
      Cohorts A1, A2, A3 and P (healthy participants aged 18 to 55 years). In each of the 4&#xD;
      cohorts, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance) to receive danavorexton or&#xD;
      danavorexton placebo-matching -which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study&#xD;
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A1: Danavorexton Low Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A2: Danavorexton Middle Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A3: Danavorexton High Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort P: Danavorexton TBD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional optional cohorts may be added to the study based on the outcomes from the&#xD;
      mandatory cohorts described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 37 days including screening period, residential period, and safety follow up period.&#xD;
      A follow-up visit by phone or video will be conducted on Day 7.&#xD;
