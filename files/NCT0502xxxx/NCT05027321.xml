  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of breast cancer and its mortality are reduced thanks in particular to early&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often performed after a screening test, stereotactic macrobiopsies are used to characterize&#xD;
      abnormalities detected on mammography. This anxiety-inducing and painful examination leads to&#xD;
      significant physiological and psychological modifications for these women who logically&#xD;
      apprehend the realization of this act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with this observation, investigators wondered what could be done to improve the&#xD;
      experience of the patients during this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators were interested in hypnosis because its effectiveness as a complementary&#xD;
      practice has been validated by numerous studies with benefits on pain and stress management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, today, there are no convincing results confirming which hypnosis method would be the&#xD;
      best to manage patients' anxiety and pain during this examination.&#xD;
