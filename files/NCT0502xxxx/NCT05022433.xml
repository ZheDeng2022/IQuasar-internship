  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical vein catheters (UVC) are commonly inserted in newborns especially neonates admitted&#xD;
      to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).These catheters are used since 1959. It is a&#xD;
      suitable method for parenteral nutrition access and medications administration. Despite the&#xD;
      benefits of the UVC, its potential complications must be considered. Thus, it is vital to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate penetration length of the UVC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UVC insertion has benefits and potential complications such as infection, intestinal&#xD;
      necrosis, thrombosis, ascites, hydrothorax, cardiac tamponade, cardiac arrhythmias, pleural&#xD;
      effusion, pericarditis and pericardial effusion. The complications may be due to insertion of&#xD;
      catheter in an inappropriate location. Imaging procedures such as plain thoracoabdominal&#xD;
      x-ray is needed after catheter insertion to specify the location of the catheter tip. In&#xD;
      addition to preventing complications, insertion of umbilical venous catheter in an&#xD;
      appropriate location is essential for umbilical catheterisation effectiveness. There are&#xD;
      different methods to determine the length of catheter which must be inserted in umbilical&#xD;
      vessels. The UVC formulae are based on either body surface measurement such as Dunn method,&#xD;
      Umbilical to Intermammary Distance (UIMD), Umbilical to Nipple Distance (UN)-1 and&#xD;
      birthweight based formula method such as Shukla and Modified Shukla. Shukla and UN-1 Methods&#xD;
      have been widely used in the world. However, the accuracy of these two methods in estimating&#xD;
      the length of umbilical venous catheter has not still demonstrated.&#xD;

    <description>Using the chest and abdominal X-ray, the distance of the UVC tip position in reference to the diaphragm level is measured.UVC tip position is then labeled as either IDEAL,SHORT or DEEP position. Ideal position is defined as the UVC tip is at the diaphragm level or +/- 0.5cm distance from the diaphragm. Short UVC is defined if the UVC tip is &gt;0.5 cm below the diaphragm.Deep UVC position is defined as if the UVC tip is &gt; 0.5cm above the diaphragm.</description>

    <description>Using the chest and abdominal X-ray, the distance of the UVC tip position in reference between the upper border of T9 to the lower border of T10 level is measured. UVC tip position is then labeled as IDEAL, SHORT and DEEP UVC position.Ideal position is defined as the UVC tip position in between the level of the upper border of T9 to the lower border of T10. Short UVC if the tip is below the lower border of T10. Deep UVC position is defined as the UVC tip above the upper border of T9.</description>
