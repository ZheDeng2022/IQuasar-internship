  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies lead to important functional limitations resulting from&#xD;
      the loss of muscle strength and endurance, especially in the hip and shoulder, which leads to&#xD;
      a significant loss of quality of life for patients. The aim of this study is to correlate the&#xD;
      &quot;Myositis Functional Index-3 (FI-3)&quot; with muscle function assessed by computerized isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometry, electromyography and magnetic resonance through an observational study; and to&#xD;
      compare the effects of a repetitive task training program with a resistance exercise program&#xD;
      through an interventional study in patients with inflammatory myopathies. It is expected that&#xD;
      FI-3 will present a good correlation with muscle function assessed by computerized isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometry and electromyography, given its reduced cost and less time spent on evaluation.&#xD;
      It is also expected to demonstrate that repetitive task training is as efficient and safe as&#xD;
      resistance exercises.&#xD;

      Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies lead to important functional limitations resulting from&#xD;
      the loss of muscle strength and endurance, especially in the hip and shoulder, which leads to&#xD;
      a significant loss of quality of life for patients. PURPOSE: to correlate the &quot;Myositis&#xD;
      Functional Index-3 (FI-3)&quot; with muscle function assessed by computerized isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometry, electromyography and magnetic resonance through an observational study; and to&#xD;
      compare the effects of a repetitive task training program with a resistance exercise program&#xD;
      through an interventional study in patients with inflammatory myopathies. METHODS: this is an&#xD;
      observational cross-sectional study for the observational study and an interventional&#xD;
      study/randomized clinical trial for the interventional study. The study will be held at the&#xD;
      Cassiano Antônio de Moraes University Hospital (HUCAM) and at the Interprofessional Health&#xD;
      Clinic (CEIS) of the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), located in the city of&#xD;
      Vitória, Espírito Santo. Patients will come from the Rheumatology Service of HUCAM For the&#xD;
      observational study, 30 patients with inflammatory myopathies and 15 healthy individuals&#xD;
      matched for age and sex. For the interventional study, the 30 patients evaluated in the&#xD;
      observational study will be randomized into two intervention groups. To participate in the&#xD;
      research, patients must have a diagnosis of polymyositis or dermatomyositis (Bohan and Peter&#xD;
      criteria); age ≥18 years; duration of disease since diagnosis for more than six months;&#xD;
      stable medication ≥3 months; chronic inactive or mildly active but stable myositis for at&#xD;
      least 3 months prior to observation; HAQ≥0.5. They may not have serious cardiac or pulmonary&#xD;
      conditions; severe osteoporosis; unable to exercise; neoplasm; cognitive disorders; and acute&#xD;
      or chronic infection. Healthy individuals must be age and sex matched with patients and may&#xD;
      not have severe cardiac or pulmonary conditions; severe osteoporosis; unable to exercise;&#xD;
      neoplasm; cognitive disorders; and acute or chronic infection. Patients will be evaluated in&#xD;
      two moments: before starting the training programs and after 12 weeks. Healthy individuals&#xD;
      will be evaluated only once. The data from the evaluations carried out before starting the&#xD;
      training programs will be used for the analysis of the observational study. Participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated for variables: muscle endurance (Functional Index-3 and isokinetic dynamometry),&#xD;
      muscle strength (Manual Muscle Test 8 and isokinetic dynamometry), muscle activation&#xD;
      (electromyography), muscle damage (magnetic resonance imaging of thigh muscles),&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary capacity (6-minute walk test), pain (visual analogue scale), functional&#xD;
      capacity (Health Assessment Questionnaire), quality of life (SF-36), disease activity (PGA,&#xD;
      SGA, MDAAT, creatine phosphokinase and aldolase) and disease damage (MDI). In addition,&#xD;
      demographic and clinical data such as date of birth, age, sex, self-reported race-color,&#xD;
      marital status, occupational status, weight, height, date of first symptoms, date of&#xD;
      diagnosis, comorbidities and medications in use will also be collected. The training program&#xD;
      will last 12 weeks, twice a week in person with the supervision of physiotherapists and once&#xD;
      a week at home. Each session will last 60 minutes. The resistance training group will perform&#xD;
      traditional resistance exercises with an intensity of 30%-60% of a voluntary repetition&#xD;
      maximum and 1 to 2 sets of 10 repetitions each exercise. The repetitive task training group&#xD;
      will carry out exercises involving upper and lower limbs. To determine the&#xD;
      clinical-demographic characterization of the study population, descriptive statistics (mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation) will be used; the correlation analysis will be performed using the&#xD;
      Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient; the comparison between the group of patients and&#xD;
      the control group of healthy individuals will be performed using the t test or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test; the comparison before and after the training programs will be performed using the&#xD;
      t-test or Mann-Whitney; the comparison between groups will be performed using ANOVA; the&#xD;
      normality test to be used will be the Shapiro-Wilk and the results will be considered&#xD;
      significant for P&lt;0.05. EXPECTED RESULTS: It is expected that FI-3 will present a good&#xD;
      correlation with muscle function assessed by computerized isokinetic dynamometry and&#xD;
      electromyography, given its reduced cost and less time spent on evaluation. It is also&#xD;
      expected to demonstrate that repetitive task training is as efficient and safe as resistance&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
