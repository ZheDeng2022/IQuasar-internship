  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of ocular images captured on 3 different&#xD;
      cameras of patients with diabetic retinopathy. The study will determine whether diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy assessment is comparable between the cameras. The research is being done to see&#xD;
      if a camera takes higher quality pictures over the other cameras.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 participants will be enrolled into this study. Participants need to have diabetic eye&#xD;
      disease. This is a one-time study visit that lasts approximately 1 hour.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Severity Level within the 7 standard fields of Clarus, Optos, and Standard 7 Field imaging and statistical comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The images captured within the 7 standard fields on each camera will be graded using the ETDRS severity scale. The total range of possible scores for severity level is from 10 (no DR) to 80 (PDR with vitreous hemorrhage); higher scores indicate increasing severity.&#xD;
Details of ETDRS severity scale: 10-No DR, 15-Probable DR, no MAs, 20-MAs only, 35-Mild NPDR, 43,47-Moderate NPDR, 53-Severe NPDR, 60-PDR status post scatter photocoagulation, 61,65,71-PDR, 80-PDR with vitreous hemorrhage, 90,95-Ungradable.&#xD;
ETDRS level agreement will be cross-tabulated and κ statistics calculated and assessed: &lt;0.20, poor; 0.21-0.40, fair; 0.41-0.60, moderate; 0.61-0.80, substantial; and 0.81-1.00, almost perfect strength of agreement. Unweighted κ will be used to avoid potential bias by weighting. Agreement will also be tested for each severity level and k statistics analyzed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Ungradable ETDRS Images within the 7 standard fields of Clarus, Optos, and Standard 7 Field imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The images captured within the 7 standard fields on each camera will be graded using the ETDRS severity scale. The proportion of ungradable images will be documented. On all tests, P &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant, and nonparametric testing will be applied where appropriate.</description>

    <description>The images captured on each camera will be graded using the ETDRS severity scale. The total range of possible scores for severity level is from 10 (no DR) to 80 (PDR with vitreous hemorrhage); higher scores indicate increasing severity.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Ungradable ETDRS Images within the Clarus global, Optos global, and Standard 7 Field grading</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The images captured within the global fields of the Clarus and Optos cameras and the 7 standard field image will be graded using the ETDRS severity scale. The proportion of ungradable images will be documented. On all tests, P &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant, and nonparametric testing will be applied where appropriate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Image quality assessment per image grader</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The images captured on each camera for each participant will be assessed for quality using the Wisconsin Reading Center's 3-step confidence score. 1-High (image can be graded for both 7 field ETDRS and global severity level); 2-Adequate (image cannot be graded for global severity level); 3-Inadequate (image cannot be graded for ETDRS and global severity level).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reason Image Quality is compromised per image grader</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>If Wisconsin Reading Center Confidence score of 2 or 3, a reason is selected (technical, patient, both patient and technical, unknown, or N/A). Eyes with photographs classified as ungradable will be excluded from agreement tables.</description>
