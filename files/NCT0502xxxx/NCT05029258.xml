  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are primarily treated with radiotherapy&#xD;
      +/- chemotherapy however 5-year survival rates are &lt;60% with significant treatment toxicity.&#xD;
      Hypoxia is a well-known radioresistant component of solid tumours such as cervical cancer and&#xD;
      hypoxia modification therapies have demonstrated immense promise in treating such tumours. A&#xD;
      major factor in determining a successful outcome with hypoxia modification is appropriate&#xD;
      patient selection as it is hypoxic tumours that receive the most benefit from hypoxia&#xD;
      modifying therapies. To date there is no validated hypoxia biomarker to stratify patients for&#xD;
      therapy in cervical cancer in clinical use. This project offers a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      examine both genetic and imaging biomarkers to optimise patient stratification when receiving&#xD;
      curative radiotherapy for cervical cancer.&#xD;
