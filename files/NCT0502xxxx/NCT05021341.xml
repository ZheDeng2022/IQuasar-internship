  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the bioavailability of berberine and&#xD;
      dihydroberberine and their impact on changes in plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin.&#xD;

      Once determined eligible and provided consent, participants will be assigned in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. Eligible study participants will&#xD;
      complete one of four testing conditions. For each testing condition, study participants will&#xD;
      arrive in the lab after observing an overnight fast. Upon arrival, participants will donate&#xD;
      the first of six venous blood samples. Follow-up blood samples will be collected at 20, 40,&#xD;
      60, 90, and 120 minutes. All collected samples will be collected into two, 4mL EDTA tubes and&#xD;
      have aliquots of 600 ul of plasma isolated and frozen at -80 degrees celsius. Collected&#xD;
      plasma will be analyzed for changes in berberine, glucose, and insulin. Participants will&#xD;
      observe a minimum of 72 hours washout between conditions&#xD;

    <description>For each visit, all participants will report to the laboratory between 0600 - 1000 hours after observing an 8 - 10 hr fast. Participants will ingest the double-blinded supplement (500 mg of berberine) at specific times, the day before and morning of study visits 2 - 5. For each visit, participants will have their heart rate, blood pressure, body mass, and height measured. After final ingestion of their assigned supplementation dose, standard multiple sample phlebotomy approaches will be used to collect 10 mL of venous blood from a forearm vein at 0, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-supplement ingestion. After donating baseline blood sample (0-min) a standard test meal, white bread, and glucose powder mixed in 250 mL of water. The complete nutritional breakdown of the test meal is anticipated to be 382 kcal, 3.2 grams of fat, 80.6 grams of carbohydrate, and 7.64 grams of protein.</description>
