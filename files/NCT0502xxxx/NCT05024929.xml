  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a common type of thyroid cancer in children and represents&#xD;
      the second most common cancer in adolescent females. Recently targeted drugs that block many&#xD;
      of the genetic drivers of PTC have become available. While Investigators know that these&#xD;
      drugs shrink PTC tumors in many cases, the impact on radioactive iodine (RAI) avidity has not&#xD;
      been systematically studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study that will enroll patients with PTC metastatic to the&#xD;
      lungs who will receive oncogene-specific targeted therapy as part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
      After approximately 1 week of therapy, patients will have a whole body scan to determine the&#xD;
      change in RAI-avidity of the tumor from baseline. Subsequent therapy will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive oncogene-specific molecularly targeted therapy independently of this protocol either via commercial supply of an FDA approved agent, or as part of a separate therapeutic clinical trial/compassionate use protocol/single patient investigational new drug (IND).&#xD;
During screening, patients will undergo a baseline RAI-whole body scan (WBS) to assess RAI-avidity of their tumor per standard of care. Following approximately 1 week of targeted therapy, the WBS will be repeated to determine whether this therapy is associated with an increase in RAI-avidity of their tumor.</description>

        This study will enroll children and adolescents with papillary thyroid cancer with&#xD;
        pulmonary metastases, both RAI-na√Øve and RAI-refractory, who are planned to receive&#xD;
        oncogene-specific targeted therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age less than 22 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a histologic diagnosis of papillary throid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of an neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors (NTRK)-fusion, RET-fusion,&#xD;
             anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-fusion, BRAF V600 mutation, BRAF-fusion or other&#xD;
             targetable alteration identified in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and&#xD;
             College of American Pathologists (CLIA/CAP) laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Anatomically evaluable disease on chest Computed tomography (CT) (i.e. visible tumor&#xD;
             on a chest CT; tumors do not need to be &gt;1 centimeter (cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients for whom systemic therapy with an oncogene-specific kinase inhibitor is&#xD;
             planned either from commercial supply or as part of a separate therapeutic clinical&#xD;
             trial/compassionate access protocol/single patient investigational new drug (IND).&#xD;
             Such agents include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Larotrectinib, entrectinib, selitrectinib, and repotrectinib for NTRK fusions&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Selpercatinib and pralsetinib for RET fusions&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Crizotinib, lorlatinib, repotrectinib, and alectinib for ALK fusions&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Dabrafenib and/or trametinib for BRAF V600 mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Trametinib and selumetinib for BRAF fusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No prior oncogene-specific targeted therapy allowed. However, patients may enroll&#xD;
             within 7 days of starting oncogene-specific therapy if a pre-therapy WBS is available.&#xD;
             Prior therapy with non-oncogene specific multi-thyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as&#xD;
             sorafenib, lenvatinib, and/or cabozantanib) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded due to the potential risks of&#xD;
             the RAI used in the WBS to the fetus/neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who require sedation/general anesthesia to complete a WBS are excluded.&#xD;
