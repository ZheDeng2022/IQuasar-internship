    <textblock>
      This trial is a single-arm, multicenter phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound) combined with Nivolumab and the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of Docetaxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN&#xD;
      who are positive for PD-L1 expression and have progressed on or after platinum-based therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two stages (phase Ib and phase II). Phase Ib: To explore the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound) (75 mg/m^2 and 100 mg/m^2)&#xD;
      combined with Nivolumab 360 mg. Dose exploration will be started at low dose and proceed in&#xD;
      turn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: According to the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) determined in the phase Ib study,&#xD;
      a phase II study of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound) combined with Nivolumab will be&#xD;
      conducted to observe the efficacy of the combination regimen, with ORR as the primary study&#xD;
      endpoint. Simon's optimal 2-stage design will be adopted for phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in Phase Ib and Phase II will be treated with Docetaxel for Injection&#xD;
      (Albumin-bound) combined with Nivolumab until participants meet the criteria for termination&#xD;
      or withdrawal criteria, for a maximum of 2 years&#xD;
