      The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether previously reported benefit of Tranexamic&#xD;
      acid in pediatric orthopedic surgeries could be recapitulated in bone tumor surgeries or not&#xD;
      through a double blinded randomized controlled trial done in children cancer hospital 57357.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resection of bone tumors is commonly associated with considerable intra and post-operative&#xD;
      blood loss due to extensive soft tissue dissection, multiple bone osteotomies, prolonged&#xD;
      operative time. The intraoperative use of limb tourniquet to reduce bleeding may not be&#xD;
      applicable in all situations e.g. arm, thigh and pelvic surgeries. The use of cell savers for&#xD;
      auto transplantation of blood is not preferred in cancer surgeries. Antifibrinolytic drug are&#xD;
      currently used to reduce perioperative blood loss in a variety of orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;
      Currently, the most common agents used are EACA and TXA. A third agent, aprotinin, was&#xD;
      withdrawn from the market in 2007 owing to safety concerns noted in several studies,&#xD;
      suggesting an increased risk of death and renal dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Slow to adopt in obstetric population, TXA became popular for patients with&#xD;
      hereditary bleeding disorders for whom menorrhagia, frequent spontaneous nose bleeds, or&#xD;
      dental procedures could be life threatening. With strong record as an effective and safe&#xD;
      medicine, TXA has earned its place on the World Health Organization List of Essential&#xD;
      Medicines as an important drug needed in every health system. More recently, its use has&#xD;
      expanded to treat or prevent excessive blood loss from trauma and major surgery, including&#xD;
      cardiac, orthopedic, and hepatic procedures. TXA, a lysine analogue, reversibly binds to the&#xD;
      plasminogen lysine receptors and thereby blocks plasminogen from binding to fibrin (tPA can&#xD;
      only activate fibrin-bound plasminogen and produce plasmin responsible for cleaving fibrin&#xD;
      molecule and dissolving the blood clot) TXA has been extensively studied in joint replacement&#xD;
      surgeries specifically total knee replacement, scoliosis surgery, and in trauma surgeries.&#xD;
      The question of efficacy of TXA in these surgeries was addressed in multiple prospective&#xD;
      randomized studies and subsequent meta-analysis. Main concern regarding increased risk of DVT&#xD;
      was negated in several of these studies. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons provides&#xD;
      a strong recommendation for the use of any administration of TXA for joint arthroplasty and&#xD;
      states that it does not seem to increase the risk of thromboembolic or myocardial&#xD;
      complications. Junlong Zhong et al. in 2019 published a systematic review and meta-analyses&#xD;
      on 2500 pediatric patients undergoing corrective surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. They&#xD;
      concluded that TXA was effective in reducing surgical time, intraoperative blood loss and&#xD;
      blood transfusion without increasing complications. Levack et al. Published in 2020 a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial on role of TXA in reducing blood loss and transfusion in&#xD;
      pediatric patients undergoing a periacetabular osteotomy. They concluded that TXA reduced&#xD;
      blood loss by 293ml and reduced frequency of allogenic transfusions by 73%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether previously reported benefit of Tranexamic&#xD;
      acid in pediatric orthopedic surgeries could be recapitulated in bone tumor surgeries or not&#xD;
      through a double blinded randomized controlled trial done in children cancer hospital 57357.&#xD;
