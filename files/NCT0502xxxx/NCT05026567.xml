      Primary objective of this study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate whether an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of the test product (10 mg /&#xD;
           0.625 mL) on bare skin in the thigh, and the i.m. injection of either the reference&#xD;
           product, HYPNOVEL® (10 mg/ 2 mL) or the i.m. injection of 2mL of the reference product,&#xD;
           DORMICUM® (15 mg/ 3 mL) or the i.m injection of 2mL of the reference product, DORMICUM®&#xD;
           (5 mg/ 1 mL) administered with a conventional syringe in the thigh on bare skin, are&#xD;
           bioequivalent&#xD;

      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate whether an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of the test product ZENEO®&#xD;
           Midazolam (10 mg / 0.625 mL) in the ventrogluteal area, and the i.m. injection of either&#xD;
           the reference product, HYPNOVEL® (10 mg/ 2 mL) or the i.m. injection of 2mL of the&#xD;
           reference product, DORMICUM® (15 mg/ 3 mL) or the i.m injection of 2mL of the reference&#xD;
           product, DORMICUM® (5 mg/ 1 mL) administered with a conventional syringe in the thigh on&#xD;
           bare skin, are bioequivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the pharmacokinetics of an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of the&#xD;
           test product ZENEO® Midazolam (10mg / 0.625mL) administered in the thigh through&#xD;
           clothing, and of the i.m. injection of either the reference product, HYPNOVEL® (10 mg/ 2&#xD;
           mL) or the i.m. injection of 2mL of the reference product, DORMICUM® (15 mg/ 3 mL) or&#xD;
           the i.m injection of 2mL of the reference product, DORMICUM® (5 mg/ 1 mL) administered&#xD;
           with a conventional syringe in the thigh on bare skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the pharmacokinetics of the major active metabolite 1'-OH&#xD;
           midazolam after a single i.m. administration when delivered by ZENEO® vs. administration&#xD;
           by conventional syringe with needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the pharmacokinetics of ZENEO® Midazolam (10mg / 0.625mL)&#xD;
           administered in the thigh on bare skin and ZENEO® Midazolam (10mg / 0.625mL)&#xD;
           administered in the thigh through clothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety and tolerability of midazolam after a single i.m. administration when&#xD;
           delivered by ZENEO® vs. administration by conventional syringe with needle.&#xD;
