  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCLC has short doubling time, high proliferation rate and early widespread metastasis. Most&#xD;
      patients with SCLC have hematogenous metastasis. SCLC is highly sensitive to initial&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy, but the recurrence rate is high. The strategy for local limited SCLC&#xD;
      patients was chemotherapy plus chest radiotherapy; In patients with extensive stage SCLC,&#xD;
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy has been established as the standard treatment for&#xD;
      patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with better results. Although the initial&#xD;
      response to chemotherapy is high, it is easy to relapse and develop drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In second-line therapy, the single-agent activity of multiple chemotherapy agents has been&#xD;
      demonstrated, but a higher incidence of grade 3-4 hematological adverse events In the Passion&#xD;
      study published by Wang Jie et al. [10], the efficacy and safety of the antiangiogenic drug&#xD;
      apatinib combined with carrizumab in the second-line treatment of small cell lung cancer were&#xD;
      investigated. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the study. Of the 47 patients in the&#xD;
      extended phase, the confirmed ORR was 34.0% (95%CI 20.9-49.3), with a median PFS of 3.6&#xD;
      months and a median OS of 8.4 months In patients with platinum sensitivity and platinum&#xD;
      resistance, ORR was 37.5% vs 32.3%, MPFS was 3.6m vs 2.7m, and MOS was 9.6m vs 8.0m. Grade 3&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 43 of the 59 patients (72.9%), and 5&#xD;
      patients (8.5%) were discontinued due to TRAEs. The combination regimen showed potential&#xD;
      antitumor activity in both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research and exploration of small cell lung cancer can learn from the research idea in&#xD;
      the field of non-small cell lung cancer. The Checkmate9LA study reported in 2020ASCO [11]&#xD;
      investigated the safety and efficacy of Nivolumab+2 cycle chemotherapy in first-line&#xD;
      treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with negative driver gene. The MOS in the&#xD;
      immunization combination group was significantly better than that in the chemotherapy group&#xD;
      (15.6 months vs. 10.9 months, HR 0.66), and the 1-year survival rate was 63% vs. 47%,&#xD;
      respectively. The ORR in the immunization combination group was also improved (38% vs. 25%),&#xD;
      and the MDOR was 11.3m vs. 5.6m, which was tolerable in terms of safety. The incidence of&#xD;
      grade 3-4 treatment-associated AE was 47% in the immune-combined group and 38% in the&#xD;
      chemotherapy group. From the perspective of mechanism, chemotherapy can enhance the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of tumor cells, damage the immune cell inhibitory activity, which can induce&#xD;
      tumor cell apoptosis, expression of MHC class 1 molecules increases and mature dendritic&#xD;
      cells to promote the immune response, in the design, add 2 cycles of chemotherapy short-term&#xD;
      intensive treatment, make up the immune short board, For example, the early onset of slow and&#xD;
      immune characteristic events such as large tumor load, pseudo progression, hyperrogression&#xD;
      and other problems, to achieve the optimization and upgrading of the scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on Rationale 307, Tislelizumab was approved on January 12, 2021 for first-line&#xD;
      treatment in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer. t the same time, Tislelizumab initial&#xD;
      efficacy in patients with extensive small-cell lung cancr.Rational-206 study is a phase â…¡&#xD;
      multi-cohort study of Tislelizumab combined with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced lung cancer in China. The MPFS in the SCLC cohort was about 7&#xD;
      months, and the MOS reached 15.6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above studies and data, in the second-line treatment of SCLC, anti-vascular&#xD;
      targeted drugs combined with chemotherapy can obtain a certain survival benefit, especially&#xD;
      for patients with sensitive recurrence, and the benefit is more significant. he immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors have gradually emerged in the second-line and later treatment of SCLC,&#xD;
      but the single drug effect has not been a great breakthrough; a small molecule antiangiogenic&#xD;
      targeted drug in China, Anlotinib has obtained third-line and later indications of SCLC&#xD;
      through ALTER1202 data, and has been included in the 2019 CSCO Guidelines for the Diagnosis&#xD;
      and Treatment of Primary Lung Cancer. t the same time, it is similar to the Checkmate9LA&#xD;
      study regimen, combined with two cycles of chemotherapy, to improve the short-term efficacy.&#xD;
      Therefore, Anlotinib combined with Tislelizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, and 2 cycles of Irinotecan&#xD;
      monotherapy were tried in second-line SCLC, with the hope of breaking through the&#xD;
      difficulties of high recurrence rate and rapid disease progression of existing second-line&#xD;
      SCLC chemotherapy, regardless of platinum-sensitive recurrence or platinum-resistant&#xD;
      recurrence, and providing more options for SCLC patients.&#xD;
