  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper extremity therapies for children with cerebral palsy (CP) have been validated for&#xD;
      improving function in higher functioning patients. Those who function at the lowest end of&#xD;
      the scale, on the Manual Ability Classification System scale (MACS) III-V, comprise 34-54% of&#xD;
      the population, but as yet have no evidence-based interventions specific to their needs.&#xD;
      Lower functioning children often retain some voluntary control of the elbow in spite of&#xD;
      limited finger motion. A dynamic splint, or exoskeleton, could utilize the tenodesis effect&#xD;
      from elbow motion to drive finger release while retaining flexor tone for grasp, potentially&#xD;
      creating a portable, home-based therapeutic tool. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an upper extremity orthotic device in improving the upper extremity function&#xD;
      of children with cerebral palsy who have limited use of their hands.&#xD;

    <description>The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) is a test of hand function in children with difficulties using one of their hands. The AHA measures how effectively the affected hand and arm is used in bimanual performance. An assessment is performed by observing the child's spontaneous handling of toys in a relaxed and playful session. The scale is 0-100, and a higher score indicates better function. A change of +5 is clinically significant.</description>

    <measure>Change in Melbourne Assessment-2 from 1) pre to post treatment; 2) post treatment to 3 month followup, and 3) pre treatment to 3 mos after cessation of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Melbourne Assessment 2 (MA2) is a valid and reliable criterion-referenced test for evaluating four elements of upper limb movement quality in children with a neurological impairment aged 2.5 to 15 years: (i) Range of movement, (ii) Accuracy of reach and placement, (iii) Dexterity of grasp, release and manipulation and (iv) Fluency of movement.&#xD;
The full test comprises 14 test items which require a child to reach to, grasp, release and manipulate simple objects. Each child's test performance is video recorded for subsequent scoring.&#xD;
Scoring is completed across the 30 score items using a three, four or five point scale and individually defined scoring criteria. Item scores relating to each element of movement measured are summed within the corresponding sub-scale. A raw score scale change of 3 for range of motion, dexterity, and fluency; and a change of 4 for accuracy is considered clinically significant.</description>

    <description>CHEQ is a newly developed questionnaire. It has been developed for children and adolescents with decreased function in one hand, for example hemiplegic CP, obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) and upper limb reduction deficiency, and for their parents. The scale is 0-100, with the higher score indicating better abilities.</description>
