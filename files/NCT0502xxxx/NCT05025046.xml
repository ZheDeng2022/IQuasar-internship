  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of Thyroscan in the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules with suspecious ultrasound features&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of thyroid nodules by high-resolution ultrasound can be as high as 20%, though&#xD;
      most of them are benign lesions, only about 5%~15% are malignant lesions. Based on 1.4&#xD;
      billion population in China, there are approximately 280 million thyroid nodule carriers, of&#xD;
      which approximately 14~42 million are potential patients with thyroid cancer. Now thyroid&#xD;
      cancer is the fastest growing cancer and the 4th most common cancer in women in China.&#xD;
      Therefore, the key point in the evaluation of thyroid nodules is the differential diagnosis&#xD;
      of benign and malignant nodules. At present, the commonly used imaging and cytological&#xD;
      diagnostic techniques for thyroid nodules include ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine&#xD;
      needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), as well as emerging molecular diagnostic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of Thyroscan in the diagnosis of benign&#xD;
      and malignant thyroid nodules with suspecious ultrasound features. For patients who have&#xD;
      signed an informed consent, the subjects undergo fine needle aspiration of thyroid nodules&#xD;
      classified as C-TIRADS catagories 3 or 4a under the guidance of ultrasound or palpation&#xD;
      before receiving surgical treatment. One needle is used to prepare cytological smear, and one&#xD;
      needle is preserved and sent to Thyroscan detection. The histopathological is obtained as the&#xD;
      &quot;gold standerd&quot; after surgical treatment.&#xD;
