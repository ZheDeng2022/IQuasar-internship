    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study with a Part 2 expansion to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and preliminary antitumor activity of orally administered DSP 0390 in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Patients in this study will receive DSP-0390 orally once daily. The study will be divided into 28-day cycles for safety and response assessments. Patients will continue treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or discontinuation of the patient by the investigator.&#xD;
The study will be comprised of 2 parts, dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). The dose-escalation part will evaluate increasing dose levels of DSP-0390 to determine the MTD and/or a suitable lower dose for expansion (the RDE) in patients with recurrent WHO Grade III or IV malignant glioma</intervention_model_description>
