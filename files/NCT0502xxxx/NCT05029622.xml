  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to assess the efficacy of the triptorelin 6 month PR&#xD;
      (Prolonged Release) formulation in suppressing LH (Luteinising hormone) levels to prepubertal&#xD;
      levels (defined as a peak LH ≤5 IU/L) after i.v. GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone)&#xD;
      stimulation at Month 6 (Day 169) in Chinese children with CPP (Central Precocious Puberty).&#xD;
