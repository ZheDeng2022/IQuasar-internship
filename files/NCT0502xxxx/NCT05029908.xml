  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders affect the general health and quality of life of individuals by&#xD;
      causing deterioration in orofacial function and cause functional limitation. The use of&#xD;
      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC-TMD) is recommended for&#xD;
      evidence-based evaluation of jaw joint disorders for clinical and research purposes.The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to show the factors affecting the functional limitation of the jaw and to&#xD;
      evaluate the relationship between the pain, Oral Behavioral Checklist and the Jaw Functional&#xD;
      Limitation Scale (JFLS-8), using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders&#xD;
      (DC-TMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      75 patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) who will apply to the outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      Istanbul Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital will be included&#xD;
      in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DC/TMD Axis I TMD Pain Screener Questionnaire, TMD Symptom Questionnaire, DC/TMD Axis II&#xD;
      assessment tools 'Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-8 (JFLS-8) and Oral Behavioral Checklist&#xD;
      (OBC) will be applied. In addition, demographic data will be questioned.&#xD;

      75 patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) who will apply to the outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      Istanbul Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital will be included&#xD;
      in our study. Ethics Committee approval was obtained from Bakırköy Sadi Konuk Training and&#xD;
      Research Hospital before starting the study and a voluntary consent form will be signed by&#xD;
      the patients before the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional study; 75 participants aged 18-65 years who has temporomandibular&#xD;
      joint (TMJ) complaints for more than 3 months and has the cognitive ability to understand&#xD;
      test instructions will be included. Patients with a history of previous TMJ operation,&#xD;
      muscle, neurological or rheumatic disease that may affect TMJ, and a history of&#xD;
      facial/cervical trauma or neoplasia will excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DC/TMD Axis I TMD Pain Screener Questionnaire and TMD Symptom Questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered to the participants. To determine parafunctional habits and limitation of&#xD;
      function, the DC/TMD Axis II assessment tools 'Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-8 (JFLS-8) and&#xD;
      Oral Behavioral Checklist (OBC) will be applied. In addition, demographic data (age, gender,&#xD;
      education level, occupation) will be questioned.&#xD;

    <description>Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-8 (JFLS-8)is a scale in the DC / TMD Axis II section and aims to evaluate the functional limitation of the jaw. It consists of eight items that assess restraint due to temporomandibular problems, and these include changes in jaw motility (item 4), chewing (items 1-3), and verbal and emotional expression. (item 5-8).</description>
