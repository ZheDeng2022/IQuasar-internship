      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of education and counseling given to women&#xD;
      according to the Theory of Planned Behavior on weight management. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted as a single-blind randomized controlled study consisting of intervention and&#xD;
      control groups. A total of 78 overweight and obese women included in the study. The&#xD;
      participants assigned to either of the groups by the block randomization method. A training&#xD;
      program consisting of a total of five sessions applied to the intervention group, and&#xD;
      counseling will be provided for 6 months. The data will be analyzed with Statistical Package&#xD;
      for Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 package program.&#xD;

    <measure>Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors-II Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors-II Scale aims to measure the health promotion behaviors of individuals. The scale consists of 52 items. It is a four-point Likert-type scale (1: &quot;never,&quot; 2: &quot;sometimes,&quot; 3: &quot;often,&quot; and 4: &quot;regularly&quot;). The lowest score that can be obtained is 52, and the highest score is 208. High scores indicate that the individual practices the specified health behaviors at a high level.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, the intensity (mild, moderate, and severe) of physical activity is taken into account to accommodate different types of physical activities. The questionnaire provides information about sitting, walking, and the time spent in moderately intense and vigorous activities. Vigorous physical activities have a value of 8.0 MET, moderate activities have a value of 4.0 MET, and walking has a value of 3.3 MET. The minute and frequency (day) values of the relevant activities are multiplied by the MET values. The total physical activity value is obtained by summing the multiplication values obtained at the last stage. Accordingly, the physical activity levels of individuals are classified as physically inactive (&lt;600 MET-min/week), low physical activity (600-3000 MET-min/week), and adequate physical activity (health benefits) (&gt;3000 MET-min/week).</description>

    <description>The selected womens were associated with obesity risk factors about obesity (overweight) or obese and between 18-49 years old) and randomly assigned to the experimental group. Obesity training consisting of a total of five sessions structured according to Theory of Planned Behavior was scheduled for the intervention group. Each session lasted for approximately 30 minutes.</description>

Each session lasted for approximately 30 minutes. After the training given to intervention group, the women will be followed-up for 6 months. The women in the intervention group will be given counseling service by the researchers, and their status will be evaluated every month.</description>
