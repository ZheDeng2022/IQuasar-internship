      The current historical phase and the growing need for rehabilitation in the world make&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation systems, and e-Health in general, fundamental tools for increasing&#xD;
      patient engagement and compliance with care, crucial elements for the preservation of the NHS&#xD;
      from a perspective expenditure review and resource optimization. In particular, the&#xD;
      rehabilitation patient has on average an adherence to the Home Exercise Program (HEP) between&#xD;
      30-50%, to which is frequently added a reduced effectiveness of motor learning due to the&#xD;
      lack of feedback on the accuracy of the gesture, as is the case. it happens in the hospital&#xD;
      or outpatient setting under the supervision of a therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new computational approaches for the analysis of data on human movement, aimed at the&#xD;
      development of algorithms to automatically supervise the accuracy of the patient's gesture&#xD;
      during home self-treatment exercise such as those based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and&#xD;
      Machine Learning (ML), especially those of the latest generation, called sub-symbolics (or&#xD;
      connectionists) can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the most promising approaches are. Given the importance of the Home Exercise Program in&#xD;
      shoulder disease, it was decided to select a population of patients affected by the main&#xD;
      pathologies affecting this joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to create and validate a software tool for the automatic&#xD;
      and expert analysis of the correct execution of the main rehabilitation exercises for the&#xD;
      functional recovery of the shoulder following orthopedic pathologies.&#xD;

      The current historical phase and the growing need for rehabilitation in the world make&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation systems, and e-Health in general, fundamental tools for increasing&#xD;
      patient engagement and compliance with care, crucial elements for the preservation of the NHS&#xD;
      from a perspective expenditure review and resource optimization .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the rehabilitation patient has on average an adherence to the Home Exercise&#xD;
      Program (HEP) between 30-50%, to which is frequently added a reduced effectiveness of motor&#xD;
      learning due to the lack of feedback on the accuracy of the gesture, as it happens in the&#xD;
      hospital or outpatient setting under the supervision of a therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new computational approaches for the analysis of data on human movement, aimed at the&#xD;
      development of algorithms to automatically supervise the accuracy of the patient's gesture&#xD;
      during the exercise of home self-treatment, attempt to solve this last critical issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the most promising approaches are those based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and&#xD;
      Machine Learning (ML), in particular those of the latest generation, called sub-symbolic (or&#xD;
      connectionist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These algorithms arouse a lot of interest for their ability to automatically extract the&#xD;
      salient properties of the movement, reducing the intervention of experts to the collection of&#xD;
      all the data, and to the possible labeling of the examples (5) In any case, the literature&#xD;
      shows a lack of models developed with the direct involvement of clinicians and a scarcity of&#xD;
      data sets created with patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, most of the models present in the literature have been created using numerous&#xD;
      input devices, often with a high technological rate with considerable costs for implementing&#xD;
      a possible service at the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons we want to create a specialist clinical dataset, starting only from the&#xD;
      videos of the exercises, involving specific populations by pathology and built on the basis&#xD;
      of clinical judgment. With these characteristics, this project aims to automate the motion&#xD;
      analysis process as much as possible, enormously reducing the costs deriving from the use of&#xD;
      technologies and minimizing human error, all by exploiting the most recent computational&#xD;
      approaches in order to create a useful and low-cost tool for home functional re-education.&#xD;

    <description>In the first phase of the project, a series of 5 active shoulder mobilization exercises characterized by an adequate range of motion will be tested to verify the set up for the video recording.&#xD;
In the second phase shoulder movements will be recorder by a smartphone.&#xD;
A questionnaire will be used and adapted on the basis of which to evaluate the correctness of the exercises performed by each healthy subject / patient. This questionnaire will provide a Clinical Score (CS) which assigns a numerical value to the patient's overall performance for each repetition.&#xD;
The videos of each repetition of exercises performed by the healthy subjects / patients will then be evaluated by two different clinicians, blinded, using the questionnaire.&#xD;
The Artificial Intelligence learning algorithm will be able to output an evaluation score that will be compared with that produced by clinicians.</description>
