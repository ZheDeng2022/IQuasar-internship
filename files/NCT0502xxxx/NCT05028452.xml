  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers to patients with head and neck cancer report that they are unprepared for&#xD;
      caregiving, that they experience a high caregiver burden and a deteriorated health. The aim&#xD;
      is to develop an internet based intervention for informal caregivers of individuals with head&#xD;
      and neck cancer and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The&#xD;
      internet based intervention (Carer eSupport) will be based on scientific evidence,&#xD;
      established theoretical frameworks and focus groups with caregivers and health care&#xD;
      professionals. The feasibility and acceptability of Carer eSupport will be evaluated by 30&#xD;
      caregivers who will have access to Carer eSupport during one months. The feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of Carer eSupport will be evaluated with quantitative and qualitative data.&#xD;
