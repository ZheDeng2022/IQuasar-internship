  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-parametric (mp) MRI has now internationally been incorporated as standard of care in&#xD;
      the work-up of participants with suspected prostate cancer. The standard mpMRI protocol&#xD;
      requires 30-45 minutes to be performed and has a sensitivity and specificity of approximately&#xD;
      90% and 50% for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Compared to the&#xD;
      non-targeted systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy approach in men with clinically&#xD;
      suspected prostate cancer (e.g.: elevated PSA), performing mpMRI as a triage test allows to&#xD;
      detect clinically significant cancer in more men (38% vs 26%) and clinically insignificant&#xD;
      cancer in less men (9% vs 22%), while avoiding biopsy in roughly one third of men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is need for improvement in the prostate diagnostic pathway even after&#xD;
      incorporation of mp-MRI, specifically mpMRI can miss significant cancer in around 10% of&#xD;
      cases and only 50% of positive scans turn out to harbor significant cancer at biopsy.&#xD;
      Moreover, the key functional imaging sequence of mp-MRI (i.e.: DWI) often suffers from image&#xD;
      artifacts causing difficulty in scan interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues the investigators aim to investigate Luminal Index MRI (LI-MRI), a&#xD;
      novel method of MR imaging that requires only up to 10 minutes to be performed and doesn't&#xD;
      require the use of contrast media. LI-MRI has shown promising results for the&#xD;
      characterization of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the diagnostic performance of LI-MRI and mpMRI for the detection of prostate&#xD;
      cancer will be directly compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Luminal Index MRI (LI-MRI). LI-MRI is a novel technique that allows the assessment of luminal&#xD;
      water fraction (LWF). The normal prostate consists of a glandular lumen and cellular areas;&#xD;
      cancer alters the balance of glandular to cellular spaces, reducing the fraction of glandular&#xD;
      lumen. This fraction decreases further as the grade of tumor increases. Using a multiecho&#xD;
      T2-weighted sequence, investigators can differentiate between long T2 values of the luminal&#xD;
      space and the short T2 values of the stromal/epithelial space. The luminal index of an image&#xD;
      pixel can be calculated as a fraction of the area of the luminal space to the sum of&#xD;
      cellular-stromal and luminal space. Studies have shown a good correlation between LWF and its&#xD;
      histological measurement, with potential to detect prostate cancer and predict tumor grade.&#xD;
      From the results of preliminary studies, the optimized LI-MRI sequence has been very good at&#xD;
      differentiating clinically significant and non-significant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE. The purpose of the study is to compare the diagnostic performance of LI-MRI (up to&#xD;
      10 minutes scan, no contrast required) and mp-MRI (35-40 min scan, intravenous contrast&#xD;
      injection required) for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN. This is a prospective, multi-centre, paired, non-randomised, comparative study.&#xD;
      Patients with clinically suspected prostate cancer that are scheduled for mpMRI as part of&#xD;
      their routine diagnostic workup will be asked to participate to the study. All participants&#xD;
      will undergo an additional LI-MRI sequence during the clinical scan session. Mp-MRI and&#xD;
      LI-MRI images will be interpreted independently by different radiologists, blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the other test. Targeted biopsies will be performed for any suspicious lesion&#xD;
      (i.e. MRI score 3-4-5) detected with mpMRI and/or LI-MRI, blinded to the source of the&#xD;
      lesion. The diagnostic performance of the two techniques will then be assessed using the&#xD;
      results of the targeted biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional translational study will also be performed to investigate the ability of DNA&#xD;
      methylation signatures in the plasma to identify men at high risk of metastases from high&#xD;
      risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
