      This pilot study will determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      Strengths-based Linkage to Alcohol Care (SLAC; a behavioral intervention) to link Veterans,&#xD;
      identified as hazardous drinkers in VHA primary care, to alcohol care. Participants screening&#xD;
      positive in VA primary care for hazardous drinking and posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD)&#xD;
      and/or depression in the past year will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two study conditions - SLAC plus usual care or usual care only. The investigators&#xD;
      will determine the feasibility of conducting a larger scale study to evaluate SLAC in primary&#xD;
      care and SLAC's acceptability among key stakeholders (e.g., Veterans, primary care&#xD;
      providers). Other outcomes will include exploring whether SLAC improves linkage to an alcohol&#xD;
      care or help option and/or reduces alcohol use and mental health (PTSD, depression) symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: It is important for Veterans with hazardous drinking to link to evidence-based&#xD;
      alcohol care given high rates of comorbid mental health symptoms (PTSD, depression). Veterans&#xD;
      with symptoms of PTSD who engage in hazardous drinking are at high risk for developing more&#xD;
      severe drinking problems and depression. And Veterans with PTSD or depression are three to&#xD;
      four times more likely to report hazardous drinking than Veterans without either of these&#xD;
      disorders. This project will determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      Strengths-based Linkage to Alcohol Care (SLAC) to link Veterans, identified as hazardous&#xD;
      drinkers in VHA primary care (PC), to alcohol care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: Existing VHA options, referral by a PC provider or mental health&#xD;
      provider co-located in PC, for linking Veterans with hazardous drinking in PC to alcohol care&#xD;
      are largely ineffective. Therefore, this proposal directly addresses HSR&amp;D priorities in the&#xD;
      areas of Access to Care, Mental Health, and Primary Care by testing a novel approach to&#xD;
      linking Veterans engaging in hazardous drinking, in the PC setting, to VA and non-VA alcohol&#xD;
      care, to improve their drinking and mental health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This project is highly innovative because it offers a solution to the critical&#xD;
      gap in VHA care in which PC patients with hazardous drinking are not receiving alcohol care.&#xD;
      It tests a strategy to increase linkage to alcohol care that is both intensive enough to&#xD;
      produce change, yet feasible to use in busy clinical settings with too-high demand on too-few&#xD;
      staff members. In addition, the intervention proposed (SLAC) targets Veterans with the entire&#xD;
      spectrum of hazardous drinking, including those with mental health symptoms. A highly&#xD;
      innovative feature of SLAC is that it teaches PC providers how to link Veterans to&#xD;
      evidence-based alcohol care instead of teaching providers how to treat hazardous drinking in&#xD;
      the PC setting. Providers' lack of knowledge on how to treat hazardous alcohol use is a&#xD;
      substantial obstacle to Veterans receiving alcohol care. Additional unique and innovative&#xD;
      features of SLAC are that it uses patients' self-identified strengths, abilities, and skills&#xD;
      to help them link to alcohol care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: (Aim 1): To adapt SLAC for use among Veterans with hazardous drinking who may&#xD;
      also have comorbid mental health symptoms, and for delivery by telephone in the VHA PC&#xD;
      setting. The investigators will conduct qualitative interviews with Veterans, PC staff, and&#xD;
      the VACO partners to ensure that the content and format of SLAC are adapted so they are&#xD;
      relevant and acceptable to these stakeholders. (Aim 2): To determine (a) the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a larger scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test SLAC's effectiveness and&#xD;
      (b) SLAC's acceptability among hazardous drinking Veterans in PC, and to explore (c) the&#xD;
      efficacy of SLAC among hazardous drinking Veterans in PC. To achieve Aim 2, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a multi-site pilot RCT of SLAC at two VA medical facilities (Little Rock, AR and&#xD;
      Palo Alto, CA). To achieve Aims 2a-b, the investigators will measure the feasibility (e.g.,&#xD;
      rates of enrollment and follow-up, fidelity to the SLAC intervention) of conducting a&#xD;
      subsequent larger RCT (to test SLAC's effectiveness) and SLAC's acceptability (SLAC&#xD;
      completion rates, satisfaction with SLAC) among Veterans. To achieve Aim 2c, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore the efficacy of SLAC to improve Veterans' linkage and engagement&#xD;
      in alcohol care, and their alcohol and mental health outcomes, at 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The investigators will use (Aim 1) qualitative interviews to adapt SLAC for&#xD;
      Veterans and for the PC setting, and (Aim 2) conduct a multi-site, pilot RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation/Next Steps: Should the findings justify a subsequent project, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to propose a fully powered, multi-site study, using a Hybrid design, to&#xD;
      test SLAC's clinical effectiveness when delivered in VHA PC while observing and gathering&#xD;
      information on the implementation potential of SLAC in this setting.&#xD;
