  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of a 15-minute meditation practice on sleep&#xD;
      architecture and high-frequency Heart Rate Variability (HF-HRV), as well as cognitive&#xD;
      performance after both a well-rested and sleep-deprived night.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is physiologically important for memory consolidation, mood and hormonal regulation,&#xD;
      and maintaining low levels of systemic inflammation. However, a substantial proportion oy f&#xD;
      people are reported to regularly sleep less than the recommended 7-9 hours a night.&#xD;
      Meditation may be a means to mitigate the negative effects of sleep deprivation, as many&#xD;
      types of meditations are associated with increasing high-frequency heart rate variability&#xD;
      (HF-HRV), which is an index of parasympathetic control of the heart. Greater parasympathetic&#xD;
      drive may be associated with physiological buffering of the detrimental effects of sleep&#xD;
      deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to conduct a waitlisted randomized control trial where subjects are&#xD;
      asked to learn and practice a 15-minute meditation (shoonya meditation) or 15 minutes of&#xD;
      alternate nostril breathing, twice a day. Subjects will be asked to complete some cognitive&#xD;
      tests before and after a night of sleep and a night of sleep deprivation. During the night of&#xD;
      sleep, participants will undergo polysomnography recording for sleep architecture and&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to undergo these same study procedures after 2 months of meditation&#xD;
      practice, after which the alternate nostril breathing group will also learn shoonya&#xD;
      meditation. Only this group will asked to undergo the same study procedures for a third time,&#xD;
      after they have practiced shoonya meditation for 2 months.&#xD;
