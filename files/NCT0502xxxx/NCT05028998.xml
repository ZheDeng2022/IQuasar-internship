    <textblock>
      Our nation is facing the COVID-19 pandemic during an ongoing opioid epidemic. Effective&#xD;
      treatment for patients with opioid use problems involves a treatment method called&#xD;
      Medication-Assisted Treatment, or MAT. In MAT, patients receive a medication that reduces&#xD;
      cravings and withdrawal symptoms and can prevent overdose. Patients also receive counseling.&#xD;
      Because the medications that are used in MAT are controlled substances, this treatment is&#xD;
      subject to a number of federal regulations. The need for social-distancing during the&#xD;
      pandemic would have made following these regulations very difficult for patients and their&#xD;
      providers. Because of these difficulties, the federal government eased regulations in March&#xD;
      2020, making it easier for patients to receive MAT with fewer (if any) in-person visits for&#xD;
      medication and counseling. Our team is studying the effects of these policy changes on the&#xD;
      treatment that patients with opioid use disorder receive and on their outcomes. We are using&#xD;
      both quantitative analyses of large, existing databases and qualitative analyses of&#xD;
      interviews with patients, providers, and policy-makers to study these effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 disease outbreak has occurred in the midst of a national opioid crisis, and&#xD;
      poses significant risk for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). If existing in-person&#xD;
      care delivery systems continued, patients would need to choose between risking exposure to&#xD;
      the virus, or foregoing OUD treatment. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the gold-standard&#xD;
      for treating OUD, involves daily medication (i.e., methadone or buprenorphine), close&#xD;
      medication monitoring, and counseling sessions, all typically occurring in person. The&#xD;
      medications used are schedule II and III controlled substances and are subject to greater&#xD;
      federal regulations than medications for other substance use disorders (SUD), such as alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder (AUD).3 To temper the impact of COVID-19 on OUD patients, in March 2020 the&#xD;
      federal government temporarily, but dramatically, loosened MAT restrictions to expand&#xD;
      treatment options, require fewer in-person visits, and prevent disruption to life-saving&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This rapid shift in policy created a natural experiment, allowing for the evaluation of this&#xD;
      MAT policy intervention on OUD patient care and outcomes. To examine the unknown effects of&#xD;
      this intervention, we propose a mixed-methods, naturalistic experimental design involving&#xD;
      quantitative analysis of large administrative and healthcare utilization datasets to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of MAT policy changes on patient care and outcomes. We will also compare OUD&#xD;
      patient outcomes to those of AUD patients (analogue comparison group), for whom treatment was&#xD;
      unaffected by MAT policy changes. We will then conduct interviews with patients, providers,&#xD;
      and key MAT policy stakeholders, to understand perspectives on the impact of these COVID-19&#xD;
      related MAT policy changes on the lives and well-being of OUD patients, and guide policy&#xD;
      decisions regarding whether or not to make these changes permanent. Given the general impact&#xD;
      of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients and systems, we will compare outcomes for patients with&#xD;
      OUD to analogue AUD patients, for whom there were no comparable medication policy changes in&#xD;
      response to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with OUD across three healthcare systems will be engaged in all steps of the&#xD;
      research, including influencing the research design, assisting in determining key variables&#xD;
      for Aims 1 and 2, collaborating in drafting our interview scripts for Aim 3, and assisting in&#xD;
      interpreting our results and disseminating findings to patient stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Using existing datasets, examine the effect of federal regulation changes on trends in&#xD;
      delivery of MAT for OUD before and after pandemic onset, with a particular focus on&#xD;
      prescription access, refills, and dosing schedules, as well as rates of in-person vs.&#xD;
      telehealth medical and counseling visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Estimate the impact of the changes in OUD healthcare delivery on crucial patient&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., emergency department visits, detoxification, treatment retention, relapse,&#xD;
      overdose, and mortality) by comparing patients with OUD vs. AUD (clinical analogue comparison&#xD;
      group), across time (pre- and post-MAT policy changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Through in-depth, qualitative interviews and analyses, characterize patient, provider,&#xD;
      and decision-maker perspectives on the impact of MAT policy changes in response to COVID-19&#xD;
      on patient access to MAT, health, functioning, and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Built-in reporting milestones will expedite data sharing to guide policy, provider, and&#xD;
      patient decision-making as health care systems determine how to prepare for future pandemics,&#xD;
      and post-COVID-19 pandemic care for OUD patients.&#xD;
