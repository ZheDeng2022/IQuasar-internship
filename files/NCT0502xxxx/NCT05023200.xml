  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellulitis is an increasingly common and unpleasant bacterial infection of the skin, usually&#xD;
      affecting the legs. Patients experience pain and swelling, loss of mobility, fever, and&#xD;
      chills. Patients may be left with chronic skin damage and 1 in 5 experience recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellulitis is treated with antibiotics, but it is unclear as to how long treatment should be&#xD;
      for. As a result, many patients get much longer antibiotic treatment than needed. This&#xD;
      exposes patients to the risks of taking unnecessary antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to find out what features of individual patients predict a good, sustained&#xD;
      recovery from cellulitis. These may include medical conditions and clinical response to the&#xD;
      first few days of antibiotic treatment, such as changes in skin temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are being treated in hospital for cellulitis will be invited to take part.&#xD;
      Information will be collected about patients who will be followed up for 3-6 months. Devices&#xD;
      for measuring skin temperature will also be compared to see which one works best. This&#xD;
      information will be used to help develop a set of rules that doctors can use to guide the&#xD;
      length of antibiotic treatment. This should ensure that future patients receive the amount of&#xD;
      antibiotics needed and no more.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single centre prospective cohort study of patients with cellulitis of the&#xD;
      lower limb. The primary objective of this study is to understand what features of individual&#xD;
      patients predict a sustained recovery from cellulitis. This information will be used to test&#xD;
      and refine a previously developed risk score that predicts clinical outcomes of patients with&#xD;
      cellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include investigating whether early response to antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      (e.g. reduction in skin temperature and patient-reported symptoms) improves the predictive&#xD;
      ability of the risk score. The study design also includes a nested technology comparison of&#xD;
      temperature measurement devices to identify the best device for measuring affected skin&#xD;
      temperature change in patients with cellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response will be measured for up to four days from starting antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
      This includes the change in temperature and area of affected skin, physiological&#xD;
      observations, blood test results (e.g. C-reactive protein) and patient-reported pain and&#xD;
      swelling scores. Patients will be followed up at 28 and 90 days (+/- 180 days for those&#xD;
      recruited in the first year) to assess recovery, recurrence, cellulitis-related mortality,&#xD;
      quality of life, and return to normal activities.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults (age ≥18 years) identified by their treating clinician as having lower limb&#xD;
             cellulitis that requires IV or oral antibiotic treatment either from the hospital or&#xD;
             another service based outside of the hospital, which will conduct ongoing follow-up&#xD;
             regardless of location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who have already received 3 or more calendar days of antibiotics from the hospital for&#xD;
             cellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  receiving antibiotic therapy for another indication that is anticipated to continue&#xD;
             for longer than the antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and that, in the judgement of&#xD;
             the investigator, would impact the study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for whom a surgical procedure to treat their cellulitis is planned (i.e. debridement&#xD;
             of suspected necrotising skin / soft tissue infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who, in the judgement of the investigator, do not have a clear diagnosis of cellulitis&#xD;
             (to enable the exclusion of infections, such as severe/deep diabetic foot infection,&#xD;
             which may be loosely labelled as cellulitis, but treated with different guideline&#xD;
             antibiotic agents and durations).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  lack capacity to give informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are receiving end-of-life care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are already involved in a CTIMP of relevance to the treatment of their cellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are unlikely, in the opinion of the investigator, to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
