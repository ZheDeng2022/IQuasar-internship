  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although many researchers would agree that obesity per se is not a risk factor for difficult&#xD;
      intubation, there are many well known obesity-related challenges in airway management&#xD;
      including difficulty with mask ventilation, more frequent and rapid oxygen desaturation,&#xD;
      increased oxygen consumption, and increased sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects&#xD;
      of anesthetic and analgesic drugs. Hence, in these conditions, rapid and nontraumatic&#xD;
      intubation gain higher interest. There is controversy about using videoaryngoscopy (VL) in&#xD;
      obese patients in these difficult situations. The primary aim of this study is to compare, in&#xD;
      terms of intubation time, VL,VL plus stylet and direct-laryngoscopy(DL) plus stylet&#xD;
      combination with DL alone in obese patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who will be scheduled for surgeries requiring endotracheal intubation, with a body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) more than 30 kg/m2, will be included to this study. During preanesthetic&#xD;
      visit (performed by an anesthesiologist not involved in this study) history of difficult&#xD;
      intubation, measurement of common predictive indices for difficult intubation (BMI,&#xD;
      thyromental distance, neck circumference, Mallampati grade, interincisal [or intergingival]&#xD;
      distances), and evaluation of status of dentition and neck movement will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, all patients will be connected to standard monitoring devices.&#xD;
      Anesthesia induction will be carried out according to our hospital obese patient anesthesia&#xD;
      management protocol. Then, after induction of anesthesia, the patients will be intubated one&#xD;
      of four pre-defined protocols that will be determined via randomization during a&#xD;
      preanesthetic visit by a person who is unfamiliar with the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis of this study is; using a video-laryngoscope plus stylet will reduce the&#xD;
      time required to achieve successful tracheal intubation in obese patients.&#xD;
