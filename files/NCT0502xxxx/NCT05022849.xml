    <description>Participants will receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine intravenously (IV) followed by JNJ-75229414 IV infusion escalated sequentially with a targeted dose consistent with the dose required by the cohort being enrolled to determine recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen(s). Additional, intermediate dose levels may be implemented based on the review of all available data including, but not limited to, safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) by the study evaluation team (SET). Participants may receive bridging therapy (anti-androgen receptor agents [example, abiraterone, enzalutamide] and radiotherapy, or chemotherapy [example, docetaxel]) if clinically indicated to maintain disease stability.</description>
