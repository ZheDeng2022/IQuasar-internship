  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for individuals who have advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA) and a body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m2 are limited, and this patient population may be neglected in current&#xD;
      clinical care pathways for OA management. These individuals are considered to be at high risk&#xD;
      for complications with total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and as a result may not be eligible for&#xD;
      this procedure unless they lose significant weight. However, there is limited evidence for&#xD;
      endorsing weight loss as beneficial prior to TKA. Further, unsupervised weight loss could put&#xD;
      patients at risk for muscle loss and development of sarcopenic obesity, a health condition&#xD;
      that negatively impacts mobility and mortality. This suggests that weight loss might not be&#xD;
      the primary treatment goal for this patient population. Integrated non-surgical treatment&#xD;
      approaches are needed that can target the specific needs of this knee OA patient group. This&#xD;
      study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a personalized, multicomponent&#xD;
      intervention, and its effects on body composition and physical function compared to usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the POMELO study are to determine if a multicomponent behavioural&#xD;
      intervention that includes personalized nutrition recommendations, progressive resistance&#xD;
      training exercise, and chronic disease self-management support is feasible and acceptable for&#xD;
      individuals living with advanced knee OA and a BMI ≥35 kg/m2. The secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      assess potential effects of the intervention on muscle mass and physical function compared to&#xD;
      usual care. The intervention is delivered over three months, followed by six months of&#xD;
      ongoing maintenance support. Assessments are completed at baseline, interim (after the 3&#xD;
      month intervention phase), and at study end (after the 6 month maintenance phase) [for a&#xD;
      total study period of 10 months]. This project will inform and influence the future&#xD;
      development and implementation of more personalized knee OA treatment approaches for adults&#xD;
      with a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 and reduce health disparities in access to effective care. Findings will&#xD;
      also contribute to improved health outcomes for this vulnerable patient population, and&#xD;
      enhanced delivery of health services by offering an alternative treatment pathway targeted to&#xD;
      patient needs.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group will receive initial nutrition and exercise consultations with a Registered Dietitian (RD) and Clinical Exercise Physiologist (CEP) to personalize the study protocol and recommendations to their needs. The intervention period (3 months) includes: a) whole-body resistance training exercise sessions completed three-times per week (at-home with loaned equipment and/or in-person at the research gym); b) biweekly nutrition education provided through video conferencing; and c) biweekly OA self-management support provided through video conferencing.&#xD;
After the 3 month intervention, participants will receive bimonthly phone calls from a study staff member to encourage continued behavior changes during the 6 month maintenance phase.</description>
