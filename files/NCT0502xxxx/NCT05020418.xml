      This project will use automated audit and feedback to improve compliance with antimicrobial&#xD;
      prophylaxis guidelines for CIED procedures that we anticipate will translate into better&#xD;
      outcomes for our patients. A multi-faceted implementation bundle to promote de-implementation&#xD;
      of guideline discordant care will be tested at three intervention sites. Materials and tools&#xD;
      will then be disseminated throughout the VA healthcare system if the intervention is found to&#xD;
      be effective.&#xD;

      Aim I tests the hypothesis that a multi-faceted implementation strategy that includes&#xD;
      educational sessions with members of electrophysiology teams and locally-adapted monthly&#xD;
      surveillance reports about guideline-concordant pre-procedural antimicrobial use and&#xD;
      guideline-discordant post-procedural antimicrobial use, 90-day incidence of CIED infections,&#xD;
      and 90-day incidence of C. difficile infections and 7-day incidence of AKI that will be&#xD;
      delivered to local infectious diseases champions and shared with electrophysiology teams&#xD;
      using blended facilitation will promote uptake of best practices and improve outcomes. This&#xD;
      hypothesis incorporates learning/unlearning and fills a major gap caused by the dearth of&#xD;
      rigorous de- implementation and de-adoption studies. Aim II tests the hypothesis that&#xD;
      electronic health records (EHRs) and medical informatics have advanced to the point that it&#xD;
      will be feasible, during the next four years, to establish an audit and feedback surveillance&#xD;
      system that can be scaled and disseminated widely across the VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to address the study aims.&#xD;
      This will include interviews with key stakeholders and quantitative measurement of quality&#xD;
      metrics (e.g., pre-and post-procedure antimicrobial use) and outcomes (e.g., cardiac device&#xD;
      infections, acute kidney injuries, C. difficile infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receiving a cardiac device implantation within the VA healthcare system during&#xD;
      the study period may be potentially included. Medical records previously reviewed and&#xD;
      accessed may also be included for validation, testing, and optimization of electronic&#xD;
      algorithms. In addition to the VA patients who will participate, key stakeholders for&#xD;
      infection prevention in the cardiac device laboratory (e.g., providers, nurses,&#xD;
      electrophysiology laboratory staff) will also participate in interviews. Active&#xD;
      implementation will occur at 3 VA sites, a passive dissemination process will occur at all VA&#xD;
      sites with a cardiac device laboratory (~78 VA sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      High quality studies establish that prolonged prophylaxis has no beneficial impact on&#xD;
      CIED-related infection rates but worsens outcomes and leads to preventable deaths. Despite&#xD;
      guidelines specifically recommending against prolonged prophylaxis, this practice is common&#xD;
      in cardiac electrophysiology laboratories, including VA and non-VA hospitals. At the same&#xD;
      time, antimicrobial resistance and overuse represent critical threats to the health of the&#xD;
      population. This intersection- inappropriate prescribing and a critical need to improve use--&#xD;
      creates an urgent need for research into methods to promote adoption of best antimicrobial&#xD;
      use and de-implementation of ineffective and harmful prescribing. IT-based solutions for&#xD;
      improving antimicrobial use, including antimicrobial prophylaxis, is a quality-improvement&#xD;
      strategy endorsed by The Joint Commission. This project will advance this concept and couple&#xD;
      learning/unlearning processes to promote uptake of best practices. If effective, this model&#xD;
      can be replicated in other settings of care to improve antimicrobial use.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Cardiac device procedures performed within the national VA healthcare system during the period from Fiscal Year (FY) 16-24 will be identified using a list of relevant Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Based on our preliminary results, we anticipate that the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) EP Procedures Cohort (electronic surveillance cohort) will include approximately 100,000 cardiac device cases. Because this cohort is based in CDW, once a Veteran undergoing a device procedure is identified using CPT codes, the orders, procedures, and consults that occurred during the 90-day window following the procedure can be extracted from the VA Electronic Health Record (EHR) In addition to the full cohort, the implementation bundle will be tested at the three high-volume intervention sites (~1500 cases per year). Roll out of the interventions will occur in a stepped manner, such that pre- and post- intervention data will be collected at all sites.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This study is open to any adult VA patient with data about a cardiac device procedure performed in the electrophysiology laboratory entered into the national VA EHR. During FY 20-FY 24, we anticipate that this will include approximately 9,000 patients per year, or a total of 50,000 patients. In addition, cases that were previously accessed and used to develop the infection monitoring system, and the quality metric monitoring system, may also be included. This includes all patients entered in the VA Clinical Assessment Reporting and Tracking - Electrophysiology Cohort (CART-EP) database during the period from 2006-2016, and all VA patients who received a cardiac device procedure during the period from 2010-2019. This includes another approximately 50,000 patients, for a total of 100,000 patients.</description>
