      This regestry study is aimed to characterize the medical care and drug treatment under&#xD;
      real-life conditions among Chinese patients with moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis who are&#xD;
      not well controlled by topical therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic recurrent inflammatory skin disease, resulting in itchy,&#xD;
      red, and skin lesion. A survey conducted in 2014 in 39 tertiary hospitals of 15 provinces in&#xD;
      mainland China has shown that the incidence of AD in outpatients (7.8%) has been raised in&#xD;
      recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among topical therapy of AD, corticosteroids are first line therapy. In patients with&#xD;
      extensive and severe dermatitis, topical therapy may be insufficient. Such patients may&#xD;
      require the addition of either oral corticosteroid or systemic immunosuppressive therapy and&#xD;
      even phototherapy. There is no clear recommendation treatment for each kind of patients with&#xD;
      different severity yet and there are still huge unmet medical needs for treatment. There is&#xD;
      not clear recommendation grade for these therapy in Chinese AD guideline and no published&#xD;
      data to demonstrate current treatment situation in real clinical practise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of clinical registry study is to document the use and effectiveness of therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions under real-life conditions. This study will help understand the clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, treatment utilization, treatment patterns, as well as disease-related&#xD;
      outcomes and cost among AD patients in China.&#xD;
