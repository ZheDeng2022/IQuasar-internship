  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project aims to better understand the multiple factors related to the clinical&#xD;
      evolution and the social participation of traumatic brain injured (TBI). The project will&#xD;
      provide better understanding of the patients' evolution during rehabilitation after TBI in&#xD;
      terms of adaptation and social participation, assess the effect of rehabilitation and study&#xD;
      social participation outcomes and quality of life of TBI patients one-year&#xD;
      post-rehabilitation. Project benefits include improvement of clinical practices and support&#xD;
      in decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this research project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: To provide a picture of the evolution, in terms of social adaptation and&#xD;
      participation of patients during rehabilitation after a TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: To study social participation outcomes and quality of life of TBI individuals one&#xD;
      year after the end of their rehabilitation.&#xD;

      Context: This clinical research project is part of a series of innovative approaches to&#xD;
      knowledge transfer in the field of trauma care funded by the Institut national d'excellence&#xD;
      en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS) that have been recently conducted by 5&#xD;
      rehabilitation centers and which laid the groundwork for a culture of systematic measurement&#xD;
      of clinical and functional evolution during rehabilitation and of social participation&#xD;
      outcomes of Quebec adults with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Mayo-Portland Adaptability&#xD;
      Inventory-4, or MPAI-4, which has three short scales: Abilities (12 items), Adaptation (12&#xD;
      items), Participation (8 items) giving specific indexes to each of these three dimensions, as&#xD;
      well as a total score reflecting the general level of adaptation/social participation, was&#xD;
      implemented in all the TBI rehabilitation programs within the trauma care continuum of&#xD;
      greater Montreal (5 rehabilitation sites). These new practices allow to carry out original&#xD;
      and rigorous prospective studies in order to better understand the multiple factors related&#xD;
      to the clinical evolution of individuals who have sustained a TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Objective 1- To provide a picture of the evolution, in terms of social&#xD;
      adaptation/participation, of a multicenter patient cohort in rehabilitation following TBI,&#xD;
      according to their rehabilitation pathway (inpatient-outpatient, outpatient only); Objective&#xD;
      Objective 2- To study social participation outcomes and quality of life of TBI individuals&#xD;
      one year after the end of their rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: MPAI-4 data will be obtained for all patients at start and end of&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and they will be subsequently contacted by phone one year after the end of&#xD;
      their rehabilitation to administer the MPAI-4 Participation scale and QOLIBRI, measuring&#xD;
      quality of life. At the end of the project, at least 1,500 unique patient cases will have&#xD;
      been integrated into the study. For the one-year post-rehabilitation follow-up of the&#xD;
      subjects included in the database we estimate the loss at 30% maximum; we expect to be able&#xD;
      to collect post-rehabilitation data from a minimum of 700 patients who have completed&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The raw data will be subjected to quantitative statistical analyzes to meet&#xD;
      different objectives: ANOVAs to compare start-to-end rehabilitation measurement times for the&#xD;
      different rehabilitation pathways; ANCOVA to compare groups on the total score and the three&#xD;
      MPAI-4 scales at the end of rehabilitation, with scores at rehabilitation start as&#xD;
      covariates; ANCOVA to compare the two groups on the Participation scale and QOLIBRI at the&#xD;
      one-year follow-up with scores at rehabilitation start as covariates. Regression analyses&#xD;
      will also be performed to determine which sociodemographic and clinical variables are most&#xD;
      closely related to MPAI-4 and QOLIBRI scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impacts: This innovative study will provide an unprecedented portrait of social&#xD;
      participation and clinical evolution during rehabilitation within the continuum of trauma&#xD;
      care services for a large cohort of adults (young adults, middle-aged adults, seniors) who&#xD;
      sustained a TBI. This will provide evidence that will improve practices and support&#xD;
      decision-making related to the organization of services. The systematic use of MPAI-4 may&#xD;
      also help to assess the effects of changes in rehabilitation practices (eg, when implementing&#xD;
      TBI practice guidelines). The various actors involved in this project and who will form the&#xD;
      Monitoring committee will ensure the multiple benefits and impacts of the project.&#xD;

    <description>The MPAI-4 has 29 scored items and each item is scored on a 5-point scale (from 0 to 4). There are three subscales: Abilities (12 scored items, 0-47 after adjusting scores), Adjustment (9 scored items, 0-46 after adjusting scores), Participation (8 scored items, 0-30 after adjusting scores) giving specific indexes to each of these three dimensions, as well as a total score (all 29 items, 0-111) reflecting the general level of adaptation/social participation. As three items contribute to both the Adjustment and the Participation scales, the total score is less than the sum of the three subscales. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>
