      This study was conducted in the Department of Dermatology of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical&#xD;
      Centre, Karachi from January to June 2021 after receiving approval from the institutional&#xD;
      ethical and research committee of hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated through NCSS software. Total of one fifty four non-admitted&#xD;
      patients were assigned two study groups with equal sample size of 77 randomly through lottery&#xD;
      method. Those patients aged between 18 to 60 years of either gender with cutaneous warts for&#xD;
      &gt; 1 week to 48 weeks were included after written informed consent. Patients treated&#xD;
      previously for warts by any methodology, with history of vascular disease, immunocompromised,&#xD;
      hypertension, cardiovascular disorder, pregnancy, lactation and hypersensitivity to lidocaine&#xD;
      were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All demography, clinical history was recorded by a principal investigator on a predesigned&#xD;
      Performa , informed written consent was taken before enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A received intralesional bleomycin 0.1% therapy until the lesion blanched. It was&#xD;
      prepared manually by diluting 15 mg powder in 5 ml distilled water and then each ml was&#xD;
      further diluted by adding 2ml of 2% lignocaine, double the amount taken from the vial, so&#xD;
      that concentration became 1mg/1ml (0.1%). Group B patients were treated with liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      with the help of a cotton swab wrapped on a wooden stick and was applied firmly with 01 mm&#xD;
      extra healthy skin margin until the lesion blanched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up was carried out at 02, 04 and 06 weeks. Both the groups were assessed and compared&#xD;
      for efficacy after 6 weeks of therapy. SPSS 23 was used for analyzing data.&#xD;
