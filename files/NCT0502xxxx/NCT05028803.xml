  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to reduce fasting circulating BCAA concentrations in volunteers&#xD;
      using Sodium Phenylbutyrate. In addition, we aim investigate the effect of BCAA lowering on&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity measures and muscle metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of twenty proteinogenic amino acids are present in the human body1. Due to their&#xD;
      chemical structure, three of the amino acids - isoleucine, leucine and valine, are termed&#xD;
      branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). Humans consume BCAAs through protein containing foods&#xD;
      such as meat, eggs and milk2,3. However, recent studies, have revealed links between elevated&#xD;
      plasma levels of BCAAs and type 2 diabetes (T2D), insulin resistance (IR) and obesity4-6.&#xD;
      Such is the strength of these links that elevated blood concentration of BCAAs are considered&#xD;
      biomarkers and prognostic factors for obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes7-9.&#xD;
      Collectively, these data suggest that targeting dysregulation of BCAAs by reducing BCAA&#xD;
      levels could offer important therapeutic value. Various methods can be implemented in order&#xD;
      to reduce circulating fasting BCAA concentrations one method that our department has&#xD;
      successfully implemented includes the restriction of BCAAs in 6 healthy volunteer&#xD;
      participants through diet control. By restricting BCAA in the diets of healthy individuals,&#xD;
      we successfully reduced fasting circulating BCAAs by 50% in just seven days. However, the&#xD;
      construction of the diet was very time consuming, tedious, and longer studies would be&#xD;
      plagued with compliance issues. This has led us to try an alternative method, which is to&#xD;
      lower BCAA levels using Sodium Phenylbutyrate (NaPB). NaPB is a commonly used medication to&#xD;
      treat patients with urea cycle disorders (UCD). However, it seems a secondary effect of the&#xD;
      drug is to reduce circulating BCAA levels in volunteers. Lindsey Burrage et al 2014, reported&#xD;
      significantly lower circulating BCAAs in volunteers receiving NaPB when compared to subjects&#xD;
      not receiving NaPB10. Although the mechanisms are not fully understood it has been suggested&#xD;
      that NaPB causes depletion of glutamine in the blood which may activate BCAA catabolism and&#xD;
      thus cause a reduction in circulating plasma BCAAs11. It is our aim to use NaPB to lower&#xD;
      BCAAs in prediabetic and obese participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit Volunteers will sign a consent form, A health assessment, including an ECG to&#xD;
      monitor your heart, a blood pressure check, height and weight measurement and a medical&#xD;
      history check A fasted blood sample to measure health parameters, including glucose, HbA1c,&#xD;
      liver and kidney function, lipid profiles, thyroid function and full blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we received the details and results (within 1 week) from your screening session, we will&#xD;
      contact you regarding your suitability. If you are suitable, we (you and the research team&#xD;
      together) will decide on the dates to start the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruct you in the completion of a food diary. STUDY DAY 0 For this day, we will ask&#xD;
      volunteers to attend after an overnight fast (except water). We will take small samples of&#xD;
      your blood (fasting sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blood samples participants will receive a 'heavy water' drink called Deuterium&#xD;
      Oxide (D2O). This is almost the same as normal water, but a small and harmless chemical&#xD;
      change allows us to calculate how much new muscle your body is making. The amount of D2O you&#xD;
      are given will be calculated based on your body weight. Participants will provide saliva&#xD;
      samples before and after receiving D2O. Before they go home they will receive small daily&#xD;
      top-ups of D2O and asked to collect your saliva 3 hours after taking your daily top-ups for&#xD;
      the first week, and twice weekly thereafter and keep the saliva samples in a fridge/freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DAY 7 On return for the second study day participants will also bring with them saliva&#xD;
      samples from the last 7 days. For this day, again volunteers are to attend after an overnight&#xD;
      fast (except water). We will perform a muscle biopsy (fasting sample) to use as our&#xD;
      baseline/pre-intervention measures. A fully qualified medical practitioner will take muscle&#xD;
      biopsies. Biopsies are sterile procedures, with local anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsies Muscle biopsies will be taken from the thigh. Before the biopsy, the area&#xD;
      will be cleaned and anaesthetised with local anaesthetic, after which a small (approx. 1cm&#xD;
      wide, 2-3cm deep) incision will be made through the skin. The muscle biopsy (smaller than the&#xD;
      size of a pea) will then be removed from the thigh using conchotome forceps (essentially a&#xD;
      sharp pair of tweezers), with 3-5 small pieces taken to ensure adequate sampling. The&#xD;
      incision will then be stitched shut and covered with a waterproof adhesive dressing. Muscle&#xD;
      biopsies are usually well tolerated, largely painless (though the insertion is felt) and the&#xD;
      complication rate is very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy Aftercare At the end of the biopsy, you will receive advice and information about how&#xD;
      to take care of the wound and given an information leaflet. Five to seven days after each&#xD;
      muscle biopsy, the stitches will be removed and the wounds will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, volunteers will also have a series of minimally and non-invasive&#xD;
      tests to assess different aspects of your health and metabolic status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will measure how well the body is able to process sugar by performing the oral&#xD;
           glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This is usually used to diagnose diabetes, or stratify&#xD;
           the future risk of diabetes. For this test, you will be given 75g of a sugary drink.&#xD;
           Small blood samples will be taken prior to the drink and every 15 minutes (for 2 hours)&#xD;
           from a cannula (thin plastic line) sited in a vein in your hand, which will be placed in&#xD;
           a warm box.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A light lunch will be provided at midday. After lunch the first oral dose of phenyl&#xD;
           butyrate will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Volunteers will receive the first dose of Phenylbutyrate after lunch. Volunteers will&#xD;
           receive 5 grams of sodium Phenylbutyrate every day. 5 g/m2/day of Sodium Phenylbutyrate&#xD;
           will be split into three and taken with each meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will receive Sodium Phenylbutyrate to last one week. STUDY DAY 10 For this&#xD;
           day, we will ask you to attend after an overnight fast (except water). We will take&#xD;
           small samples of your blood (fasting sample). In addition, blood pressure, weight and&#xD;
           height will be recorded. Volunteers will also have an ECG. It is anticipated study day&#xD;
           11 will take up to 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DAY 17 For this day, we will ask you to attend after an overnight fast (except water).&#xD;
      We will take small samples of your blood (fasting sample) and a saliva sample to use as our&#xD;
      midpoint intervention measures. In addition, blood pressure, weight and height will be&#xD;
      recorded. Volunteers will then be provided with another medication organiser box with enough&#xD;
      Sodium Phenylbutyrate to last them until the end of the study. It is anticipated study day 17&#xD;
      will take up to 1 hour to complete. We will also request a test for Leukopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DAY 28 This is the final day of the study, again volunteers are to attend after an&#xD;
      overnight fast (except water). A fully qualified medical practitioner will take muscle&#xD;
      biopsies. Biopsies are sterile procedures, with local anaesthetic. Following this, we will&#xD;
      perform the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), volunteers will be given 75g of a sugary&#xD;
      drink. Small blood samples will be taken prior to the drink and every 15 minutes (for 2&#xD;
      hours) from a cannula which will be placed in a warm box In addition, blood pressure, weight&#xD;
      and height will also be recorded. In addition a Fructosamine test will also be requested pre&#xD;
      and post study.&#xD;
