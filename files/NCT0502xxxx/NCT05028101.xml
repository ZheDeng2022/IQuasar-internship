  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if a functional medicine approach, delivered as an adjunct to&#xD;
      standard of care, is feasible, safe, clinically beneficial and cost-effective for patients&#xD;
      undergoing autologous breast reconstruction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous microsurgical breast reconstruction is associated with a protracted recovery and a&#xD;
      significant amount of opioid utilization. Many institutions have &quot;Enhanced Recovery After&#xD;
      Surgery (ERAS)&quot; protocols that utilize multi-modality therapy to decrease opioid use, length&#xD;
      of stay, hospital costs and expedite recovery. However, nutrition-based interventions used&#xD;
      perioperatively are not currently part of ERAS protocols for surgical sub-specialties,&#xD;
      including breast surgery despite ample literature that nutrition (with or without&#xD;
      supplements) can improve surgical wound healing and other outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional medicine model of care expands upon the conventional medicine model of care by&#xD;
      providing a unique operating system that works to reverse illness, promote health and&#xD;
      optimize function. A foundation of functional medicine is the use of food as medicine to&#xD;
      prevent, treat and reverse chronic disease. Dietary supplements are used as an adjunct to&#xD;
      nutrition-based interventions. Dietitians support patients with implementing food plans, and&#xD;
      health coaches support patients through lifestyle and behavioral changes focused on sleep,&#xD;
      exercise and movement and stress reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the feasibility of implementing a functional medicine-based&#xD;
      intervention focused on nutrition and lifestyle, and the ability of the intervention to&#xD;
      improve wound healing and decrease various post-operative complications in patients&#xD;
      undergoing autologous breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to attend study visits, complete questionnaires and have their&#xD;
      blood drawn. Participants randomized to standard of care plus functional medicine will be&#xD;
      asked to also follow a specific food plan, take specific dietary supplements, exercise and&#xD;
      engage in stress reduction techniques for 3 months prior to and after surgery. The study&#xD;
      duration is 6 months.&#xD;

PROMIS is an NIH-validated set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children within the general population and in those living with chronic conditions. This is considered SOC for the Center for Functional Medicine. Scores are transformed into T-Scores. The mean (SD) of the US General Population is 50 (10). Higher scores mean better outcomes.</description>

The MSQ identifies symptoms that a patient has experienced over the previous 48 hours based upon their health profile. The MSQ utilizes a semantic differential scale to determine how often a patient is experiencing a specific symptom and to track a participant's progress. All scores are totaled and higher MSQ scores indicate worsening of symptoms while lower scores indicate symptom improvement. This is considered SOC for the Center for Functional Medicine.&#xD;
Total Score Range: 0-352, with higher scores meaning worse outcomes.</description>
