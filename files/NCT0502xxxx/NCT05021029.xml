  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish a prospective cohort of individuals diagnosed with gastric pre-malignant&#xD;
      conditions (chronic gastritis, atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, intestinal&#xD;
      metaplasia, intestinal dysplasia) to monitor and study disease progression. The Investigators&#xD;
      will like to survey cohort participants for lifestyle behaviors and environmental exposures&#xD;
      associated with gastric pre-malignancy and cancer. Analyzing patient biospecimens to identify&#xD;
      and characterize host and microbiome biomarkers associated with initiation and progression of&#xD;
      gastric pre-malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initially, study coordinators will identify prevalent patients diagnosed with gastric&#xD;
      pre-malignancy at UC Davis Health in the last five years or receive a list of eligible&#xD;
      patients by a GI doctor at UC Davis Health. These individuals will be sent an invitation&#xD;
      letter via mail or by physician, to participate in the study and will be provided with a&#xD;
      reply slip authorizing contact by the research team. Individuals willing to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be then contacted by research coordinators via phone/mail to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Provide information about the study and answer questions (via phone call,&#xD;
      video-conference, letter or email),&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Answer study questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Sign study's informed consent to provide saliva, blood, urine and/or stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Sign a HIPPA form to obtain permission to retrieve archival tumor blocks and pathology&#xD;
      reports&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be also asked for permission to regular re-contact and will be asked to&#xD;
      inform study coordinators about future endoscopic appointments, where blood, stomach biopsies&#xD;
      and stomach juice samples will be obtained. If the participant agrees, permission will be&#xD;
      requested for these samples as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To recruit incident participants, the research coordinators will review endoscopic schedules&#xD;
      and or be provided a list of patients who fit the criteria to identify participants suspected&#xD;
      or diagnosed with gastric pre-malignant diseases. Participants will be asked to consent and&#xD;
      asked to fill out a short version survey before their endoscopic procedure. Contact&#xD;
      information will be collected (Phone, Address, Email) in order to send the full version of&#xD;
      the survey later. Participants will be asked if they would like to donate a blood, saliva and&#xD;
      urine sample and will be provided with a stool collection kit for home sampling, which will&#xD;
      be returned to the research team in a pre-paid padded envelope. At the appointment,&#xD;
      participants will also be asked if they would agree to provide tissue and/or gastric juices&#xD;
      that will be obtained by their physician during their procedure or any leftover tissue after&#xD;
      histological examination. For specimens requiring histological analyses, only once consents&#xD;
      and/or HIPPA waivers are received will any leftover specimens be collected for this research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (prevalent and incidence) will be contacted once a year to update surveys,&#xD;
      clinical and risk factor information, consent and HIPPA waivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the study questionnaire will be analyzed regularly using standard epidemiological&#xD;
      methods. Biospecimens will be used for multiple omics approaches and results will be&#xD;
      published regularly in medical and scientific journals and conferences.&#xD;
