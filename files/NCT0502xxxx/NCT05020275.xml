    <textblock>
      Osimertinib is a tyrosine kinase (TKI) inhibitor targeting EGF-R (epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor) and used in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with&#xD;
      oncogenic drug addiction to EGF-R. The results of the FLAURA study justifies this 3rd&#xD;
      generation TKI as the first line TKI of choice since an increase in overall survival of&#xD;
      several months has been observed compared to TKIs of previous generations (erlotinib,&#xD;
      gefitinib). However, the response to osimertinib is heterogeneous and some patients are poor&#xD;
      responder. In addition, even when an initial response to ITK is observed, the natural history&#xD;
      of the disease inevitably leads to the appearance of resistance mutations and loss of&#xD;
      efficacy of osimertinib after a few months of treatment.In the hypothesis of a&#xD;
      concentration-effect relationship, an underexposure (an insufficient plasma concentration) to&#xD;
      osimertinib could lead to a suboptimal response by favoring the appearance of molecular&#xD;
      resistance. By analogy with the mechanisms of resistance to anti-infectives, the systemic&#xD;
      concentration of TKI may have to be maintained above a certain value throughout the treatment&#xD;
      to reach an effective concentration in the tumor, in order to to prevent the selection of&#xD;
      resistant clones. The value of this approach for optimizing treatment with TKI has been shown&#xD;
      for this therapeutic class. This mechanistic hypothesis has been suggested several TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the association between pharmacokinetics of TKIs and the development of&#xD;
      resistance has been reported in several pilot studies for dasatinib, erlotinib. Furthermore,&#xD;
      a link between TKI concentration and ctDNA concentration was demonstrated in a pilot study by&#xD;
      Garlan et al. in 11 patients treated for melanoma with vemurafenib.&#xD;

      preemptive and predictive biomarkers of drug response and to increase mechanistic knowledge&#xD;
      regarding risk factor of resistance to osimertinib. Finally, if the hypotheses evaluated in&#xD;
      this translational research study are verified, therapeutic drug monitoring of TKI (and ctDNA&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osimertinib is a tyrosine kinase (TKI) inhibitor targeting EGF-R (epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor) and used in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with&#xD;
      oncogenic drug addiction to EGF-R. The results of the FLAURA study justifies this 3rd&#xD;
      generation TKI as the first line TKI of choice since an increase in overall survival of&#xD;
      several months has been observed compared to TKIs of previous generations (erlotinib,&#xD;
      gefitinib). However, the response to osimertinib is heterogeneous and some patients are poor&#xD;
      responder. In addition, even when an initial response to ITK is observed, the natural history&#xD;
      of the disease inevitably leads to the appearance of resistance mutations and loss of&#xD;
      efficacy of osimertinib after a few months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of resistances is a major problem since they lead to treatment failure.&#xD;
      Identifying biomarkers predictive of the response and / or the emergence of these mutations&#xD;
      of resistance is therefore a research challenge. Indeed, knowing risk factors molecular&#xD;
      resistance could help to optimize the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first approach to monitor the disease is the measurment of residual disease circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA in the blood of patients (ctDNA). These minimally invasive &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; can be&#xD;
      performed iteratively, unlike tissue biopsies. It is a dynamic biomarker with several&#xD;
      advantages. On the one hand, it would be a biomarker for monitoring residual disease during&#xD;
      treatment. The ctDNA concentration and its kinetics under treatment have also been associated&#xD;
      with the clinical outcome. Better overall survival has thus been observed with the first&#xD;
      generation molecules in patients with low baseline ctDNA concentration or a rapid decrease in&#xD;
      the ctDNA concentration at the start of treatment. On the other hand, the analysis of ctDNA&#xD;
      makes it possible to characterize the nature of the acquired resistance mutations appearing&#xD;
      during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, TKI are good candidates for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The objective of&#xD;
      TDM is to assess exposure by measuring plasma concentration. TKIs are characterized by&#xD;
      interindividual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. Indeed, taking into account their route of&#xD;
      administration (per os) and their metabolism (substrate for CYP450 enzymes), plasma exposure&#xD;
      is variable from one patient to another. Thus, at the same dosage, depending on absorption&#xD;
      and metabolic capacity, patients are not likely to be exposed to the same plasma&#xD;
      concentrations. This PK variability is also observed for osimertinib since interindividual&#xD;
      coefficients of variation of plasma exposure of 50 to 60% have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the hypothesis of a concentration-effect relationship, an underexposure (an insufficient&#xD;
      plasma concentration) to osimertinib could lead to a suboptimal response by favoring the&#xD;
      appearance of molecular resistance. By analogy with the mechanisms of resistance to&#xD;
      anti-infectives, the systemic concentration of TKI may have to be maintained above a certain&#xD;
      value throughout the treatment to reach an effective concentration in the tumor, in order to&#xD;
      to prevent the selection of resistant clones. The value of this approach for optimizing&#xD;
      treatment with TKI has been shown for this therapeutic class. This mechanistic hypothesis has&#xD;
      been suggested several TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the association between pharmacokinetics of TKIs and the development of&#xD;
      resistance has been reported in several pilot studies for dasatinib, erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a link between TKI concentration and ctDNA concentration was demonstrated in a&#xD;
      pilot study by Garlan et al. in 11 patients treated for melanoma with vemurafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NSCLC, it therefore appears relevant and innovative to study the relationship between the&#xD;
      plasma concentration of osimertinib and the efficacy of the treatment. In addition, it would&#xD;
      be relevant to investigate the correlation between the plasma concentration of osimertinib&#xD;
      and ctDNA in order to assess whether osimertinib plasma exposure could be a risk factor of&#xD;
      emergence of resistance to anti-EGF treatment. These two minimally invasive biomarkers could&#xD;
      be integrated into a dynamic monitoring of the treatment response in a personalized medicine&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results expected, perspectives As this is an observational study, there is no need to add&#xD;
      invasive procedure compared to the usual follow-up of patients with NSCLC , the benefit /&#xD;
      risk balance is favorable for the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit is collective since if the interest of a therapeutic follow-up by&#xD;
      pharmacological (and oncogenetic) approach is demonstrated, the clinicians will have at their&#xD;
      disposal minimally invasive, longitudinal and follow-up biomarkers, allowing to prevent the&#xD;
      emergence of resistance to osimertinib to maintain its effectiveness as longer as possible.&#xD;
      It should allow to individualize the dosages for each patient, taking into account their&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile and the molecular profile of the tumor. This personalized medicine in&#xD;
      &quot;2-dimensions&quot; would help to delay tumor progression and would preserve a valuable line of&#xD;
      treatment with TKI by optimizing its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the results of this study is important since the aims are to identify&#xD;
      preemptive and predictive biomarkers of drug response and to increase mechanistic knowledge&#xD;
      regarding risk factor of resistance to osimertinib. Finally, if the hypotheses evaluated in&#xD;
      this translational research study are verified, therapeutic drug monitoring of TKI (and ctDNA&#xD;
      analysis) would be immediately applicable in clinical practice since the technical tools are&#xD;
      already available in the laboratories of most hospitals centers.&#xD;
