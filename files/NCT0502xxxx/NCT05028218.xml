  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB3824 blocks function of a specific protein called Cell Division Cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase in&#xD;
      the human body, which plays important roles in the maintenance of DNA replication forks and&#xD;
      DNA damage response pathways. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TQB3824.&#xD;
