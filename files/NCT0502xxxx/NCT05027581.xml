    <textblock>
      This phase IIb study is a prospective, single-blind, parallel, active-controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chondrochymal® in subjects with knee OA. All the subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in Taiwan. The target population is composed of subjects with unilateral or&#xD;
      bilateral OA knee(s). For subjects with bilateral OA knees, only the knee with more severe&#xD;
      symptoms will be selected as the target knee. If the severities of the OA symptoms are the&#xD;
      same for both knees, the knee with more pain should be selected, where the WOMAC pain score&#xD;
      will take the priority over the VAS index. Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      the study groups, Chondrochymal® Group or Control Group, in 1:1 ratio. To keep the blindness,&#xD;
      the subject's eyesight will be masked by a curtain while receiving the IA injection.&#xD;

    <measure>Efficacy-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score on the target knee at Week 24.&#xD;
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC LK 3.1) is applied extensively to patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. It is a 24-item patient-reported questionnaire with a total score ranging from 0 to 96. The sub-scores range from 0 to 4 for each item with a higher score indicating a more severe OA symptom. The WOMAC includes 3 domains: (1) Pain: 5 items (score range: 0 to 20), (2) Stiffness: 2 items (score range: 0 to 8), and (3) Functional limitation: 17 items (score range: 0 to 68).&#xD;
For ease of interpretation, WOMAC scores (including total scores and sub-scores) will be linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline at each post-treatment visit during the Evaluation Period on the target knee in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain.&#xD;
The Visual analog scale (VAS) pain assessment measures pain intensity. It is a scale of 10 cm in length, representing the subject's pain intensity with higher scores indicating more severe pain. VAS score ranges from 0 to 10 cm, and will be transformed to a &quot;0 to 100&quot; mm scale.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline at each post-treatment visit during the Evaluation Period in the domain scores and total score of SF-36 Quality of Life (QoL) health survey questionnaire.&#xD;
The SF-36 Quality of Life (QoL) health survey questionnaire (v2.0) is a standardized, self-evaluated measurement of health status. It has 36 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The SF-36 QoL questionnaire consists of 8 scaled scores in various health domains including 4 items in vitality, 10 items in physical functioning, 2 items in bodily pain, 5 items in general health perceptions, 4 items in physical role functioning, 3 items in emotional role functioning, 2 items in social role functioning, and 5 items in mental health. The score for each domain will be transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, on which zero corresponds to &quot;worst health status&quot; and 100 to &quot;best health status&quot;.</description>

    <description>Changes from baseline in Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) of the target knee.&#xD;
MRI performed on the target knee will be used to evaluate the Whole-Organ-MRI Scores (WORMS). The WORMS, diffusion mapping (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and fractional anisotropy [FA]), and T2 map values (it is a value from the worst region for screening visit), will be recorded in the CRF to evaluate the effect on knee cartilage response.&#xD;
WORMS are used to evaluate the articular cartilage lesions at three joints, including 14 anatomic compartments as follows (Peterfy et al., 2004)</description>

Knee X-ray for knee joint space width (JSW) assessment will be performed on anterior-posterior (AP) view, Rosenberg's view, and axial view of patella 45° (lateral part and medial part). X-ray will be performed for both knees at Screening Visit, while only for the target knee at the other scheduled visits.</description>

    <description>The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in Chondrochymal® for this study was obtained from the donor recruited in Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. Donors aged 20 to 50 and tested negative to infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2 (HIV-1/2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Treponema pallidum (syphilis), human T-lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II), and Tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled. The eligible donor's bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest or femur. The collected BM-MSCs were then cultured, expanded and cryopreserved in a Good Tissue Practice (GTP)-complied laboratory. The qualified cells in cryopreservation meeting the release criteria will be thawed, mixed with lactated Ringer's solution, and transferred into a sterile syringe as the final product.</description>
