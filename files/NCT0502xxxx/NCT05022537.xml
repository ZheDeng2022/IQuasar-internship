  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare relevant clinical outcomes in patients requiring&#xD;
      percutaneous nephrostomy for urolithiasis treatment between those who undergo an antegrade&#xD;
      approach versus a retrograde approach and to determine which clinical characteristics predict&#xD;
      success of lithotomy with anterograde or retrograde percutaneous nephrostomy approaches.&#xD;
