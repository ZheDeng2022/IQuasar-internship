  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central sensitization (CS) is as increased response to normal or sub-threshold stimuli of&#xD;
      central nervous system and its close relationship with fibromyalgia has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      several studies. However, the effect of initial CS severity on treatment response in these&#xD;
      patients is not fully known. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the severity of CS&#xD;
      and its effect on treatment response in patients with fibromyalgia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a disease characterized by chronic widespread pain and its etiology and&#xD;
      pathophysiology are still unknown.It is considered to be the main member of the central&#xD;
      sensitization-related disease group known as central sensitivity syndromes with impaired pain&#xD;
      regulation.In various studies, hyperalgesia and allodynia, which are accepted as objective&#xD;
      findings of central sensitization in patients with fibromyalgia, strengthen the relationship&#xD;
      between fibromyalgia and central sensitization. The central sensitization inventory (CSI) was&#xD;
      developed in 2012 to be used in the recognition of central sensitivity syndromes in patients&#xD;
      with fibromyalgia. A score of 40 and above is accepted in favor of central sensitization in&#xD;
      the scale, which consists of two parts, in which central sensitization-related symptoms and&#xD;
      diagnoses are questioned; scores of 30-39 are classified as mild, 40-49 moderate, 50-59&#xD;
      severe, and 60-100 very severe. Parallel to the increase in the CSI score, an increase is&#xD;
      observed in patients' pain severity, disability, depressive symptoms and sleep disorders.In&#xD;
      addition, it has been reported in the literature that factors such as pre-treatment pain&#xD;
      severity and depression affect the treatment response.Considering all these factors, it is&#xD;
      possible that there is a relationship between the severity of central sensitization and&#xD;
      treatment response in patients with fibromyalgia.Based on this, in this study, it was aimed&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of central sensitization severity, which was evaluated with CSI&#xD;
      before treatment, on the treatment process.&#xD;

    <measure>Fibromyalgia impact scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire was developed to determine the degree of being affected by the disease in patients with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia.The scale consists of 10 parts in total, and the first part is a Likert scale containing 11 questions. High scores indicate that the patient is overly affected.</description>
