    <description>Following the collection of the baseline data, the study participant will be assigned to a volunteer(medical student) to begin the social phone calls. The first phone call will be scheduled to occur within one week of the consent and baseline assessments. A minimum of one social phone call will occur each week for 6-weeks. Each phone call is expected to last up to 1 hour.The calls will be unstructured and designed simply to engage in conversation with the participant. The length of the phone calls, days and times will be recorded by the volunteer along with a short journal entry describing the conversation topics and any information that stood out to the volunteer.At the end of the 6-weeks phone calls, a group session will be held with the volunteers to engage in a debriefing and narrative medicine session.</description>
