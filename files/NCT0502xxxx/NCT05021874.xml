  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determinate influence of four selected physiotherapeutic procedures on the&#xD;
      pain intensity and the range of mandibular mobility in patients with myofascial disorders in&#xD;
      the SS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study group will consist of 100 women (GI) aged 20 to 45 who report pain and increased&#xD;
      facial muscle tension in masseter muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis will be made according to RDC/TMD (Research Diagnostic Criteria for&#xD;
      Temporomandibular Disorders), which will determine the occurrence of painful myofascial&#xD;
      disorders. Patients will undergo both external and intraoral dental examinations to exclude&#xD;
      odontogenic and articular causes of pain. Patients will then be palpated for the masseter&#xD;
      muscles and both: the range of mandibular abduction (linear measurement in mm) and the level&#xD;
      of pain intensity (VAS scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (GII) will consist of 100 women between 20 and 45 years of age with no&#xD;
      signs of masticatory disorders or orofacial pain during a physical examination and with no&#xD;
      such reference in their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain a homogenic study group the following inclusion criteria will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myofascial pain of less than 12 months in duration that is evoked by an active motion of&#xD;
           the mandible or by palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A feeling of an increased muscle tension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of all occlusal contact zones&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female sex&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past or present, neurological disease, neuromuscular disease or severe systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temporomandibular joint pathology based on X-ray imaging or stomatological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthodontic or prosthetic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindication to physiotherapeutic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a stomatognathic system disorder will be randomized into four therapeutic&#xD;
      subgroups, 26 patients each, who will receive a physiotherapy treatment of the masseter&#xD;
      muscles for a period of 10 days (excluding Saturdays and Sundays). The duration of a single&#xD;
      therapy session will be 12 minutes per patient in each of the subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The division of the study group into subgroups is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IA: magnetotherapy; a pulsating, non-homogeneous magnetic field generated by the Viofor&#xD;
           JPS apparatus (Med &amp; Life, Poland) will be applied with an elliptical applicator with a&#xD;
           beamwidth of approx. 5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IB: magneto-led therapy; synergistic action of a slowly changing magnetic field&#xD;
           generated by the Viofor JPS apparatus (Med &amp; Life, Poland) and LED diodes with the&#xD;
           wavelength of 860 nm will be applied with an elliptic magnetic-light (IR) applicator&#xD;
           with a diameter of 5 [cm] containing 47 infrared diodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IC: magneto-laser therapy; synergistic action of a slowly changing magnetic field&#xD;
           generated by the Viofor JPS apparatus (Med &amp; Life, Poland) and a low-energy laser with&#xD;
           an infrared wavelength of 808 [nm] (max. power 300 mW) will be applied. The dose would&#xD;
           increase from 3,0 J/cm2 to 5,0 J/cm2 and the total dose applied per each patient from&#xD;
           this subgroup was 40 J/cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ID: manual therapy of soft tissues (i.e. post-isometric relaxation of the masseter,&#xD;
           cellular and tissue mobilization with Kibler fold, masseter trigger point therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the therapy, the patients' pain level will be assessed via VAS scale. After&#xD;
      the last day of physiotherapy, a linear measurement of mandibular abduction will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
