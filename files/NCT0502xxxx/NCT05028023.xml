  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study presents an alternative method of tracheal dilatation in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      acquired tracheal stenosis. Dilatation is performed by the use of balloon catheter connected&#xD;
      with manometer, that is bronchoscopic guided into trachea in the stenotic area, through the&#xD;
      wide canal of supraglottic device i-Gel. Every dilatation cession consists of three&#xD;
      consequent tracheal balloon dilatations of maximum 3 minutes duration each, followed by&#xD;
      10-15minutes interval of controlled ventilation. The balloon is inflated for 60 seconds to&#xD;
      reach predefined pressure, and then deflated. This method is minimal traumatic for tracheal&#xD;
      mucosa, and application of several dilatation procedures every 2-3months, in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with acquired tracheal stenosis, may lead to a relative reopening of trachea and&#xD;
      recession of clinical symptoms.For the right performance of the dilatation procedure,&#xD;
      patients receive general anesthesia with cessation of spontaneous ventilation. During&#xD;
      procedure, controlled ventilation-oxygenation is impossible, because the i-Gel canal is&#xD;
      occupied by bronchoscope and balloon catheter, so patients will remain apneic for a short&#xD;
      period of time. For pediatric patients is important to perform proper preoxygenation prior to&#xD;
      procedure, and to maintain oxygenation as long as possible during procedure. This is achieved&#xD;
      by application of apneic oxygenation, through a small catheter, connected to high flow&#xD;
      oxygen. Participants are exposed during first dilation to no oxygenation, while during second&#xD;
      and third dilatation to apneic oxygenation. Aim of the study is to investigate primarily&#xD;
      whether application of apneic oxygenation, in pediatric patients during tracheal balloon&#xD;
      dilatation, maintains regional cerebral oxygen saturation rSO2 in significant higher levels,&#xD;
      compared with no application of oxygenation. rSO2 levels are a sensitive index of oxygenation&#xD;
      efficacy of the brain, accordingly this refers to a safe procedure. Secondary issues are&#xD;
      whether application of apneic oxygenation maintains pulse oximetry SpO2 and artierial oxygen&#xD;
      partial pressure PaO2 in higher levels, and what are the effects on arterial carbon dioxide&#xD;
      partial pressure PaCO2 and on haemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure), compared&#xD;
      with no application of apneic oxygenation.&#xD;

      The study is taking place in the Bronchoscopy Unit of the 3rd Pediatric Dpt of the Aristotles&#xD;
      University of Thessaloniki, in the area of the Operating Rooms in the Hippokratic General&#xD;
      Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece. The procedure of tracheal balloon dilatation was developed&#xD;
      and performed in Hippokratic General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece, for the last three&#xD;
      years. From October 2020, pediatric patients are recruited and enrolled in this study,&#xD;
      according to specific criteria, set by the Collaborators of the Pulmonology and Bronchoscopy&#xD;
      Unit of the 3rd Pediatric Dpt of Aristotles University of Thessaloniki, Greece. Prior to the&#xD;
      dilatation procedure, following steps are necessary, performed by the Principal Investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.detailed preanesthetic evaluation of the participant, for recognition of clinical signs or&#xD;
      pathology, that can complicate the procedure and jeopardize health status 2. written informed&#xD;
      consents from parents/caregivers, for anesthesia procedure, for tracheal dilatation&#xD;
      procedure, and for participation in the study. All recordings during procedures are performed&#xD;
      by the Principal Investigator, and double checked by two Collaborators.In cases of appearance&#xD;
      of adverse events during the procedure (i.e. severe desaturation, anaphylactic reaction,&#xD;
      severe bronchospasm), it is automatically discontinued, advanced life support is initiated,&#xD;
      anesthesia is terminated, and participants are closely monitored during recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was performed according to G* power analysis 3.1.9.2. and the Means&#xD;
      test: for extraction of results is necessary to record at least five different pediatric&#xD;
      patients, who will undergo at least four tracheal dilatation cessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis, quantitative variables will be described as median values and&#xD;
      standard deviation (or IQR), qualitative variables as frequencies and percentages, while&#xD;
      significancy level will be defined as &lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>In pediatric patients undergoing tracheal balloon dilatation, oxygenation maintenance is essential, while induction in anesthesia, cessation of spontaneous ventilation by neuromuscular relaxant and pediatric i-gel placement are necessary for access to trachea. After i-Gel placement controlled ventilation with 100% oxygen is initiated. Pediatric bronchoscope and balloon dilatation catheter are advanced into trachea to the stenotic area. Overall dilatation duration is 2,5-3minutes, while the balloon is inflated for 60sec. Every dilatation cession consists of three dilatations. First dilatation is performed without oxygen enrichment. During second and third dilatation, a nelaton catheter, connected with high oxygen flow, is advanced into i-Gel canal, together with bronchoscope and balloon catheter. Effects of no oxygenation and apneic oxygenation in regional cerebral oxygen saturation rSO2, pulse oximetry SpO2, arterial blood gases and haemodynamics are recorded and compared.</description>
