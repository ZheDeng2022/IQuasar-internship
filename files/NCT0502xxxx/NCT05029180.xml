      Neither the international nor the interregional variation in survival following OHCA is fully&#xD;
      understood, but may rely on multiple factors such as: organization of the Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Service (EMS) system bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the use of Automatic&#xD;
      External Defibrillators (AED's), response time, and which subgroups are included as the&#xD;
      denominator, (i.e. obvious dead, withholding of resuscitation). Variation in denominators&#xD;
      provide an obstacle when comparing outcome between different EMS-systems. Studies have found&#xD;
      that Utstein factors explained half of the variation in survival to hospital discharge among&#xD;
      different EMS agencies highlighting the importance of further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high mortality rate of OHCA, the decision of withholding or withdrawing&#xD;
      resuscitative efforts must be made frequently. We find that a description of the differences&#xD;
      in initiation and termination of resuscitation of adult patients (&gt;18 years of age),&#xD;
      suffering from non-traumatic OHCA could add an important perspective on the impact of&#xD;
      differences in EMS systems across the World regarding the outcome following OHCA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death in the World. Substantial&#xD;
      international differences in survival to hospital discharge has been reported; ranging from&#xD;
      3.1% to 20.4% worldwide, 0% to 18% in Europe, 0,5% to 8,5% in Asia, 9% to 17% in Australia&#xD;
      and New Zealand and from 1.1% to 8.4% in North America. Regional differences of up to a&#xD;
      fivefold increase in survival have also been reported in multiple settings and geographic&#xD;
      locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the international nor the interregional variation is fully understood, but may rely&#xD;
      on multiple factors such as: organization of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system&#xD;
      bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the use of Automatic External Defibrillators&#xD;
      (AED's), response time, and which subgroups are included as the denominator, (i.e. obvious&#xD;
      dead, withholding of resuscitation). Variation in denominators provide an obstacle when&#xD;
      comparing outcome between different EMS-systems. Studies have found that Utstein factors&#xD;
      explained half of the variation in survival to hospital discharge among different EMS&#xD;
      agencies highlighting the importance of further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high mortality rate of OHCA, the decision of withholding or withdrawing&#xD;
      resuscitative efforts must be made frequently. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC)&#xD;
      stated in their 2021 guidelines that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;Systems should implement criteria for the withholding and termination of CPR&#xD;
           out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), taking into consideration the specific local&#xD;
           legal, organizational, and cultural context.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Systems should define criteria for the withholding and termination of CPR, and ensure&#xD;
           criteria are validated locally.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;Systems should implement criteria for early transport to hospital in cases of OHCA,&#xD;
           taking into account the local context, if there are no criteria for&#xD;
           withholding/terminating CPR&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate Termination of Resuscitation rules locally could be challenging both ethically&#xD;
      and epidemiologically. This would require a prospective study with a transportation rate of&#xD;
      100%, which could put an immense amount of pressure on the limited sources of the EMS system,&#xD;
      and moreover providing sufficient power in the study could be difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We find that a description of the differences in initiation and termination of resuscitation&#xD;
      of adult patients (&gt;18 years of age), suffering from non-traumatic OHCA could add an&#xD;
      important perspective on the impact of differences in EMS systems across the World regarding&#xD;
      the outcome following OHCA.&#xD;
