  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer in the non-metastatic&#xD;
      setting is a combination of radiation and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy for non-metastatic&#xD;
      cervical cancer currently consists of radiation in the form of external beam delivered over&#xD;
      5-6 weeks of daily therapy followed by or interdigitated with intracavitary brachytherapy.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is used as a sensitizing agent with radiation and this is associated with&#xD;
      substantial improvement in local control and overall survival. The treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      cervical cancers is challenging, The standard of care for patients with metastatic disease is&#xD;
      systemic therapy alone. The treatment of metastatic cervical cancers is challenging, with&#xD;
      many patients developing resistance to platinum based chemotherapy and progressing through&#xD;
      multiple lines of treatment. Although early stage cervical cancer is highly treatable with an&#xD;
      excellent prognosis, recurrent and metastatic disease poses a significant treatment&#xD;
      challenge. Several large clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in&#xD;
      progression free and overall survival rates with the treatment of the local disease in other&#xD;
      sites, eg head and neck and prostate cancer . These outcomes have generated optimism for&#xD;
      aggressively treating local disease in the metastatic setting. Furthermore retrospective&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated improvement in OS with treatment of the primary with radiation in&#xD;
      women with metastatic cervical cancer. None of the studies have standardized their methods of&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, treating metastatic patients with conventionally fractionated&#xD;
      radiation treatment will prolong treatment time and can interrupt with systemic therapy which&#xD;
      is critical for distant disease. With imaged-based ultrafractionated radiation, high doses&#xD;
      can be delivered without inordinately large expansion margins and shortens treatment time.&#xD;
      Moreover, studies have shown that the dose of radiation matters with higher doses associated&#xD;
      with improved outcomes. These high doses levels can only be achieved with modern image&#xD;
      guidance that limits expansion margins of radiation planning. Further pulsar technique allows&#xD;
      for adaptation to the patient's tumor and anatomy and this process reduces the dose to the&#xD;
      normal structures, thus minimizing serious toxicity in a metastatic population. There are no&#xD;
      prospective trials of radiation in this setting. Currently, the standard of care remains&#xD;
      cisplatin-based doublet therapy +/- avastin and this combination with radiation treatment has&#xD;
      the potential to change outcomes and the could impact the management for this patient&#xD;
      population&#xD;
