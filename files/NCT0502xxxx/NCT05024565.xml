    <textblock>
      The prolonged β-lactam Antibiotics intravenous infusion strategy has emerged as the standard&#xD;
      treatment for sepsis despite its unknown efficacy. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      prospective, multi-center, cluster randomized controlled clinical trial. The investigators&#xD;
      aimed to compare the clinical efficacy and prognosis of prolonged β-lactam antibiotics&#xD;
      intravenous infusion versus short-term intravenous infusion in ICU patients with early&#xD;
      sepsis. The investigators expect to recruit 40 branch centers and enroll at least 2600&#xD;
      patients with sepsis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sepsis and septic shock can lead to high morbidity and mortality. The mortality of sepsis is&#xD;
      related to inappropriate antibiotic treatment strategy. Due to the pathophysiological&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with sepsis, the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics have changed,&#xD;
      and antibiotic treatment strategies applied to general mild and severe infections may not be&#xD;
      suitable for those patients. The relevant international guidelines recommend that antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment for patients with sepsis should base on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles,&#xD;
      but this recommendation is based on low-level clinical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and so on, are the&#xD;
      most widely used antibacterial drugs in clinical practice. The best predictive parameter of&#xD;
      those antibiotic bactericidal activity is the time during which the free drug concentration&#xD;
      exceeds the target microbial MIC value (fT &gt;MIC). According to Monte Carlo approach and&#xD;
      clinical studies, as a PK/PD target value, an effective bactericidal effect can be achieved&#xD;
      if fT&gt;MIC reaches more than 40%; fT&gt;MIC reaches more than 60%-70% can achieve the maximum&#xD;
      bactericidal effect, which can be used in the treatment of severe cases. For severe infection&#xD;
      and prevention of bacterial resistance, fT&gt;MIC needs to reach 90%-100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of clinical studies have proved that improper or inadequate initial empiric&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment is an independent risk factor that affects the therapeutic effectiveness&#xD;
      and prognosis of severe infections. Important reasons for the lower-than-expected antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment effect in severely ill patients include at least the following two factors: (1)&#xD;
      Changes in the pathophysiological state of severely ill patients on drug metabolism, such as&#xD;
      capillary leakage leading to increased drug distribution volume. As well as the high&#xD;
      excretion and low obstruction hemodynamic characteristics of sepsis, increased renal blood&#xD;
      flow leads to high excretion of water-soluble drugs, which often reduces the effective plasma&#xD;
      concentration of the drug; (2) ICU infection of pathogenic bacteria has increased drug&#xD;
      resistance and increased MIC. The above factors lead to the decrease of drug fT&gt;MIC, which&#xD;
      affects the efficacy of antibiotics. In recent years, the optimization of PK/PD-guided&#xD;
      time-dependent antimicrobial treatment programs have confirmed that the administration method&#xD;
      of prolonging the infusion time or continuous infusion can maintain a good steady-state blood&#xD;
      drug concentration, prolong fT&gt; MIC, and improve clinical curative effect, and can reduce the&#xD;
      amount of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main problems with PK/PD-guided antimicrobial therapy are: (1) Lack of convincing large&#xD;
      sample clinical research results; (2) It has not been confirmed which subgroup (such as the&#xD;
      sepsis severity, drug-resistant patterns of pathogens, immunocompetence) can be benefited&#xD;
      from this strategy; (3) It is not clear whether the method of prolonged infusion can be&#xD;
      applied in all kinds of β-lactam antibiotics .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopts multi-center, openness, cluster randomization method to group, and&#xD;
      eliminates the bias caused by factors such as the treatment environment in a single ward&#xD;
      through the multi-center study; through Uniform training realizes the standardization of drug&#xD;
      delivery methods to eliminate researchers' human bias in treatment operations and&#xD;
      observations. At the same time, the regional randomization method sets the drug delivery&#xD;
      method for a certain research center in a certain research phase to be determined, which&#xD;
      eliminates the operational error and observation bias when the researcher needs to face&#xD;
      multiple drug delivery programs at the same time. It can greatly reduce research costs and&#xD;
      human bias, and more reliably obtain the impact of PK/PD-guided antibiotic treatment on the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients and the impact of bacterial resistance in the entire ward.&#xD;
