    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of binimetinib and encorafenib in treating patients&#xD;
      with melanoma that has spread to the central nervous system (metastases). Binimetinib and&#xD;
      encorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Giving binimetinib and encorafenib may help control melanoma that has spread to&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate antitumor activity of high dosing regimen of encorafenib + binimetinib&#xD;
      combination therapy for patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma and/or leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
      (LMD) as measured by progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of high dosing regimen of encorafenib + binimetinib&#xD;
      combination therapy for patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma and/or LMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further evaluate antitumor activity of high dosing regimen of encorafenib + binimetinib&#xD;
      combination therapy for patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma and/or LMD, as measured by&#xD;
      brain metastasis response rate (BMRR), extracranial response rate, global response rate,&#xD;
      disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and duration of response (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the immunological effects of this treatment on immune cells in the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to those observed in the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare levels of encorafenib and binimetinib in the CSF and peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess neurocognitive function as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      (MoCA) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory brain tumor module (MDASI-BT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      on day 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;
