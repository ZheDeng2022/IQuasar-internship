  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study involving two phases: 1) adaptation and 2) intervention, in&#xD;
      adolescents aged 14-21 experiencing homelessness. The overarching goal is to develop and&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of a counselling intervention to improve access to&#xD;
      contraception among AYA experiencing homelessness. During the first phase, referred to as the&#xD;
      adaption phase, we will rely on collective input from formative groups of AYA experiencing&#xD;
      homelessness to adapt the CHOICE counselling intervention for this underserved and&#xD;
      under-resourced population. In the second phase, referred to as the intervention phase, we&#xD;
      will evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the adapted intervention (CHOICE-AYA).&#xD;

      This study will adapt an evidence-based contraceptive counseling intervention (CHOICE) using&#xD;
      input from the formative groups of AYA experiencing homelessness and study the impact of the&#xD;
      adapted counseling (CHOICE-AYA) on contraceptive use, continuation, and satisfaction in a&#xD;
      specialized community care setting. After informed consent is obtained, participants will&#xD;
      receive the CHOICE-AYA counseling intervention by trained clinic staff. Provision of&#xD;
      contraception based on participant choice will occur through the clinic provider same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sent links to complete the follow-up surveys at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
      In addition, Clinic staff (e.g., prescribers and nurses) will be sent electronic surveys&#xD;
      following randomly selected study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will inform best practices for this vulnerable population and provide foundational&#xD;
      evidence for future studies focused on expanding care to other sites that serve this group.&#xD;
