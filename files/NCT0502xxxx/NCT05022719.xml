    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, single-arm, non-randomized, post-market pilot study evaluating&#xD;
      the technical feasibility of mucosal staining during COLON2 Capsule Endoscopy (CCE) procedure&#xD;
      in population at high risk for Colorectal Cancer (CRC), when using MB-MMX (Methylene Blue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 subjects will be enrolled in 1 center located in Spain. Study duration- up to 10&#xD;
      months from study approval.&#xD;

      Single-center, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the technical&#xD;
      feasibility during CCE procedure, when using MB-MMX as a contrast- enhancement technique of&#xD;
      mucosal staining in CRC high risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a bowel preparation (split dose, 4L PEG), including 200 mg&#xD;
      Methylthioninium chloride, corresponding to eight 25 mg MB-MMX tablets. An experienced&#xD;
      Gastroenterologist will read the CCE procedure and complete a subjective questionnaire, to&#xD;
      evaluate mucosal enhancement during a CCE procedure, when using MB-MMX as a&#xD;
      contrast-enhancement technique.&#xD;

An experienced Gastroenterologist will read the CCE procedure and complete a subjective questionnaire, to evaluate mucosal enhancement during a CCE procedure, when using MB-MMX as a contrast-enhancement technique.&#xD;
The technical feasibility will be evaluated by:&#xD;
The percent of colonic polyps which have a visible contrast to the healthy colonic mucosa during CCE.&#xD;
The interference level of detrimental effects on the visualization of the colonic mucosa during CCE, due to use of MB-MMX per colonic segment.</intervention_model_description>
