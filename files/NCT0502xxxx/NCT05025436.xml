  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the &quot;Survey on Colon Pouch Problems and Living Settlements&quot; conducted by the&#xD;
      Taiwan Cancer Foundation in 2017, 48% of office workers have constipation problems. The&#xD;
      proportion of medical staff is high, especially in acute and severe units. The reason is high&#xD;
      work pressure. , Life tension and other characteristics. In western medicine, enemas or stool&#xD;
      softening drugs are often used in clinical treatment. This kind of treatment treats the&#xD;
      symptoms but not the root cause. In addition, long-term use can easily cause damage to the&#xD;
      intestinal nerves and become dependent on drugs. Systematic literature points out that the&#xD;
      use of acupoint stimulation can effectively increase spontaneous defecation and promote bowel&#xD;
      movements, but there is no conclusion on the effective acupuncture points. Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this research is to use precise acupoint stimulation to improve the constipation&#xD;
      problem of nursing staff in emergency and intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopts a single-blind randomized controlled Cross-over trial. Take the emergency&#xD;
      department of a medical center in the north as the research site, and take the nursing staff&#xD;
      of the emergency and intensive care unit with constipation as the research object. The&#xD;
      experimental group received precise acupoint care, and the control group received routine&#xD;
      care. After a 2-week pause, the two groups crossed. Use questionnaires to collect basic&#xD;
      patient data (basic attributes and Chinese medical physique, etc.), and assess the intestinal&#xD;
      tract. Data analysis uses IBM SPSS 22.0 software for descriptive statistical analysis and&#xD;
      inferential statistical analysis, and p&lt;0.05 is regarded as statistically significant.&#xD;

&#xD;
                This study is expected to target emergency nurses with constipation in the&#xD;
                emergency department of Yadong Memorial Hospital. The co-host will use 5-10 minutes&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Method of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
                This research plan applies for the approval of the Human Test Review Committee of&#xD;
                Yadong Memorial Hospital and the relevant departments or units of the hospital to&#xD;
                start accepting the case. It is estimated that emergency nurses with constipation&#xD;
                symptoms will be the research subjects, and the number of samples to be collected&#xD;
                will be estimated through G-power version 3.1 statistical software, and a total of&#xD;
                64 people (32 people in each group) will be included. Random Allocation Software is&#xD;
                used to randomly allocate 64 cases with random serial numbers generated by the&#xD;
                computer. The 64 cases are divided into two groups with 32 people in each group.&#xD;
                Randomly assigned serial numbers will be stored in consecutively numbered opaque&#xD;
                sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                On the first day of admission, the host/co-host will explain the case acceptance&#xD;
                and research progress in the emergency meeting room, and complete basic information&#xD;
                and pre-test questionnaires. It takes 13 minutes. The intervention time of the&#xD;
                study was 2.5 months. The method of cross-over was adopted. There were 2 kinds of&#xD;
                intervention measures. Each subject in the experimental group was involved in&#xD;
                acupoint stimulation with a low-energy laser (Erger laser pen), and set Wavelength&#xD;
                810nm +/-10%, power 200mW, select Bahr parameter (B2: 1199 Hz; B3: 2398 Hz) module&#xD;
                according to acupoints, treatment time is 30 seconds per acupoint, treatment dose&#xD;
                is 3 joules per acupoint, select main acupoint as day Shu points, Zusanli points,&#xD;
                Hegu points, Zhigou points, Shangjuxu points, and physique matching points: the&#xD;
                physique matching point for yang deficiency is Zhaohai; the yin deficiency physique&#xD;
                matching point is Sanyinjiao and Taixi points; the qi deficiency constitution&#xD;
                matching point is There are Fenglong and Sanyinjiao points; Quchi is the matching&#xD;
                point for physical heat (dampness and heat, phlegm-dampness); Yanglingquan is the&#xD;
                matching point for Qi stagnation (qi stagnation and blood stasis); each of the&#xD;
                control group Subjects were given the same main acupoints (5 acupoints) and&#xD;
                physical matching acupoints (1-2 acupoints) without energy acupoint care&#xD;
                (therapeutic dose is 0 joules per acupoint), three times a week, after a period of&#xD;
                4 weeks, pause for 2 weeks Later, after the two groups crossed, interventional&#xD;
                measures were carried out for 4 weeks. The measurement time and method are: Bristol&#xD;
                stool classification table, visual analogy scale for constipation symptoms, bowel&#xD;
                movement, constipation assessment scale, and Chinese version of the patient&#xD;
                constipation symptom scale on the day of admission (before intervention). , Chinese&#xD;
                medicine body mass scale, Chinese version of self-rating quality of life for&#xD;
                patients with constipation scale, Chinese version of Bayesian Anxiety Scale, and&#xD;
                Bristol Stool Classification Scale and Visual Analogy Scale for Constipation&#xD;
                Symptoms to investigate stool status (one week) 3 times), and auscultation for 1&#xD;
                minute before and after each intervention to investigate the stool status. After&#xD;
                the intervention, the constipation assessment scale will be measured once a week&#xD;
                after the intervention, and the Chinese version of the patient constipation symptom&#xD;
                scale will be conducted every two weeks, the fourth week After the interventional&#xD;
                measures are completed, the TCM body mass scale, the Chinese version of the&#xD;
                Bayesian Anxiety Scale, and the Chinese version of the self-assessment of the&#xD;
                quality of life for patients with constipation will be tested. It takes 10 minutes&#xD;
                to complete the post-test questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subject tracking or necessary rehabilitation plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
                During the study, closely follow up and pay attention to whether the subjects have&#xD;
                the following discomforts: skin rashes at the acupoints, abnormal skin sensations,&#xD;
                fatigue, slight dizziness and other symptoms. If the above symptoms occur,&#xD;
                immediately stop the low-energy laser Shot pen) acupoint stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Treatment effect evaluation and statistical analysis methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher first checks the integrity of the data, encodes the data, and then enters it&#xD;
      into the computer according to the codebook. After the file is created, the IBM SPSS 22.0&#xD;
      software is used for statistical analysis of the data. In this study, p&lt;0.05 was regarded as&#xD;
      statistically significant. According to the purpose of the research and the nature of the&#xD;
      variables, the following statistical methods are used for descriptive statistical analysis&#xD;
      and inferential statistical analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis: categorical variables&#xD;
      are described by sample number, percentage, and chi-square test, while continuous variables&#xD;
      are described by average, standard deviation, and independent sample t test; inferential&#xD;
      statistical analysis: Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) ): Analyze the correlation&#xD;
      between repeated measurements.&#xD;
