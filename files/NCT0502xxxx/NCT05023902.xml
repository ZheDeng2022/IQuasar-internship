  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Neuromuscular Integrative Action (NIA)&#xD;
      and Pilates exercises on physical fitness and psychological effects in sedentary women. 20-45&#xD;
      years old 43 sedentary females were randomly divided into Pilates and NIA groups. The&#xD;
      6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), the Sit and Reach Test, and the Static Plunk Test durations&#xD;
      were used for the physical fitness level assessment at baseline and at the end of trainings.&#xD;
      In addition, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the SF-36 were&#xD;
      used to evaluate the psycho-somatic symptoms and health-related quality of life of the&#xD;
      participants. Both groups received 60-min exercise sessions 2 days a week for 8 weeks.&#xD;

      Participant Healthy female volunteers between the ages of 20 and 45 who performed desk jobs 8&#xD;
      hours a day and with a sedentary lifestyle were included in this study. This is a parallel&#xD;
      group randomized comparative study aimed to compare the effects of NIA and Pilates on&#xD;
      physical fitness and psychological status. This study was conducted at …………. University&#xD;
      School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in 2017. Participants were excluded if&#xD;
      participants had a risk of pregnancy, using pacemakers or metal implants in participiants'&#xD;
      body, had an active athlete history, had any health problems preventing them performing&#xD;
      exercises. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and participants&#xD;
      signed the form approved by the ………………….. University Clinical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (020/55134) prior to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the volunteers were screened for eligibility and signed an informed consent&#xD;
      form. Then, participants were randomized to Pilates and NIA groups using the sealed envelope&#xD;
      method. An identification number (i.e., 1-54) was allocated to each volunteer. Each number&#xD;
      was written on a separate piece of folded white paper and placed into an opaque envelope. The&#xD;
      randomization process was performed by picking a random number from the sealed envelope to&#xD;
      allocate each volunteer to either the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Measures This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized-comparative study, and it&#xD;
      involved twice time at pre and post 8-week exercise program. Assessments were performed at&#xD;
      the baseline and after eight weeks of intervention. The dependent variables were flexibility,&#xD;
      cardiovascular endurance, Abdominal Strength-Endurance, Balance Assessment, self-esteem,&#xD;
      anxiety, and quality of life. BMI was measured with a Tanita BC 418 (Tanita Corp., Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan), which is a segmental professional body analysis monitor measuring the impedance&#xD;
      generated during the passage of an electric current of 50 kHz, 0.8 mA through tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological Status Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was&#xD;
      developed by Morris Rosenberg and the validity and reliability studies of the Turkish version&#xD;
      of the scale were performed by Çuhadaroğlu. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is a 10-item&#xD;
      scale that assesses global self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about&#xD;
      the self. Each item has a 4- point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly&#xD;
      disagree. Higher scores indicate higher self-esteem. The scale was used for self-esteem&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life Assessment Short Form Health Survey is a questionnaire assessing the quality&#xD;
      of life of the subjects. Short Form Health Survey examines eight different parameters,&#xD;
      namely, Functional Capacity, Physical Aspects, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social&#xD;
      Aspect, Emotional Aspect, and Mental Health domains. A higher score indicates a better&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beck Anxiety Inventory The Beck Anxiety Inventory is a 21-item self-report questionnaire for&#xD;
      assessing the severity of anxiety. The Beck Anxiety Inventory assesses the grade of anxiety&#xD;
      using 21 questions. A higher score indicates more severe anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue A Visual Analogue Scale was applied to assess the severity of perceived fatigue. The&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale is a 10-cm scale that evaluates the severity of fatigue in the previous&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Fitness Assessment Flexibility Assessment The Sit and Reach Test was used to&#xD;
      evaluate the flexibility of the participants. The participants were placed in a long sitting&#xD;
      position with straight legs. Participants were asked to lean forward four times and reach&#xD;
      forward on the board. At the end of the fourth reach, the distance obtained after&#xD;
      participants waited for two seconds was recorded in centimeters (cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Endurance Assessment The cardiorespiratory endurance of the participants was&#xD;
      evaluated with the 6 Minute Walk Test. The test was conducted by measuring the distance the&#xD;
      participants could walk in a 20-meter corridor with a fast and firm walk. At the beginning of&#xD;
      the test, the heart rate and blood pressure of the participants were measured with a pulse&#xD;
      meter heart rate monitor. Before the test, the fatigue levels of the participants were&#xD;
      assessed by taking the perceived difficulty levels according to the Borg Rating of Perceived&#xD;
      Exertion. After the test, evaluations were repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal Strength-Endurance Assessment Muscle strength and endurance of the abdominal&#xD;
      muscles were evaluated by sit-up tests. The participants were placed on participants' back,&#xD;
      hips and knees in flexion, with the plantar side of the foot on the bed. The arms were&#xD;
      positioned according to the strength of the rectus abdominus muscle and participants were&#xD;
      asked to perform trunk flexion for 60 seconds consecutively. The number of trunk flexions&#xD;
      completed was recorded. Static abdominal strength and trunk stabilization were evaluated&#xD;
      using a static plank test. Individuals assumed a position with the elbows on the ground with&#xD;
      the fingertips touching the ground and the hip raised from the ground, and the knee, hip, and&#xD;
      trunk were in a parallel line, the maximum time participants could keep this position was&#xD;
      recorded. During the test, the participant was asked not to disturb the horizontal position&#xD;
      of the trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance Assessment The balance of the participants was evaluated with the Functional Reach&#xD;
      Test. The test measures dynamic balance and core stabilization. The participants were asked&#xD;
      to stretch participants' hands forward while standing and reach from that distance without&#xD;
      stepping forward and without support. The distance participants reached was recorded in cm.&#xD;
      Interventions The NIA and Pilates programs were implemented by one of the researchers (AU)&#xD;
      with trainings and qualifications in both approaches. The trainings were carried out for 60&#xD;
      minutes, 2 days a week, for 8 weeks. Each session was performed by a Pilates instructor with&#xD;
      a 10-year of Pilates training experience. NIA sessions were also performed by the same&#xD;
      instructor (AA), and she had a 1-year NIA training experience. The participants were asked&#xD;
      not to participate in any other physical activity program during the study. Prior to training&#xD;
      sessions, a familiarization period of practice was conducted to introduce the participants&#xD;
      with the methods and techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilates Mat Exercise Protocol The Pilates Mat exercise group followed an eight-week exercise&#xD;
      program. The exercise protocol of this study was designed by the researchers. According to&#xD;
      previous reports, 6 to 8 weeks of Pilates training has positive effects on physical and&#xD;
      psychological health. As the program advanced, 20-cm diameter mini soft balls, Pilates rings,&#xD;
      65 cmdiameter soft gymnastic balls, and rubber bands were used in this order as materials in&#xD;
      Pilates exercises. After an initial warm-up exercises at a slow pace for 10 minutes, Pilates&#xD;
      exercises with and without equipment were performed for 40 minutes. The exercises ended with&#xD;
      a 10-minute recovery and stretching exercises for relaxation of all muscle groups&#xD;
      Neuromuscular Integrative Action Protocol NIA includes nine basic movement forms, 13&#xD;
      principles, and 52 basic moves. The nine movement forms were derived from martial arts, dance&#xD;
      arts, and the healing arts of the Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais Method, and Yoga. The 13&#xD;
      principles specify areas related to fitness, personal growth, and lifestyle. Centered on the&#xD;
      joy of movement, participants focus on, for example, being sensitive to personal rhythms,&#xD;
      making the correct movement choices, and experiencing positive changes in daily life. The&#xD;
      moves of NIA are used to engage all body areas, improve fitness, and facilitate self-healing.&#xD;
      Instrumental music, which plays throughout each 60-min session, is an integrative part of&#xD;
      NIA, and the melody and beat of the music used are directly associated with the movements.&#xD;
      For instance, the feet and the legs follow a pattern that maps directly on to the drum beat&#xD;
      of a particular song, while the arms and the upper body express the melody of the rest of the&#xD;
      instruments, such as the guitar, violin, or the singer's voice. Visual imagination is&#xD;
      stimulated in NIA as the movements pertaining to the choreography relate a particular image&#xD;
      or symbol.&#xD;
