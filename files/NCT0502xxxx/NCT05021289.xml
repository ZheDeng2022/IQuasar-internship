    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>• The first practice of guided imagery was performed face-to-face with pregnant women. At the end of 20 minutes, the pregnant women's stress levels were reevaluated by using the Perceived Stress Scale.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the stress level of pregnant women with the Perceived Stress Scale. Comprised of 14 items in total, the scale was designed to measure the extent to which circumstances in one's life are perceived as stressful. The respondents evaluate the items based on a five-point Likert scale that is scored from '0: Never' to '4: Very Often'. Seven positively-stated items are reverse scored. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from the scale are successively 0 and 56 points. A high score obtained from the scale indicates that the respondent has high-level stress perception.</description>
