      This study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitor for&#xD;
      advanced uncommon pathological types of lung cancer whether or not it is accompanied by a&#xD;
      driver mutationin the real world. Through retrospective collection of clinical data of&#xD;
      patients with uncommon pathological types of lung cancer.The patients who are treated with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents are screened out, and they are divided into immune combination&#xD;
      therapy or immune monotherapy, and further evaluate whether there is a difference in efficacy&#xD;
      between the two.&#xD;

      This is a research project involving patients in Medical Oncology Department of Affiliated&#xD;
      Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University. Retrospective study&#xD;
      of 40 patients with advanced uncommon pathological types of lung cancer and observe the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen in the real world. The patients&#xD;
      who are treated with immunosuppressive agents are screened out, and they are divided into&#xD;
      immune combination therapy or immune monotherapy, and further evaluate whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in efficacy between the two. Statistical analysis is used to compare the&#xD;
      differences between the two treatments, so that patients can better choose treatment&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
