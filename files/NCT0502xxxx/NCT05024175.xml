      This is a single site, non-randomized, open-label, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up&#xD;
      Phase 1 study for subjects who have been treated with CARv3-TEAM-E T cells in clinical Study&#xD;
      DF/HCC IRB #20-532 (the main study), that evaluated the safety and efficacy of CARv3-TEAM-E T&#xD;
      cells in subjects with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARv3-TEAM-E drug product is defined as autologous T lymphocytes transduced with a CAR&#xD;
      lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor targeting human EGFRvIII antigen and a&#xD;
      T cell engaging antibody molecule (TEAM) targeting wildtype EGFR. CARv3-TEAM-E T cells are&#xD;
      administered in subjects up to six times in main Study #20-532.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No investigational treatment will be administered in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 2018) recommend long-term follow-up for&#xD;
      subjects treated with gene therapy drug products to monitor for selected adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and the durability of clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the subjects in the parent study has been completed (24 months after CARv3-TEAM-E T&#xD;
      cells infusion, or &lt;24 months after CARv3-TEAM-E infusion if subject discontinues due to&#xD;
      disease progression or any other reason), subjects will be asked to participate in a&#xD;
      long-term follow-up study.&#xD;
