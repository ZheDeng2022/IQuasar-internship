    <textblock>
      Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of paramount importance to human brain function, as the brain&#xD;
      relies on a continuous blood supply to meet its energy needs. Blockage of a cerebral blood&#xD;
      vessel during neurosurgery, even if transient and short-lived, may result in irreversible&#xD;
      brain tissue damage (i.e. stroke) and loss of cortical function, if not identified quickly&#xD;
      enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) has been demonstrated to provide the ability to&#xD;
      visualize flow in vessels in real time and continuously without the need for contrast agents.&#xD;
      In LSCI, the tissue of interest is illuminated with low power laser light at red or near&#xD;
      infrared wavelengths and the light reflected from the tissue surface is imaged onto a camera.&#xD;
      The resulting images are laser speckle patterns and a computer processes the images to&#xD;
      produce speckle contrast images, which are images of the motion within the field of view (ie,&#xD;
      blood flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess the usefulness and accuracy of LSCI&#xD;
      compared to ICGA and/or FA during neurovascular surgery. LSCI videos will be recorded&#xD;
      automatically intraoperatively in each patient before, during, and after ICGA and/or FA in&#xD;
      the same surgical field of view to guarantee comparability of the methods.&#xD;

      Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of paramount importance to human brain function, as the brain&#xD;
      relies on a continuous blood supply to meet its energy needs. Blockage of a cerebral blood&#xD;
      vessel during neurosurgery, even if transient and short-lived, may result in irreversible&#xD;
      brain tissue damage (i.e. stroke) and loss of cortical function, if not identified quickly&#xD;
      enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurosurgery involves the treatment of blood-vessel related pathologies within the brain,&#xD;
      like intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations and dural arteriovenous fistulas,&#xD;
      but also the handling of vessels during brain tumor resections. For these operations,&#xD;
      assessment of flow in vessels is of paramount importance. So far, the surgeon can not &quot;see&quot;&#xD;
      blood flowing inside the artery or vein. Real-time flow visualization during surgery could&#xD;
      help neurosurgeons better understand the consequences of vascular occlusion events during&#xD;
      surgery, recognize potential adverse complications, and thus prompt timely intervention to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of stroke. The current standard for visualizing flow in arteries during&#xD;
      surgery is indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and fluorescein angiography (FA), which&#xD;
      involves administering a bolus of fluorescent dye intravenously and imaging the wash-in of&#xD;
      the dye to determine which vessels are perfused. Both ICGA and FA provide only a punctual&#xD;
      view of perfusion over several seconds, being far away from a continuous assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) has been demonstrated to provide the ability to&#xD;
      visualize flow in vessels in real time and continuously without the need for contrast agents.&#xD;
      In LSCI, the tissue of interest is illuminated with low power laser light at red or near&#xD;
      infrared wavelengths and the light reflected from the tissue surface is imaged onto a camera.&#xD;
      The resulting images are laser speckle patterns and a computer processes the images to&#xD;
      produce speckle contrast images, which are images of the motion within the field of view (ie,&#xD;
      blood flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these properties LSCI has the potential to deliver for the first time continuous&#xD;
      visualisation of blood flow in large and small vessels and to overcome limitations of ICGA&#xD;
      and FA. LSCI is an established technique for studies of CBF and has predominantly been used&#xD;
      to study microcirculation of the cerebral cortex during neurosurgical procedures. However,&#xD;
      the spatial resolution in the clinical setting and its accuracy compared to ICGA and FA are&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess the usefulness and accuracy of LSCI&#xD;
      compared to ICGA and/or FA during neurovascular surgery. LSCI videos will be recorded&#xD;
      automatically intraoperatively in each patient before, during, and after ICGA and/or FA in&#xD;
      the same surgical field of view to guarantee comparability of the methods.&#xD;
