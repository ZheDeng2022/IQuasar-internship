  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Singapore's fertility rate is currently below 1.2, raising concerns about population ageing&#xD;
      and long-term sustainability. The fertility decline is characterized by falling birth rates&#xD;
      among women in their 20s with almost no recuperation among women in their 30s. This project&#xD;
      explores a) whether informational imperfections help to account for high intended ages at&#xD;
      childbearing in Singapore, b) whether informational interventions significantly affect ideal&#xD;
      and expected ages at marriage and childbearing, and expected probability of undergoing social&#xD;
      egg freezing, and c) whether informational interventions significantly affect expected and&#xD;
      actual educational outcomes and labor market outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. University students have knowledge gaps about age-related onset of infertility, assisted&#xD;
           reproductive technologies and local policy initiatives related to age at marriage and&#xD;
           childbearing, especially among male students.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Being exposed to accurate information in these domains leads to significantly lower&#xD;
           ideal/expected ages at marriage and childbearing, and higher expected probability of&#xD;
           undergoing social egg freezing, immediately after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Being exposed to accurate information in these domains does not lead to lower&#xD;
           educational and labor market expectations immediately after the intervention among&#xD;
           either male or female students, or to significant differences in module choices,&#xD;
           Cumulative Average Point (CAP), starting salary and employment status of university&#xD;
           students in the following academic semester and six months after graduation, among&#xD;
           either male or female students.&#xD;

      The project conducts a randomized controlled trial involving 1000 full-time undergraduate&#xD;
      students at NUS. The trial has three stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, participants will be recruited through campus advertisements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, participants who meet the eligibility criteria will complete a 30-40&#xD;
      minute online survey. The survey includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a background survey on items including age, race, family income and parental background,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a section on dating history,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. questions on ideal/expected ages at marriage, expected probability of undergoing social&#xD;
           egg freezing, and fertility and educational and career expectations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. a section on mental wellbeing,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. an awareness survey on age-related onset of infertility, assisted reproductive&#xD;
           technologies, and local policy initiatives related to age at marriage and childbearing,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. an informational intervention. One-third of participants (333 individuals) are randomly&#xD;
           assigned to receive accurate information on the age-related fertility survey items.&#xD;
           One-third of participants (333 individuals) are randomly assigned to receive accurate&#xD;
           information on policy-related survey items. One-third of participants (334 individuals)&#xD;
           receives a fact sheet on diabetes in Singapore. Participants are asked to read the&#xD;
           information thoroughly,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. selected questions from c), which collects data on after-intervention intended ages at&#xD;
           marriage and fertility and educational and career expectations, as well as questions&#xD;
           about whether the questions were useful or led to anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third stage, the students' responses are linked to the Educational Data Lake managed&#xD;
      by ALSET, Provost's Office, NUS, which collects data on students' module choices (whether&#xD;
      within the same major, in a different major within the same faculty or in a different&#xD;
      faculty) and CAP in the following academic semester and at graduation, graduation status, and&#xD;
      starting salary and employment status six months after graduation. All participants are&#xD;
      informed and these linkages are mentioned in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the data collection is completed, we will analyse the data using a&#xD;
      difference-in-differences econometric model. Our model compares three sets of dependent&#xD;
      variables at different points in time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ideal/expected ages at marriage and fertility, expected probability of undergoing social&#xD;
           egg freezing, and educational and career expectations, compared before and immediately&#xD;
           after the intervention,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Module choices and CAP, compared before the survey and in the following academic&#xD;
           semester and at graduation, and graduation status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Starting salary and employment status, compared between the control and treatment groups&#xD;
           six months after graduation (multiple regression rather than difference-in-differences&#xD;
           model)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are compared by gender, faculty, educational and career expectations, and other&#xD;
      background characteristics, including dating history and mental wellbeing.&#xD;
