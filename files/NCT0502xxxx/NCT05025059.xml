  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the feasibility of exercise during chemotherapy in older women&#xD;
      with stage I-III breast cancer. Previous studies have reported that exercise may reduce the&#xD;
      chemotherapy-toxicity risk. This trial may help researchers learn if engaging in a physical&#xD;
      activity program is feasible in patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility of implementing a home-based exercise intervention in older&#xD;
      adults receiving chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe and determine the incidence of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) grade 3-5 toxicities overall and in three risk subgroups (&quot;low-risk,&quot; &quot;mid-risk&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;high-risk&quot;) determined by the Cancer and Aging Research Group-Breast Cancer (CARG-BC) tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the accuracy of the CARG-BC tool in predicting the incidence of CTCAE grade 3-5&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the incidence of dose-reductions, dose-delays, treatment discontinuation and&#xD;
      reduced-dose intensity (RDI; defined as &lt; 85% of total dose) overall and in the three risk&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the incidence of hospitalizations overall and in the three risk subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To examine the effect of the intervention on quality of life overall and in the three risk&#xD;
      subgroups, as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To examine the effect of the intervention on function overall and in the three risk&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To examine the effects of the intervention on patient expectation and self-efficacy, as&#xD;
      assessed by Outcomes Expectations for Exercise (OEE) and Perceived Self-Efficacy for Fatigue&#xD;
      Self-Management (PSEFSM) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in one-on-one coaching sessions with a health coach once a week (QW) to&#xD;
      discuss the content offered in the program, and challenges they are currently facing in&#xD;
      achieving their exercise goals. Patients receive a copy of the Walk with Ease Program (WWE)&#xD;
      workbook, wear a fitness tracker and are encouraged to achieve 150 minutes of walking per&#xD;
      week during chemotherapy and up to 1 month after chemotherapy. Patients also participate in&#xD;
      the Growing Stronger Strength Training Program and receive instruction manuals. They perform&#xD;
      the initial 2 exercises 2 days per week for 4 weeks, and subsequent 2 exercises 2 days per&#xD;
      week for the remainder of the chemotherapy course. Patients maintain exercise logs and&#xD;
      complete questionnaires over 30-45 minutes at baseline, end of chemotherapy and at 1 month&#xD;
      after chemotherapy.&#xD;
