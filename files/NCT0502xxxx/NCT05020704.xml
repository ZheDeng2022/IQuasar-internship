      The addition of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin 10mg once daily to standard-of-care therapy&#xD;
      administered early following acute myocardial infarction will result in a greater attenuation&#xD;
      of adverse left ventricular remodelling, compared with matched placebo, in patients with left&#xD;
      ventricular systolic dysfunction as a result of an acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the administration of an SGLT2i has not been proven to improve outcomes when&#xD;
      commenced in patients immediately after acute myocardial infarction. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME&#xD;
      trial, which only studied patients with type 2 diabetes, patients were excluded from&#xD;
      enrolment if they had had a myocardial infarction in the two months prior to randomisation.&#xD;
      Similarly, in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, patients who had had a myocardial infarction within&#xD;
      the previous 90 days were excluded. Two trials are currently examining the effect of the&#xD;
      addition of an SGLT2i to standard therapy on outcomes in patients following myocardial&#xD;
      infarction; DAPA-MI (ClinicalTrials.gov unique identifier NCT04564742) and EMPACT-MI&#xD;
      (NCT04509674).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the observed benefits in patients with and without diabetes in EMPEROR-Reduced and&#xD;
      DAPA-HF, the investigators will recruit all patients irrespective of diabetes status in the&#xD;
      present trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose (10mg once daily) of empagliflozin is based on the dose used in licensed indications&#xD;
      and the clinical benefit and safety results seen with this dose in EMPEROR-Reduced and&#xD;
      EMPA-REG OUTCOME.21&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI is the reference method of assessment of LV mass, volumes and ejection fraction.&#xD;
      It has the additional benefit of allowing assessment of myocardial viability, tissue&#xD;
      characterisation, myocardial fibrosis and regional dysfunction.31 LVESVI has been shown to be&#xD;
      a major determinant of survival after myocardial infarction.32,33 The degree of LV&#xD;
      remodelling and effect of treatment will be measured by the primary endpoint of the change in&#xD;
      LVESVI from baseline to 24 +/- 4 weeks Microvascular obstruction within the infarct core is&#xD;
      independently associated with an adverse prognosis, and the magnitude of this association is&#xD;
      greater than for infarct size. The investigators research in the British Heart Foundation&#xD;
      MR-MI study (NCT02072850) highlighted the complex nature of microvascular obstruction in&#xD;
      post-MI patients and, to date, there are no evidence-based treatments for this problem.&#xD;
      Microvascular obstruction and, relatedly, myocardial haermorrhage, are associated with&#xD;
      adverse left ventricular remodelling, and, potentially, these infarct core microvascular&#xD;
      pathologies represent a therapeutic target for limiting adverse left ventricular remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial inflammation is a characteristic feature of acute myocardial infarction. However,&#xD;
      dysregulation of myocardial inflammation, particularly in ventricular tissue that is remote&#xD;
      from the infarct zone, may lead to enhanced tissue fibrosis and adverse left ventricular&#xD;
      remodelling. In the BHF MR-MI study, we found that an imaging biomarker of inflammation (T1)&#xD;
      was independently predictive of adverse left ventricular remodelling at 6 months post-MI. The&#xD;
      investogators also found that extracellular volume fraction (ECV) was also associated with&#xD;
      adverse remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal dysfunction early post-MI is an adverse prognostic marker. SGLT2i have favourable&#xD;
      effects on renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and/or HFrEF. The effects of SGLT2i on renal function in post-MI patients&#xD;
      are uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore assess the effects of SGLT2i with empagliflozin on renal&#xD;
      function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine creatinine: albumin ratio) and renal&#xD;
      tissue characteristics revealed by MRI.&#xD;
