  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The quality of PI/PC and iDose4/ cardiac imaging reconstructed images was basically equal or above 3 score</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2months</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring criteria 5 points The image quality of PI/PC is better than that of iDose4/ cardiac imaging, which can be used for diagnosis, very satisfied 4 points The image quality of PI/PC is better than that of contrast products, and the image of iDose4/ cardiac imaging can be used for diagnosis, satisfactory 3 points The image quality of PI/PC is basically equivalent to that of iDose4/ cardiac imaging. The image quality is defective, which does not affect the diagnosis, but is normal 2. The image quality of PI/PC is not lower than iDose4/ cardiac imaging, but the image quality is poor, which affects the diagnosis and is not satisfactory&#xD;
1 points The image quality is lower than iDose4/ cardiac imaging after using PI/PC, the image quality is poor, cannot diagnose, unsatisfactory</description>

    <description>Score enhancement 5 points - Very satisfied very clear and good, can be used for diagnosis 4 points - Satisfaction is clear and good and can be used for diagnosis 3 points - Generally defective, acceptable, without affecting diagnosis 2 points - Unsatisfactory enhancement is poor, affecting diagnosis&#xD;
1 point - Unsatisfactory enhancement is poor and cannot be diagnosed</description>

    <measure>Imaging reconstruction diagnostic confidence using PI/PC compared with using iDose4/ cardiac basically equivalence to or above 3 score</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2months</time_frame>
    <description>Score diagnostic confidence 5 points - Very satisfied the lesion or tissue structure is shown very clearly and can be used for diagnosis Score 4 - Satisfied that the lesion or tissue structure is clearly displayed and can be used for diagnosis 3 points - Generally the lesion or tissue structure is shown with acceptable clarity and does not affect the diagnosis 2 points - unsatisfactory lesion or tissue structure showing poorly, affecting diagnosis&#xD;
1 point - Unsatisfactory lesion or tissue structure is not clearly displayed and cannot be diagnosed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Imaging reconstruction clarity using PI/PC compared with using iDose4/ cardiac basically equivalence to or above 3 score</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2months</time_frame>
    <description>Score clarity 5 points - Very satisfied with the clear edge, the details show very clear and clear and can be used for diagnosis 4 points - Satisfied with a clear edge, showing clear and clear details that can be used for diagnosis 3 points - General clarity acceptable without prejudice to diagnosis 2 points - Undersatisfied edges and details show smooth, unclear, affecting diagnosis&#xD;
1 point - Unsatisfied edges and detail display that is too smooth and unclear to affect diagnosis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Imaging reconstruction Noise level using PI/PC compared with using iDose4/ cardiac basically equivalence to or above 3 score</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2months</time_frame>
    <description>Score noise level 5 points - Very satisfied with very low or no noise, can be used for diagnosis 4 points - Satisfied with low or mild noise, can be used for diagnosis 3 points - General The noise value is normal, acceptable and does not affect the diagnosis 2 points - unsatisfactory high noise, affecting diagnosis&#xD;
1 point - Dissatisfaction with high noise and excessive noise that affects diagnosis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Imaging reconstruction Image texture using PI/PC compared with using iDose4/ cardiac basically equivalence to or above 3 score</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2months</time_frame>
    <description>Score image texture 5 points - Very satisfied with texture very clear, intuitive feel similar to high dose scan image quality, can be used for diagnosis 4 points - Satisfied with clear texture and good image quality for diagnostic purposes 3 points - General texture is normal, image edges or some areas of speckled blur or smoothness, but acceptable, does not affect the diagnosis Score 2 - An undersatisfied image has acceptable speckled blurring that will not be misdiagnosed as lesions and affect the diagnosis&#xD;
1 point - Unsatisfactory image texture and poor texture, blotchy, affecting diagnosis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Imaging reconstruction Image artifacts using PI/PC compared with using iDose4/ cardiac basically equivalence to or above 3 score</measure>
