      This is a Phase I, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study to&#xD;
      explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of&#xD;
      NMS-03597812 in adult patients with RRMM who have exhausted standard treatment options that&#xD;
      are expected to provide meaningful clinical benefit or for whom standard therapy is&#xD;
