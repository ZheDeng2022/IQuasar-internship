  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a life threatening condition and is defined by 1) a&#xD;
      weight-for-height Z-score more than three standard deviations (SD) below the median based on&#xD;
      the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards, 2) a mid-upper arm circumference&#xD;
      (MUAC) of less than 115 mm or 3) by the presence of nutritional edema. Signs such as edema,&#xD;
      mucocutaneous changes, hepatomegaly, lethargy, anorexia, anemia, severe immune deficiency and&#xD;
      rapid progression to mortality characterize a state commonly coined as &quot;complicated SAM&quot;.&#xD;
      Kwashiorkor is one of the forms of complicated SAM commonly distinguished by the unmistakable&#xD;
      presence of bipedal edema. SAM results in high mortality rates of up to half a million child&#xD;
      deaths annually. Undernourished children are at higher risk of mortality ranging from three&#xD;
      times more risk among children with moderate malnutrition to 10-times in SAM children&#xD;
      compared to well-nourished children. Children with complicated SAM require inpatient&#xD;
      treatment in specialized centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Rehabilitation and Nutritional Education Center&quot; (CREN) is a specialized center in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso receiving on average 10 SAM children per day. Recovery rate is lower than&#xD;
      international standards; and adverse events and mortality remain strikingly high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to assess the underlying risk factors affecting the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the nutritional therapeutic treatment protocol for complicated SAM children under 5 years of&#xD;
      age who have been referred to the CREN, at the Centre Hôspitalier Universitaire Souro, Bobo&#xD;
      Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective is to assess the effectiveness of alternative dietary regimens during&#xD;
      the stabilization phase on well-specified clinical and biochemical outcomes in children with&#xD;
      complicated SAM. Dietary regimens differ by their carbohydrate profile and content, and by&#xD;
      their different micronutrient composition including vitamin A, iron and zinc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute malnutrition (SAM), defined as severe wasting [weight-to-height Z-score &lt; -3&#xD;
      standard deviations (SD), based on the WHO Child Growth Standards] and / or the presence of&#xD;
      nutritional edema, and / or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;115 mm, is a condition that&#xD;
      requires urgent attention and appropriate management to reduce mortality and promote recovery&#xD;
      among children. Management of SAM children without complications is provided at the community&#xD;
      level. Hospitalization in specialized care centers is necessary for SAM children with&#xD;
      complications. SAM children with comorbidities have a greater risk of mortality and treatment&#xD;
      failure. Our knowledge of the specific adequate nutritional needs of SAM is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of SAM in hospital, the WHO recommends the use of therapeutic milk low in&#xD;
      protein 'F75' in the stabilization phase; and more protein-rich F100 or F75 combined with&#xD;
      ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) in the transition phase. The WHO also recommends using&#xD;
      as an alternative formula made of cereal flour, skimmed milk powder, oil, sugar, and a&#xD;
      therapeutic vitamin and mineral complex (CMV), in case of shortage of the standard&#xD;
      therapeutic milk F75 / F100 or in case of signs of intolerance (vomiting, diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Refeeding Center - Centre de Récupération et d'Education Nutritionnelle (CREN) of the&#xD;
      Sourô Sanou University Hospital Center (CHUSS) in Burkina Faso specializes in the care of SAM&#xD;
      children with complications. In 2018, out of 500 children aged 6-59 months admitted for SAM&#xD;
      with complications, the CHUSS CREN registered 86.8% full recovery, 8.2% dropout and 5% death.&#xD;
      Although the recovery rate is higher than international standards (greater than 75%), the&#xD;
      mortality rate remains higher than the recommended 3% by international standards; in addition&#xD;
      to the challenges that are faced locally in maintaining high standards of care. At the CREN,&#xD;
      we observed that some SAM children with complications can have severe diarrhea and vomiting&#xD;
      after taking F75 (first phase of the nutritional treatment). It was also observed that other&#xD;
      SAM children with edema, whose edema resolved in the first phase of treatment under F75,&#xD;
      redeveloped edema when they received RUTF (Plumpy Nut®) in the transition phase according to&#xD;
      the WHO 2013 protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective of the study is to assess the risk factors affecting the response to&#xD;
      dietary treatment in this center (the CREN, Burkina Faso) and to compare alternatives for&#xD;
      treatment during the nutritional rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problematic It was observed at the Refeeding Center (CREN) of the Sourô Sanou University&#xD;
      Hospital (CHUSS) in Bobo Dioulasso, that SAM children with complications show during their&#xD;
      treatment, signs of intolerance to F75 (diarrhea , vomiting). The pathophysiology of diarrhea&#xD;
      in SAM involves several theories including that of lactose intolerance, and that of&#xD;
      alteration of the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to assess the effectiveness of diet regimens [standard F75, or alternative F75&#xD;
      + mineral vitamin complex (CMV), or alternative F75 without CMV] during the stabilization&#xD;
      phase from both a clinical and biochemical aspects in children with complicated SAM. Diets&#xD;
      differ in their profile and carbohydrate content, and in their different micronutrient&#xD;
      compositions, including vitamin A, iron and zinc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the F75 alternative during the stabilization phase (the first phase)&#xD;
      of complicated SAM children is associated with better compliance, less diarrhea and better&#xD;
      outcomes than the recommended F75 formulation; and that children treated correctly with the&#xD;
      F75 alternative containing CMV will perform better than the other two groups of children&#xD;
      treated with F75 or the F75 alternative without CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open, randomized controlled trial aimed at testing the effectiveness of three&#xD;
      therapeutic diet regimens during the first phase of hospital management of children with&#xD;
      complicated SAM admitted to CREN, Bobo Dioulasso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent from parents / guardians for the inclusion of the child, the&#xD;
      child will be randomized and will receive their assigned treatment. In accordance with the&#xD;
      2014 protocol for the management of SAM in Burkina Faso, an antibiotic will be given as part&#xD;
      of the systematic treatment of complicated SAM, and other medical treatments depending on the&#xD;
      associated complication. Deworming is provided also gratis, will be done only in children&#xD;
      whose tests are positive for intestinal parasites and ONLY in the rehabilitation phase (the&#xD;
      third phase of the treatment) as per the National Protocol for the management of complicated&#xD;
      SAM. The dietetic treatment will be given by the nurses every 2 hours on the first day; then&#xD;
      if tolerance is good, every 3 hours the following days. No family meals during phase 1. But&#xD;
      the baby can breastfeed. The observance and tolerance of the treatment will be noted by the&#xD;
      nurses: amount of milk taken, refusal, vomiting, diarrhea, presence of a nasogastric tube.&#xD;
      The quantities will be given according to the weight of the child, the presence or not of&#xD;
      edema, in accordance with the national protocol.&#xD;
