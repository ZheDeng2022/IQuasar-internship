  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effects of the self-regulation (neurofeedback) of the&#xD;
      fMRI signal of the prefrontal cortex in depression to ones of more conventional&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment, primarily, psychotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was devoted to the neural, clinical, and psychological effects of the rt-fMRI&#xD;
      neurofeedback for mild/moderate depression. Recruited unmedicated patients suffering from&#xD;
      depression were assigned either to the fMRI neurofeedback (8 sessions of the left prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex activity regulation) or to the active control group, i.e., a double dosage of&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment or EEG neurofeedback (preliminary aborted). Depression&#xD;
      symptoms were measured at baseline, at mid-treatment, and at post-treatment points. Some&#xD;
      inventories of depression and related traits were also given. In the rt-fMRI group,&#xD;
      self-regulation learning was also estimated by means of the fMRI signal change.&#xD;
