  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how alternating-frequency Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
      works to improve postural instability and gait, while also treating other motor symptoms of&#xD;
      Parkinson Disease (PD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postural instability, gait impairment, and falls are among the greatest unmet needs in&#xD;
      Parkinson disease (PD). A single fall can be catastrophic, and impairments that limit&#xD;
      mobility lead to social isolation or depression, and adversely affect bone and cardiovascular&#xD;
      health. Unfortunately, postural instability and gait disorders are refractory to current&#xD;
      pharmacological and surgical treatments, including deep brain stimulation (DBS). This project&#xD;
      will directly address this pressing need. We will recruit participants to perform a gait&#xD;
      task, using a new, alternating DBS frequency paradigm, while body movements and neural&#xD;
      signals are recorded. The findings will lead to improved therapies to address these symptoms&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>On a single day, participants will switch between six DBS frequency conditions. Gait and body kinematics will be monitored during these conditions. The order that participants experience the six conditions will be randomized, and participants will be blinded to the condition. In addition, the assessments will be performed OFF and then repeated ON medication.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Neural recordings (LFP = Local Field Potential and EEG = Electroencephalogram) from the DBS electrode and from EEG electrodes will be analyzed in the frequency domain. Assessed frequency bands will include delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma activity. These will be correlated with behavior and kinematic recordings to determine the neural correlates of gait instability and other parkinsonian symptoms.</description>

    <measure>LFP and EEG connectivity correlation with behavior and kinematics</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Neural recordings (LFP = Local Field Potential and EEG = Electroencephalogram) consist of multiple channels of simultaneously measured electrical activity. Connectivity is a measure of correlations between each pair of recorded and postprocessed channels, at each frequency band, over time. A machine learning algorithm will be trained to correlate the connectivity to behavior and kinematic recordings, to determine the neural correlates of gait instability and other parkinsonian symptoms.</description>
