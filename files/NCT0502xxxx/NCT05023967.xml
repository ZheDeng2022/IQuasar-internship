    <textblock>
      This phase IIb trial studies the combined effect of prolonged nightly fasting and metformin&#xD;
      hydrochloride extended release in decreasing breast tumor cell proliferation and other&#xD;
      biomarkers of breast cancer. Preventing invasive breaset cancer or DCIS. Metformin is widely&#xD;
      used to treat type II diabetes and is associated with a decreased risk of cancer and death in&#xD;
      diabetic individuals. Intermittent fasting may protect cancer patients from the toxic effects&#xD;
      of chemotherapy agents without causing chronic weight loss. The combination of intermittent&#xD;
      fasting and metformin may reduce breast cancer growth and may be used in women at risk for&#xD;
      breast cancer or other cancers associated with being overweight.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of the experimental intervention based on the frequency of occurrence&#xD;
      of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 14 participants assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the difference in post-treatment Ki67 labeling index (LI) in cancer adjacent&#xD;
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (in the presence of invasive breast cancer [IBC]), if&#xD;
      present, or intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) (defined as atypical ductal hyperplasia [ADH] or&#xD;
      atypical lobular hyperplasia [ALH] or lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS]) between the active&#xD;
      treatment and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDRY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the effect of intervention on the change of expression of PP2A-GSK3beta-MCL-1&#xD;
      axis in pre-post treatment cancer tissue levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the change in circulating biomarkers: Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)&#xD;
      index, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) (hsCRP), C-peptide, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3,&#xD;
      free IGF-I, Hb1Ac, lipid profile, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate a customized next generation sequencing (NGS) mutational profile panel&#xD;
      focused on estrogen receptor (ER) positive (+ve) with the response of Ki67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure the difference of cell death by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for M30 in post-&#xD;
      treatment cancer samples between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To measure the difference of phosphorylated (p)S6 by IHC in post- treatment cancer samples&#xD;
      between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess safety and toxicities according to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To correlate eating habits, tobacco and alcohol consumption with the response of Ki67&#xD;
      between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To compare the area under the curve (AUC) of glucose levels between arms and within the&#xD;
      experimental arm according to different doses of metformin hydrochloride extended release (0&#xD;
      mg, 750 mg and 1500 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients fast for &gt;= 16 hours every night and use the continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      system for 4-6 weeks. Patients also receive nutritional counseling sessions on days 0 and 10.&#xD;
      Beginning During week 2, patients also receive metformin hydrochloride extended release (ER)&#xD;
      750 mg orally once daily; week 3 until the day of surgery the dose is 1500 mg daily.&#xD;
      Treatment continues for 4-6 weeks (until surgery) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Control: Patients continue their usual dietary pattern and use the continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring system for 4-6 weeks (until surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin hydrochloride extended release was used&#xD;
             during pregnancy, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any&#xD;
             metformin hydrochloride extended release associated risk because of methodological&#xD;
             limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with metformin hydrochloride extended release,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with metformin&#xD;
             hydrochloride extended release. Moreover, prolonged fasting is not recommended in&#xD;
             pregnant woman&#xD;
