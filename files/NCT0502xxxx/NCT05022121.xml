  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guidelines advocate several complementary modalities as alternatives to drugs and other&#xD;
      invasive treatments for chronic low back pain (LBP) conditions. However, there is little&#xD;
      high-quality research investigating treatments for back-related leg pain, one of the more&#xD;
      severe and disabling presentations of LBP. The investigators are conducting a pilot study to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of a future phase II multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      future trial will assess the comparative effectiveness of a novel supported biopsychosocial&#xD;
      self-management (SBSM) intervention versus Medical Care (MC).&#xD;

    <description>Participants receive training and instruction in skills to engage in healthy physical, psychological, and social self-management behaviors. This will be accomplished through 6-12 sessions with a trained chiropractor or physical therapist. Patients will receive training and instruction in exercises targeting posture, strength, stabilization, and mobility based on their individual needs. They will learn psychological strategies including problem solving and cognitive restructuring to address unhelpful thoughts and emotions. Social strategies include pleasant activity planning with a social focus, and communication techniques for navigating relationships to garner support for self-sufficiency. Other elements include providing key evidence based information about BRLP and spinal manipulation therapies (SMT). SMT will include manipulation, mobilization and soft-tissue treatment. Other intervention elements include enablement, persuasion, and resources and materials to support the patient.</description>

    <description>Medical care will be comprised of primarily medication management, which is a standard first-line approach for back-related leg pain in primary care. Choice of medications is informed by the current evidence and the American College of Physicians guidelines on noninvasive treatment for LBP which balances evidence for risks and benefits when making recommendations. Decisions regarding medication selection will be made collaboratively between the study provider and patient after a discussion of risk/benefit profiles and patient preferences, including prior response. Study providers licensed to prescribe FDA-approved medications will call-in the prescription for the medication of choice to the participant's preferred pharmacy, as is typical in clinical practice.</description>
