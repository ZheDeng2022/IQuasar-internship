  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to develop and test clinical decision support (CDS) tools that&#xD;
      present clinical care team members with a given patient's social risk information and&#xD;
      recommend care plan adaptations based on those risks. This study will test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that providing care team members with CDS about patients' known social risks will result in&#xD;
      improved outcomes. This study's focus is on hypertension and diabetes control, but the&#xD;
      results will have implications for a wide range of morbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a randomized quasi-experimental design to assess impact of the CDS&#xD;
      tools designed to support social risk-informed care. After conducting a 12-month pilot study&#xD;
      with 3 CHCs to test and further refine the CDS tools, 6 CHCs will be recruited to participate&#xD;
      in the main trial. All OCHIN clinics with &gt;200 SDH screenings (excluding the pilot clinics)&#xD;
      will be identified and randomized to a potential intervention group or a control group.&#xD;
      Clinics from the potential intervention group will be recruited in a random order until 6&#xD;
      agree to participate. This recruitment method ensures randomization between intervention and&#xD;
      control clinics, without recruiting CHCs to a study in which they might not receive an&#xD;
      intervention. Intervention sites will be trained in how to use the tools shortly before the&#xD;
      tools are activated and will be followed for 18 months to assess tool adoption and impact on&#xD;
      the CQMs of interest. Use of the CDS tools will occur as part of the regular care patients&#xD;
      receive and will not require special clinic visits. Patients will interact with providers as&#xD;
      they normally would, augmented by the intervention when clinicians choose to utilize the CDS&#xD;
      tools. For all study clinics, quantitative data will be collected (via EHR data extraction)&#xD;
      on social risk data collection and action by care team members. Limited clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected on patients who are seen at a study CHC during the study period. Qualitative data&#xD;
      will also be collected which includes semi-structured interviews with clinic staff from all&#xD;
      study CHCs and a provider survey (card study) for the clinics enrolled in the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Individual patients will not be assigned to an intervention. Instead, randomization and&#xD;
      intervention will occur at the clinic level. While CHCs will be recruited that have&#xD;
      previously screened patients for social risks, it is unlikely that these CHCs will have&#xD;
      screened all patients in their clinics. Thus, the CDS tools will not apply to all patients in&#xD;
      participating clinics, and it cannot be guaranteed that individual patients will receive an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
