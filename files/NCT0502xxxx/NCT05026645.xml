  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an ongoing multicentric observational study that aims to assess the medical response&#xD;
      to chemical events during the last five (5) decades (i.e.: 1970-2020), and in any future&#xD;
      chemical attack that might occur within the next 15 years (i.e.: 2021-2036). Of note, the&#xD;
      data collection will be performed retrospectively and after sites review ethic board (REB)&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The chemical attack occurred between 1970 and 2035 for which a confirmation was made&#xD;
             by reliable authorities (e.g.: US Intelligence community);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The chemical attack was part of a conventional military operation, mass attack,&#xD;
             political assassination or terrorist event;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The chemical attack cause at least one casualty who required the assistance of the&#xD;
             health care professionals (e.g.: physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care&#xD;
             specialists) during a medical extraction from the incident site up-to an admission&#xD;
             into a medical facility;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical information concerning the chemical exposures is accessible to health care&#xD;
             professional for filling out the electronic case report form (eCRF);&#xD;
