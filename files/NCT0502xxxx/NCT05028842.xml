  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel corona virus disease (COVID-19), pandemic has costed lives of several hundred&#xD;
      thousands and affected millions. Comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome components and&#xD;
      chronic liver disease have been associated with more severe infection and increased risk of&#xD;
      death in this pandemic. Several measures have been taking by the governments across the&#xD;
      world. An important step taken by the Indian government was the temporary lockdown of the&#xD;
      whole country starting from 25th March 2020 till 31st May. This was followed by relaxation in&#xD;
      phases across the country. Lockdown and social distancing helped in controlling the pandemic,&#xD;
      but had enormous impact on health of non-COVID patients, economics and social life. Impact of&#xD;
      lockdown COVID-19 on metabolic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy people is&#xD;
      studied. However, the impact on liver disease patients is not known.&#xD;

      Aim and Objective -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: Change in liver stiffness measured by fibroscan before and after&#xD;
           implementation of lockdown in patients of liver disease without COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives: Change in liver fat content measured by fibroscan as Controlled&#xD;
           Attenuation Parameter (CAP) value, metabolic and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (b) Methodology: OPD records of all consecutive patients of liver disease without&#xD;
           COVID-19 infection from the Institute database from 1st January 2020 attending the liver&#xD;
           clinic till 31st December 2020 will be reviewed. Patients with atleast two OPD visits,&#xD;
           with one before implementation of lockdown and the other during the lockdown phase will&#xD;
           be analysed. Patients of liver disease without atleast 2 fibroscan examination (one&#xD;
           before lockdown and the other after lockdown implementation) will be excluded. In&#xD;
           patients having more than one lockdown OPD visit, the one done at later time will be&#xD;
           taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: Patients of liver disease attending the OPD with one visit before&#xD;
           implementation of lockdown and the other during the lockdown phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: Retrospective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period: NA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring and assessment: OPD records of patients fulfilling the inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will be analysed for liver stiffness and CAP using Fibroscan, body weight, body&#xD;
           mass index (BMI), complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFT), kidney&#xD;
           function test (KFT), HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, post prandial blood glucose, total&#xD;
           cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis: Baseline parametric data will be expressed as the proportion,&#xD;
           meanÂ± standard deviation and median with interquartile range. Categorical variables will&#xD;
           be analyzed by chi squared test or Fisher exact test while the continuous variables will&#xD;
           be analyzed using unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Paired t-test&#xD;
           will be used to compare the change before and after the intervention. The p value &lt; 0.05&#xD;
           will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse effects: NA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stopping rule of study: NA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome of the project: Results of the study will be helpful in analyzing its impact&#xD;
      on liver and metabolic health in liver disease patients. Importance of adequate compliance to&#xD;
      the pharmacotherapy and healthy life style will be highlighted if result shows negative&#xD;
      impact as the pandemic is still far from over.&#xD;
