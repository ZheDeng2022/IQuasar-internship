  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Down's syndrome (DS) are more liable to vitamin D deficiency. Treating this&#xD;
      deficiency with supplements is associated with the risk of intoxication due to increased&#xD;
      intestinal absorption or decreased vitamin D metabolism. The aim of the study was to compare&#xD;
      the effect of two exercise intensities on the modulation of vitamin D and Parathormone (PTH)&#xD;
      levels in children with DS.&#xD;

      Forty-four DS male children aged from 8-12 years participated in the study. The subjects were&#xD;
      assigned randomly into two equal groups. group I received high-intensity treadmill aerobic&#xD;
      exercises (T-AE) and group II received moderate-intensity T-AE, three times per week for&#xD;
      three months. the blood samples were collected from both groups before the intervention,&#xD;
      after one month of intervention, then after three months of intervention to assess serum&#xD;
      25(OH)D and PTH levels.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized controlled trial was used to investigate the effect of exercise intensity on vitamin D and PTH levels in children with Down's syndrome. The enrollment of the participants was done by telephone calls to their parents or legal guardians. A total of fifty male DS subjects were initially selected to participate in the study. Only forty-four subjects completed the interventional study because six children were excluded. three children did not meet the inclusion criteria, parents of two children refused to complete the study, and one lost to follow-up. Their age was ranged from 8-12 years. The participants were assigned randomly using sealed envelopes into two equal groups; group I (GI) and group II (GII) each contain twenty-two subjects. GI received the high-intensity T-AE and the GII received the moderate-intensity T-AE, three times per week for three months. All subjects were selected from hospitals in the Western area, Saudi Arabia.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>We used the Martti Karvonen formula to calculate the heart rate zone. Firstly, the resting heart rate (rest-HR) was detected for every participant by inviting him to lie in a prone position for 10 minutes while catching a heart rate monitor. After that, the maximum heart rate (max-HR) was calculated by utilizing this formula: maximum heart rate =220- age. Then, we calculated the heart rate reserve (HRR) by using the law: HRR= max-HR - resting HR. Exercise intensity is represented as a percentage of HRR. Finally, the target heart rate (target-HR) was calculated by using the formula: target-HR = HRR x intensity% + rest-HR. Moderate-intensity exercises are defined as the activity which uses 50% to 70% of the HRR, while high-intensity exercises use 70% to 90% of the HRR</description>
