  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate the cognitive effects of fenfluramine, a&#xD;
      drug that directly stimulates the release of serotonin in the brain and positively modulates&#xD;
      σ1 function. The investigators will use fenfluramine to assess the cognitive effects of&#xD;
      modulating serotonin and σ1 function in healthy volunteers using a battery of cognitive tasks&#xD;
      that measure learning and memory, executive functioning, reward processing, and emotional&#xD;
      processing. The study design is double-blind, and participants will be randomised to either&#xD;
      seven days of fenfluramine or placebo administration. All participants will attend two&#xD;
      screening visits to assess eligibility. There are two main study visits; during the first,&#xD;
      participants will undertake cognitive tasks and questionnaires before taking the initial&#xD;
      study dose. One the second study visit, participants will once again complete these tasks and&#xD;
      questionnaires after a week of fenfluramine/placebo administration.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups (fenfluramine or placebo), stratified on group allocation, gender and cognitive task version administered. Participants in the fenfluramine group will receive oral solution of fenfluramine 15mg twice daily (BID) for seven days. Participants in the placebo group will receive a placebo oral solution 15mg twice daily (BID) for seven days. The study is assessing the effects of fenfluramine on cognitive ability, it is not an efficacy or safety study.</intervention_model_description>
