  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, single-arm, multicenter, international study to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of ONCOFID-P-B following intravesical instillation in adult patients with&#xD;
      histologically and cytologically confirmed CIS, with or without concomitant Ta-T1, who are&#xD;
      unresponsive to BCG therapy and unwilling or unfit to undergo radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing written informed consent (in presence of an Independent Witness, if&#xD;
      applicable), patients will receive an induction therapy consisting of 12 weekly intravesical&#xD;
      instillations of ONCOFID-P-B (induction phase). Patients who achieve a CR by Investigator&#xD;
      assessment at the end of the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase and receive&#xD;
      monthly treatment for an additional 12 months or until recurrence of CIS/Ta-T1 or progression&#xD;
      to MIBC or extravesical disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and able to freely provide written informed consent (in presence of an&#xD;
             Independent Witness if applicable) prior to performing study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18 years or older, male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Persistent or recurrent histologically confirmed CIS of the bladder with or without&#xD;
             concomitant Ta-T1 and with no evidence of metastases demonstrated by abdominal CT&#xD;
             scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. &quot;BCG unresponsive&quot; patients who refuse radical cystectomy or are not clinically&#xD;
             suitable for cystectomy. BCG unresponsive disease includes BCG refractory (persistent&#xD;
             high-grade disease at 6 months despite adequate BCG treatment) and BCG relapsing&#xD;
             (recurrence of high-grade disease after achieving a disease-free state at 6 months&#xD;
             after adequate BCG). Patients can be within 6 to 9 months of the last BCG exposure,&#xD;
             thereby allowing a 3-month lead time for referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Adequate BCG therapy is defined as at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of&#xD;
                  three doses of maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of&#xD;
                  six doses of a second induction course.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Complete resection of Ta-T1 papillary lesions before entering the trial in patients&#xD;
             with concomitant CIS and papillary tumors (residual CIS acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate organ function: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelets ≥&#xD;
             100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL, ALT/AST ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN),&#xD;
             alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN, total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, serum creatinine ≤&#xD;
             2.2 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female in non-reproductive years (defined as surgically sterile or one year&#xD;
             postmenopausal). Female of childbearing potential must agree to practice complete&#xD;
             abstinence or agree to use highly effective contraceptive methods, which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system, or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male patients must be surgically sterile or willing to use a double barrier&#xD;
             contraception method upon enrollment, during the course of the study, and for 1 month&#xD;
             following the last study drug infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Able and willing to comply with the scheduled visits, therapy plans, and laboratory&#xD;
             tests required in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or previous muscle-invasive disease (T2-T4) or metastatic urothelial&#xD;
             carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Suspected hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or to any of the Oncofid-P-B constituents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous or concomitant cancer of the upper urinary tract or the prostatic urethra.&#xD;
             Freedom from upper tract disease must be demonstrated by intravenous pyelogram,&#xD;
             retrograde pyelogram, CT scan or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current or prior systemic therapy for bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Intravesical therapy within 4 weeks prior to beginning study treatment with the&#xD;
             exception of cytotoxic agents (e.g. mitomycin C, doxorubicin and epirubicin) when&#xD;
             administered as a single instillation immediately following a TURBT procedure between&#xD;
             14 to 60 days prior to beginning study treatment, or previous intravesical BCG&#xD;
             therapy, which can be given at least 5 weeks before the diagnostic biopsy required for&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Symptomatic urinary tract infection or bacterial cystitis. Once successfully treated&#xD;
             (negative urine culture), patients may enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Major surgery, other than diagnostic, within 4 weeks prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Previous (within the last 5 years) or current malignancies at other sites, except for&#xD;
             adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the&#xD;
             cervix uteri.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, cannot tolerate intravesical&#xD;
             administration or intravesical surgical manipulation (cystoscopy, biopsy) due to the&#xD;
             presence of serious comorbid condition(s) (e.g., uncontrolled cardiac or respiratory&#xD;
             disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of significant urologic disease interfering with intravesical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Current enrollment or participation in another therapeutic clinical trial within 3&#xD;
             months preceding treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known substance and/or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry in this study or could&#xD;
             compromise protocol objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Pregnancy, lactating women or women of childbearing potential unwilling to use&#xD;
             adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study and until 3 months after&#xD;
             the end of treatment.&#xD;
