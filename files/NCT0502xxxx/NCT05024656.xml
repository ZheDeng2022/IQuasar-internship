      This study will have three (3) phases: (1) a Screening Phase, (2) a Treatment Phase, and (3)&#xD;
      a Follow-up Phase. Subjects will be seen weekly in the Screening and Treatment Phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seen weekly in the Screening and Treatment Phases. Subjects who achieve&#xD;
      confirmed wound closure during the Treatment Phase will be entered into the Follow-up Phase&#xD;
      and will return to the site four (4) weeks following that confirmation visit.&#xD;

    <description>AmnioExcel Plus is a human placental-based tissue consisting of dehydrated, tri-layer Placental (Amnion/Chorion/Amnion) Allograft Membrane (T-PAM) layers. T-PAM is a minimally manipulated placental membrane product made from tissues donated by pre-screened mothers during planned C-sections and is intended for use as a wound covering in the homologous use for the repair, reconstruction and replacement of skin at the direction of a physician. AmnioExcel Plus contains Human Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/P) as defined by US FDA 21 CFR Part 1271.&#xD;
Standard of care includes the following:&#xD;
Coban™&#xD;
Conforming gauze&#xD;
Optifoam® non-adhesive dressing&#xD;
Xtrasorb® for highly exudated wounds&#xD;
Cotton Gauze&#xD;
Normal saline (liquid or gel)&#xD;
Non-adhering dressings&#xD;
Steristrips&#xD;
Offloading boot, as appropriate</description>
