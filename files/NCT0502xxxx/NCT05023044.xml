    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver conditions associated with&#xD;
      fat accumulation that ranges from benign, non-progressive liver fat accumulation to severe&#xD;
      liver injury, cirrhosis, and liver failure. The spectrum of NAFLD encompasses simple&#xD;
      nonalcoholic steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL]) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH) in which there is evidence of hepatocellular injury and/or fibrosis. NAFLD is the most&#xD;
      common liver disease in adults and the second leading cause for liver transplantation in the&#xD;
      U.S. The natural history of NAFLD in the general population has been well described. The NASH&#xD;
      Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) was established by the National Institute of Diabetes&#xD;
      and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in 2002 to further the understanding of the&#xD;
      diagnosis, mechanisms, progression and therapies of NASH. This effort has resulted in&#xD;
      numerous seminal studies in the field. However, NASH CRN studies have systematically excluded&#xD;
      persons living with HIV (PLWH) , as NAFLD in PLWH was thought to be different from that in&#xD;
      the general population due to HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy (ART), concomitant&#xD;
      medications and co-infections. This resulted in major knowledge gaps regarding NAFLD in the&#xD;
      setting of HIV infection. Thus, the natural history of NAFLD in PLWH is largely unknown. The&#xD;
      goal of this ancillary study of NAFLD and NASH in Adults with HIV (HIV NASH CRN), is to&#xD;
      conduct a prospective, observational, multicenter study of biopsy-proven NAFLD in PLWH&#xD;
      (HIV-associated NAFLD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NAFLD is the most prevalent of all liver disorders and is the most common cause of chronic&#xD;
      aminotransferase elevations in the U.S. With the availability of highly effective ART,&#xD;
      chronic liver disease has become a leading cause of non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in PLWH. NAFLD is projected to become the leading cause of liver disease in the aging HIV&#xD;
      population. While there is evidence that both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infection follow an&#xD;
      accelerated course in PLWH, it is unknown if NAFLD is also accelerated in PLWH. Unlike NAFLD&#xD;
      in the general population, there is a significant lack of characterization of the natural&#xD;
      history of NAFLD in PLWH. This prospective observational study of PLWH with&#xD;
      histologically-characterized NAFLD will examine the natural history of HIV-associated NAFLD.&#xD;
      It will also test the accuracy of non-invasive assessments of advanced fibrosis in detecting&#xD;
      histologically confirmed advanced fibrosis in PLWH, and establish a robust biospecimen bank&#xD;
      (plasma, serum, genomic DNA, and urine; peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and stool&#xD;
      at select sites).&#xD;

      Fasting serum and plasma, DNA (in participants consenting to genetic research), PBMCs, stool,&#xD;
      and snap frozen liver tissue will be banked in the NAFLD in HIV Database. Blood will be drawn&#xD;
      for serum and plasma banking during screening and yearly visits on all participants enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. If a standard of care liver biopsy is obtained at any time for any reason after&#xD;
      the participant has signed the informed consent form, a portion of the liver sample will be&#xD;
      collected for banking. The samples will be shipped on dry ice to the Indiana University&#xD;
