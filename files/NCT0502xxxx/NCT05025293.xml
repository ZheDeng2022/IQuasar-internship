      To prevent hip fracture patients for having another fracture, secondary fracture preventing&#xD;
      medication should be given as soon as possible. Zoledronate is the most efficient&#xD;
      bisphosphonate and is given as an intravenous infusion once yearly. However, the appropriate&#xD;
      time to initiate zoledronate treatment after a hip fracture has not yet been established. To&#xD;
      clarify the optimal timing of zoledronate to hip fracture patients we have designed a&#xD;
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial to compare if zoledronate&#xD;
      administered early (within 3 days) after hip fracture surgery is as good as zoledronate given&#xD;
      late (3 months) after hip fracture surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture patients have the highest risk for recurrent hip or other osteoporotic&#xD;
      fractures. We have efficient fracture preventing medication easily available, but few&#xD;
      patients receive them. We therefore need to create simple systems to ensure that these frail&#xD;
      patients with the highest risk for a new fracture are offered proper treatment early and any&#xD;
      delay in treatment should be avoided. Zoledronate is the most efficient bisphosphonate and&#xD;
      the drug of choice for hip fracture patients due to the results from the Horizon recurrent&#xD;
      fracture trial. It is given as an intravenous infusion once yearly. However, the appropriate&#xD;
      time to initiate zoledronate treatment after a hip fracture has not yet been established. The&#xD;
      summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Aclasta (zoledronate) in Norway says that&#xD;
      Aclasta should not be administered within the first 2 weeks after the hip fracture, however&#xD;
      there have been a practice over years in Norway to give zoledronate to the hip fracture&#xD;
      patients during their stay in hospital for fracture treatment. There are logistical and&#xD;
      practical advantages of giving zoledronate while the patient is still in hospital for her&#xD;
      fracture. It has, however, been questioned whether the effect of zoledronate given within the&#xD;
      first 2 weeks postoperatively really is fracture preventing. The results from the post hoc&#xD;
      analysis from the Horizon recurrent fracture trial by Eriksen and co-workers in 2009,&#xD;
      suggested that given zoledronate within 2-weeks after hip fracture surgery may be a little&#xD;
      less fracture preventing. The results from this analysis can be due to the low number of&#xD;
      study subjects as well as frailty in the study population causing the large variations. On&#xD;
      the other hand, the lack of effect in the within 2-week group may be due to the affinity for&#xD;
      zoledronate to bone mineral and the accumulation of zoledronate in the fracture callus during&#xD;
      bone repair with less being incorporated in the rest of the skeleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify the optimal timing of zoledronate to hip fracture patients we wanted to compare if&#xD;
      zoledronate administered early (within 3 days) after hip fracture surgery, while the patients&#xD;
      is still in hospital, is as good as zoledronate given late (3 months) after hip fracture&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis we designed a non-inferiority randomized trial using the bone turnover&#xD;
      marker N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) as the primary endpoint. PINP has&#xD;
      in recent years been widely used as a marker to follow the effect of anti-resorptive therapy&#xD;
      as it is more robust than the other well studied bone marker; cross-linked C-telopeptide of&#xD;
      type I collagen (CTX). P1NP and CTX are recommended as reference markers for bone turnover by&#xD;
      the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF). Anti-resorptive agents as bisphosphonates&#xD;
      influence bone remodeling by decreasing bone resorption (amino-bisphosphonates kills&#xD;
      osteoclasts) and thereby also reducing bone formation. This affects the bone turnover&#xD;
      markers: Both P1NP and CTX drops in value in a consistent manner reflecting the level of bone&#xD;
      suppression and has shown to correlate with the level of bone mineral density and the&#xD;
      subsequent fracture risk. P1NP and CTX are therefore well suited to monitor the effect of&#xD;
      anti-resorptive therapy as they reflect the bone turnover status in the entire skeleton. It&#xD;
      is likely to believe that if zoledronate given early after fracture is accumulated in the&#xD;
      fracture callus and too little is incorporated in the entire skeleton, the result will be&#xD;
      just a local decrease in bone resorption (only in the fracture callus). This will not to the&#xD;
      same extent as a decrease in bone resorption from the entire skeleton, be reflected by the&#xD;
      bone turnover markers P1NP and CTX and the fall in these markers will be less than if we give&#xD;
      zoledronate after the fracture has healed (after 6-12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients that meets the study requirements and with an informed consent will be&#xD;
      stratified on type of operation (arthroplasty versus internal fixation) and on hospital&#xD;
      before randomization 1:1 to either zoledronate early (ZOLearly: zoledronate given within 3&#xD;
      days after hip fracture surgery) or zoledronate late (ZOLlate: zoledronate given 3 months&#xD;
      after hip fracture surgery). The patients will be followed for 15 months with study visits at&#xD;
      3 months post fracture and at 6 and 12 months post treatment with zoledronate. The study is&#xD;
      double-blinded the first 3 months to be able to test for the &quot;soft&quot; secondary endpoints;&#xD;
      delirium and rehabilitation. Approximately 300 patients will be recruited. Estimated&#xD;
      recruitment time is 2 years.&#xD;
