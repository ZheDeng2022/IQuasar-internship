  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many autistic children suffer from chronic constipation. Gut mobilization was obtained&#xD;
      administering polyethylene glycol (PEG) at the dose of 6.9 g/d once a day for 6 months in an&#xD;
      open trial involving 21 chronically constipated autistic children 2-8 years old, followed&#xD;
      prospectively for 6 months. Children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder by DSM-5 and&#xD;
      confirmed by ADOS-2 criteria, were evaluated before (T0), 1 month (T1), and 6 months (T2)&#xD;
      after intestinal mobilization, recording Bristol stool scale scores, urinary p-cresol&#xD;
      concentrations, and behavioral scores for social interaction deficits, stereotypic behaviors,&#xD;
      anxiety, and hyperactivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic constipation is common among children with ASD and is associated with more severe&#xD;
      anxiety, hyperactivity, irritability and repetitive behaviors. Young autistic children with&#xD;
      chronic constipation display higher urinary and foecal concentrations of p-cresol, an&#xD;
      aromatic compound produced by gut bacteria, known to negatively affect brain function. Acute&#xD;
      p-cresol administration to BTBR mice enhances anxiety, hyperactivity and stereotypic&#xD;
      behaviors, while blunting social interaction. This study was undertaken to prospectively&#xD;
      assess the behavioral effects of gut mobilization in young autistic children with chronic&#xD;
      constipation, and to verify their correlation with urinary p-cresol. To this aim, 21&#xD;
      chronically constipated autistic children 2-8 years old were evaluated before (T0), 1 month&#xD;
      (T1), and 6 months (T2) after intestinal mobilization, recording Bristol stool scale scores,&#xD;
      urinary p-cresol concentrations, and behavioral scores for social interaction deficits,&#xD;
      stereotypic behaviors, anxiety, and hyperactivity. Gut mobilization was obtained&#xD;
      administering PEG (6.9 g/d once a day) for 6 months. A progressive, statistically significant&#xD;
      decrease in all behavioral symptoms was recorded over the six-month study period. Urinary&#xD;
      p-cresol levels displayed variable trends, mainly increasing at T1 and decreasing at T2.&#xD;
      These results support gut mobilization as a simple strategy to at least partly ameliorate ASD&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as comorbid anxiety and hyperactivity, in chronically constipated children.&#xD;
      These beneficial effects likely involve multiple mechanisms.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In this open trial, each child underwent gut mobilization using a standard protocol with oral administration of PEG (6.9 g/d once a day) for 6 months. Children were observed and behaviorally tested at baseline (T0), 1 month (T1) and 6 months (T2) after gut mobilization.&#xD;
At the time of recruitment, Intellectual Quotient (IQ) or Developmental Quotient (DQ) were determined using the Leiter International Performance Scale-Third Edition or the Griffith Mental Development Scales, respectively. Autistic behaviors were assessed using the ADOS-2, and the Children Autism Rating Scales (CARS). Adaptive functioning was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Childhood Autism Rating Scale is a clinical rating scale for the trained clinician to rate the presence and severity of signs and symptoms of ASD by direct observation of the child. Scores can range from 15 to 60: below 30, non autistic; 30-36.5 mild to moderate autism; 37-60, severe autism</description>
