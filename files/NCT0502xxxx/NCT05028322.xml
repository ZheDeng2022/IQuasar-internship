  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a population of cirrhotics patients who did not responde to an anti-HBV vaccination&#xD;
      according to the recommended vaccination, the goal is to :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the proportion of patients with HBs antibody levels greater than 10mUI/mL at 1 month&#xD;
      of the last injection of vaccine ; with a M0-M1-M6 vaccine regimen using 3 vaccines&#xD;
      strategies :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After simple intramuscular vaccine (IM) ( Control group )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After simple intradermal vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after IMIQUIMOD's application followed by intradermal vaccine administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is : IMIQUIMOD acts as an immunity booster, so the&#xD;
      combination of IMIQUIMOD with an intra-dermal injection of the anti-HBV vaccine allows better&#xD;
      acquisition of post-vaccination immunization.&#xD;

      This study will be in a population of Cirrhotic patients who have already received a HBV&#xD;
      vaccination with a conventional regimen and who have not responded (characterized by a level&#xD;
      of antibody Hbs &lt; 10UI/ml at the end of the vaccine regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current recommendations, up to 3 additional injections of HBV vaccine should be injected&#xD;
      to obtain an antibody level&gt; 10 mIU / ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigator will describe the proportion of patients with HBs antibody&#xD;
      levels greater than 10mUI/mL at 1 month of the last injection of vaccine ; with a M0-M1-M6&#xD;
      vaccine regimen using 3 vaccines strategies :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After simple intramuscular vaccine (IM) ( Control group )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After simple intradermal vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after IMIQUIMOD's application followed by intradermal vaccine administration&#xD;
