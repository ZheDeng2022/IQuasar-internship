  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually, more than 35 million patients are hospitalized in the United States. Many of these&#xD;
      will experience hospital-acquired loss of physical functioning due to a lack of mobility&#xD;
      during their in-patient stay. Such loss includes difficulties performing basic activities,&#xD;
      such as rising from a chair, toileting, or ambulating. This loss of function may increase&#xD;
      hospital length of stay (LOS), nursing home placement, and decrease mobility and&#xD;
      participation in community activities even years after hospitalization. Prevention of this&#xD;
      hospital-acquired functional loss is critical. Even the sickest hospitalized patients (e.g.,&#xD;
      those in the intensive care unit [ICU]), can safely and feasibly benefit from early&#xD;
      mobilization. In the non-ICU setting there is evidence that patient mobilization reduces LOS&#xD;
      and hospital costs, while improving patient satisfaction and physical and psychological&#xD;
      outcomes. The overall objective of this proposed project is to evaluate the implementation&#xD;
      and impact of a transdisciplinary and multifaceted mobility program (Johns Hopkins Activity&#xD;
      and Mobility Promotion - AMP) on clinical outcomes among hospitalized adults. In addition to&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, we will identify barriers and facilitators to high-performance program&#xD;
      adoption. Results of this project will provide critical new insights on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      AMP and inform dissemination and implementation nationwide.&#xD;

    <description>Each study site will implement the Johns Hopkins AMP program at different times. The AMP program includes nursing staff training on the goals of AMP, how to complete mobility-focused outcome measures, set mobility goals, and to safely mobilize/ambulate patients. The AMP program also includes embedding these outcome measures and mobility goals into electronic medical records and producing weekly/monthly reports that show how often nursing staff score patient mobility and help patients meet daily activity goals.</description>
