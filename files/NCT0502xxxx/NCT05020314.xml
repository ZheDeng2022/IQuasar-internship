  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to increase access to and adoption of the Healthy Weight&#xD;
      Clinic package in primary care settings serving low income families in the United States who&#xD;
      have a disproportionately high prevalence of childhood obesity. Two federally-qualified&#xD;
      health centers will be implementing a Healthy Weight Clinic Program. The Healthy Weight&#xD;
      Clinic is staffed by a medical provider, a Dietitian/Nutritionist, and a Community Healthy&#xD;
      Worker. Patients attend individual medical visits (once per month for 12 months) with the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team, group visits led by a member of the team (once per month for 6&#xD;
      months), and phone follow-up between visits. All patients who receive care at the pilot&#xD;
      implementation sites will be exposed to the systems-level intervention. A subset of patients&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in a research evaluation of the program.&#xD;
