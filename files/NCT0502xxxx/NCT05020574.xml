  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common tissue expander-related infections are from Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas&#xD;
      species. In addition, from breast tissue microbiome studies, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas&#xD;
      show variable abundance across samples. The investigator hypothesizes that breast cancer&#xD;
      patients undergoing reconstructive surgery with high initial abundance of Staphylococcus&#xD;
      and/or Pseudomonas are more likely to develop subsequent tissue expander-related infections&#xD;
      from these respective organisms.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) To determine the feasibility of breast microbiome sampling using the study techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define the differences in the gut and breast microbiomes between patients undergoing&#xD;
           mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction who develop post-operative implant&#xD;
           infection and those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of post-operative antibiotics on the gut and breast microbiomes&#xD;
           after mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed-up for 90 days after undergoing implant-based reconstruction.&#xD;

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of success in obtaining samples from breast tissue will be measured as a binary outcome (successful or not successful) over time (intra-operatively, week 1, week 2, week 3, and week 4). The investigators will assess and document success in obtaining a tissue sample immediately at the time of sampling of each participant.</description>

    <description>The feasibility of success in obtaining samples from the tissue expander aspiration ports will be measured as a binary outcome (successful or not successful) over time (intra-operatively, week 1, week 2, week 3, and week 4). The investigators will assess and document success in obtaining a aspirate sample immediately at the time of sampling of each participant.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of the change in breast microbiome over time with total duration of antibiotics (Cohort A only)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will analyze the microbiomes between groups, between microbiome environments (gut v.&#xD;
breast, inter-individual). The correlate of change in breast microbiome over time will be compared to the total duration of antibiotics for Cohort A only. The measure of association ranges from +1 to -1, with a value of zero equal to no association.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with post-operative infection</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by clinically assessing for signs of post-operative infection in each patient at each clinic visit. A post-operative infection is defined by clinical assessment of findings of surgical site erythema, tenderness, edema, and/or purulent drainage +/- fever. Proportion of participants with clinically diagnosed infection will be reported for each group and final diagnosis for analyses will be binary; a participant will either have a post-operative infection in the 90 day post-operative period or not have a post-operative infection in the 90 day post-operative period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shannon Diversity Index Score for species of microbiome</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha diversity will be evaluated for species richness by number of operational taxonomic units and for evenness using the Shannon Index. The Shannon diversity index (H) is an index that is commonly used to characterize species diversity in a community and accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present. The proportion of species (i) relative to the total number of species (pi) is calculated, and then multiplied by the natural logarithm of this proportion (lnpi). The resulting product is summed across species, and multiplied by -1. Shannon's equitability (EH) can be calculated by dividing H by Hmax (here Hmax = lnS). Equitability assumes a value between 0 and 1 with 1 being complete evenness and the overall index score is represented by a percentage of the species.</description>

    <measure>Number of overall identified microbes</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate microbial composition by grouping identified microbes into operational taxonomic units at the species, genera and phyla levels. We will compare the relative abundances of these microbes between groups at the species, gene</description>
