      This study evaluates if the implementation of an online platform with procedures and&#xD;
      protocols, improve the knowledge of professionals and can have a health impact related to&#xD;
      decreased contamination of blood cultures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Quasi-experimental study, with parallel groups (experimental and control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an Online Learning Platform used by&#xD;
      nurses to improve the results of a blood culture technique. The online learning tool is&#xD;
      studied in two of four internal medicine units of a tertiary hospital in Madrid. These two&#xD;
      units have similar characteristics of personnel, materials and structure. Both units are at a&#xD;
      great distance, preventing a professional talk to each other.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Contaminated Cultures in the Control and Experimental Group Before Intervention and After the Learning Obtained With the Online Training Platform.</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed monthly, month 6 and 9 reported.</time_frame>
    <description>The results obtained in each arm of the study are collected month by month in both groups (Experimental and control). The data for each month are summarized for 6 months, reporting the pre-intervention result (for both groups: experimental and control). The data collected during the 3 months following the intervention are also summed during the 3 months, giving a value at the end of this time (month 9 of the study).</description>

    <measure>Score on the Knowledge Test Related to Blood Culture Extraction Technique for Nurses (K-Blood-CT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month and 9 month of study.</time_frame>
    <description>The improvement in the learning of the technique is measured with a test with 20 questions created ad hoc related of blood culture intervention (Blood culture collection knowledge test for nurses). The score ranges from 0 points (worst level of knowledge) to 10 points (best level of knowledge). The results can be divided into intervals: 0-2.99 very deficient; 3- 4.99 insufficient; 5-6.9 good; 7-8.9 notable; &gt; 9 outstanding.</description>

        <title>Score on the Knowledge Test Related to Blood Culture Extraction Technique for Nurses (K-Blood-CT)</title>
        <description>The improvement in the learning of the technique is measured with a test with 20 questions created ad hoc related of blood culture intervention (Blood culture collection knowledge test for nurses). The score ranges from 0 points (worst level of knowledge) to 10 points (best level of knowledge). The results can be divided into intervals: 0-2.99 very deficient; 3- 4.99 insufficient; 5-6.9 good; 7-8.9 notable; &gt; 9 outstanding.</description>
