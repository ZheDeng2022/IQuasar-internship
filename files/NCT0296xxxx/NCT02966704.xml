  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of protein quality has been identified as the top priority question by the&#xD;
      Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. However, the current&#xD;
      available methods do not precisely estimate protein quality, or need invasive procedures. The&#xD;
      proposed 'dual tracer approach' is a non-invasive method to evaluate protein quality in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project characterizes the use of 15N-intrinsically-labelled milk protein as a&#xD;
      reference-protein for development a non-invasive method that can be used to assess protein&#xD;
      quality in human subjects&#xD;

      Rationale: The evaluation of protein quality has been identified as the top priority question&#xD;
      by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. However, the current&#xD;
      available methods do not precisely estimate protein quality, or need invasive procedures. The&#xD;
      proposed 'dual tracer approach' is a minimal invasive method to evaluate protein quality in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The present project characterizes the use of 15N-intrinsically-labelled milk&#xD;
      protein as a reference-protein for development a minimal invasive method that can be used to&#xD;
      assess protein quality in human subjects. For this purpose, our primary objectives are to&#xD;
      define the digestive and metabolic behaviour and distribution of the&#xD;
      15N-intrinsically-labelled milk protein compared to the internal standard 13C-spirulina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized cross-over trial with two experimental meals. Study population:&#xD;
      Healthy male and female, age 18-35y Intervention (if applicable): On two separate test days,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a semi liquid meal (pudding) divided in 9 portions, (meal 1: 27 En%&#xD;
      Protein,10 En% fat, 62 En% carbohydrates; meal 2: 14 En% Protein,10 En% fat, 75 En%&#xD;
      carbohydrates), with intrinsically labelled 15N protein powder. Furthermore, the meal will&#xD;
      contain a trace amount of 13C-labelled algae protein as an internal standard. Meals will&#xD;
      differ in the amount (e.g. 50g or 25g) of 15N-labelled milk protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The ratio of isotopic enrichment (15N/13C) of (total) amino&#xD;
      acids of the test meal and the blood plasma as determined by (gas chromatography-) isotope&#xD;
      ratio mass spectrometry ((GC)-IRMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: A meal challenge with intrinsically labelled protein and addition of stable&#xD;
      isotope tracer is frequently used in postprandial studies. Stable isotopes are naturally&#xD;
      occurring isotopes and are not harmful for subjects, as there is no decay. Furthermore,&#xD;
      placing venous catheters and blood sampling can occasionally cause a local haematoma or&#xD;
      bruise and some participants may report pain or discomfort. Subjects have to come to the&#xD;
      research facility three times, a screening visit of 1 hour, and 2 experimental days of 7&#xD;
      hours. Subjects will be financially compensated for participation.&#xD;
