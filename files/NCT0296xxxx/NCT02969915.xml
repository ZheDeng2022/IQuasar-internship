    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of integrated care centers vs. integrated&#xD;
      care centers plus HIV patient treatment incentives for achieving HIV treatment targets among&#xD;
      people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men in India. The investigators will also&#xD;
      assess cost-effectiveness and barriers and facilitators to implementation through targeted&#xD;
      mixed-methods approaches. This study is a model for improving HIV treatment outcomes in key&#xD;
      populations in low to middle-income countries.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trajectory of the HIV epidemic in coming decades will be determined by the degree to&#xD;
      which we can identify infected persons and engage them in care - a point implicit in the&#xD;
      ambitious UNAIDS &quot;90-90-90&quot; target, which sets 90% goals for HIV diagnosis, linkage of&#xD;
      infected persons to sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression in those&#xD;
      treated. Meeting this target requires successful engagement of difficult to reach&#xD;
      populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM), who&#xD;
      bear a disproportionate share of the epidemic, particularly in low to middle income&#xD;
      countries. Our team is nearing completion of a multi-site cluster-randomized trial in India&#xD;
      to assess the effectiveness of integrated care centers (ICCs) for PWID and MSM compared to&#xD;
      usual care. ICC process measures from the first year show robust uptake of HIV counseling and&#xD;
      testing, the primary outcome for that trial, but slower than anticipated ART uptake.&#xD;
      Demand-side interventions in public health (such as treatment incentives) can be particularly&#xD;
      effective when paired with optimized treatment accessibility (i.e., supply). Consequently,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to examine whether provision of HIV care and treatment incentives&#xD;
      to ICC clients will improve overall utilization of the clinics and downstream HIV care&#xD;
      continuum outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design. This will include a&#xD;
      16-site, pair-matched cluster randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of adding of HIV&#xD;
      care incentives to ICCs (ICC+) versus standard ICCs on HIV care continuum outcomes, including&#xD;
      ART initiation, adherence and viral suppression. Effectiveness will be compared at the ICC&#xD;
      level (from a cohort of HIV-infected ART-eligible clients followed in each ICC and process&#xD;
      measures deriving from all ICC clients) and at the community-level through a cross-sectional&#xD;
      sample accrued via respondent-driven sampling (RDS) 2 years after initiation of the&#xD;
      intervention. Because PWID and MSM will be sampled independently from the ICCs in the RDS, it&#xD;
      provides an opportunity to characterize outcomes like community viral load and HIV incidence,&#xD;
      reflecting impact within the broader PWID/MSM communities. As an exploratory sub-aim, we will&#xD;
      use a rigorous scientific design to assess the effects of withdrawing (vs. continuing)&#xD;
      incentives beyond the initial intervention phase. Additionally, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine the cost-effectiveness of the ICC+ intervention.&#xD;
