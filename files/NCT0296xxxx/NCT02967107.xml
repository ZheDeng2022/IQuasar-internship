      Comparing the efficacy of cold snare polypectomy with endoscopic mucosal resection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and it remains the second most&#xD;
      commonly diagnosed malignancy in Australia. Colonoscopic polypectomy reduces the incidence&#xD;
      and mortality from CRC by disrupting the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Screening for CRC has&#xD;
      proven to be effective in reducing mortality and morbidity from CRC and has become common&#xD;
      practice. Interval cancers (development of a CRC within 6 to 60 months of a colonoscopy)&#xD;
      occur in 6% of patients and estimations showed that up to 27% of these are due to incomplete&#xD;
      adenoma resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serrated neoplasia pathway accounts for 20- 30% of sporadic cancers. Serrated precursor&#xD;
      lesions are thought to be a major contributor to the relative failure of colonoscopy in the&#xD;
      prevention of proximal colorectal cancer (CRC) and to the 5- 7% of CRCs which occur in the&#xD;
      period after complete colonoscopy and prior to surveillance, termed 'interval' cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to being difficult to detect, sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) are more likely to&#xD;
      be incompletely resected than conventional adenomas. The CARE study demonstrated that 31% of&#xD;
      SSPs had remnant tissue in the resection defect compared with 7.2% of conventional adenomas,&#xD;
      and in lesions greater than 10 mm in size, residual tissue remained in 47.5%. SSPs may have&#xD;
      indistinct margins, and smaller lesions may prove difficult to entrap with the snare because&#xD;
      of their flat nature. SSPs also may contain dysplastic foci within the lesion, with an&#xD;
      endoscopic appearance indistinguishable from conventional adenomas, and the surrounding&#xD;
      serrated component may be overlooked and incompletely resected if this is not recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of colonoscopic polypectomy is continually evolving, leading to better outcomes&#xD;
      with regard to polyp detection rate, complete resection rate (CRR) of polyps, patient&#xD;
      comfort, safety and cost-efficacy. Although colonoscopy is considered the 'gold standard' for&#xD;
      detecting and removing polyps, the technique is still imperfect. Questions about best&#xD;
      practice for polypectomy remain, so optimizing the technique is expected to lead to better&#xD;
      patient outcomes. The optimal treatment of SSPs should be effective, safe and inexpensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such lesions can be removed by cold snare polypectomy or by endoscopic mucosal resection.&#xD;
      Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is now common practice and has proven to be a safe and effective&#xD;
      technique for removal of any small polyps (&lt;10 mm). Because of their physical&#xD;
      characteristics, use of thin wire snares leads to a fast tissue transection and ability to&#xD;
      remove SSP relatively swiftly. The size of snares suitable for SSP CSP is approximately 9 mm.&#xD;
      Thus lesions greater than this size would need to be removed in more than one piece,&#xD;
      introducing the possibility of incomplete resection. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is&#xD;
      well established for laterally spreading colorectal lesions. It involves submucosal injection&#xD;
      and diathermy assisted snare resection by piecemeal or en-bloc depending on polyp size. En&#xD;
      bloc resection is possible for lesions up to 20 mm and facilitates histopathological&#xD;
      evaluation. EMR is more time consuming than CSP and may be associated with diathermy related&#xD;
      complications such as postpolypectomy bleeding, perforation and pain. The most efficient and&#xD;
      safe method of removal of SSP has not been established.&#xD;
