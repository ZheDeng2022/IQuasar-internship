    <textblock>
      The study assesses the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ACZ885 (canakinumab) in pediatric&#xD;
      and young adult patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an ambulatory-based 24-week study followed by an additional 24-week open label&#xD;
      phase. It was a subject- and investigator-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, non-confirmatory study to assess the clinical efficacy of ACZ885 administered s.c. in&#xD;
      six injections given 28 days apart (in each phase of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric and young adult subjects diagnosed with sickle cell anemia (SCA) were planned to be&#xD;
      randomized to either ACZ885 treatment or placebo treatment in a 1:1 ratio,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, there was a maximum 28-day screening period that included recording of&#xD;
      daily pain frequency and intensity by e-diary for at least 1 week. Subjects who met the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria at screening underwent evaluation of baseline clinical and biomarker&#xD;
      assessments prior to first dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, monthly s.c. dosing with ACZ885 started at 4 mg/kg for subjects weighing ≤40 kg and&#xD;
      300 mg for all other subjects. Subjects in the placebo treatment arm were injected with&#xD;
      placebo in a like manner. All subjects returned to the study centers for safety checks on a&#xD;
      monthly basis when they received treatment with either ACZ885 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final blinded dosing was given on Week 20, followed by blinded clinical assessments at&#xD;
      Week 24. Subjects from both study arms were then offered optional, open label monthly dosing&#xD;
      of ACZ885 for an additional 24 weeks (Weeks 24-48) with clinical outcome assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects returned for the end of study (EOS) visit at Week 56. For subjects who chose not to&#xD;
      participate in the optional, open label portion of the study, or for those stopping treatment&#xD;
      early for any other reason, an EOS visit occurred approximately 8 weeks after last dose&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment of 49 subjects, Novartis decided to terminate the study early due to&#xD;
      strategic reasons not related to safety and decided that no additional enrollment was needed&#xD;
      in order to interpret the study objectives.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline of 4- Week Average Daily Pain Measured by Visual Analog Score (VAS) Over the Period of Week 8 to 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (upto 28 days prior to start of treatment), Week 8 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to record severity. Pediatric and young adult participants rated their daily sickle cell associated pain intensity once each day in the evening using an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 to 10 with higher ratings associated with more intense pain (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain). For each subject, there was a maximum 28-day screening period that included recording of daily pain intensity by e-diary for at least 1 week. The average daily pain results in the screening period were used to derive the baseline value. The average over week 8 to 12 was calculated and the change from baseline in the average daily pain VAS was analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of 4- Week Average Daily Pain Measured by Visual Analog Score (VAS) Over the Period of Week 8 to 12</title>
        <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to record severity. Pediatric and young adult participants rated their daily sickle cell associated pain intensity once each day in the evening using an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 to 10 with higher ratings associated with more intense pain (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain). For each subject, there was a maximum 28-day screening period that included recording of daily pain intensity by e-diary for at least 1 week. The average daily pain results in the screening period were used to derive the baseline value. The average over week 8 to 12 was calculated and the change from baseline in the average daily pain VAS was analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measures.</description>
