      The purpose of this study was to compare CO measured by two easy to use non-invasive&#xD;
      monitors, the esCCO (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) to the Volume View (Edwards Lifesciences,&#xD;
      Irvine, USA) and to assess their trending ability in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac output (CO) is a major physiological variable that should be monitored closely during&#xD;
      cardiac surgery in order to assess and guide therapeutic interventions so as to decrease&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity. The purpose of this study was to compare CO measured by two easy to&#xD;
      use non-invasive monitors, the esCCO (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) to the Volume View (Edwards&#xD;
      Lifesciences, Irvine, USA) and to assess their trending ability in patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. After Internal review board approval and written informed consent, 19&#xD;
      patients were included in this study. Before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), CO was measured&#xD;
      simultaneously using both the esCCO and the Volume View device before and after 3&#xD;
      CO-modifying maneuvers [passive leg raise (PLR), end expiratory occlusion test (EEOT) and&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cm H2O. Five CO values for esCCO and three for&#xD;
      volume view were averaged and compared during a one minute period of time before and after&#xD;
      each maneuver. The precision error and its 95% confidence interval (CI) that corresponds to&#xD;
      the least significant change (LSC) were calculated within this period of time. The&#xD;
      Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare bias, precision and limits of agreement (LOA) of&#xD;
      both devices. Trending ability of CO changes was assessed by a modified 4 quadrant plot&#xD;
      analysis, within angular limits of agreement considered as acceptable when the mean angle&#xD;
      between both delta CO was less than 30°.&#xD;
