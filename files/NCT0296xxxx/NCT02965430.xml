  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, comparative, and prospective pivotal study to demonstrate that&#xD;
      AL-SENSE can indicate whether wetness sensed by pregnant women may be caused by amniotic&#xD;
      fluid leakage rather than by urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects arriving at the hospital will receive a single AL-SENSE to use until they notice any&#xD;
      wetness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blinded physician will perform a diagnosis according to the standard diagnostic methods&#xD;
      (clinical assessment). The standard diagnostic methods will include the following tests: (1)&#xD;
      Pooling test, (2) Ferning test, (3) pH test by pH paper. A positive Pooling test or positive&#xD;
      result in both the pH test and the Ferning test is defined as a positive clinical assessment.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, comparative, and prospective pivotal study to demonstrate that&#xD;
      AL-SENSE can indicate whether wetness sensed by pregnant women may be caused by amniotic&#xD;
      fluid leakage rather than by urinary incontinence. Subjects arriving at the hospital and&#xD;
      reporting unidentified wetness (undetermined whether this is amniotic fluid leakage or&#xD;
      urinary incontinence) will receive a single AL-SENSE to use up to 12 hours or until they&#xD;
      notice any wetness. The clinician will explain the proper use and handling of the AL-SENSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each case, the blinded clinician will be required to read and record any occurrence of&#xD;
      color change of the AL-SENSE 10 minutes after the AL-SENSE removal and to mark if it changes&#xD;
      color to blue or to green on the designated form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blinded physician (other than the clinician who records the AL-SENSE results) will&#xD;
      perform a diagnosis according to the standard diagnostic methods (clinical assessment). The&#xD;
      standard diagnostic methods will include the following tests: (1) Pooling test, (2) Ferning&#xD;
      test, (3) pH test by pH paper. A positive Pooling test or positive result in both the pH test&#xD;
      and the Ferning test is defined as a positive clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where the AL-SENSE shows positive results but the clinical assessment results are&#xD;
      negative, reference laboratories, or any other standard procedure will check for the&#xD;
      possibility of BV or Trichomonas in addition to the tests noted above.&#xD;
