      AZD7594 is a non steroidal, potent and selective modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      (GR) under development for once daily inhaled treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) and asthma. Abediterol is a novel and selective β2 adrenergic receptor agonist&#xD;
      with the potential for once daily treatment of asthma and COPD in fixed dose combination&#xD;
      (FDC) with an ICS or a novel anti inflammatory (AI) agent. This study will be the first&#xD;
      clinical study for the combination exposure of AZD7594 with abediterol as 2 compounds in FDC&#xD;
      or in free combination via 2 separate dry powder inhalers (DPIs). This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in healthy male subjects to minimize the effects of concomitant disease states or&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZD7594 is a non steroidal, potent and selective modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      (GR) under development for once daily inhaled treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) and asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have not been definitively shown to&#xD;
      decrease the rate of decline in lung function that is typical of COPD. The aim is to develop&#xD;
      AZD7594 as a well tolerated once daily selective inhaled GR modulator with an acceptable side&#xD;
      effect profile compared to conventional ICS on the market. Abediterol is a novel and&#xD;
      selective β2 adrenergic receptor agonist with the potential for once daily treatment of&#xD;
      asthma and COPD in fixed dose combination (FDC) with an ICS or a novel anti inflammatory (AI)&#xD;
      agent Fixed dose ICS/LABA combination treatment is more effective in improving lung function,&#xD;
      health status and reducing exacerbations than the individual components. The long term goal&#xD;
      of abediterol development program in COPD is to investigate it both as a monotherapy and as a&#xD;
      combination therapy in conjunction with an ICS or a novel anti inflammatory agent. This study&#xD;
      will be the first clinical study for the combination exposure of AZD7594 with abediterol as 2&#xD;
      compounds in FDC or in free combination via 2 separate dry powder inhalers (DPIs). This study&#xD;
      will be conducted in healthy male subjects to minimize the effects of concomitant disease&#xD;
      states or medications on study measurements. Subjects will receive all 4 treatments in a&#xD;
      randomized order. Given that the treatment in each period is a single dose of AZD7594, a 21&#xD;
      (±2) day wash out should be adequate to prevent carry over effect to next period. The&#xD;
      abediterol elimination half life is shorter than that of AZD7594. Therefore, a 21 (±2) day&#xD;
      wash out is sufficient for the elimination of both AZD7594 and abediterol. Overall,&#xD;
      pre-clinical and clinical data generated to date with abediterol show expected safety&#xD;
      profile, and support the continued studies with abediterol.&#xD;
