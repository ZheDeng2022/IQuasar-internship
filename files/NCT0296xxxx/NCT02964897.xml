    <textblock>
      Veterans leaving incarceration and re-entering their communities (often described as&#xD;
      &quot;reentry&quot; Veterans) face a number of challenges, including uncertainty about housing,&#xD;
      vulnerability to substance use and relapse, on-going mental health concerns, and often&#xD;
      multiple health conditions require timely continuity of care. The purpose of the project is&#xD;
      to increase support for Veterans post-incarceration through the addition of trained peers&#xD;
      with lived experience of being a Veteran and a history of incarceration. Emphasis will be on&#xD;
      peers who will help link Veterans to Veterans Health Administration (VHA) services, including&#xD;
      housing and healthcare. Peers will provide linkage with Health Care Reentry Veterans program&#xD;
      specialists, transportation to appointments, and support in community reintegration. Peers&#xD;
      will assist reentry veterans to make a successful transition and get and stay engaged in&#xD;
      their care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans leaving incarceration (henceforth, &quot;reentry Veterans&quot;) are among the most&#xD;
      underserved by the VA and thus are an increasingly high priority population. The Bureau of&#xD;
      Justice Statistics estimates that 140,000 Veterans are incarcerated in the U.S. at a given&#xD;
      time, approximately 80% of whom are eligible for VA benefits. Many of these Veterans had&#xD;
      problems with substance use disorders (SUD)(including alcohol) and/or mental health (MH)&#xD;
      issues prior to being incarcerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VA's national Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) program identifies 10,000-15,000&#xD;
      incarcerated Veterans annually preparing to transition back to the community. A HCRV outreach&#xD;
      specialist works with incarcerated VHA-eligible Veterans to establish a post-release plan for&#xD;
      linkage to VHA services. This program, with 1-2 outreach specialists per state, has improved&#xD;
      the connection between reentry Veterans and the VHA. However, the investigators' analyses of&#xD;
      homeless program data linked to VHA administrative data indicate that 43% of eligible HCRV&#xD;
      Veterans do not have a VHA outpatient contact in the first 4 months post incarceration.&#xD;
      Reducing this number is critical given the elevated rates of chronic health conditions, as&#xD;
      well as MH or SUDs in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this gap, the investigators will work with the national HCRV office to implement&#xD;
      an evidence-based peer support intervention to extend the reach and effectiveness of the HCRV&#xD;
      program in linking Veterans to VHA. Peers with incarceration experience are likely to better&#xD;
      understand and connect with Veterans on a personal level than the outreach specialist, and&#xD;
      thus are more likely to maintain contact and link to VHA during the first months&#xD;
      post-release. Peers are gaining popularity in forensic settings (called &quot;forensic peer&#xD;
      specialists&quot;) with civilian populations and would likely be beneficial for a Veteran&#xD;
      population .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct contextual analysis to identify VHA and community reentry resources, and to&#xD;
           describe how reentry Veterans use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implement peer-support, in one state, to link reentry veterans to VHA primary, mental&#xD;
           health, and SUD services. The investigators will use external and internal facilitation&#xD;
           as the implementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spread the peer-support intervention to another, geographically, and contextually&#xD;
           different state.&#xD;
