      Hypercholesterolemia is considered one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular prevention include a class I indication to statins in addition to&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies in patients deemed to be 'high&#xD;
      risk'. Along with non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies, newer approaches&#xD;
      to reduce cholesterol blood levels currently include nutraceuticals, which are compounds&#xD;
      derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions. However, it remains unclear if&#xD;
      nutraceuticals yield additive positive effects other than cholesterol lowering. In&#xD;
      particular, there is evidence that Berberine has cardiovascular protective effects and that,&#xD;
      in vitro, Morus Alba, mulberry fruit, modulates platelet function by inhibiting platelet&#xD;
      activation, thromboxane formation, serotonin secretion, aggregation and thrombus formation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Morus Alba exerts an α-glucosidase inhibitory and antioxidant activity in vitro,&#xD;
      which may reduce postprandial glucose peak, thus improving HbA1c concentration. Accordingly,&#xD;
      we designated a study to evaluate the effects of two commercially available nutraceutical&#xD;
      combined pills [LopiGLIK™, Akademy Pharma, 1 capsule/day containing red yeast rice 220 mg (at&#xD;
      least 3,3 mg of Monacolin K) + Berberine 531,25 mg + Morus Alba 200 mg (at least 4 mg of&#xD;
      Deoxynojirimycin) vs. Armolipid Plus®, Meda Pharma, 1 capsule/day containing Berberis&#xD;
      aristata d.e. 588 mg (equivalent to Berberine chloride 500 mg) + Red yeast rice 200 mg&#xD;
      (equivalent to Monacolin K 3 mg) + Policosanol 10 mg + Folic acid 0.2 mg + Coenzyme Q10 2.0&#xD;
      mg + Astaxanthin 0.5 mg] on lipid and metabolic profile, platelet aggregation, endothelial&#xD;
      function and coronary flow reserve (CFR). For this purpose patients with hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
      not requiring statins or statin intolerant at moderate cardiovascular risk will be subjected&#xD;
      at day 0 and at day 28, after 4 weeks of therapy, to blood sampling to evaluate lipid and&#xD;
      metabolic profile, peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT), platelet aggregation tests with&#xD;
      light transmission aggregometry (LTA), nitric oxide (NO) release, endothelial nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation on platelets. Only for CFR, patients will be further&#xD;
      evaluated also after two hours from the administration of the first dose of nutraceutical&#xD;
      combined pill. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive therapy with LopiGLIK™ or with&#xD;
      Armolipid Plus®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the principal cause of death worldwide. Primary prevention&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease by identifying and treating at-risk individuals remains a major&#xD;
      public-health priority. According to guidelines, the main approach is a healthy life-style,&#xD;
      assisted by pharmaco-therapy. Hypercholesterolemia is considered one of the most important&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular prevention include a class I indication to&#xD;
      statins in addition to non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies in patients&#xD;
      deemed to be 'high risk'. In the real world, however, statin treatment is often discontinued&#xD;
      due to side effects. In addition, statins are not indicated in those subjects deemed to be&#xD;
      'low risk', in whom only non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies are&#xD;
      currently prescribed. Along with non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies,&#xD;
      newer approaches to reduce cholesterol blood levels currently include nutraceuticals, which&#xD;
      are compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions. However, it remains&#xD;
      unclear if nutraceuticals yield additive positive effects other than cholesterol lowering. In&#xD;
      particular, there is evidence that Berberine has cardiovascular protective effects and that,&#xD;
      in vitro, Morus Alba, mulberry fruit, modulates platelet function by inhibiting platelet&#xD;
      activation, thromboxane formation, serotonin secretion, aggregation and thrombus formation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of treatment tolerability (as evaluated by a specific questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for treatment discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Effects on coronary flow reserve (CFR) as evaluated by echocardiocolorDoppler&#xD;
           visualization of coronary flow in the distal left anterior descending artery at rest and&#xD;
           after cold pressure test (CPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will be enrolled (15 in each treatment group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function Endothelial function will be assessed with the flow-mediated dilation&#xD;
      test (FMD) by digital pulse amplitude, using a fingertip PAT as previously described&#xD;
      [Gargiulo P, et al. Int J Cardiol 2013]. The system (Itamar Medical Ltd., Caesarea, Israel)&#xD;
      consists of a finger probe to assess digital volume changes accompanying pulse waves. All&#xD;
      subjects included in the study were maintained without smoking, alcohol or caffeine from the&#xD;
      night before the evaluation. Reactive hyperaemia was measured as a PAT reactive hyperaemic&#xD;
      index (RHI) calculated as the ratio of the average amplitude of the PAT signal over a 1-min&#xD;
      time interval starting 1-min after cuff deflation divided by the average amplitude of the PAT&#xD;
      signal of a 3.5-min time period before cuff inflation (baseline) and normalized to the RHI of&#xD;
      the control arm. Endothelial dysfunction was defined as a RHI &lt;1.68 calculated by the mean&#xD;
      value minus 2 standard deviations of 20 healthy asymptomatic control individuals without&#xD;
      history of cardiovascular disease and without major cardiovascular risk factors as previously&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet function Platelet aggregation will be measured by light transmission aggregometry&#xD;
      (LTA) using a dual channel lumi-aggregometer (model 700; Chrono-Log). Platelets will be&#xD;
      prepared according to a standard procedure. Briefly, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) will be&#xD;
      prepared from blood that was drawn by venipuncture into 3.8% trisodium citrate (w/v)&#xD;
      Vacutainer Blood Collection Tubes. PRP will be obtained by centrifugation of blood at 250 g&#xD;
      at 25°C for 15 minutes. Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) will be obtained by centrifugation of the&#xD;
      rest of the blood at 1400 g at 25°C for 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet aggregation will be monitored at 37°C with constant stirring (1200 rpm) and measured&#xD;
      as the increase in light transmission for 10 minutes, with the addition of adenosine&#xD;
      diphosphate (ADP) 10 μmol/L, collagen 2 μg/ml and arachidonic acid 1 0,5 millimole (mM) as a&#xD;
      proaggregatory stimulus. All measurements will be obtained within 2 hours of sample&#xD;
      collection, and results will be reported as percentage maximum aggregation. Some experiments&#xD;
      will be performed in platelet pre-treated with insulin (15 microIU/mL) for 30 minutes at&#xD;
      37°C. After stimulation, 3 ml of platelet suspension will be centrifuged for 15 minutes at&#xD;
      3000 and the platelet pellet obtained will be used for the measurement of eNOS&#xD;
      phosphorylation and NO levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary flow reserve Standard Doppler echocardiography will be performed using a Vivid Seven&#xD;
      machine (GE, Horten, Norway) in the morning after an overnight fast of 12-14 h; subjects will&#xD;
      be instructed to avoid all coffee-containing drinks and theophylline containing medications,&#xD;
      and to abstain from smoking and heavy exercise from 24 h before the study. The color Doppler&#xD;
      visualization of coronary flow in the distal left anterior descending artery will be obtained&#xD;
      with a 5 megahertz (MHz) shallow-focus phased-array transducer. Doppler sample volume will be&#xD;
      placed on the color signal of the left anterior descending artery, and the spectral pulsed&#xD;
      Doppler signal will be recorded to look for the characteristic biphasic flow pattern with a&#xD;
      larger diastolic and a smaller systolic component both at rest and after cold pressure test&#xD;
      (CPT). Coronary diastolic peak flow velocities (cm/s) as well as heart rate and BP will be&#xD;
      measured at rest and soon after CPT, corresponding to maximal hyperemia. CFR will be&#xD;
      calculated as the ratio of hyperemic-to-resting diastolic peak velocities. The CPT will be&#xD;
      performed according to a standardized protocol, by placing the subject's hand and distal part&#xD;
      of the forearm in an ice water slurry for 3 min. The highest three spectral Doppler signals&#xD;
      will be averaged for each parameter. CFR will be evaluated at baseline, 2 hours after&#xD;
      administration of the first nutraceutical combined pill, and after 28 days of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All images will be recorded on local archives and analyzed off-line by two observers who will&#xD;
      be blinded to the clinical characteristics of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Assuming that the standard deviation of the differences in Endo-PAT&#xD;
      indices for the 2 test days would be 0.5 and that we would want to detect a true difference&#xD;
      in means &gt;0.5 with a paired t test conducted at the 0.05 level of significance, we determined&#xD;
      that a sample of 30 subjects (15 for each group) would provide 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composition and supply of the nutraceutical treatments Capsules of LopiGLIK™ (containing red&#xD;
      yeast rice 220 mg + Berberine 531,25 mg + Morus Alba 200 mg) and of Armolipid Plus®&#xD;
      (containing Berberis aristata d.e. 588 mg (equivalent to Berberine chloride 500 mg) + Red&#xD;
      yeast rice 200 mg (equivalent to Monacolin K 3 mg) + Policosanol 10 mg + Folic acid 0.2 mg +&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 2.0 mg + Astaxanthin 0.5 mg) will be provided free of charge by Akademy Pharma&#xD;
      and Meda Pharma, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration All patients will be treated for a period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Results of the study will be communicated to all participant at the study end.&#xD;
