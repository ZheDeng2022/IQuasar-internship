      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study, evaluating the efficacy of venetoclax in&#xD;
      participants with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic&#xD;
      Lymphoma (SLL) either in presence of 17p deletion (Cohort 1) or those who have failed a&#xD;
      B-receptor signaling pathway inhibitor (BCRI) therapy and who have also failed were&#xD;
      intolerant to or were unable to receive chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) irrespective of 17p status&#xD;
