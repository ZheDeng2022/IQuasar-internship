      This is a community-based cluster randomized control trial aimed to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      lifestyle modification (diet, physical activity, alcohol drinking and smoking) on the&#xD;
      development of dementia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancers, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease in an intermediate risk population in mixed&#xD;
      urban-rural areas of Ubon Ratchathani.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. examine the impact of lifestyle modification on the development of dementia, diabetes,&#xD;
           chronic kidney disease, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease in an intermediate risk population in Ubon Ratchathani&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. examine the economic impact of lifestyle modification on prevention of dementia,&#xD;
           diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease in an intermediate risk population in Ubon Ratchathani&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: community-based cluster randomized control trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: 60 villages randomly selected from mixed urban-rural areas in 15 districts of Ubon&#xD;
      Ratchathani province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 3,600 apparently healthy men and women aged 45-75 years who have resided in&#xD;
      the village selected for at least one year. 4,000 men and women will be approached and&#xD;
      screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and baseline assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After community consent, potential participants will be informed about the details of the&#xD;
      project. For those who are willing to participate, written informed consent will be given&#xD;
      before carrying out all research procedures. Participants will be questioned about their&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, medical and family history, health behaviours including diet,&#xD;
      physical activity, alcohol drinking and smoking. Physical activity will be assess using the&#xD;
      Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and diet will be assessed using 24 hour food&#xD;
      recall. Their cognitive function will be assessed using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE),&#xD;
      Thai version, and clock drawing test and depression test will also be performed. Physical&#xD;
      examination includes weight, height, blood pressure, waist and hip circumference as well as&#xD;
      physical fitness test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples will be collected for the following laboratory tests: Complete blood&#xD;
      count, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fasting plasma glucose,&#xD;
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and estimated&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic&#xD;
      transaminase (SGPT), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Ca++, PO4-, urine creatinine/albumin,&#xD;
      urine sodium &amp; potassium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in 30 villages in the intervention group will be given 4x4 lifestyle&#xD;
      modification intervention, which will address four health behaviors (diet, physical activity,&#xD;
      alcohol drinking and smoking) at four different levels: individual, household, knowledge&#xD;
      management and community levels. A new computer program called 'iActive' will be used. The&#xD;
      program was adapted from the GPAQ with add-on functions to allow real-time assessment and&#xD;
      presentation of the energy expenditure along with recommendations specific to each&#xD;
      individual. Dietary counseling will be given individually following assessment using a new&#xD;
      dietary assessment program called Dietary Assessment Scanning Calculator (DISC). Home visit&#xD;
      will be done every 3 months by responsible nurses and village health volunteers in order to&#xD;
      assess and give simple counseling about health behaviors. Knowledge management will be&#xD;
      undertaken through meetings and forums between participants and villages with support from&#xD;
      trained nurses. Situation analysis and agreed community action will be encouraged to address&#xD;
      community problems concerning four health behaviors. A combination of these intensive&#xD;
      interventions will be given for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and outcome ascertainment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years after baseline assessment for the&#xD;
      development of the outcomes of interest. In each follow-up, procedures identical to baseline&#xD;
      assessment will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Incident dementia Incident dementia will be ascertained by a battery of&#xD;
      screening test (MMSE, clock drawing and depression tests) and those with abnormal test&#xD;
      results will be referred to neuro-medicine specialists at the regional hospital for further&#xD;
      investigations and diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. chronic kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. waist circumference&#xD;

        8. blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Lipids (total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and estimated LDL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MMSE scores or Cognitive decline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
