    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether molecularly tailored therapy can improve&#xD;
      the efficacy of treatment when compared to standard chemotherapy combinations for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving their second line of therapy for metastatic&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized Phase II trial for patients with metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The trial is designed to compare the outcomes (primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS)) for patients who receive molecularly-tailored therapy (MTT)&#xD;
      to those who receive physician discretion standard of care (SOC). To successfully allow for&#xD;
      this assessment, and minimize confounding variables, we will need to ensure that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is enough tissue for the molecular profiling to occur. Thus, only patients with&#xD;
           adequate tumor tissue will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is enough time for the molecular profiling to be completed; for the medical review&#xD;
           panel (MRP) to render a determination on the optimal molecularly-guided therapy; and for&#xD;
           the treating physician to obtain access to therapies, particularly if the MRP-determined&#xD;
           therapy includes an off-label treatment OR a clinical trial. We anticipate this process&#xD;
           will take a minimum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors will inevitably lead to a selection bias towards patients with a better&#xD;
      prognosis. However, the randomization design should mitigate this selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who are actively on (or about to initiate)&#xD;
      first-line therapy, who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in Section 3&#xD;
      will be enrolled. For all enrolled patients, at the time of enrollment, the treating&#xD;
      physician will be asked to submit the planned second line SOC treatment he/she would&#xD;
      recommend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to streamline accrual, and based on data that demonstrate that the tumor genetic&#xD;
      profile does not change significantly overtime in patients with pancreatic cancer, archived&#xD;
      tumor tissue may be used for determination of MTT. The archived tissue may be, for example,&#xD;
      core needle biopsies obtained at the time of establishing the diagnosis of metastatic&#xD;
      disease; or for example, a surgical specimen obtained prior to the identification of&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Archived tissue may be used as long as there is sufficient tissue for&#xD;
      full molecular testing. Of note, even if sufficient archived tissue is available for testing,&#xD;
      patients will still be required to undergo a new biopsy to obtain fresh tissue for ex vivo&#xD;
      analysis, prior to initiation of second line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo tumor testing, as detailed next. If a patient undergoes tumor&#xD;
      testing but his/her disease progresses on first-line therapy prior to an MRP-determined&#xD;
      therapeutic plan, then the patient will be considered a screen failure, and will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, for all patients for whom adequate tissue is available for profiling, an MRP-determined&#xD;
      therapeutic plan will be developed. This process of determining the MRP-determined&#xD;
      therapeutic plan will be kept blinded to the treating physician (i.e. each treating physician&#xD;
      will NOT be involved in the determination of MTT for his/her patient) - but once the plan is&#xD;
      available, the patients will be randomized to either MTT or SOC (See Figure 4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored closely while on first-line therapy. For patients who are&#xD;
      randomized to MTT, the MRP-determined therapeutic plan will be unblinded to the treating&#xD;
      physician, and preparation for MTT can begin, including acquiring access to off label&#xD;
      therapy, if required. Patients who are randomized to SOC therapy will receive the SOC&#xD;
      treatment initially recommended by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient experiences disease progression on first-line therapy, they will receive MTT&#xD;
      vs. SOC as second-line therapy, according to their randomization. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      will receive second-line therapy until disease progression or therapy intolerance (with dose&#xD;
      and schedule modifications as needed). Response assessment will occur approximately every 8&#xD;
      weeks (based on the calendar) as determined from the time of the initiation of therapy. All&#xD;
      patients will have the option to undergo a repeat tumor biopsy upon disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients on SOC therapy experience progressive disease on second-line therapy, the&#xD;
      MRP-determined therapeutic plan will unblinded to the treating physician, and MTT therapy can&#xD;
      be administered as third-line therapy (crossover to MTT). Third-line therapy can also&#xD;
      incorporate correlative analyses on the patient tumor samples tested ex vivo (detailed below)&#xD;
      if these results are available at the time that third line therapy is required. As this may&#xD;
      impact the overall survival assessment, the primary endpoint is disease progression at 4&#xD;
      months (PFS4mos), and the primary objective is to compare the PFS4mos for MTT treated vs. SOC&#xD;
      treated patients. We hypothesize that MTT will improve the PFS4mos from 50% for SOC (based on&#xD;
      historical data), to ≥75%. We anticipate having 80% power to detect an improvement in the&#xD;
      PFS4mos from 50% to ≥75% (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5), assuming a 1-sided significance level of&#xD;
      0.05 and an accrual rate of 4 patients per month (see statistics below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, the treating physician may opt to incorporate the molecular data to select&#xD;
      third-line therapy for patients whose disease progresses on second-line MTT therapy. The&#xD;
      results of ongoing analyses and testing of the patient tumor samples, ex vivo including the&#xD;
      CRCs, organoids, and the zebrafish avatars may be available at the time that the patient&#xD;
      requires third-line therapy. If so, the treating physician may incorporate the results of&#xD;
      these analyses into the decision plan for third-line therapy. These patients will continue to&#xD;
      be followed longitudinally for survival, but there will be no formal comparison of third line&#xD;
      therapy outcomes with the &quot;crossover&quot; group.&#xD;
