  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have demonstrated that they can reliably identify an optimum heart rate&#xD;
      range for contractility of the left ventricle in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).&#xD;
      They have also demonstrated in an acute cross-over study that keeping the heart rate in this&#xD;
      range (versus standard rate-response programming) in patients with CHF is associated with&#xD;
      increased exercise time on a treadmill (around 60s or 10%). They now want to explore in a&#xD;
      randomised, placebo-controlled trial whether optimal programming versus standard&#xD;
      rate-response programming for 6 months leads to appreciable improvements in exercise time and&#xD;
      quality of life, while having no adverse effects on left ventricular function and battery&#xD;
      longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients with CHF and a pacemaker will undergo the non-invasive echocardiographic&#xD;
      assessment to establish the force frequency relationship and the optimal heart rate for&#xD;
      contractility. They will then perform a treadmill walk test and fill out a quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire. They will then be randomised to optimal rate-response settings or standard&#xD;
      rate response settings and followed up at 6 months at which point the tests will be repeated.&#xD;

      Design: This will be a randomised, double-blind 'placebo' controlled trial of optimised&#xD;
      programming versus standard rate-response settings, aiming to determine whether the short&#xD;
      term improvements translate into longer term benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants: 60 adult patients (&gt;18years) aiming for 50 matched datasets (25 in each&#xD;
      arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Patients attending the heart failure clinic, the pacemaker clinic or&#xD;
      previous participants in the acute cross-over study (pilot data 2) will be approached with a&#xD;
      standard letter and information sheet and then a telephone call to make sure any remaining&#xD;
      questions are answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to participate will attend the clinical research facility (CRF) and will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a consent form. Each patient will have a standard device check, check of their&#xD;
      demographic data, and co-morbidities. The investigators will record a resting cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound, and, in those who did not participate in the pilot study (or did so more than six&#xD;
      months previously), we will measure the force frequency relationship (FFR) as described to&#xD;
      determine critical heart rate (HR), and the optimal range of HR rise. All images will be&#xD;
      stored for offline analysis. Participants will then be asked to do a symptom-limited walk&#xD;
      test on the treadmill (until they cannot do any more). At this first visit, participants will&#xD;
      also complete a quality of life questionnaire. All of these activities will take place in the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Facility at Leeds General Infirmary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Each patient will then be randomised to either optimised programming (n=30) as&#xD;
      predicted by their force-frequency curve or standard settings (n=30). In the optimised group,&#xD;
      programming will keep heart rates below the critical HR. Randomisation will be by a random&#xD;
      number generator and programming will be undertaken by one of my colleagues to maintain&#xD;
      blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Each patient will be called at one month to check that they are tolerating any&#xD;
      changes and will then be invited back at 6 months for a repeat resting echocardiogram,&#xD;
      treadmill walk test and quality of life assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data: All data will be stored on a bespoke Excel spreadsheet on an LTHT server in a&#xD;
      password-protected folder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: The effects of heart rate programming that optimises heart rate for&#xD;
      contractility on change in treadmill-based walk distance over six months in patients with&#xD;
      heart failure and a pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: 1) the safety of pacemaker programming optimised for heart rate in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure and a pacemaker, 2) the effect of this programming on change of&#xD;
      quality of life at 6 months 3) the effect of this programming on change in cardiac function&#xD;
      at 6 months.&#xD;
