  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center open-label pilot study will enroll 15 non-ambulatory children with&#xD;
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy at least 8 years of age and who demonstrate pre-clinical&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (defined as a cardiac ejection fraction &gt;55% with abnormal LV strain by&#xD;
      cardiac MRI). They will receive (+)-epicatechin at one of three doses during an 8-week&#xD;
      dose-ranging study with assessments at baseline, 2 Weeks, 4weeks, and 8 weeks. The study will&#xD;
      determine optimal dosing for future cardiac efficacy studies based on serum / plasma&#xD;
      biomarker response using follistatin: myostatin ratio, nitrite/nitrate ratio, cardiac&#xD;
      troponins and cardiac BNP. Secondary endpoints will include additional biomarker assessments&#xD;
      by SOMAscanTM, cardiac functional evaluations by cardiac MRI (LV strain), and echocardiogram&#xD;
      (LV strain by speckle tracking) and measures of strength, range of motion and mobility, and&#xD;
      clinical safety assessments. Results of secondary endpoint analysis will be used to refine&#xD;
      design of subsequent clinical trials powered to detect changes in clinical outcomes.&#xD;
