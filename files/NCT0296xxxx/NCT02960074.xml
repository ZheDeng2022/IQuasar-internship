  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral encapsulated fecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of peanut allergy. In this research the&#xD;
      investigators would like to learn more about ways to treat peanut allergies. There is&#xD;
      currently no known cure for peanut allergy. The primary aim is to assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of oral FMT in patients with peanut allergy aged 18-40 years.&#xD;

      This is a study of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of peanut allergy.&#xD;
      The primary aim is to assess safety and tolerability of oral encapsulated FMT in patients&#xD;
      with peanut allergy aged 18-40 years. A total of 15 patients with peanut allergy will be&#xD;
      enrolled after they fail a screening food challenge to peanut. 10 patients will be given oral&#xD;
      encapsulated frozen FMT over 1-2 days. 5 additional patients will receive antibiotics prior&#xD;
      to being given oral encapsulated frozen FMT over 1-2 days. Patients will undergo a second and&#xD;
      third food challenge after receiving FMT. The expected duration of the study for each subject&#xD;
      will be one year. Stool collection, skin testing and blood samples will be done serially.&#xD;
