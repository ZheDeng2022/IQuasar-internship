  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by blast effects of explosive devices has been&#xD;
      called the &quot;signature injury&quot; of soldiers who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.&#xD;
      mTBI can also occur from impact or hitting the head on an object or the ground. Although&#xD;
      termed &quot;mild&quot; in comparison to major brain injuries, people with mTBI can have problems with&#xD;
      their memory and concentration. People with mTBI can also find they are more irritable, have&#xD;
      more anxiety, and have trouble with their mood and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if a medication called prazosin can help treat chronic&#xD;
      headaches in people with mTBI. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved prazosin&#xD;
      for treating people with high blood pressure. At this time, the FDA has not approved prazosin&#xD;
      in the treatment of mTBI or headaches. Some people who have posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) and have been taking prazosin for their medical conditions or who have taken it in&#xD;
      research studies have said they have fewer headaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale: Headaches following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are common,&#xD;
      can be refractory to standard therapies, and may persist and worsen to become a debilitating&#xD;
      chronic pain syndrome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the centrally acting alpha-1&#xD;
      adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist drug prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for chronic&#xD;
      posttraumatic headaches (PTHAs). The impetus for this study comes from a large open-label&#xD;
      case series in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with mTBI and PTHAs and data from a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial evaluating use of prazosin for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      in active-duty Servicemembers (SMs). Findings from these studies showed that in addition to&#xD;
      decreasing PTSD-related symptoms and improving sleep quality, prazosin decreased the&#xD;
      frequency and severity of headaches, which were common in the study populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives, Specific Aims, and Hypotheses: The objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for persistent PTHAs, which will be&#xD;
      accomplished by conducting a randomized placebo-controlled double blind trial of prazosin vs.&#xD;
      placebo in active-duty SMs and Veterans who were in military service at any time from October&#xD;
      7, 2001 to the present with persistent PTHAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of prazosin compared to placebo on headache&#xD;
           frequency, headache severity and duration, use of abortive/analgesic medications, and&#xD;
           headache-related disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of prazosin on sleep disturbance, PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
           depressive symptoms, alcohol consumption, global cognitive function, health-related&#xD;
           quality of life, and global clinical status.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  HAs either 1) must last 4 or more hours a day and reach a moderate to severe&#xD;
                  intensity at any point during the headache, or 2) may be of any severity or&#xD;

             accompanied by lightheadedness], chronic renal or hepatic failure, or acute&#xD;
             pancreatitis. The eligibility of potential participants having acute serious and/or&#xD;
             chronic medical illnesses other than those listed will be evaluated on a case-by-case&#xD;
             basis by a study physician, PA-C, or ARNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist (including but not limited to alfuzosin,&#xD;
             doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, terazosin) for any purpose in the 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             initial screen (P1) visit and prohibited throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy or previous adverse reaction to prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active psychosis or psychotic disorder, severe depression (as determined per clinician&#xD;
             prescriber judgment), severe psychiatric instability or severe situational life crisis&#xD;
             (including evidence of being actively suicidal or homicidal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)&#xD;
             criteria for any Substance Use Disorder except caffeine-related disorders, or&#xD;
             tobacco-related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of delirium within the prior 3 months, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, psychotic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participation in a HA support group or other activity such as meditation or yoga&#xD;
             intended to mitigate HA or other chronic pain must be stable at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             beginning the initial screen (P1) visit and may not be started during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to record HA data for at least 80% of days during the Screening Period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not suitable for study per clinician judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medication-and other Treatment-Related Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of HA rescue or symptom-relieving medications will be allowed during the&#xD;
             study. This includes triptans, ergotamines, opioids, simple analgesics (e.g.&#xD;
             acetaminophen, aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDS], and combination&#xD;
             analgesics. Their use will be recorded on the concurrent medication CRF during the&#xD;
             Preliminary Screening Period (P1) and throughout the remainder of the study.&#xD;
             Randomization of participants will be stratified based on whether their use of HA&#xD;
             medications meets ICHD-3 beta criteria for overuse of these medications, as described&#xD;
             in section 5.5 below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Opioid Medications: Use of opioids for treatment of HA or non-HA-related pain or for&#xD;
             any other purpose is allowed during the study. Any opioid use would ideally be&#xD;
             excluded due to potential confounding effects on interpretation of response to&#xD;
             treatment. However, in this population, particularly in Veterans with chronic pain or&#xD;
             undergoing minor orthopedic or dental procedures, opioid use is common. Use of&#xD;
             opioids, including frequency and dose, will be recorded on the concurrent medication&#xD;
             CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannabis: The use of cannabis in any form is not excluded unless its use meets&#xD;
             criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. All use of cannabis will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other Medications: Participants who are using other medications or treatments on a&#xD;
             routine basis must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the Preliminary&#xD;
             Screening Period (P1), and must intend to continue the medication at the same regimen&#xD;
             for the duration of the trial unless lack of efficacy, safety, or tolerability&#xD;
             dictates otherwise. The following medications and treatments are not excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychoactive drugs (for example, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines,&#xD;
                  antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antihypertensive medications (including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers,&#xD;
                  angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor&#xD;
                  blockers),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of magnesium in any dose that is prescribed for the purpose of HA&#xD;
                  prevention or treatment. The incidental use of magnesium in multi-vitamins,&#xD;
                  laxatives, etc. is permissible but must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormones (for example, testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone) in any form.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Onabotulinum toxin A and nerve block injections for the purpose of HA prevention&#xD;
                  are permissible if the treatment response has been stable during the two most&#xD;
                  recent treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The &quot;as-needed&quot; (prn) use of any non-exclusionary medications is allowed;&#xD;
                  however, such use must be discussed with a clinician prescriber and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of butalbital in any form within 4 weeks of beginning the Preliminary&#xD;
             Screening Period (P1) through the end of the participant's study involvement is&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have been taking trazodone will undergo a 2-week washout period&#xD;
             before the Preliminary Screening Period (P1 visit). Combining prazosin and trazodone&#xD;
             may increase the risk of priapism. We have decided to begin the washout period before&#xD;
             the Preliminary Screening Period in order to remove any confounding variables while on&#xD;
             the headache log and actigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and avanafil (Stendra)&#xD;
             will not be permitted during the study drug dose Titration Period, because of&#xD;
             increased risk of hypotension in combination with alpha-1 blockers, but will be&#xD;
             allowed at half the usual starting dose following the study drug dose Titration&#xD;
             Period, per VA prescribing guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of supplements containing nitrates and supplements containing stimulants (such as&#xD;
             ephedra) are exclusionary in the two weeks prior to initial screen (P1) visit and&#xD;
             prohibited throughout the study. Participants who take these supplements will be asked&#xD;
             to discontinue them for a minimum of two weeks before the Preliminary Screening Period&#xD;
             (P1 visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescribed stimulants (such as amphetamine or dextroamphetamine containing&#xD;
             medications) is exclusionary in the 2 weeks prior to the initial screen (P1) visit and&#xD;
             prohibited throughout the study. Participants who take these medications will be asked&#xD;
             to discontinue them for a minimum of 2 weeks before the Preliminary Screening Period.&#xD;
