  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three arm Phase I study within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium&#xD;
      (PNOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look to determine the safety and recommended phase 2 dose of the modified&#xD;
      measles virus (MV-NIS) in children and young adults with recurrent medulloblastoma or&#xD;
      atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase I study to assess the safety of administering&#xD;
      MV-NIS directly into the tumor bed (for locally recurrent medulloblastoma or ATRT patients)&#xD;
      or into the subarachnoid space (for disseminated recurrent medulloblastoma or ATRT patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For locally recurrent patients (patients in the first arm) MV-NIS will be directly&#xD;
      administered into the tumor bed following a standard of care surgical resection. For patients&#xD;
      with disseminated recurrence (patients in the second or third arm), MV-NIS will be injected&#xD;
      via lumbar puncture (LP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the second arm will receive a one-time administration of MV-NIS. Patients will be&#xD;
      closely monitored for 30 days after injection, and then followed for evaluation of 6 month&#xD;
      progressive free survival and overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the third arm will receive two administrations of MV-NIS. Patients will be&#xD;
      closely monitored for 56 days after injection, and then followed for evaluation of 4 month&#xD;
      progressive free survival.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of the modified measles virus will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events. Subjects will be monitored for adverse events via scheduled laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, and physical examinations. The severity of any toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0. We will aggregate this information into the number of subjects with adverse events that are related to study treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recommended Phase 2 Dose.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be the dose level at which 6 evaluable patients have been treated and at most 1 patient experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next highest dose level is too toxic or we have reached the protocol defined highest dose level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Any eligible patient that receives MV-NIS will be considered evaluable for clinical efficacy. The objective response criteria is that partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) must be confirmed at least 8 weeks after the initial PR or CR criteria is met.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who are still progression free at the time of analysis, PFS will be censored at the last contact date. PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The distribution of MV-NIS</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who consent to this optional study will receive an injection of technetium-99m (TC-99m) (pertechnetate) and then undergo SPECT imaging to determine MV-NIS distribution after local injection or after administration into the subarachnoid space.</description>
