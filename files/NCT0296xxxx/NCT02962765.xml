      Prospective, multinational, non-interventional post-authorisation study to collect additional&#xD;
      clinical data and to ensure consistency in the long-term between the outcome from&#xD;
      pre-authorisation clinical studies (in 135 previously treated paediatric and adult patients)&#xD;
      and routine clinical practice. Besides aspects such as general product safety and efficacy,&#xD;
      there will be a focus on immunogenicity, particularly on inhibitor development. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of FVIII inhibitor will be based on clinical observations and confirmed by FVIII inhibitor&#xD;
      testing in the laboratory.&#xD;

    <description>At the end of a BE, treatment efficacy was to be assessed either by the patient (or the patient's parent or legal guardian) or by the treating physician in case of on-site treatment using a 4-point scale including the four items 'excellent,' 'good,' moderate,' and 'none.' Excellent result was defined as abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single injection. Good was definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8-12 hours after an injection requiring up to 2 injections for complete resolution. Moderate was probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first injection requiring more than two injections for complete resolution. None was no improvement after 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 injections for complete resolution.</description>

    <description>At the end of the postoperative period, an overall assessment of the efficacy of treatment in the pre-, peri-, and postoperative periods using the 'excellent,' 'good,' moderate,' and 'none' scale will be done jointly by the surgeon and the hematologist. Based on this assessment, efficacy ratings assessed as either 'excellent' or 'good' will be considered 'successfully treated'.</description>

        The goal is to collect data on 200 previously treated male patients of any age with&#xD;
        haemophilia (FVIII:C ≤ 2%). Patients from pre-authorisation studies can be followed up to&#xD;
        at least 100 EDs. Newly enrolled patients have to be treated and followed for at least 100&#xD;
        EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Of the 200 enrolled patients, at least 100 patients should have severe haemophilia A&#xD;
             (FVIII:C &lt; 1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Of the 200 enrolled patients, approx. 60 patients should be &lt; 12 years of age. At&#xD;
             least 10 patients should be aged between 14-18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe haemophilia A after successful immune tolerance induction (ITI)&#xD;
             can also be included; the proportion of these ITI patients should not exceed 25% of&#xD;
             the entire cohort.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Haemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤ 2%) based on medical history; at least 100 patients should&#xD;

             the last 50 EDs or the last 2 years per patient to confirm treatment modality (i.e.,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Inhibitor negative (&lt; 0.6 BU) at study entry as confirmed by a recovery test with&#xD;
             previous FVIII product and inhibitor test in a central laboratory&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Decision to prescribe Human-cl rhFVIII before enrolment into the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) except FVIII IMP&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or patients planning to undergo treatment&#xD;
             with any IMP other than Human-cl rhFVIII are not eligible for enrolment into the&#xD;

          <description>A total of 80 patients were enrolled in this study.&#xD;
Of the 80 patients enrolled into the study, 2 were excluded because they had not received any treatment with Nuwiq, leaving 78 patients in the full analysis population (FAS) and safety population (SAF).&#xD;
Of these, 77 patients were part of the prophylactic treatment group and 2 patients were in the on-demand treatment group.&#xD;
One patient changed regimen from on-demand treatment to prophylactic treatment and back to on-demand treatment while in the study. Corresponding data for this patient in included in both the prophylactic and on-demand treatment groups.&#xD;
The treatment regimen, doses, dosing intervals and dose adjustments were determined at the discretion of the treating physician. A usual dose for long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A is 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.&#xD;
Of the 78 total patients, 17 were excluded for the reasons summarized below.</description>

        <description>At the end of a BE, treatment efficacy was to be assessed either by the patient (or the patient's parent or legal guardian) or by the treating physician in case of on-site treatment using a 4-point scale including the four items 'excellent,' 'good,' moderate,' and 'none.' Excellent result was defined as abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single injection. Good was definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8-12 hours after an injection requiring up to 2 injections for complete resolution. Moderate was probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first injection requiring more than two injections for complete resolution. None was no improvement after 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 injections for complete resolution.</description>

        <title>Assessment of the Efficacy of Treatment of Bleeding Episodes (BEs) Based on a 4-point Efficacy Scale</title>
        <description>At the end of a BE, treatment efficacy was to be assessed either by the patient (or the patient's parent or legal guardian) or by the treating physician in case of on-site treatment using a 4-point scale including the four items 'excellent', 'good', 'moderate', and 'none.'&#xD;
Excellent result was defined as abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single injection. Good was definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8-12 hours after an injection requiring up to 2 injections for complete resolution. Moderate was probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first injection requiring more than two injections for complete resolution. None was no improvement after 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 injections for complete resolution.</description>
        <time_frame>Recorded from screening through to study completion (minimum 1.7 months; maximum 31.6 months)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was only performed on patients in the prophylactic treatment group who experienced bleeding episode that required treatment with Nuwiq. Of the 77 patients in the prophylactic treatment group, 48 patients experienced a BE that required treatment with Nuwiq and were assessed using the 4-point efficacy scale</population>
