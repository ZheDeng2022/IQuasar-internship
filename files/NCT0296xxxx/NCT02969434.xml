      Sleep impairments reliably predict worsened chronic pain and correlate with visual analogue&#xD;
      pain scores. Therapies targeted at improving sleep, including cognitive behavioral therapy,&#xD;
      improve both sleep quality and also pain management, and reduce interference of pain with&#xD;
      daily activities. As effective pain relief decreases sleep disturbances, improvement in sleep&#xD;
      has been proposed as marker of effective pain management. Hence it is useful to evaluate&#xD;
      sleep disturbances in chronic pain population both in clinical and research setting. There&#xD;
      are many tools to evaluate sleep quality; the routinely used simple brief pain inventory&#xD;
      (BPI) has a single question about sleep. We will compare three dedicated sleep measures to&#xD;
      the BPI in patients with chronic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of sleep disturbances including insomnia is high in chronic pain patients and&#xD;
      is known to contribute to the maintenance of chronic pain. A large survey estimated that&#xD;
      chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity occurs in 19% of adult Europeans, and that 50%&#xD;
      of this cohort reported feeling tired all the time. Studies using specific sleep assessment&#xD;
      tools have found that up to 50% of patients complain of poor sleep and 40% have clinically&#xD;
      defined insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though association between sleep and pain is well established, it is still unclear about the&#xD;
      direction of causality. A recent narrative review has found that sleep impairments reliably&#xD;
      predict worsening of chronic pain and correlate with higher visual analogue pain scores.&#xD;
      Therapies targeted at improving sleep hygiene, including cognitive behavioral therapy, have&#xD;
      been shown to not only improve sleep quality, but also pain management and reduce the degree&#xD;
      to which pain interfered with daily activities. As effective pain relief decreases sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, improvement in sleep has been proposed as marker of effective pain management.8&#xD;
      Hence it is useful to evaluate sleep disturbances in chronic pain population both in clinical&#xD;
      and research setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are at least 30 different sleep evaluation scales and questionnaires. Previous works&#xD;
      have used several different tools to quantify the prevalence and severity of sleep&#xD;
      disturbance in chronic pain patients. The most commonly used tools are the Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index (PSQI) and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale. The PSQI has an&#xD;
      extensive body of evidence in detecting primary insomnia, demonstrating a high test-retest&#xD;
      reliability and contains domains which are of importance when measuring sleep disturbance in&#xD;
      chronic pain. However, none of the aforementioned tools directly assesses the impact of pain&#xD;
      on sleep, and are as such not capable of establishing a direct link between sleep disturbance&#xD;
      and chronic pain. Chronic Pain Sleep Inventory (CPSI) and Pain and Sleep Questionnaires (PSQ)&#xD;
      were developed to assess the impact of pain on pain related sleep disturbances. These&#xD;
      multidimensional items were abbreviated to Sleep Pain Index (SPI) and Pain and Sleep&#xD;
      three-item index (PSQ-3) and specifically targeted at assessing sleep disturbance in patients&#xD;
      with chronic pain. Both SPI and PSQ- 3 have been tested for their reliability and validity.&#xD;
      The Verran Snyder-Halpern (VSH) scale uses visual analogue scales to describe sleep quality,&#xD;
      latency and disturbance but none of these questionnaires have been widely adopted either in&#xD;
      research setting or clinical practice. Though the reasons are not known, people may find&#xD;
      multi-items dedicated questionnaires as cumbersome and overwhelming. One way to circumvent&#xD;
      the issue is to utilize a single item questionnaire or even use a single item on the widely&#xD;
      used pain questionnaire. Single item numerical rating scales to measure sleep quality have&#xD;
      shown modest correlation with the MOS sleep scale and may be of particular benefit when&#xD;
      repeated measurements are used due to their simple nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is one of the most widely used measurement tool and is advocated&#xD;
      as one of the core outcomes tool for pain clinical trials. BPI provides an overall picture of&#xD;
      pain status and its interference with general health and serves to help monitor response to&#xD;
      treatment with time. Included in the BPI is a single numerically rated score assessing the&#xD;
      degree to which pain interferes with sleep. This item has the potential to detect the impact&#xD;
      of pain on pain related sleep disturbances thereby insomnia and therefore lead to treatment.&#xD;
      Validation of this commonly used questionnaire BPI, against a formal sleep assessment tools&#xD;
      would not only allow identification of patients with significant sleep disturbance and&#xD;
      facilitate prompt targeted treatment but also help to evaluate the pain treatment.&#xD;
