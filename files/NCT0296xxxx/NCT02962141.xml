      Dilatation Catheter (APERTO) compared with the Balloon Dilatation catheter (OHICHO II) for&#xD;
      the treatment of Arteriovenous Fistulae Stenosis in patients undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled, open-label, superiority study. A&#xD;
      total of 160 subjects will be enrolled from 10 sites in China. All subjects enrolled will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the test group (APERTO group, n=80) and the control group (OHICHO II&#xD;
      group, n=80) with randomized allocation ratio of 1:1. Subjects in the test group and the&#xD;
      control group will be treated with APERTO OTW or OHICHO II respectively.&#xD;
