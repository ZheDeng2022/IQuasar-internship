      Design A single-blind two-group longitudinal experimental study will be conducted to compare&#xD;
      a story-centred care intervention program with a health consultation control condition. After&#xD;
      receiving informed consents, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment conditions, either a story-centred care intervention program or a health&#xD;
      consultation control condition. Each intervention will be conducted for 4 weeks. Measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained at the following time points: pre-intervention (baseline), post-intervention&#xD;
      and 1-month- and 3-month follow-up (see Figure 1). Outcome measurements include the following&#xD;
      parameters: 15-item geriatric depression scale test (GDS-15), short portable mental status&#xD;
      questionnaire (SPMSQ) , WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), blood pressure and 5-minute&#xD;
      HRV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will be recruited from January 2013 to August 2013 via posters and&#xD;
      notifications during routine activities and gatherings. The study design and protocols will&#xD;
      be reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the participating hospital. At&#xD;
      the content session, all assessments and procedures will be fully explained. When&#xD;
      participants express their interest in participating in the study, they need to leave their&#xD;
      contact information at the front desk. The research team will contact the participants as&#xD;
      soon as a list is compiled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of eligibility and randomisation Participants will beconsidered eligible if they&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria. All participants will be informed that they can withdraw&#xD;
      themselves from the study at any time. Before randomisation, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      answer a few questionnaires and will be subjected to the 5-minute HRV test. The&#xD;
      questionnaires include demographic characteristics, the 15-item geriatric depression scale&#xD;
      test (GDS-15) and SPMSQ. Randomisation will be conducted using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomisation scheme (SPSS software Version 21.0). Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the story-centred care intervention program or to the health consultation control condition.&#xD;
      The random allocation sequence will be set in a uniform 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Participants will be randomly assigned to either the story-centred care intervention&#xD;
      program or the health consultation control condition. They will be informed not to disclose&#xD;
      their randomisation status to anyone. The outcome evaluator will be blinded to the assigned&#xD;
      condition of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants will randomly be assigned to the experimental (intervention) group&#xD;
      (IG) or the control group (CG) using SPSS software (Version 21.0). Participants in the IG&#xD;
      will receive the story-centred care intervention program once a week for 4 weeks; the CG will&#xD;
      receive health consultation from researchers once a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Story-centred care intervention program Participants randomised to the IG will be made to&#xD;
      participate in a 4-week long story-centred care intervention program conducted by a trained&#xD;
      researcher. A trained researcher will facilitate the six-step intervention. Step 1 involves&#xD;
      gathering stories about complicated health challenges of the participants. the investigators&#xD;
      will guide the participants in describing their health challenges using elements of a story.&#xD;
      The challenges include current health problems, past experiences related to these problems&#xD;
      and expectations for dealing with these problems. During Step 2, connections of the health&#xD;
      challenges to existing literature will be made and a story is reconstructed. In order to&#xD;
      ensure that the health challenge is a true reflection of participants' condition, the&#xD;
      investigators identifies the complicated health challenges of the participants through&#xD;
      existing literature and helps them revise the story to identify their most important and&#xD;
      influential health challenges. Step 3 determines key moments of the health challenges by&#xD;
      understanding the participants' feelings about these challenges. Step 4 involves accepting&#xD;
      the story episodes, which will be recorded and consolidated into a theme for the entire&#xD;
      story. In Step 5, the researcher guides the participant to describe approaches that can&#xD;
      motivate him/her to resolve existing health challenges. In Step 6, the participant is&#xD;
      encouraged to resolve the challenges by generating new meanings of life to improve their&#xD;
      overall well-being. During the process, the researcher does not interfere but asks questions&#xD;
      to help the participants clarify vague parts of the health story.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health consultation control condition Participants randomised to the control group will&#xD;
      receive a health consultation from a trained researcher once a week for 4 weeks. The health&#xD;
      consultation will be tailored to the participants' needs. Based on a previous study, the&#xD;
      health consultation will include pain management, healthy nutrition, how to make best use of&#xD;
      medical services and education and counselling for individual health-related concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The investigators will use descriptive statistics (mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, frequency and percentage) to analyse participant characteristics and primary&#xD;
      outcomes. Mann-Whitney U test is used to examine the continuous variables between groups and&#xD;
      chi-square test (or Fisher's Exact tests where appropriate) is used to examine the&#xD;
      categorical variables between groups. Generalised estimating equation (GEE) is used to&#xD;
      examine the effects of the story-centred care intervention program on the improvement of&#xD;
      depression, cognitive function, quality of life, blood pressure and HRV. The SPSS 21.0&#xD;
      software package, Chinese version, will be used to analyse the data. All tests are two-tailed&#xD;
      and α &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Sample size will be estimated using a repeated-measures MANOVA&#xD;
      approach, within-between interaction in G*power 3.0.10 with power = 0.8, type 1 error α =&#xD;
      0.05 and effect size η2 = 0.43. We will require a sample size of 64 (32 per group) rising to&#xD;
      70 accounting for a 10% loss in follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome 15-item geriatric depression scale test (GDS-15): The GDS-15 test assesses&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. The GDS-15 test is a self-administered questionnaire with a yes/no&#xD;
      response. This study used the Chinese version of the GDS-15 test. A higher score indicates&#xD;
      more severe depression with a sensitivity of 70.6% and a specificity of 70.1% for older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome The short portable mental status questionnaire (SPMSQ): The SPMSQ assesses&#xD;
      disorientation, personal profile, short- and long-term memory and computing ability. The&#xD;
      number of incorrect answers indicates the level of cognitive function. This study uses the&#xD;
      Chinese version of the SPMSQ. To suit the context of this study, some items are deleted,&#xD;
      resulting in a 10-item questionnaire scored as follows: 0-2, intact cognitive function; 3-4,&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment and ≥5, moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The test-retest&#xD;
      reliability of the Chinese SPMSQ for older adults is 0.714.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate variability (HRV): HRV is measured using the CheckMyHeart handheld HRV device&#xD;
      (DailyCare BioMedical Inc., Chungli, Taiwan), which is a limb-lead ECG (modified lead I)&#xD;
      recorder with HRV analytical software. It is CE certified in several countries (US, Canada,&#xD;
      Japan and Taiwan) and has been used in previous studies. The investigators make use of HRV&#xD;
      time-domain parameters of standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and&#xD;
      root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) as outcome variables, which are more&#xD;
      strongly associated with psychological measures than frequency domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO Quality of Life-BREF(WHOQOL-BREF):The WHOQOL-BREF includes 26 questions covering four&#xD;
      domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Two&#xD;
      items have been added to the Taiwanese version in order to reflect Taiwanese cultural&#xD;
      differences, bringing the total number of items to 28. The two questions are 'Do participants&#xD;
      feel respected by others?' and 'Are participants usually able to get the food (i.e. lack of&#xD;
      availability) that participants like?' Each item is scored from 1 to 5, and the higher the&#xD;
      score, the greater the perceived quality of life. Scores are transformed linearly into a&#xD;
      28-140 possible range so that a mean scale score can be calculated. Cronbach's alpha is above&#xD;
      0·69 for all subscales (range 0·69-0·87) and 0·93 for the whole scale in the present study.&#xD;
