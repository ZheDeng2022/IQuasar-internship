  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RAPID-LTCF is a stratified, block-randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      a simple ARI case definition, rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) with wireless&#xD;
      transmission of results, and provision of infection control guidance when influenza is&#xD;
      detected. Because of the nature of the intervention, blinding is not possible. Sites will be&#xD;
      initially recruited for a study of &quot;respiratory infections within LTCFs.&quot; After acceptance&#xD;
      into the study, sites will be matched in terms of bed capacity, location, and other features&#xD;
      prior to randomization.&#xD;

      Project Overview: The primary goal of RAPID-LTCF is to conduct a randomized, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) to assess the effect of on-site, rapid influenza detection at long-term&#xD;
      care facilities (LTCFs) on influenza-related hospitalizations, deaths, and&#xD;
      healthcare-associated costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic research question in PICO format is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: for residents of LTCFs across Wisconsin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: does early detection of influenza coupled with infection control guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator: compared to usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increase early detection and reporting of influenza outbreaks?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. increased early antiviral treatment of influenza?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. increased use of antiviral prophylaxis for other at-risk residents?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. fewer hospitalizations during the influenza season?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. reduced mortality during the influenza season?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. lower healthcare associated costs during the influenza season?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on two highly successful pilot QI projects-undertaken during the last two influenza&#xD;
      seasons-that confirmed the feasibility and desirability of this approach, existing,&#xD;
      CLIA-waived, low-complexity rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) with high sensitivity and&#xD;
      high specificity in this population as the diagnostic platform will be used. RIDT analyzers&#xD;
      will be configured for wireless transmission of anonymous test results to a cloud-based&#xD;
      server for real-time access by public health. Detection of influenza at a LTCF and its&#xD;
      transmission to public health in real time will trigger communication and advice on&#xD;
      appropriate infection control measures to reduce in-facility transmission. This approach has&#xD;
      high potential for limiting influenza's effect at LTCFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents of LTCFs are at high risk for influenza infection due to reduced efficacy of&#xD;
      influenza vaccines in elders, close quartering, presence of co-morbid medical conditions, and&#xD;
      delayed response times. Consequently, outbreaks of influenza and other significant&#xD;
      respiratory viruses easily spread within LTCFs and cause substantial morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in these populations. Results from this RCT will provide highly generalizable approaches&#xD;
      using low-cost, low-complexity and easily-adapted tools and protocols for extremely early&#xD;
      influenza detection and response. It is anticipated that early outbreak recognition and&#xD;
      control in LTCFs will substantially reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare associated&#xD;
      costs in this vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: At present, 1.8 million individuals live in this nation's 16,000 nursing homes&#xD;
      and an additional 900,000 live in assisted living facilities. Significant healthcare&#xD;
      disparities exist for these individuals; a recent study found that the largest for-profit&#xD;
      nursing homes delivered significantly lower quality of care. Part of this disparity is&#xD;
      reflected in the fate of those infected with influenza. Influenza and pneumonia combine to&#xD;
      form the 8th leading cause of death in the United States. Outbreaks of influenza and other&#xD;
      respiratory viruses are common in LTCFs and result in significant morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      among residents. This increased morbidity and mortality is due to a combination of close&#xD;
      quartering, residents with co-morbid medical conditions, and delays in medical response.&#xD;
      Because of this high risk, influenza vaccination has long been recommended for all residents&#xD;
      and health care workers in these settings. Influenza vaccines, however, can have very low&#xD;
      efficacy in older individuals; vaccine efficacy for protection from the predominant influenza&#xD;
      strain in 2014-2015 was estimated to be only 14% for individuals aged 50 years and older.&#xD;
      Accordingly, elders (aged 65+) accounted for 72.4% of Wisconsin's influenza-related&#xD;
      hospitalizations during the 2014-2015 influenza season and 63% of influenza-related ICU&#xD;
      admissions. Moreover, across the country, the rate of attributable influenza hospitalization&#xD;
      was 313 per 100,000 for individuals aged 65 year and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current practice for identifying and responding to influenza outbreaks in LTCFs is&#xD;
      reactive and delayed. Of 41 known influenza outbreaks in LTCFs during the 2010-2011 season in&#xD;
      New York, most were identified retrospectively through reporting of influenza&#xD;
      hospitalizations and well before the LTCFs submitted reports to the Department of Health. The&#xD;
      availability of CLIA-waived, low-complexity, sensitive and specific rapid influenza detection&#xD;
      tests (RIDTs) can facilitate on-site diagnosis and early detection of an outbreak. Coupling&#xD;
      RIDTs with wireless transmission of anonymous results directly to public health officials&#xD;
      provides the means for extremely early and proactive outbreak recognition and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program Goal: A randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effect of on-site RIDTs&#xD;
      at LTCFs on subsequent influenza-related hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare-associated&#xD;
      costs is proposed. LTCF nursing staff will use RIDT technology to screen residents with acute&#xD;
      respiratory infections (ARI). The proposed RIDT is a CLIA-waved, low-complexity test that&#xD;
      uses a benign nasal swab specimen. It is configured to send test results via wireless&#xD;
      transmission to a cloud platform. From there, data can be accessed in real-time by public&#xD;
      health partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Starting in January 2013, extensive experience with the Quidel SOFIA Influenza A+B&#xD;
      system at 20 clinical sites and 7 LCTFs where the testing platform transmits influenza test&#xD;
      results immediately to a cloud-based system with public health access has been acquired. True&#xD;
      &quot;real-time&quot; availability of surveillance results are achievable. Since initiation, this&#xD;
      highly innovative system has been working flawlessly. A plan to conduct RAPID-LTCF over three&#xD;
      sequential influenza seasons to adapt to the uncertainties of influenza epidemiology has been&#xD;
      proposed. Twenty LTCFs across Wisconsin will be recruited for participation and randomized,&#xD;
      following stratification, to intervention (RIDT) or control (usual care) arms. Waived consent&#xD;
      for on-site specimen collection from residents at the RIDT sites with acute respiratory&#xD;
      infections has been approved by the IRB. Nasal swabs will be tested by nursing personnel at&#xD;
      each intervention site using SOFIA. Anonymous results will be sent, via wireless&#xD;
      transmission, for daily review by the study team and public health personnel. A positive&#xD;
      influenza detection will trigger direct communication with LTCF personnel with advice on&#xD;
      antiviral treatment, antiviral prophylaxis, and appropriate infection control practices. Data&#xD;
      will be collected from each site regarding the number of courses of influenza antiviral&#xD;
      medication provided for influenza treatment and for influenza prophylaxis, number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations, number of deaths, and associated healthcare costs during annual, dynamic,&#xD;
      4-month risk windows, based on Wisconsin surveillance of influenza patterns. An independent&#xD;
      data monitoring and safety board will continuously review outcomes and halt the study should&#xD;
      significant differences between the two arms emerge. Outcomes will be assessed using standard&#xD;
      statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This program reflects the full intent of the Wisconsin Partnership Program and&#xD;
      the Wisconsin Idea by identifying high-risk populations, and combining research, education&#xD;
      and public health practice to reduce the disparities of care experienced by these&#xD;
      populations. The application of cutting-edge, inexpensive, high-performing and reliable&#xD;
      technology into a population of traditionally under-served, high-risk individuals would&#xD;
      provide a translatable model for very early and proactive detection of, and response to&#xD;
      influenza in LTCFs, thus allowing for appropriate medical (antiviral) and public health&#xD;
      (in-room quarantining, enhanced personal protection equipment, prophylaxis of other&#xD;
      residents) interventions.&#xD;
