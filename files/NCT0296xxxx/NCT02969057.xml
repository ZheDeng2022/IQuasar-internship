      The objective of the present study is to compare the effects of liquid or solid state of food&#xD;
      on glycaemia, lipaemia and insulinaemia. 25 participants aged between 21 and 45 years will be&#xD;
      recruited from the general public in Singapore. Fingerpricks and cannulation may cause minor&#xD;
      discomfort and there may be some slight bruising around the site. Fingerpricks and&#xD;
      cannulation will be done by an experienced research nurse or a trained research officer to&#xD;
      minimize participant discomfort. If bruising does occur, it should disappear within one day&#xD;
      and it should not affect participants' regular daily activity. Participants will be limited&#xD;
      to a maximum of one test per week. In addition, blood collection will be carried out in a&#xD;
      sterile designated area and thus the risk of infection will be very low. On rare occasions,&#xD;
      participants may feel unwell during or after the testing session. We have several metabolic&#xD;
      suites with beds for these individuals to rest on. The research nurse and research officers&#xD;
      will monitor the individuals' condition and they will be provided with a ride home if&#xD;
      required. All the study foods will be prepared in a hygienic manner in a purpose-built&#xD;
      research kitchen maintained to the highest hygiene standards. The research staff has&#xD;
      undergone basic training in food hygiene procedures. Hence, the risk of infective acute&#xD;
      gastroenteritis will be minimal. Participants will be provided with some snacks at the end of&#xD;
      each testing session. They will also be reimbursed to compensate for their time and costs&#xD;
      associated with travel and parking at the completion of the study. In addition, participants&#xD;
      will be provided with their blood glucose, blood pressure, and body composition results, with&#xD;
      a brief interpretation of these at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;

      Design: This will be a randomised, crossover study with five sessions in total. 1.) Instant&#xD;
      rice porridge with orange juice, 2.) Instant rice porridge with palm oil, with orange juice&#xD;
      3.) Instant rice porridge with palm oleogel, with orange juice 4.) Instant rice porridge with&#xD;
      liquid rice bran oil, with orange juice 5.) Instant rice porridge with rice bran oleogel,&#xD;
      with orange juice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy Chinese males (BMI 18-25 kgm-2) with body weight &gt;/=45 kg, aged&#xD;
      21-45 years with normal fasting blood glucose (&lt;6.0 mM), will be recruited from the general&#xD;
      public in Singapore. The exclusion criteria are people with major chronic disease such as&#xD;
      heart disease, cancer or diabetes mellitus, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)&#xD;
      deficiency, glucose intolerance, intolerances or allergies to test products, as well as&#xD;
      individuals who are taking insulin or drugs known to affect glucose metabolism. People with a&#xD;
      major medical or surgical event requiring hospitalization within the preceding 3 months,&#xD;
      individuals with the presence of disease or drugs which influence digestion and absorption of&#xD;
      nutrients, people who are on any therapeutic diet/ drug therapy and smokers will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit: During the screening session, participants will receive an informed consent&#xD;
      form and given ample time to go through it and rectify any queries they have. If they decide&#xD;
      to take part in the study, they will be asked to sign the informed consent form. They will&#xD;
      then be asked to complete a screening questionnaire, baseline measurements including&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and physical activity level will be collected&#xD;
      from each participant in order to determine their eligibility. Body weight and body&#xD;
      composition will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Height will be measured&#xD;
      using a stadiometer in order to calculate participants' BMI. Blood pressure will also be&#xD;
      measured. All measurements will be taken in duplicate. Participants will then be scheduled&#xD;
      for the 5 subsequent test visits. The screening visit will take approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening questionnaire: The screening questionnaire will include contact information,&#xD;
      demographic, general health details, and physical activity level. This information will be&#xD;
      used to determine whether the participant is eligible for the study, as well as to check for&#xD;
      any possible confounders that may influence the study outcomes. Physical activity level will&#xD;
      be measured using a previously validated international physical activity questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal composition: The test meal will consist of cooking oil (palm oil or rice bran oil in&#xD;
      either liquid or gelled form made with ethylcellulose), orange juice and commercially&#xD;
      available instant porridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test visits: During the testing sessions, participants' glycaemic, insulinaemic, and lipaemic&#xD;
      responses to the test meals will be measured. Participants' metabolic satiety for the test&#xD;
      meals will also be assessed at regular intervals throughout the testing session. The test&#xD;
      duration for each treatment is 6.5 hours and the testing sessions will take place at least 1&#xD;
      week apart. Subjects will be instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity for at least 3&#xD;
      days and avoid caffeine and alcohol consumption for at least 1 day prior to visiting the CNRC&#xD;
      for their study trials. Participants will be asked to standardise their diets and to refrain&#xD;
      from alcohol and exercise the day before their testing sessions. At the beginning of the&#xD;
      testing session, a cannula will be inserted into participants' arms. One fasting blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected by fingerprick and venous cannulation. A drop of blood will be collected&#xD;
      into a HemoCue® cuvette (Helsingborg, Sweden) for blood glucose analysis. In addition, 5&#xD;
      milliliters of venous blood will be collected into Vacutainers® (Belton Dickinson&#xD;
      Diagnostics) containing disodium EDTA for the analyses of plasma triglyceride, insulin and&#xD;
      non-esterified fatty acids concentrations. Participants will then consume treatment meal&#xD;
      within 10 minutes. Blood samples will be taken at baseline, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150&#xD;
      and 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 and 360 minutes. The amount of blood that will be collected&#xD;
      at every time point will be approximately 5 mL. A maximum of 16 blood samples for will be&#xD;
      collected by fingerprick and cannulation. A total of 400mL approximately of blood will be&#xD;
      taken for the study. Glycaemic, insulinaemic, and lipaemic responses will be determined using&#xD;
      the method described by Wolever and Jenkins. The area under the curve will be determined as&#xD;
      the area of those increments above baseline only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to rate their 'liking' for the test meal. Participants will&#xD;
      rate their 'overall liking' for the test meal on a 100 mm VAS anchored with 'dislike&#xD;
      extremely' (0 mm), 'neither like or dislike' (50 mm) and 'like extremely' (100 mm)&#xD;
      immediately after they consume the test meal. Metabolic satiety: On the testing session days,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to record their appetite ratings on a 100 mm visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) immediately before they consume the test meal, then at every 30 minutes interval as&#xD;
      peak changes are usually observed at 15-30 minutes after a test meal, based on previous&#xD;
      studies.. The appetite-rating questionnaire will include questions on hunger, desire to eat,&#xD;
      prospective consumption, fullness, and preoccupation with thoughts of food.&#xD;
