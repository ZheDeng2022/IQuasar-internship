  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open labeled, phase 2 clinical trial, where patients are stratified to&#xD;
      one of two treatment groups based on upfront TP53 mutation status; i.e. TP53 mutated vs. TP53&#xD;
      wt disease, and treated with dose-dense cyclphosphamide. Furthermore, patients included are&#xD;
      stratified based on tumor stage; i.e. locally advanced breast cancer (M0 disease) or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (M1 disease). All participating cancer centers will prospectively&#xD;
      include patients with breast cancer fulfilling the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients do not respond to the experimental treatment as outlined in the protocol,&#xD;
      treatment with dose-dense cyclophosphamide will be terminated, and further cancer treatment&#xD;
      will continue at the treating oncologist's discretion. The response data for all patients who&#xD;
      have received at least one chemotherapy course will be included in the final efficacy&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue, blood samples and radiology data will be collected before therapy starts, if&#xD;
      therapy needs to be changed, and for patients with locally advanced breast cancer: at&#xD;
      surgery. Response data will be evaluated closely during treatment, with clinical assessment&#xD;
      of tumor size every two weeks for patients with locally advanced breast cancer and by&#xD;
      radiology every eight weeks for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Evaluation of side&#xD;
      effects/tolerance will be performed at every clinical visit, i.e. every two weeks for all&#xD;
      patients included in the p53 trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage IV breast cancer (distant metastases) remains a non-curable condition; thus, treatment&#xD;
      is considered palliative. However, many patients may live for years with their metastatic&#xD;
      disease with a reasonably good quality of life. As for locally advanced primary breast&#xD;
      cancers in need of primary medical therapy, lack of responsiveness to regular chemotherapy is&#xD;
      associated with a poor prognosis, with a high risk of relapse and, subsequent, breast cancer&#xD;
      death. TP53 mutations have been shown to predict a poor response to anthracyclines, a group&#xD;
      of cytotoxic agents which is extensively used and which is in general efficacious in breast&#xD;
      cancer. Notably, dose-intensification with cyclophosphamide has been found to significantly&#xD;
      improve the response rate in TP53 mutated primary breast cancers. Our preliminary experience&#xD;
      indicates that the use of dose-dense cyclophosphamide monotherapy every 2nd week with G-CSF&#xD;
      support is well tolerated. As for patients with metastatic disease for whom the alternative&#xD;
      would be to receive continuous chemotherapy at 3-weekly intervals the hypothesis is that&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide given at 2-weekly intervals over a limited time period, followed by a&#xD;
      &quot;treatment holiday&quot; among responders should be associated with a non-inferior quality of life&#xD;
      all-over. As for patients with TP53 mutated locally advanced breast cancers where standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy fails, the hypothesis is that cyclophosphamide dose dense treatment may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment option downstaging the tumor prior to surgery.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced breast cancers in need of pre-surgical chemotherapy or metastatic&#xD;
             breast cancer in need of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resistance to endocrine therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Either i) estrogen and progesterone negative tumor, or ii) harboring an estrogen and / or&#xD;
        progesterone positive tumor where regular endocrine therapies have failed or where the&#xD;
        treating physician finds endocrine therapy not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Prior cancer therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Metastatic disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        First line treatment (amendment 2018):&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior chemotherapy*. Prior endocrine therapy +/- CDK4/6 inhibitor or mTOR inhibitors is&#xD;
        allowed if hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Late-stage disease (approved protocol):&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) Prior exposure to and resistance to a taxane regimen**. ii) Prior exposure to and&#xD;
        resistance to an anthracycline regimen** -mandatory only for patients with TP53 wt tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        LABC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) Prior exposure to and lack of response to to a taxane regimen**. ii) Prior exposure to&#xD;
        and lack of response to an anthracycline regimen** - mandatory only for patients with TP53&#xD;
        wt tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        * Only for patients with TP53 mutated disease. Previous adjuvant chemotherapy, including&#xD;
        alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide a.o.) and/or platinum, is allowed if completed &gt;12&#xD;
        months prior to inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ** In metastatic breast cancer resistance to taxanes/anthracyclines is defined as&#xD;
        progressive disease (PD). In LABC lack of response is defined as stable disease (SD) after&#xD;
        4 courses of chemotherapy or PD. Breast cancer relapsing within 12 months subsequent to&#xD;
        adjuvant taxanes or anthracyclines is considered resistant and re-exposure is not required&#xD;
        prior to inclusion in the trial. This relates also to patients who could not receive proper&#xD;
        taxane or anthracycline therapy due to side effects or other medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The primary tumor or at least one metastatic lesion must be available for biopsy&#xD;
             collection at protocol inclusion. Notably; for patients with primary metastatic breast&#xD;
             cancer, TP53 status should be determined in a metastatic deposit; tissue from the&#xD;
             primary tumor may not substitute (this relates both to patients with synchronous and&#xD;
             metachronous metastatic disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have clinically and/or radiographically documented measurable breast&#xD;
             cancer according to RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WHO performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known tumor ER, PGR and HER2 status in the current situation, i.e. archival and&#xD;
             historic breast cancer tissue can not be used for patients with relapse of the&#xD;
             disease. However, patients can be included regardless of hormone receptor and HER2&#xD;
             status; in case such information lacks at inclusion, it may be analysed on the biopsy&#xD;
             retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiology studies (CT thorax/abdomen and bone scintigraphy/bone scan) and ecco cor&#xD;
             must be performed within 28 days prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to&#xD;
             national and local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood test requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.0 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt; 75 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt; 20 µmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbidity that, based on the assessment of the treating physician, may preclude the&#xD;
             use of cyclophosphamide at actual doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition(s) potentially&#xD;
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions&#xD;
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of serious coagulopathy. Prior arterial/venous thrombosis or&#xD;
             embolism does not exclude patients from inclusion, unless patient is considered unfit&#xD;
             by study oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active cystitis (to be treated upfront)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active bacterial infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urinary obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity towards cyclophosphamide or pegfilgrastim, their metabolites&#xD;
             and other ingredients in the drug administration formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient not able to give an informed consent or comply with study regulations as&#xD;
             deemed by study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amendment 2018: Patients with HER2 positive, metastatic breast cancer in the first&#xD;
             line setting (Arm C).&#xD;
