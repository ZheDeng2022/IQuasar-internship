    <textblock>
      The iTrackFitness study aims to test the &quot;engagement engine&quot; that was developed from activity&#xD;
      tracker and survey data gathered during phase I of the study. For the current phase the&#xD;
      &quot;engagement engine&quot; will support successful and sustained engagement with health trackers&#xD;
      thereby increasing physical activity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the growing interest in tracking personal health and wellness information, the use of&#xD;
      wearable fitness trackers is becoming a necessary tool in providing the tracking data.&#xD;
      However, the potential benefits of the tool can be fully realized only if the adoption and&#xD;
      use of the tracker is sustained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to engage in physical activity (or not) is complex, and therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators attempt to engage people in a physical activity program will consider adopting&#xD;
      an individualized approach to barrier management which takes into account personal beliefs&#xD;
      and perceptions regarding physical activity, setting goals in addition to using an&#xD;
      &quot;engagement engine&quot; designed specifically for this study. The primary objective of the phase&#xD;
      2 of this study is to test an &quot;engagement engine&quot; that will support successful and sustained&#xD;
      engagement with health trackers thereby increasing physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be recruiting a total of 138 participants from the general public via&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research broadcast e-serve list, the study website,&#xD;
      flyers and study informational tables at MGH-affiliated health clinics. Participants can&#xD;
      enroll in the study by consenting remotely where the screening and consenting will take place&#xD;
      online through the study website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the consenting process, enrolled participants will be instructed on how to download the&#xD;
      FitBit smartphone application and provide the study staff authorization to collect step data&#xD;
      from their tracker. The enrollment process will involve completing a set of enrollment&#xD;
      questions related to general health, barriers to physical activity, exercise regulation,&#xD;
      Prochaska's stage of change, demographics and technology use via a web link on the study&#xD;
      website. Next a research analyst will mail a copy of the consent form, wearable activity&#xD;
      tracker (Fitbit Charge) and device instructions via traceable mail to the research&#xD;
      participants. For participants who enroll from the informational tables, the research analyst&#xD;
      will provide them the FitBit in person. Once confirmed that participants have received their&#xD;
      device, the participant will be contacted by the Partners Connected Health (PCH) study staff&#xD;
      to conduct a brief phone interview to determine a personalized goal that can be used for&#xD;
      targeted, personalized messages as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study for (24 weeks) and for the first week the&#xD;
      engagement engine will calculate the average step count and use data from the enrollment&#xD;
      questionnaire to recommend a physical activity goal. During the study, the engagement engine&#xD;
      will recommend a daily physical activity goal and will assess the user's levels of engagement&#xD;
      with the activity tracker. At week 12, participants will be sent a midpoint questionnaire and&#xD;
      at week 24 the closeout questionnaire will be sent to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not foresee any significant risks for study participants and&#xD;
      participants may not directly benefit from this the study. It is hoped that data collected&#xD;
      from this study will allow the investigators to assess the engagement engine that could&#xD;
      potentially be used to help individuals remain engaged with their physical activity tracker&#xD;
      thereby sustaining regular physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk for potential inadvertent release of Protected Health Information is taken very&#xD;
      seriously. Investigators have taken several steps to minimize this risk as much as possible.&#xD;
      Data collected on paper will be stored in a locked cabinet at PCH, accessible only to&#xD;
      research staff. For the purposes of this study, participants will be asked to authorize the&#xD;
      PCH database to access and store activity data from the activity tracker server. This is done&#xD;
      using a secure, OAUTH procedure in which participants will be asked to enter their account&#xD;
      username and password. The OAUTH process does not store this information on the PCH/study&#xD;
      website, making this a secure and confidential method for participants to enable the PCH&#xD;
      study staff to have access to their activity data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity data retrieved from the FitBit app will be stored on password protected server&#xD;
      maintained by PCH Information Systems. At the conclusion of the study participants can change&#xD;
      their account user settings on the study website and revoke PCH study database access to&#xD;
      their account and data. Participants will be instructed on this process at the close-out of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
