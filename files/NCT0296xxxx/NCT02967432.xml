    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial of mupirocin treatment of MSSA- and MRSA-colonized infants&#xD;
      aims to determine whether or not mupirocin treatment results in S. aureus decolonization in&#xD;
      affected NICU patients. MSSA- or MRSA-colonized patients who enroll in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized to either a treatment group (treatment with mupirocin) or control group (treatment&#xD;
      with placebo). A combination of active surveillance and targeted decolonization will&#xD;
      qualitatively and quantitatively enable assessment of any changes in S. aureus colonization&#xD;
      in study patients. The primary outcome measure will be the number of MSSA/MRSA patient&#xD;
      colonization days in the treatment versus control groups. Secondary outcome measures will&#xD;
      include the proportion of persistently colonized patients at each subsequent weekly screening&#xD;
      interval in the treatment versus control group, incidence and timing of MSSA/MRSA&#xD;
      recolonization in the treatment group, incidence of invasive infections with S. aureus in the&#xD;
      treatment versus control group, incidence of mupirocin-resistance in treatment versus control&#xD;
      group, and incidence of MSSA/MRSA colonization after NICU discharge in the treatment versus&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard of care in the NICU includes active universal screening of all admitted&#xD;
      patients weekly for MSSA/MRSA colonization and contact precautions for MRSA-positive&#xD;
      patients. No universal or targeted decolonization procedures are currently utilized. NICU&#xD;
      patients who screen positive for MSSA/MRSA colonization will be approached for participation&#xD;
      in this study and consent will be obtained from a parent within 2 days of the initial&#xD;
      positive screening result by a neonatologist. At time of enrollment, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the treatment or control group. The pharmacy team will assign&#xD;
      randomization; all NICU staff will be blinded to the patient's study group assignments&#xD;
      throughout their admission. The treatment group will receive mupirocin ointment applied twice&#xD;
      daily inside the nares and to the skin around the umbilicus for five days. The control group&#xD;
      will receive a placebo ointment (petroleum jelly) applied in an identical fashion. The&#xD;
      control group will not receive mupirocin ointment at any time, regardless of colonization&#xD;
      status. If patients have recurrent positive MSSA/MRSA screens during the study, they may&#xD;
      receive additional identical courses of treatment with either mupirocin or placebo based on&#xD;
      their study group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mupirocin and placebo petroleum jelly ointments will be supplied by the Crouse Hospital&#xD;
      pharmacy and sent to the NICU daily for twice daily application by the nursing staff. Both&#xD;
      groups will receive a ½ inch ribbon topical application of mupirocin or petroleum jelly&#xD;
      ointment according to their assignment around the umbilicus and a ½ inch ribbon inside each&#xD;
      nare. The neonatal nursing staff will receive appropriate education regarding the application&#xD;
      technique and study protocol prior to study initiation. The cost of the mupirocin and placebo&#xD;
      ointments will be paid for by Neonatal Associates of Central New York, LLC, and patients will&#xD;
      not receive any fee for this service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonization with MSSA/MRSA will be screened weekly on Mondays, in line with current Crouse&#xD;
      Hospital NICU standard of care. MSSA/MRSA screening is performed by polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR). Sample collection involves swabbing an infant's nares, umbilicus, and groin with a&#xD;
      cotton-tipped applicator. The swab tip is then sent to the Crouse Hospital Laboratory for&#xD;
      Staphylococcus species identification. There will be no additional costs associated with&#xD;
      these screenings, as this is already standard of care. Mupirocin resistance will be assessed&#xD;
      by disk diffusion assay with E-test methodology to determine MICs. The costs associated with&#xD;
      this additional test will be paid for by Neonatal Associates of Central New York, LLC, and&#xD;
      patients will not receive any fee for this service. An additional MSSA/MRSA screen will be&#xD;
      performed approximately 2 months after discharge at a patient's primary care physicians'&#xD;
      office visit. Sample collection procedures will be identical to the screens performed at&#xD;
      Crouse, and the screens will be sent to Laboratory Alliance of Central New York's&#xD;
      Microbiology Department for testing. Results will be made available to the principal&#xD;
      investigator. The costs associated with this additional outpatient screening test will be&#xD;
      paid for by Neonatal Associates of Central New York, LLC, and patients will not receive any&#xD;
      fee for this service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine Crouse Hospital NICU policies regarding the use of contact precautions for any MRSA&#xD;
      colonized infant will continue during the study period. If an infant enrolled in the study&#xD;
      displays signs or symptoms concerning for infection, diagnostic evaluation and treatment will&#xD;
      be guided by the attending neonatologist, not deviating from the current NICU standard of&#xD;
      care. Parents are notified if their infant screens positive for MRSA colonization and if any&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation was performed on their infant. Current standards of infection&#xD;
      prevention, such as aggressive and consistent hand hygiene, sterile procedure policies, etc.&#xD;
      will be continued during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline patient demographics and clinical characteristics and outcomes will be collected on&#xD;
      every study subject, including: birth weight, sex, gestational age, birth hospital, mode of&#xD;
      delivery, maternal age, length of rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, documented maternal&#xD;
      MRSA history when available, maternal antibiotic exposure, maternal drug abuse history,&#xD;
      respiratory support throughout hospitalization, central line access, number of days on TPN,&#xD;
      maternal breast milk and/or formula use, gavage feeding, surgery, grade III/IV&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), spontaneous intestinal&#xD;
      perforation (SIP), clinical condition and gestational age at time of any infectious&#xD;
      evaluation, description of any positive infection (cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine,&#xD;
      pustule, abscess, osteomyelitis, endocarditis), antibiotic exposure (agent, antibiotic days),&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, discharge disposition, and MSSA/MRSA colonization screening results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of MSSA/MRSA patient colonization days will be determined and compared between the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups. The proportion of persistently colonized, decolonized, and&#xD;
      recolonized study subjects at each subsequent weekly screening interval in each study group&#xD;
      will be determined and compared. The incidence and timing of MSSA/MRSA recolonization&#xD;
      following decolonization with mupirocin will be determined. The incidence of nosocomial&#xD;
      sepsis and invasive infections with any organisms will be determined and compared between the&#xD;
      two groups. The incidence of mupirocin resistance in each group will be compared. The&#xD;
      incidence of MSSA/MRSA colonization after discharge based on the outpatient screenings will&#xD;
      be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent study monitoring committee, composed of a pharmacist and an attending&#xD;
      neonatologist (not the principal investigator), will meet after the first 30 patients are&#xD;
      enrolled and periodically after the first review to ensure the safety of this study protocol&#xD;
      for the duration of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of S. aureus colonization and infection during the study period will also be compared&#xD;
      with historical rates from the Crouse Hospital NICU to ensure that there was not some other&#xD;
      largely unanticipated change during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be compiled into an electronic database, which will be kept in a secure&#xD;
      password-protected computer in the principal investigator's locked office on the ninth floor&#xD;
      of Crouse Hospital. The study subjects' personal health information including name, date of&#xD;
      birth, and medical record numbers will be used to identify subjects, and their study&#xD;
      information will be part of their medical record. A copy of the data collection form and data&#xD;
      analysis form will be submitted along with this protocol and application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS, DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will include a descriptive phase to assess the frequencies of all&#xD;
      variables and an analytic phase to evaluate the associations between methicillin-sensitivity&#xD;
      or resistance status and the patient's gestational age, gender, birth weight, discharge&#xD;
      diagnoses, discharge disposition, length of NICU stay, or presence/type of underlying&#xD;
      condition, treatments, or clinical outcomes. Pearson's X2 test will be used to compare&#xD;
      categorical variable counts/frequencies between the treatment and control groups. The&#xD;
      two-sample t-test will be used for continuous variables with normal distribution to test&#xD;
      differences between means. Appropriate alternatives, such as Wilcoxon rank sum, will be used&#xD;
      if data violate t-test assumptions. The two-proportion z-test will be used to assess&#xD;
      differences between two proportions. All hypothesis testing will be 2-tailed with a P ≤ 0.05&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. An analyst for statistical support has been involved&#xD;
      with the study design, power analysis, and sample size calculation. She will remain involved&#xD;
      throughout the study period and will assist with data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal MSSA/MRSA patient colonization days data from the Crouse Hospital NICU was used for&#xD;
      sample size calculations. Approximately 12-15 new cases of MSSA- or MRSA-colonization occur&#xD;
      each month, with a mean of 21.5 patient colonization days (standard deviation 20 days). A&#xD;
      two-sample t-test with 95% confidence interval, power of 80, and hypothesized reduction of&#xD;
      40% (8 patient colonization days), suggests a sample size of 98 patients per group, or a&#xD;
      total of approximately 200 patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study personnel, aside from the pharmacy staff who will randomize patients, will be&#xD;
      blinded regarding patients' study group allocation until after discharge from the Crouse&#xD;
      Hospital NICU. At time of discharge, the pharmacy will notify the principal investigator of&#xD;
      each patient's study group allocation so that data analysis by treatment group can occur.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants admitted to Crouse Hospital NICU with MSSA/MRSA colonization that have&#xD;
             parental consent for participation obtained within 2 days of their initial positive&#xD;
             screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any infant with an active or previous S. aureus infection at time of initial positive&#xD;
             S. aureus colonization screen.&#xD;
