      Primary object is to determine if 100% orange juice with enzyme-treated orange pomace fiber&#xD;
      compared to a 100% orange juice will reduce 2 hr glycemic response as measured by glucose&#xD;
      area under the curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary object is to assess if 100% orange juice with enzyme-treated orange pomace fiber&#xD;
      compared to a 100% orange juice will reduce 2 hr insulin iAUC response.&#xD;

      The study is single-center, randomized, 2-arm, and crossover design. Twelve healthy men and&#xD;
      women aged 20-45 will be recruited for the study. Interested subjects will be asked to come&#xD;
      to the Clinical Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) on the IIT Campus, Chicago, IL, where the&#xD;
      study will take place for a screening visit to determine if they are eligible to participate&#xD;
      in the study. The screening visit will take 2-2.5 hours. Prospective subjects must read, sign&#xD;
      and date a written Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form prior to&#xD;
      performing any study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the on-site screening visit, subject will be asked to arrive after overnight fasting for&#xD;
      10-12 hours and be well-hydrated. Subject will be instructed to aim for a water intake of at&#xD;
      least 8-10 cups for the 24 hours before the screening visit. Determine eligibility to&#xD;
      participate includes having subjects to complete a series of questionnaires related to their&#xD;
      health, medication use, dietary habits, and physical activity history. Anthropocentric&#xD;
      (height, weight and waist circumference), ear temperature, and vital signs (blood pressure&#xD;
      and heart rate) will be measured. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated from height and&#xD;
      weight measurements. BMI is an estimate of body fat based on height and weight that applies&#xD;
      to both adult men and women. Fasting blood glucose level by capillary blood from finger prick&#xD;
      will be tested. For vital sign measurements, subjects will sit in a comfortable chair, feet&#xD;
      uncrossed and on the floor and will be asked to rest quietly for 5 minutes before measuring&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate. Arm vein will be assessed using a vein access scale test.&#xD;
      Subject will be instructed to complete a 24-hour food recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the questionnaires, BMI calculation, health evaluation and 24-hour&#xD;
      food recall, subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Eligible subjects will be trained and instructed to record all food&#xD;
      and beverages consumed for a 3-day period on food record diaries. Study staff will provide&#xD;
      the food record forms and training to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to come to the center for two test days. Test Day 1 will&#xD;
      follow the screening visit by at least a 7 day washout adhering to diet instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each Test Day visit, subjects will arrive at the clinic between 7 am and 9 am after&#xD;
      fasting for 10 to 12 hours and in a well-hydrated and well-rested state. If they are taking&#xD;
      medication(s) each morning, they will be asked not to take the medication(s) at home and&#xD;
      instead to bring to the clinical nutrition center to be taken in the presence of the study&#xD;
      investigator so the medications(s) is taken at the same time before each Study Day visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol adherence will be corroborated by asking about the period of fasted state.&#xD;
      Subject will also be asked about their limitation/avoidance of polyphenolic diet the last one&#xD;
      week and detailed food intake the 24-hour period prior to the visit to ensure consistency and&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol requirements. Subjects experiencing unusual stressful events&#xD;
      (such as loss of job, loss of loved one, divorce, etcâ€¦) will be rescheduled to a later time&#xD;
      agreed upon by the subject and investigator. Subject will be asked about their medication&#xD;
      intake and health status since their last visit to ensure that subjects are maintaining their&#xD;
      good health and medication intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirming compliance with protocol, anthropometric measurements and vital signs (blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate and ear temperature) will be taken. A finger prick for fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose will be taken to confirm if subject is fasting. A licensed healthcare professional&#xD;
      (LHCP) will evaluate and place a catheter on antecubital site of subject's non-dominant arm.&#xD;
      A catheter is a thin flexible tube that allows sampling of blood through one port throughout&#xD;
      the Study Day. Once the catheter is placed, a baseline blood sample will be taken (Time point&#xD;
      T -5). Subject will be asked to rest for 5 minutes, and then another baseline blood sample&#xD;
      will be taken (T 0). After completing 2 baseline blood sampling, subjects will receive a&#xD;
      serving of 100% orange juice or 100% orange juice with orange pomace fiber based on computer&#xD;
      generated randomization sequence. The randomization sequence will be assigned to each subject&#xD;
      on the first Study Day visit (Test Day 1). Additional blood samples will be taken at 15, 30,&#xD;
      45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes after the start of the orange juice. Subjects are allowed&#xD;
      to drink water after 60 min and the amount will be recorded. After completion of all study&#xD;
      procedures and data/sample collection for the day, the catheter will be removed and subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated for safety and/or discomfort/symptoms before leaving the study site. They&#xD;
      will be given a snack and written instructions in preparation for the next visit. Study day&#xD;
      visits will be scheduled at least 3 days apart, but not more than 7 days. Test Day 2 will be&#xD;
      exactly the same as Test Day 1 except the treatment, which will be the other of 100% orange&#xD;
      juice or 100% orange juice with orange pomace fiber based on computer generated randomization&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
