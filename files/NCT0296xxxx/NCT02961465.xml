  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Previous reviews showed that the evidence regarding the effectiveness of sacral&#xD;
      neuromodulation (SNM) in patients with therapy-resistant, idiopathic (slow-transit)&#xD;
      constipation is of suboptimal quality. Furthermore, there is no estimate of costs and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective cohort study with one group. This study is conducted next to a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) on 'the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      sacral neuromodulation in patients with idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory to&#xD;
      conservative treatments' (for more information ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT02961582). This RCT&#xD;
      is part of a temporary reimbursement arrangement, called conditional reimbursement of health&#xD;
      care (in Dutch: Voorwaardelijke Toelating) of the National Health Care Institute&#xD;
      (Zorginstituut Nederland). As part of this arrangement, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and&#xD;
      Sports requires that SNM remains available for eligible patients during the conditional&#xD;
      reimbursement period, also when inclusion of the RCT has ended. Furthermore, the Ministry&#xD;
      requires that patients who received personalized conservative treatment in the RCT (control&#xD;
      group), are offered SNM after completion of their follow-up of 6 months. As a result, the&#xD;
      National Health Care Institute requires that the patients who receive SNM outside the RCT are&#xD;
      included in a prospective cohort study to be able to collect data on them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this prospective cohort study is to collect more (but uncontrolled)&#xD;
      information regarding the safety and effectiveness of SNM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adolescent (14-17 years) and adult (18-80 years) patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      slow-transit constipation refractory to conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention is SNM, a minimally invasive surgical procedure consisting of&#xD;
      two phases. In the screening phase an electrode is inserted near the third sacral nerve and&#xD;
      connected to an external stimulator. If the screening phase is successful (average defecation&#xD;
      frequency (DF) ≥3 a week), the electrode is connected to a pacemaker that is implanted in the&#xD;
      buttocks of the patient. If not successful, the pacemaker will be removed and patients&#xD;
      receive conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is treatment success at 6 months,&#xD;
      defined as an average DF of ≥3 a week according to a 3-week defecation diary and safety.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are straining, sense of incomplete evacuation, constipation severity and&#xD;
      generic (health-related) quality of life ((HR)QOL).&#xD;

In patients who still have the pacemaker at 6 months, outcomes are als measured 12 months after inclusion to monitor the longer term effectiveness and safety of SNM.</description>

    <description>SNM starts with a screening phase. In this phase a tined lead is inserted into the third sacral foramen and attached to an external stimulator, after which the patient enters a four-week stimulation test period.&#xD;
If the screening phase is successful (defecation frequency (DF) ≥3 a week), the external stimulator is changed for a pacemaker that is implanted in the buttocks. If the screening phase is unsuccessful (DF &lt;3 a week), the lead is explanted. Patients are asked to limit the use of additional conservative treatments for constipation (such as laxatives and colonic irrigation) to what is necessary to relieve (the most severe) complaints. What is necessary to relieve complaints is determined by the patient.</description>

        The study population consists of adolescents (14-17 years) and adults (18-80 years) with&#xD;
        idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory to conservative treatment. As data&#xD;
        regarding this population is limited it is virtually impossible to provide precise numbers&#xD;
        of this patient population. However, some numbers are known:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average prevalences of idiopathic constipation of 16% and 19.2% are reported in Europe&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Of all patients treated for constipation, 5.6% is treated at the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is estimated that 1% of the constipation patients who are treated with conservative&#xD;
             treatment in hospitals, are unresponsive and are eligible for sacral neuromodulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Over the last 6 years, annually, on average, 25 patients were treated with SNM at the&#xD;
             Maastricht UMC+ and the Groene Hart Ziekenhuis Gouda&#xD;
