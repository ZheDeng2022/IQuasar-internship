    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that young plasma infusions can be performed&#xD;
      safely in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Secondary outcomes will include behavioral&#xD;
      and laboratory data that will support the next study that will inquire whether young plasma&#xD;
      infusions improve or slow the progression of cognitive, mood and/or motor impairment and rate&#xD;
      markers of the disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects over 1.6 million people&#xD;
      in the United States and whose incidence increases with age, affecting over 1% of people over&#xD;
      the age of 65. The neuropathological processes involved in PD are widespread throughout the&#xD;
      brain, and are reflected in a constellation of motor, cognitive, mood and other non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms. Treatments to date have largely focused on dopamine replacement strategies or deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation, both symptomatic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As neurodegenerative diseases progress, there are major changes throughout the body and&#xD;
      brain. These changes are transmitted in the body via the circulatory system between organs,&#xD;
      tissues and cells. Recent findings from multiple laboratories have shown that infusions of&#xD;
      young plasma into aging rodents can have beneficial effects on cognitive functions. This&#xD;
      suggests that the circulating components of plasma can improve cognitive and disease-relevant&#xD;
      symptoms. This has motivated the field to treat multiple disorders with blood products and&#xD;
      their constituent active components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The established safety of blood transfusions allows the investigators to test whether&#xD;
      infusions of young plasma can ease the neurological symptoms in human subjects with&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. A related study of plasma infusions has already been completed at&#xD;
      Stanford in patients with Alzheimer's disease (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02256306).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator proposes to test the safety and efficacy of transfusing young plasma into PD&#xD;
      participants, in order to establish its effects on motor and cognitive functions in&#xD;
      participants in a Phase 1 study. The successful completion of this study will inform the&#xD;
      design of future, larger and multicenter studies with the goal to determine whether infusions&#xD;
      of young plasma can ameliorate the neurodegenerative symptoms and underlying pathophysiology&#xD;
      in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Related and Unrelated Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the number of adverse events across all participants that might be related to young plasma infusions as a novel treatment to Parkinson's Disease symptoms. Adverse events were categorized as probably, possibly, or not related to the study intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quantitative Data of Cognitive Ability (Neuropsychological Battery)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quantitative data of cognitive ability. Raw scores and normative scores were calculated for all measures according to standardized procedures across all 3 time points.&#xD;
The cognitive test battery included:&#xD;
Trail Making Test Part A (0-92; lower scores indicate better performance) and B (0-300; lower scores indicate better performance)&#xD;
Digit Symbol Modalities Test (Oral: 0-110 and Written: 0-110; higher scores indicate better performance)&#xD;
Animal Naming Test (0-no maximum; higher scores indicate better performance)&#xD;
Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) (0-no maximum; higher score indicates better performance)&#xD;
CogStateTM Groton Maze Learning Test (GML) (minimum score is 0; lower scores indicate better performance)&#xD;
Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-II (WASI-II) Block Design (0-71; higher scores indicate better performance) and Matrix Reasoning (0-30; higher scores indicate better performance)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QOL) changes were tracked using the self-report Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). The PDQ-39 includes 8 sub-scales: Mobility (raw score range 0-40), Activities of Daily Living (raw score range 0-24), Emotional Well-Being (raw score range 0-24), Stigma (raw score range 0-16), Social Support (raw score range 0-12), Cognition (raw score range 0-16), Communication (raw score range 0-12), and Bodily Discomfort (raw score range 0-12). Subscales scores are totaled then converted to a percentage to calculate the Total score (0 to 100, higher scores indicating the more problems). Ratings are based on participant experiences over the course of the prior month. Lower scores represent better quality of life for all scores.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quantitative Data of Motor Movements up to 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The second outcome measure is the change in the quantitative data of current motor movement ability.&#xD;
Patients completed a repetitive Wrist Flexion Extension (rWFE) task with both hands, off therapy at the baseline, immediate-post, and delayed-post visits. Patients were instructed to flex and extend their hands at the wrist as quickly as possible after a &quot;Go&quot; command was given and to stop when instructed. This movement was self-paced, lasted 30 seconds, and was measured using wearable sensors attached to the dorsum of each hand (Motus Bioengineering, Inc.). Variables of interest included the mean angular velocity (Vrms), the variability of mean angular velocity, (CV Vrms), and rhythmicity, defined as the regularity of the interstrike interval (CV ISI). MA = more affected; LA = less affected.</description>

        <description>Quality of life (QOL) changes were tracked using the self-report Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). The PDQ-39 includes 8 sub-scales: Mobility (raw score range 0-40), Activities of Daily Living (raw score range 0-24), Emotional Well-Being (raw score range 0-24), Stigma (raw score range 0-16), Social Support (raw score range 0-12), Cognition (raw score range 0-16), Communication (raw score range 0-12), and Bodily Discomfort (raw score range 0-12). Subscales scores are totaled then converted to a percentage to calculate the Total score (0 to 100, higher scores indicating the more problems). Ratings are based on participant experiences over the course of the prior month. Lower scores represent better quality of life for all scores.</description>

Patients completed a repetitive Wrist Flexion Extension (rWFE) task with both hands, off therapy at the baseline, immediate-post, and delayed-post visits. Patients were instructed to flex and extend their hands at the wrist as quickly as possible after a &quot;Go&quot; command was given and to stop when instructed. This movement was self-paced, lasted 30 seconds, and was measured using wearable sensors attached to the dorsum of each hand (Motus Bioengineering, Inc.). Variables of interest included the mean angular velocity (Vrms), the variability of mean angular velocity, (CV Vrms), and rhythmicity, defined as the regularity of the interstrike interval (CV ISI). MA = more affected; LA = less affected.</description>
