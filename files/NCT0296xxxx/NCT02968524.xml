  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will focus on testing the accuracy of ThermoSpot -a low-cost, color-based,&#xD;
      temperature indicator in estimating the body temperature of Nigerian babies exposed to&#xD;
      ambient temperature conditions. The particpants will be recruited among babies receiving&#xD;
      Filtered Sunlight Phototherapy (FSPT) at Bowen University Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso and&#xD;
      other babies in the nursery at Bowen University Teaching Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be an educational session to teach health workers and mothers about the signs&#xD;
      for hypothermia and hyperthermia on the indicator. Then, the investigators will collect&#xD;
      observational cross-sectional data on random days to see how many of the trained health&#xD;
      workers and mothers were able to accurately recognize and provide appropriate response to&#xD;
      warning signs on the indicator.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ThermoSpot is a liquid crystal display thermometer. It comes as a sticky disc (12mm in&#xD;
      diameter) which can be applied to the skin over the liver, in the armpit, or over the neck&#xD;
      blood vessels of an infant. ThermoSpot was designed as a non-invasive hypothermia indicator&#xD;
      for infants. The device changes color when the baby's core body temperature changes, allowing&#xD;
      it to be understood even by a non-literate parent. It has been tested and proven to&#xD;
      accurately detect hypothermia in Malawi, Nepal and India. However, no large-scale studies&#xD;
      have been performed on babies exposed to ambient temperatures for long periods such as those&#xD;
      under FSPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the project is to determine whether ThermoSpot can be used to detect&#xD;
      hypothermia or hyperthermia in babies receiving FSPT instead of thermometers. The ability of&#xD;
      a parent to respond in a timely manner to the temperature indicator will help provide&#xD;
      critical information on technical, as well as educational components required for FSPT&#xD;
      scale-up in Nigeria and other resource-limited countries with health worker shortage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the performance of ThermoSpot in the detection of hypothermia or hyperthermia&#xD;
           with the standard axillary thermometer measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if parents are able to correctly interpret the color indicators on ThermoSpot&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether parents carry out the appropriate action based on the ThermoSpot&#xD;
           indicator.&#xD;
