  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder that is associated with a four&#xD;
      times greater risk of learning disabilities, including reading disabilities, and a deficiency&#xD;
      of neurofibromin - a protein important in a signaling pathway that regulates learning and&#xD;
      memory. Our previous work (NS49096) demonstrated that school-age children with NF+RD can&#xD;
      respond to standard phonologically-based reading tutoring originally developed to treat&#xD;
      reading disability in the general population. Combining our work with that by other&#xD;
      researchers suggesting that a medication (Lovastatin) may counteract the effects of the&#xD;
      deficient neurofibromin, and possibly ameliorate learning disabilities in NF1, the&#xD;
      investigator propose to examine the synergistic effects of medication plus reading tutoring.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromitosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome. The&#xD;
      most common concern of NF1 is learning disabilities (LDs). Approximately half of children&#xD;
      with NF1 have LDs, the most common of which are reading disabilities (RDs).The purpose of&#xD;
      this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and treatment of RDs&#xD;
      in NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will evaluate four different groups (see list below) to determine if there&#xD;
      are differential outcomes in these groups of children with NF+RD. The first two groups will&#xD;
      consist of NF1 patients, and the second two groups will consist of participants with RDs but&#xD;
      without NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reading tutoring program and a medication called Lovastatin (NF1 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reading tutoring program and no Lovastatin (placebo) (NF1 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reading tutoring program (RD participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other Academic &quot;Sham&quot; tutoring (eligible to receive reading tutoring after study&#xD;
           participation is complete) (RD participants)&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Participant able to swallow capsule (NF patients only, may be confirmed via&#xD;
             swallowability test, described below)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant's English is sufficient for school (all participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant must either answer &quot;yes&quot; to question A, or answer &quot;yes&quot; to at least 2&#xD;

        your child's reading ability? D. Did the school or teacher ever express any concerns about&#xD;
        your child's reading ability? Swallowability Assessment: We may ask patients to perform a&#xD;
        capsule swallowability assessment prior to enrollment. We will ask subjects to attempt to&#xD;
        swallow an empty capsule, matching the same size of the Lovastatin 20mg and 40mg capsules&#xD;
        to be used in the study, to confirm swallowability. Patients will be provided with up to 2&#xD;
        capsules as needed to successfully perform the swallowability assessment. If the patient is&#xD;
        unable to swallow the capsule, enrollment in the study may deferred or declined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A child will be excluded if he/she meets any of the following criteria, which will be&#xD;
        determined by initial telephone screening as well as review of medical/developmental&#xD;
