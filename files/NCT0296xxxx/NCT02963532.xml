  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The timing of extubation following surgery and anesthesia in young children is a complex&#xD;
      decision frequently guided by the experience of the clinician. The clinician frequently must&#xD;
      make a decision based on assimilating multiple cues that may or may not demonstrate that the&#xD;
      patient is ready for extubation such as eye opening, conjugate gaze, spontaneous ventilation,&#xD;
      and end tidal agent concentration. At this time there is no published data on the predictive&#xD;
      ability of individual extubation criteria for young patients undergoing anesthesia for&#xD;
      surgery so most practice is based solely on experience and anecdotal teaching. In some cases&#xD;
      if the timing is misjudged and the patient is extubated too early negative airway reflexes&#xD;
      such as breath holding and laryngospasm may take over creating a critical situation in which&#xD;
      the patient forgoes gas exchange and rapidly desaturates with the potential for bradycardia&#xD;
      and further cardiovascular collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine criteria used to determine fitness for extubation have been primarily described in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit literature and may be less relevant in the operating room in the&#xD;
      setting of routine general anesthetics. Most predictors including adequate tidal volume,&#xD;
      presence of conjugate gaze, eye opening, patient movement purposeful or otherwise, low end&#xD;
      tidal anesthetic agent concentration, response to physical or verbal stimulation and the&#xD;
      laryngeal stimulation test have not previously been evaluated to determine their individual&#xD;
      predictive value in deciding if the presently anesthetized patient now emerging is ready to&#xD;
      be extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to perform a laryngeal stimulation test the patient must be breathing spontaneously&#xD;
      and practitioner will gently move the endotracheal tube up and down stimulating the larynx.&#xD;
      In patients in stage 2 of anesthesia, the clinician will typically observe a cough or series&#xD;
      of coughs followed by a respiratory pause of greater than 5 seconds. In this situation the&#xD;
      patient has not adequately passed through stage 2 and remains at increased risk for apnea,&#xD;
      breath holding, or laryngospasm. If the patient is in stage 1 of anesthesia the clinician&#xD;
      will observe a cough followed by a brief pause (less than 5 seconds) or almost immediate&#xD;
      return to spontaneous ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, their exist no quantitative data on the predictive value of these various&#xD;
      criteria for extubation and the goal of our study is determine the indivdual predictive value&#xD;
      of different criteria in determing fitness for extubaion in young pediatric patients by&#xD;
      recording the presence or absence of various criteria in pediatric patients at the time of&#xD;
      extubation during routine anesthetic care.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to prospectively observe the frequency and predictive value of&#xD;
      specific signs and criteria and correlate those with successful extubation in young children&#xD;
      to determine which are present with the greatest frequency and which signs are most&#xD;
      predictive of successful extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained observer will prospectively observe emergence and extubation in pediatric patients&#xD;
      between the ages of less than 7 years of age in which potent inhalational agents were used&#xD;
      for anesthetic maintenance. They will record the presence or absence of certain accepted&#xD;
      signs that a young child is ready for extubation such as eye opening, postive larygneal&#xD;
      stimulation test, purposeful movement, end tidal agent concentration, and several others (see&#xD;
      Appendix 1 for complete list). We will also record the use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular&#xD;
      blocking drugs, use and presence of train of four monitoring, and end tidal carbon dioxide&#xD;
      concentration at the time of extubation. Timing of extubation will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the attending anesthesiologist caring for the patient according to their usual practice.&#xD;
      Following extubation we will observe the patient and a second checklist will be filled out&#xD;
      detailing any events such as the need for continuous positive pressure with 100% oxygen,&#xD;
      reintubation. The quality of extubation will be scored as either &quot;successful,&quot; &quot;moderately&#xD;
      successful,&quot; or &quot;failed,&quot; according to predefined criteria; see appendix 1.The investigators&#xD;
      will record the oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and presence or absence of additional&#xD;
      oxygen supplementation such as &quot;blow by,&quot; &quot;mask oxygen&quot; or &quot;nasal cannula&quot; on arrival to the&#xD;
      Post anesthesia care unit, at 5, 10, and 30 minutes after arrival in the post anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit. The investigators will also record the post anesthesia care unit length of stay as&#xD;
      defined as the time at arrival until the time the nurse deems that the patient has recovered&#xD;
      sufficiently to leave the post anesthesia care unit either for home or for their inhouse bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will record age, height, weight, gender, American society of anesthesiologist&#xD;
      status, type of surgery, and presence or absence of any upper respiratory infection symptoms&#xD;
      in the previous 2 weeks, and any premedication, type of inhalational agent used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will observe patients less than 7 years old based on the operating room&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center a tertiary academic medical&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects selection criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients under the age of 7 scheduled for surgery and anesthesia with an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube will be observed at the time of extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients less than 7 years of age scheduled for surgery and anesthesia in which an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube is placed for airway management and potent inhalational agents are used for&#xD;
      anesthetic maintenance for which a trained study observer can be present for extubation will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients using a laryngeal mask airway or other supralaryngeal device for airway management&#xD;
      during an elective procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a tracheostomy in place. Any case in which total intravenous anesthesia is&#xD;
      used. Patient in which a mask alone is used for airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an a priori sample size calculator for multiple regression analysis based on effect&#xD;
      size f2 of 0.05 in a model with 7 predictors, a probablility level of 0.05, and a statistical&#xD;
      power of 80% we estimate a sample size of 293 patients. The calculator can be found at the&#xD;
      following internet address: http://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=1 Given&#xD;
      the number of 293 patients we will observe 300 extubations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Interactions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and interactions for the patient should be minimal since this is an&#xD;
      observational study. Study personnel will monitor the pediatric operating room schedule&#xD;
      during the day to look for cases where an endotracheal tube is being used for airway&#xD;
      management in children less than 7 years of age. Study personnel will consult with the&#xD;
      responsible anesthesia team and will prospectively record data at the time of emergence and&#xD;
      extubation. They will also intermittently observe the patient in the post anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit but may delegate the recording of respiratory data in the post anesthesia care unit at&#xD;
      arrival, 5, 10, and 30 minutes. They will also record post anesthesia care unit length of&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be successful, moderately successful or failed extubation and the&#xD;
      correlation, frequency, and predictive value of individual subjective and objective criteria&#xD;
      for extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be analyzed initially using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis to determine the predictive value of different criteria for successful&#xD;
      extubation and further to determine if one criteria is more predictive than another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Subjects Protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be identified by looking at the pediatric operating room schedule and&#xD;
      consulting with the anesthesia team responsible for the patient to determine if they used an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube for airway management and then further if they plan to extubate the patient&#xD;
      at the end of the procedure. If the aforementioned is acceptable and the patient meets the&#xD;
      age inclusion criteria and a member of the study is available they will observe the emergence&#xD;
      and record data based on what is occurring during the emergence and extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will not be sought as this is an observational study designed to observe&#xD;
      criteria used in the routine practice of pediatric anesthesia to determine the timing of&#xD;
      extubation. All clinical care will be administered at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist according to their routine standard practice.&#xD;
