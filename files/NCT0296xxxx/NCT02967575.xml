      This Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is conducted to collect clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      outcome information on patients suffering from intractable symptomatic cervical disc disease&#xD;
      requiring 1- or 2-level reconstruction of the disc from C3-C7, after being treated with the&#xD;
      Triadyme-C polycrystalline diamond compact cervical disc replacement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately fifty percent of the population has evidence of degenerative changes in their&#xD;
      cervical spine by the age of fifty. As part of the aging process, the intervertebral discs&#xD;
      wear out. They lose their flexibility and elasticity and begin to collapse or even herniate.&#xD;
      This process may result in a pathological condition called cervical Degenerative Disc&#xD;
      Diseases (cDDD). cDDD can either be asymptomatic or symptomatic, showing different symptoms&#xD;
      such as neck, shoulder, head, arm or leg pain, possibly associated with numbness, tingling or&#xD;
      weakness in the upper extremity. In most cases symptomatic cDDD is initially treated&#xD;
      conservatively with rest, immobilization, physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation and&#xD;
      pain medication. For those cases not responding to conservative therapy, anterior cervical&#xD;
      discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a standard technique. The primary purpose of ACDF is to&#xD;
      excise any disc material (discectomy), which compresses the spinal nerve or cord causing&#xD;
      pain, sensory disturbance or weakness at the affected level, followed by interbody fusion of&#xD;
      the adjacent vertebrae using grafts or intersomatic devices to compensate the instability and&#xD;
      the loss of disc height resulting from discectomy. Despite the success of this common&#xD;
      procedure, some disadvantages are to be mentioned including donor site morbidity when&#xD;
      autografts are used, graft or device subsidence or pseudarthrosis of the segment to be fused.&#xD;
      Besides this, physiological motion of successfully fused segments is no longer possible. This&#xD;
      alters the loading and kinematics of adjacent spine segments which is believed by some&#xD;
      authors to lead to adjacent segment overload as reported by several clinical and&#xD;
      biomechanical studies. To address the disadvantages of ACDF, cervical total disc replacement&#xD;
      (cTDR) has been developed in the 1990s, with the aim to carry the load and restore the normal&#xD;
      disc height while preserving almost physiological segmental motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, several different cTRD designs are on the market, some of them with mid- to long-term&#xD;
      results. A number of randomized controlled trials indicate clinical equivalence or even&#xD;
      superiority of cTDR in some aspects compared to ACDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dymicron Triadyme-C cTDR is a two-piece articulating artificial disc prosthesis. Its&#xD;
      patented tri-lobe articulation mechanism consists of three spherical lobes mating to three&#xD;
      non-congruent, spherical pockets. The motion of these three lobes within their associated&#xD;
      pockets emulates and controls natural motion of the cervical spine motion segment in all&#xD;
      degrees of freedom.Triadyme-C is a self-centering device. This is achieved by the implant&#xD;
      growing in height as it moves away from its center. The further away from center, the tighter&#xD;
      the ligaments will be stretched. Each half of the Triadyme-C is a sintered monobloc,&#xD;
      consisting of a polycrystalline diamond (PCD) bearing surface with a base of&#xD;
      titanium-titanium carbide (Ti-TiC) composite. PCD is a sintered material composed of fused&#xD;
      diamond crystals (typically more than 90%) and a small amount of catalyst sintering metal.&#xD;
      The polycrystalline structure of diamond, together with the small amount of residual metal&#xD;
      alloy, contributes significantly to the extraordinary toughness and abrasion-resistance of&#xD;
      the material. PCD retains many of the phenomenal properties of natural diamond, including&#xD;
      hardness, but in an isotropic form that is far more resistant to fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is conducted to collect clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      outcome information on patients suffering from intractable symptomatic cervical disc disease&#xD;
      requiring 1- or 2-level reconstruction of the disc from C3-C7, after being treated with the&#xD;
