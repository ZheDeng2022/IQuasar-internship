      This study will evaluate the preventive vaccine efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the&#xD;
      ALVAC-HIV vaccine + Bivalent Subtype C gp120 protein adjuvanted with MF59 in HIV-seronegative&#xD;
      South African adults over 24 months from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438), or placebo, by intramuscular&#xD;
      injection at weeks 0 and 4; they will receive ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) + Bivalent Subtype C&#xD;
      gp120/MF59, or placebo, by IM injection at weeks 12, 24, and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the vaccination visits, participants will attend study visits at weeks 26, 39,&#xD;
      54, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130, 142, and 156. All study visits, including vaccination visits,&#xD;
      will include HIV risk reduction counseling, a physical exam, and an interview/questionnaire.&#xD;
      and pregnancy testing for participants capable of becoming pregnant. Select study visits will&#xD;
      include a medical history review, physical exam, blood collection, urine collection, HIV&#xD;
      testing, and pregnancy testing for participants capable of becoming pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of February 3, 2020, vaccinations for this study were suspended. Participants have been&#xD;
      asked to continue attending follow-up visits for 12 months after the last vaccination they&#xD;
      received. Participants who become HIV infected will be followed for 6 months after diagnosis.&#xD;
