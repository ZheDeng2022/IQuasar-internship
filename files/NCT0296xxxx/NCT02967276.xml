    <textblock>
      This phase II trial study assessing the activity of metformin when given together with high&#xD;
      dose of dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma (MM) that has relapse or&#xD;
      refractory to previous treatment. High dose of dexamethasone (HDdexa) is used to treat&#xD;
      relapse/refractary patients with myeloma and metformin also demonstrated synergistic activity&#xD;
      with dexamethasone to eradicate MM cells in vitro and in vivo. Metformin hydrochloride, used&#xD;
      for diabetes, may also help kill tumor cells. Giving dexamethasone with metformin may kill&#xD;
      more MM cells and increase the response rate to HDdexa.&#xD;

      Phase II trial, open label, clinical activity of metformin combination with high-dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone (HDdexa) in patients with multiple myeloma relapsed-refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, metformin will be given&#xD;
      continuously until completion of the treatment, disease progression, severe toxicity or&#xD;
      intolerance. The same duration of treatment will be applied to dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be initiated with dexamethasone (40 mg daily for 4 days on D1-D4, D9-D12&#xD;
      and D17-D20) Before starting the HDDexa investigators will obtain blood and bone marrow&#xD;
      samples for evaluation of response to the disease using biomarkers of multiple myeloma. On&#xD;
      day 1, the patients will begin metformin XR (500mg daily with the evening meal) with gradual&#xD;
      increase in the dose - 500 mg per week up to a maximum of 2.5 g / day if no toxicity grade â‰¥&#xD;
      2 . Each cycle will be reset every 35 days in the 1st and 2nd cycle and every 28 days from&#xD;
      3rd to 6th cycle. Patients who maintained clinical response to treatment after the first&#xD;
      cycle should use the drugs for 6 cycles, or until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Oral&#xD;
      dexamethasone (40 mg) is administered on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12 and 17 to 20 the first and&#xD;
      second (cycles of 35 days) and on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the third to sixth (cycle 28d), for&#xD;
      a period of 190 days of treatment. Patients over 75 years will use 20 mg / day instead of 40&#xD;
      mg / day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be submitted to collection of tissues: blood and bone marrow to evaluate the&#xD;
      response to disease through multiple myeloma biomarkers before the first cycle, 4th and 5th&#xD;
      cycle of treatment to assess the response according to IMWG criteria: blood count, creatinine&#xD;
      , calcium, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); Beta2 microglobulin; C-reactive protein (CRP) and&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); Immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation of the&#xD;
      proteins in serum and urine 24 hours; 24h proteinuria; Myelogram and bone marrow biopsy (BMO)&#xD;
      and Immunophenotyping. Clinical and laboratory exams will be conducted at the beginning and&#xD;
      every 35 days on first 2 cycles every 28 days until the 6th cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include history and physical examination, electrocardiography, blood&#xD;
      count, biochemical tests (including glucose and glycated Hb) and pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxic effects will be analyzed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 (NCI CTCAE v4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Dexamethasone is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases. Metformin is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The combination of these drugs to treat&#xD;
      multiple myeloma is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 28 patients will take part in this study. This is a multicenter study, and will take&#xD;
      place in the clinical research center at the Clinical Hematology of the Clinical Hospital,&#xD;
      University of Campinas-UNICAMP and at the Cascavel Cancer Hospital - UOPECCAN. This study&#xD;
      will be coordinated by the Hemocentro-UNICAMP&#xD;
