  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the African-American (AA) population tends to have lower serum 25(OH)D levels&#xD;
      compared to whites, there is no evidence that the lower 25(OH)D levels in African-Americans&#xD;
      are harmful. In fact, skeletal health is superior in AA. It is clear that total serum 25(OH)D&#xD;
      concentrations do not reflect the same risk/benefit ratio in AA compared to white women and&#xD;
      is, therefore, an inappropriate biomarker in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to investigate whether free 25(OD)D and Vitamin D Metabolite Ratio&#xD;
      (VMR, ratio of 25(OH)D to 24,25(OH)2D) are preferable biomarkers to total 25(OH)D. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a six month randomized double blinded study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish that free 25(OH)D and VMR are similar in black and white populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the relationships between free 25(OH)D and VMR and two measures of bone&#xD;
           health (PTH and BMD) in black and white women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate whether the relationship of free 25(OH)D (and in parallel analyses, VMR) and&#xD;
           bone health are stronger than those based on total 25(OH)D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate whether free 25(OH)D and VMR respond to vitamin D intake (dose-response) in&#xD;
           a similar manner to total 25(OH)D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is postmenopausal Caucasian women age 60 and older. This six month study&#xD;
      includes four visits. These results will be compared to those from a study in AA women which&#xD;
      the investigators are also completing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two study groups. One group will receive vitamin D supplementation, the other a&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking outside Vitamin D supplements for the&#xD;
      duration of the study. If the subject is eligible based on the results from the first two&#xD;
      visits, the subject will be randomized into one of these two groups. Randomized subjects will&#xD;
      be taking the vitamin D or placebo for a period of 6 months and will have one visit at the 3&#xD;
      month mark and a final visit at the 6 month mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3-month visit, the following procedures will be conducted: obtain interim medical and&#xD;
      travel history, vital signs, weight, and height measured by the Harpenden Stadiometer, record&#xD;
      adverse events and concomitant medications, Fasting blood collection: total 25(OH)D (by&#xD;
      Diasorin), PTH, serum calcium and creatinine, Fasting urine collection for calcium and&#xD;
      creatinine, and questionnaires: calcium food frequency questionnaire, quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire, falls and flu questionnaires. Subjects will be instructed on how to collect a&#xD;
      24-hour urine sample (for final visit) and collection container will be dispensed. Unused&#xD;
      study supplements will be collected and counted, and study supplements will be dispensed&#xD;
      based on serum 25(OH)D level algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-month visit, in addition to what is completed at the 3-month visit, the following&#xD;
      procedures will also be conducted:24-hour urine calcium, sodium, oxalate and creatinine;&#xD;
      mini-mental health examination; physical performance examination (SPPB); and a physical&#xD;
      activity questionnaire. Unused study supplements will be collected and counted. No further&#xD;
      supplementation will be provided.&#xD;
