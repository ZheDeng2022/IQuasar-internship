  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected&#xD;
      intercourse, It affects approximately one in six couples pregnancy. Many lifestyle factors of&#xD;
      the couple's pre and peri-conceptional environment (weight, diet, alcohol, tobacco, coffee,&#xD;
      drugs, exercise, stress, sleep, pollution...) are risk factors for infertility. Weight gain,&#xD;
      in both members of the couple, is associated with an increased risk of Assisted Reproduction&#xD;
      Technology (ART) failure and adverse pregnancy outcome, while healthy lifestyle makes the&#xD;
      risk of infertility three times less likely to happen. Idiopathic infertility may greatly&#xD;
      benefit from lifestyle factors optimization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate and optimize periconceptional habits (diet and lifestyle factors) of unfertile&#xD;
      couple may have favorable impact on conception and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to undertake a controlled trial of the efficiency of an integrated&#xD;
      global care program. This trial of an intervention on lifestyle factors will be compared with&#xD;
      the &quot;&quot;cohort multiple randomised controlled trial&quot;&quot; methodology in order to strengthen&#xD;
      external validity by limiting bias that may result from initial consent to randomisation, or&#xD;
      from deception of allocated treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any visit in a participating ART center, all attending couples will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in an observational survey in order to allow access to their data. In this whole&#xD;
      cohort, all eligible couples will be identified as consultations go. An &quot;&quot;on the fly&quot;&quot;&#xD;
      randomisation process (ration 2 usual / 1 experimental) will select candidate couples from&#xD;
      all eligible ones, who will be ten offered the experimental PEPCI intervention. In case of&#xD;
      refusal of the experimental care, they will be given the usual care.&#xD;
