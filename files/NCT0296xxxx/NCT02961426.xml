    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III, multicenter, multi-country trial to assess the efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      tolerance and pharmacokinetics of SOF-RDV for the treatment of HCV infection, across&#xD;
      genotypes 1,2,3,6, among non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic with CTP class A, interferon/ribavirin&#xD;
      naïve or experienced, HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also study the pharmacokinetics of RDV and, in HCV/HIV co-infected subjects, possible&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment duration will be 12 weeks for subjects with no cirrhosis (Metavir F0 to F3) and&#xD;
      24 weeks for subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Metavir F4, CTP class A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is performed in 2 stages. Stage 1 has been completed. Efficacy and safety results&#xD;
      from Stage 1 were reviewed and approved by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB) which provided the recommendation to proceed with the study stage 2. On-going stage 2&#xD;
      aims to supplement Stage 1 results and provide additional information on the performance of&#xD;
      SOF-RDV in the main genotypes found in Malaysia and Thailand.&#xD;
