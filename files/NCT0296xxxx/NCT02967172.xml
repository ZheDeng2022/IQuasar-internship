  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a peri-articular&#xD;
      multimodal injection for post-operative pain control following operative management of&#xD;
      closed, rotational ankle fractures. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to either receive or&#xD;
      not receive intra-operative injections in addition to standard opioid analgesic regimens.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with standard of care surgical techniques by the treating&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeon for the patient's specific fracture pattern. The patients randomized into&#xD;
      the injection cohort will receive a 25cc intra-operative injection with 200 mg ropivacaine,&#xD;
      0.6 mg epinephrine, 5 mg and morphine into the local superficial and deep peri-incisional&#xD;
      tissues while under general anesthesia. Total post-operative opioid consumption expressed in&#xD;
      morphine equivalent dose will be recorded, including IV and oral opioids. Time in hours from&#xD;
      operation conclusion to discharge and discharge disposition (to where the patient is&#xD;
      discharged) will also be recorded. Post-operative pain scores will be assessed and recorded&#xD;
      in the immediate post-operative period and every 4 hours subsequently until the patient is&#xD;
      discharged. Medication related side effects will be monitored. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the injection cohort will have reduced pain scores, lower narcotic requirements, shorter&#xD;
      length of stay, and be more likely to discharge to home following surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periarticular fractures (bone breaks extending into the joint surface) treated by orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeons are associated with significant pain in the post-operative period, often requiring&#xD;
      high doses of opioid analgesics. In recent years, the high risk of misuse, abuse, and death&#xD;
      associated with prescription opioid use has become increasingly evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although physicians are being advised to avoid administration of opioid prescriptions,&#xD;
      alternative pain management options are limited. Currently, there is a need to investigate&#xD;
      different pain management models in order to provide safe and effective pain relief during&#xD;
      the post-operative period. The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      peri-incisional multimodal injections as an alternative post-operative pain control method in&#xD;
      orthopaedic trauma patients with operative ankle fractures. Approximately 200 patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to either receive or not receive intra-operative injections in addition to&#xD;
      standard opioid analgesic regimens. Post-operative pain management outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      and compared between the 2 study groups to determine effectiveness of the injections. The&#xD;
      proposed study will build upon related work to advance post-operative pain control regimens&#xD;
      in orthopaedic surgery. Goals include the reduction of unnecessary patient suffering,&#xD;
      reliance on opioids, and length of stay, while improving patient experience. These aims will&#xD;
      be accomplished through the expansion of currently used multimodal periarticular injections&#xD;
      from populations undergoing elective surgery to orthopaedic trauma patients with rotational&#xD;
      ankle fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients&#xD;
      included in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
      intra-operative multimodal periarticular injection or control (no injection). The&#xD;
      peri-incisional injection will consist of ropivacaine, epinephrine, and morphine. All&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents in the anesthetic cocktail are FDA approved and have been previously&#xD;
      used in combination during other types of orthopaedic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in the study will receive standard post-operative opioid analgesic&#xD;
      regimens, administered 'per needed', regardless of their assigned treatment group per study&#xD;
      protocol. â‰¥ 40 patients will be randomly assigned to each group. The patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      investigation as well as health care professionals performing post-operative assessments and&#xD;
      collecting data will be blinded to treatment allocation. The feasibility of multimodal&#xD;
      peri-incisional injections is supported by their current efficacy in populations undergoing&#xD;
      elective orthopedic surgeries. These injections may be equally effective at reducing pain&#xD;
      compared to regional anesthesia with continuous infusions, and single-shot nerve blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the injection cohort will have reduced pain scores, lower&#xD;
      narcotic requirements, shorter length of stay, and be more likely to discharge to home&#xD;
      following surgery.&#xD;

    <description>A single, 25 cc multimodal analgesic cocktail will be injected following completion of ankle fracture fixation/instrumentation while the patient remains under general anesthesia and prior to skin closure. The injection will be administered as such:&#xD;
20 mL injected into the peri-incisional soft tissues in a circumferential fashion&#xD;
5mL injected into the ankle joint This cocktail includes 200 mg of 0.8% ropivacaine, 0.6 mg of epinephrine, 5 mg of morphine sulfate, and sodium chloride solution. All infiltrations will be completed with a blunt trochar to minimize the risk of intravascular injection.&#xD;
Interventions:&#xD;
Drug: Ropivacaine Drug: Epinephrine Drug: Morphine Drug: 0.9% sodium chloride solution Following surgery, patients in the treatment and non-treatment groups will both be provided with the same intravenous (patient-controlled analgesia) and oral pain medications scheduled &quot;per needed&quot;.</description>
