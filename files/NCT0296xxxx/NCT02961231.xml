      The cost of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use can be greatly reduced by making use of&#xD;
      existing herd immunity to protect children against vaccine type pneumococci. The&#xD;
      investigators will reduce the circulation of vaccine type pneumococci to low levels by PCV&#xD;
      catch-up campaign; vaccinating all children less than 3 years of age with PCV, after which&#xD;
      the investigators will evaluate the ability of a simplified two doses regimen and an&#xD;
      alternative one dose regimen to prevent the reintroduction of vaccine type pneumococci&#xD;
      compared to the WHO recommended 2 doses schedule.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCVs) have substantially reduced the burden of&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease. WHO currently recommends giving PCVs as 3 doses - either 3 doses in&#xD;
      infancy with Pentavalent vaccine (3p+0), or two doses in infancy followed by a booster around&#xD;
      the end of the first year of life (2p+1). The 3p+0 schedule is used in many countries&#xD;
      introducing PCV with Gavi support while several European countries are using 2p+1 schedule.&#xD;
      However, their high price and the current recommendation for at least 3 doses to achieve full&#xD;
      individual protection for infants, introduces a substantial financial burden. As a result,&#xD;
      many middle income countries have not yet introduced PCVs, and low income countries that have&#xD;
      introduced PCVs with the aid of the Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, may not be able to sustain&#xD;
      PCV vaccination after graduating from GAVI support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date PCV programs have been designed to provide optimal individual protection of the&#xD;
      vaccinees, yet experience in developed countries indicates that herd immunity, which is&#xD;
      generated by reducing carriage and hence transmission of vaccine serotypes in the community,&#xD;
      controls vaccine type pneumococcal disease in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals alike&#xD;
      [1]. Using PCV impact on vaccine type carriage as a marker of vaccine type disease [2], the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate the feasibility of reducing the number of infant doses in the&#xD;
      PCV immunization schedule, to make more efficient use of herd immunity in the protection&#xD;
      against pneumococcal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim and objectives Primary objective 1- The investigators will measure the effect of&#xD;
      the 1p+1 schedule on vaccine type pneumococcal carriage and non-inferiority compared to a&#xD;
      2p+1 or 3p+0 schedule in (a) children aged 4-11 months, i.e. after the age of a completed&#xD;
      primary series and before the age where they would receive a booster dose (this is the&#xD;
      population that is most at risk for pneumococcal disease and is likely to receive less direct&#xD;
      protection from a reduced primary series), and (b) children aged 14-24 months, i.e. after the&#xD;
      age where a booster dose is given in the treatment arms(this is the beginning of the age&#xD;
      period when most intense transmission of pneumococci is believed to occur).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 1 - The investigators will measure the effect (both direct + indirect&#xD;
      effects) of the 0p+1 schedule against vaccine type carriage and non-inferiority against a&#xD;
      2p+1 or/and 3p+0 schedules respectively in (a) children aged 4-11 months, and (b) children&#xD;
      aged 14-24 months,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 2 - The investigators will measure the effect of the 1p+1 and 0p+1&#xD;
      schedules against vaccine type carriage and non-inferiority against a 2p+1 or 3p+0 schedules&#xD;
      respectively among unvaccinated mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 3- The investigators will measure the effect of catchup vaccination&#xD;
      effect in the community by conducting and post catchup carriage survey, 4 months after the&#xD;
      second catchup vaccination campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 4 - The investigators will develop mathematical models to predict the&#xD;
      impact of 1p+1 and 0p+1 schedules against vaccine type carriage and disease in Nha Trang if&#xD;
      introduced simultaneously to all clusters following a catch up campaign, and infer the impact&#xD;
      of such schedules in other transmission settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: The study will be conducted in 27 communes of Nha Trang, central Vietnam which is&#xD;
      the capital of Khánh Hòa province and has about 400,000 inhabitants. PCV10 was recently&#xD;
      registered in Vietnam. However, PCV is yet to be introduced into the national immunization&#xD;
      program in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The investigators will conduct a PCV cluster randomized trial in 27 communes of&#xD;
      Nha Trang city. There will be four different schedules of PCV intervention arms; 1p+1, 0p+1,&#xD;
      2p+1, and 3p+0 schedules. The followings are the PCV schedules that will be investigate in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0p+1 - A single dose of PCV at 12 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. p+1 - A two-dose schedule of PCV at 2 and 12 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. p+1 - A three-dose schedule of PCV at 2, 4 and 12 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. p+0 - A three dose schedule of PCV at 2, 3 and 4 months of age Communes will be&#xD;
           considered as clusters. Six clusters for each intervention arm and 3 clusters for the&#xD;
           unvaccinated arm will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of PCV for the study: PCV10 has recently been registered in Vietnam and can be&#xD;
      purchased locally, while this is not yet the case for PCV13. Therefore the investigators&#xD;
      decided to use PCV10 for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal carriage survey: Nasopharyngeal samples will be collected before the catchup&#xD;
      vaccination and annually from 60 subjects per age groups (4-11mth, 14-24mth) and their&#xD;
      mothers. The investigators will include 6 clusters for each intervention arm. Sixty subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited from 3 age groups (60 children 4 to 11 months old, 60 children 14 to 24&#xD;
      months old and 120 mothers) of each clusters to achieve the primary study objectives, which&#xD;
      accumulates to 6480 samples for each cross sectional pneumococcal carriage survey. Our&#xD;
      carriage surveys in Nha Trang among healthy children as well as hospitalized children&#xD;
      admitted with acute respiratory infection found similar serotype coverage for both PCV10 and&#xD;
      PCV13 (~65% in health and ~70% in ARI children respectively)[3]. Number of cluster and sample&#xD;
      size were calculated based on Hayes and Moulton [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of intervention communes: The 3 communes in the north; Vinh Luong, Vinh Phuong, and&#xD;
      Vinh Hoa will be selected as unvaccinated communes based on the geographical background.&#xD;
      Although we will not consider these communes as controls for the study, inclusion of&#xD;
      unvaccinated communes will provide information on potential year by year carriage due to&#xD;
      introduction of new strains from outside of Nha Trang or from vaccinated communes in Nha&#xD;
      Trang. The remaining 24 communes will be randomized into 4 arms: a 2p+1 arm, a 3p+0 arm, a&#xD;
      1p+1 arm, and a 0p+1 arm. There are 8 rural and 19 urban communes in Nha Trang City. Two&#xD;
      rural communes and one urban commune were selected for the unvaccinated cluster so there were&#xD;
      6 rural and 18 urban communes left for the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial catchup vaccination: a catch up vaccination campaign will be done before the start of&#xD;
      PCV vaccine introduction. Three doses of PCV10 will be administered to all children between 2&#xD;
      - 6 months of age with an interval of 2 months between the first and second, and 7 months&#xD;
      between the second and the third doses. A catch up of two doses of PCV10 will be administered&#xD;
      to all children between 7 and 18 months of age with an interval of two months between the two&#xD;
      doses. Children between 19 and 36 months of age will receive a single dose. This is expected&#xD;
      to quickly control circulation of vaccine serotypes in these areas. The total number of&#xD;
      children less than 3 years of age in 24 communes is estimated to be approximately 18,000 (750&#xD;
      x 24). The total number of vaccine doses required is estimated to be 30,000 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCV introduction in birth cohort children: There will be 4 PCV intervention schedules; 2p+1&#xD;
      arm, 3p+0 arm, 1p+1 arm, and 0p+1 arm in this study. The children will receive PCV based on&#xD;
      which cluster/communes they reside in. This PCV vaccination work will start one month after&#xD;
      the initial catchup vaccination campaign. Based on the current census data, the investigators&#xD;
      estimate that the birth cohort of children in each communes will be 250 and there will be a&#xD;
      total of 6000 children to be vaccinated per year in 24 treatment communes. Vietnam National&#xD;
      Immunization Program vaccinate DPT-HepB-Hib vaccine at 2, 3, 4months and JE vaccine at 12&#xD;
      months. The investigators will vaccinate PCV on the same visit with the above vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and testing: Nasopharyngeal samples will be collected from the study&#xD;
      subjects. The initial screening test will be conducted at Nha Trang Pasteur Institute. DNA&#xD;
      will be extracted from the nasopharyngeal samples and screened for S.pneumoniae lytA gene by&#xD;
      realtime PCR assay. The positive samples will be cultured, DNA extracted and then the DNA&#xD;
      samples will be transported to MCRI for serotype determination by Microarray assay. Already&#xD;
      standardized protocols will be used for the testing [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach and data analysis: To address primary objective and secondary objective 1, 2 &amp; 3 we&#xD;
      will conduct annual cross sectional nasopharyngeal carriage surveys testing 60 children 4 to&#xD;
      11 months old, 60 children 14 to 24 months old and their mothers in each cluster for the&#xD;
      presence of vaccine serotype carriage in 27 communes of Nha Trang. The comparison of the&#xD;
      baseline and post-catchup vaccination carriage survey will reveal the effect of catchup&#xD;
      vaccination to children &lt;3 years of age and initial vaccination in the community. The&#xD;
      comparison of carriage prevalence in the intervention/treatment (1p+1 or 0p+1) clusters and&#xD;
      the gold standard (2p+1 or 3p+0) clusters respectively will allow age-group specific&#xD;
      assessment of non-inferiority of the 1p+1 and 0p+1 schedules if compared with the 2p+1 or&#xD;
      3p+0 schedules respectively in regard to protection against vaccine type carriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mathematical modelling analysis: Furthermore we will use the acquired data to fit a dynamic&#xD;
      metapopulation model for pneumococcal transmission to the observed changes in pneumococcal&#xD;
      carriage in the 27 study communes. The estimated model parameters will be used to predict the&#xD;
      impact of PCV in a scenario where PCV had been introduced using the 1p+1 or 0p+1 schedules in&#xD;
      all 27 communes. We will also use this framework to infer the impact of continuation with a&#xD;
      1p+1 or 0p+1 schedules in other transmission settings where PCVs have been in use and where&#xD;
      high quality allows model calibration (secondary objective 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe adverse events monitoring: Preventive medicine center in Nha Trang is responsible for&#xD;
      monitoring SAE/AE related to routine national vaccination program in Nha Trang will&#xD;
      collaborate and support on PCV related SAE monitoring activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: The investigators have already received ethical approval from Nagasaki University,&#xD;
      Nagasaki and National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Hanoi. Ministry of Health,&#xD;
      Vietnam approval was also obtained in September 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2016, October: Initial carriage study, followed by yearly carriage surveys at same month&#xD;
      every year up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2017 February: First catch-up vaccination (the second and third catch-up vaccination will&#xD;
      follow 2 months after the first dose and 7 months after the second dose) 2017 March: Start&#xD;
      the PCV introduction in 24 communes with different schedule based on their cluster&#xD;
      allocation. This PCV introduction will be for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2017, June: Post-catchup carriage survey Annual cross sectional carriage surveys will be&#xD;
      conducted in the same month with the baseline carriage survey in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and&#xD;
      2021 respectively.&#xD;
