      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) blinatumomab dose&#xD;
      administrations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) with continuous intravenous (cIV) and SC&#xD;
           administrations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) tested for blinatumomab administered&#xD;
           subcutaneously&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation following SC&#xD;
           administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacodynamics (PD) time profiles for B-and T-lymphocytes as well as&#xD;
           cytokine profiles during SC administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration&#xD;
           using Lugano criteria if positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is&#xD;
           used for evaluation&#xD;

    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
