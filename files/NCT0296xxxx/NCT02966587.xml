    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well durvalumab works in treating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer that is resistant to hormones and has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as durvalumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate to durvalumab in metastatic castration-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer (mCRPC) patients with microsatellite instability (MSI), where response rate is defined&#xD;
      either according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
      criteria or a reduction in prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of &gt;= 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the percent of mCRPC patients with MSI achieving a radiographic response per&#xD;
      modified RECIST 1.1 criteria following treatment with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the percent of mCRPC patients with MSI achieving a reduction in PSA level of &gt;=&#xD;
      50% following treatment with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the radiographic progression free survival (PFS) in hypermutated mCRPC&#xD;
      patients with MSI treated with durvalumab using modified RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue&#xD;
      metastases and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the PSA PFS rate according to PCWG3 criteria in hypermutated mCRPC patients&#xD;
      with MSI treated with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the time to response in hypermutated mCRPC patients with MSI treated with&#xD;
      durvalumab using modified RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the overall survival in hypermutated mCRPC patients with MSI treated with&#xD;
      durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine the change in PSA doubling time 12-weeks after the initiation of durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Track pain as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory during the course of treatment with&#xD;
      durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Assess the incidence and severity of adverse events according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine mismatch repair gene mutational status and mutational load (by UWOncoPlex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine mismatch repair gene mutational status, mutational load and microsatellite&#xD;
      stability from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and/or cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transcript profiling (e.g.&#xD;
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [qRT-PCR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the relative location of T-cells within the tumor microenvironment (i.e. stroma&#xD;
      vs. tumor edge) using CD3/CD8 IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate for tumor specific T-cell responses in blood and within the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment using next generation sequencing assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      4 weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,&#xD;
      and 10 months, and then every 6 months.&#xD;
