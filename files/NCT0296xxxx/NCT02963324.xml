  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of Ivermectin (IVM) in healthy human&#xD;
      volunteers and aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. Planned&#xD;
      indication is the prevention of malaria transmission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug. Recent research indicates that IVM&#xD;
      could potentially be used in malaria vector control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of IVM in healthy human volunteers and&#xD;
      aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. This model will be used to&#xD;
      characterize enterohepatic circulation, serve as a basis for drug-drug and drug-disease-state&#xD;
      interaction studies, and simulations of IVM disposition in different populations, with&#xD;
      special regard given to adolescents and children. With this, safety in individual&#xD;
      administrations can be increased, and mass drug administration programs, e.g. oral IVM as&#xD;
      malaria vector control, be simulated and planned to maximize the share of a population that&#xD;
      can be included. Capillary blood concentration profiles will also be determined to assess the&#xD;
      amount of IVM delivered to mosquitos in malaria vector control programs. Furthermore, this&#xD;
      study will validate dried blood spot analytics of IVM which will allow easier procurement of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) data in the field.&#xD;
