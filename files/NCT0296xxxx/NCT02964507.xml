  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a combination Phase I and Phase II study, with an aim to evaluate the combination of&#xD;
      GSK525762 and fulvestrant in women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who&#xD;
      have disease that has progressed after prior treatment with at least one line of endocrine&#xD;
      therapy. The objectives of the study are to first identify, in open-label single-arm Phase I,&#xD;
      a recommended Phase II dose of GSK525762 that may be combined safely with fulvestrant. Phase&#xD;
      I will follow a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, and a sentinel group&#xD;
      will be evaluated first for dose-limiting toxicity and further expanded to collect additional&#xD;
      safety data. This will be followed by a double-blind, randomized controlled Phase II, to&#xD;
      identify the clinical activity of the two study treatments when given in combination. The&#xD;
      composition of Phase II will be selected at the end of Phase I.&#xD;
