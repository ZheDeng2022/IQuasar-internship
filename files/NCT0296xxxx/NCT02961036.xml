  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Questionnaires are frequently used in online research, however recruiting, and completion&#xD;
      rates of online participants from a variety of cultures and demographic backgrounds can be&#xD;
      challenging. The challenge is greater in an online cohort because there is no way to observe&#xD;
      the participant beyond what is contributed online. Poor recruiting and completion can result&#xD;
      in underpowered research that may not be representative of the sample population. This can&#xD;
      trigger an increase in costs as the recruitment period may have to be extended until sample&#xD;
      size is reached. When recruiting and completion rates are inadequate studies may have to be&#xD;
      terminated and the answer to the research question can remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate these challenges, incentives may be offered in the form of gift certificate&#xD;
      draws. There is uncertainty about whether this strategy is effective in online research and&#xD;
      if the value of the incentive alters the outcome. A randomised trial can be used to test the&#xD;
      intervention to establish an evidence base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study (SupMatQT) proposes to link with a large 20,000 person international cohort study&#xD;
      (SupMat) that will test the utility and preferences of journal supplementary materials for&#xD;
      reviewers, authors,and readers. The research described here will examine the evidence of&#xD;
      effect for offering a prize draw incentive on rates of recruitment, and completion for&#xD;
      consented participants. All participants will be entered in the draw. Information about the&#xD;
      value of the incentive of a prize draw will differ according to what group a participant is&#xD;
      randomized to. The entry in the prize draw will not be conditional on levels of participation&#xD;
      or group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other question researchers will address is what effect do survey reminders have on&#xD;
      outcomes? All non-responders will be sent an initial reminder to complete the survey (Group&#xD;
      A) and for those who have still not responded a second reminder will be sent 14 days later&#xD;
      (Group B). Outcomes will be compared at three time points: for initial response, following&#xD;
      reminder 1(Group A), and following reminder 2 (Group B).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Role of Supplementary Material in Journal Articles is a research collaboration between&#xD;
      the BMJ, University of Oxford, and Queen's University Belfast where the research team aims to&#xD;
      explore the usage patterns of supplementary materials for journal articles by authors, peer&#xD;
      reviewers, and readers and to compare authors, peer reviewers and readers responses to these&#xD;
      materials. The large cohort provides a unique opportunity to conduct methodology research&#xD;
      with online participants using a nested cohort study defined as a study within a trial&#xD;
      (SWAT). The nested study &quot;The Role of Supplementary Material in Journal Articles&#xD;
      Questionnaire Study &quot; will explore the effects of recruitment and survey completion when a&#xD;
      prize draw for participants is included in the invitation letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large research populations can struggle to recruit participants and to obtain complete data.&#xD;
      This can have a direct effect on the robustness of the findings and can undermine the often&#xD;
      substantial investment, participants, researchers, and sponsors have made in the research.&#xD;
      This research waste may undermine public trust and community enthusiasm for the research&#xD;
      process. It may seem logical to offer a prize-winning draw as an incentive but only a trial&#xD;
      can give objective information about how well this intervention works. It is cost effective&#xD;
      to embed this research at the beginning of an existing large cohort study as funding may not&#xD;
      be available to test the intervention as a stand alone question. The additional question of&#xD;
      interest addressed will be asking whether one survey reminder or two is more effective in&#xD;
      terms of recruitment and survey completion rates. The question is practical as ineffective&#xD;
      reminders use researcher resources, increase the burden of participation on the participant&#xD;
      and could build resentment if the respondent feels &quot;spammed&quot; whereas the ideal balance of&#xD;
      reminders will result in increased recruitment and survey completion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this cohort are drawn from a convenience sample of BMJ Publishing Group's&#xD;
      journals that have a spread of Impact Factors, including the BMJ. Included journals have a&#xD;
      website and publish supplementary material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devoting time and resources to understand what strategies will mobilize participants to&#xD;
      remain motivated to join a study and complete the conditions is good planning and contributes&#xD;
      to robust methods that other researchers can replicate. To the investigators' knowledge, no&#xD;
      similar work has been conducted solely within the online population of readers, peer&#xD;
      reviewers and authors of an academic journal group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to test the effect of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Being told you will be entered into a prize draw versus not being told on survey&#xD;
           recruitment and completion rates across three surveys (authors, readers, reviewers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Entering participants into a prize draw with different values of monetary incentives on&#xD;
           survey recruitment and completion rates across three surveys (authors, readers,&#xD;
           reviewers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sending two survey reminders to each of these incentive groups on survey recruitment and&#xD;
           completion rates across three surveys (authors, readers, reviewers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question(s) this research explores is, what effect does the knowledge of being&#xD;
      entered into a prize draw have on the rates of recruitment and completion in the study and&#xD;
      does varying the value of the incentive influence the outcomes. The study will describe how&#xD;
      or if these rates differ between authors, reviewers, and readers. The second question is how&#xD;
      does one v two reminders influence recruitment and completion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (authors, reviewers ,and readers) will be invited to take part in the study and&#xD;
      will be randomized into one of five trial arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants who are non-responders will receive one reminder to complete the&#xD;
      survey (Group A), For those who are still non-responders the initial reminder will be&#xD;
      followed by an additional reminder 14 days later (Group B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group one will receive information within the invitation letter that they will be entered&#xD;
      into a prize draw to win a 100% of an Amazon gift certificate or the currency equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group two will receive information within the invitation letter that they will be entered&#xD;
      into a prize draw to win a 75% of an Amazon gift certificate or the currency equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group three will receive information within the invitation letter that they will be entered&#xD;
      into a prize draw to win a 50% of an Amazon gift certificate or the currency equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group four will receive information within the invitation letter that they will be entered&#xD;
      into a prize draw to win a 25% of an Amazon gift certificate or the currency equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group five will not receive any information about the prize draw for an Amazon gift&#xD;
      certificate in the invitation letter.&#xD;
