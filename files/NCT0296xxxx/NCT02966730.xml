  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how successful ibrutinib is at putting follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma into full remission. In this study, remission will be determined by achieving a&#xD;
      normal PET scan after treatment. A PET scan is an imaging test that looks for active&#xD;
      lymphoma. People who don't have a complete remission on PET after their first treatment are&#xD;
      at high risk for having their lymphoma return. This study will investigate if ibrutinib will&#xD;
      help participants achieve a complete remission without giving additional chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      study will also investigate any possible side effects of the study drug ibrutinib.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the rate of conversion from FDG-PET positive to negative at 12 months from the start of ibrutinib in patients receiving at least 6 months of Ibrutinib consolidation therapy for follicular lymphoma achieving at least a PR but remaining FDG-PET positive after first line chemoimmunotherapy.</description>

    <description>Participants will be receive Ibrutinib as an oral capsule preparation once daily for a period of 2 years. The dose will be 560mg daily. Toxicities will be recorded and graded. Response to treatment will be determined by FDG-PET imaging every 6 months, or as clinically indicated, in conjunction with clinical assessment by a physician, including physical examination, every 4 weeks from day 1 (baseline) for the first 3 months and then every 3 months until the end of treatment at 2 years.</description>

    <description>Ibrutinib will be administered orally, on a once daily continuous dosing schedule and in an outpatient setting. Treatment will continue for 2 years and there will be no planned treatment breaks. The dose of Ibrutinib will be initiated at 560mg per day, which will remain constant throughout the study period, unless otherwise specified.</description>
