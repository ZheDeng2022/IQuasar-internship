  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hospitalizations for a diagnosis of angioedema doubled from the year 2000 to&#xD;
      2009. Although some of the cases represented hereditary angioedema or ace-inhibitor induced&#xD;
      angioedema, the majority of episodes were idiopathic. Idiopathic Angioedema (IAE) can be&#xD;
      life- threatening especially when affecting tissues within the respiratory tract. No clear&#xD;
      guidelines exist for management of this important condition for clinicians. Current therapies&#xD;
      typically include avoidance of potential triggers and use of medications either for&#xD;
      prophylaxis or for acute events, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine.&#xD;
      There remains a critical need for therapeutic options to provide more effective prophylaxis.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial which will&#xD;
      study the effects of omalizumab on patients with 2 or more episodes of Idiopathic Angioedema&#xD;
      (IAE) in the past 6 months, despite current therapy. This study has three periods; screening,&#xD;
      treatment, and follow-up. Subjects in the screening period will be consented and screened for&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. 40 qualified individuals will enter the treatment period. Individuals&#xD;
      will be randomized to either monthly subcutaneous administration of omalizumab 300mg (20&#xD;
      subjects) versus monthly placebo injection (20 subjects) in addition to their previously&#xD;
      prescribed management plan for a total of 6 months. Individuals will then enter a follow-up&#xD;
      period of 4 months. Study visits will occur monthly during the treatment period for update of&#xD;
      clinical status and administration of omalizumab/placebo injection. After, the treatment&#xD;
      period individuals will be seen twice for follow-up period. The entire study will consist of&#xD;
      10 study visits and will last approx. 10 months.&#xD;
