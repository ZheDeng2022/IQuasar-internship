      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dentinal fluid (tooth fluid) of teeth with&#xD;
      or without a painful inflammatory condition in their nerve (pulp) contain inflammatory&#xD;
      marker.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to use an improved sampling method for collection of MMP-9 to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that MMP-9 levels are significantly elevated in the dentinal fluid of&#xD;
      symptomatic (painful) human permanent teeth compared to asymptomatic counterparts that need&#xD;
      replacement of a filling, and pulp necrotic teeth. Moreover, the dynamics of MMP-9 expression&#xD;
      after removal of the causative stimulus for pulpitis is to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the total MMP-9 levels of dentinal fluid collected during dental treatment using a&#xD;
      human MMP-9 fluorescent assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the day service of the Center of Dental Medicine Zurich will be screened.&#xD;
      Patients matching the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study. Upon&#xD;
      written informed consent, the affected tooth gets anesthetized, isolated with rubber dam and&#xD;
      receives one of the following treatment procedures: caries removal and restoration, tooth&#xD;
      filling replacement and restoration, or root canal treatment (because of irreversible&#xD;
      pulpitis, or pulp necrosis). After caries removal, removal of the defect tooth filling, or&#xD;
      during access cavity preparation, a cellulose membrane (paper point) will be applied with its&#xD;
      blunt end to the dentin for 1 min to collect dentinal fluid. The cellulose membrane will be&#xD;
      stored until the laboratory analysis. Depending on the individual treatment plan of the&#xD;
      patient, the tooth will subsequently receive root canal treatment, its final restoration, or&#xD;
      a temporization with glass-ionomer cement for coverage of the dentinal wound and&#xD;
      reinforcement of the remaining tooth structure. Final restoration of a tooth with composite,&#xD;
      a partial crowns, or full-coverage crown can be technically demanding, time consuming, and&#xD;
      frequently involves multiple patient visits. Teeth that receive root canal treatment, or the&#xD;
      final restoration are sampled once. When a patient with a temporized tooth returns for the&#xD;
      final restoration, the sampling procedure (appliance of a cellulose membrane to the dentin&#xD;
      for 1 min and storage for further analyses) will be repeated. Any further treatment will be&#xD;
      continued without further impairments. The investigation does not alter the treatment plan of&#xD;
      any patient (either participating in one, or two sampling procedures, or in the study at&#xD;
      all).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a previously performed study (Zehnder et al., 2011), which used a similar&#xD;
      experimental set-up and had 31 participants (2 groups), it is aimed to recruit 60&#xD;
      participants for the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMP-9 levels in dentinal fluid sampled from teeth with painful (irreversible) pulpitis will&#xD;
      be compared to MMP-9 levels of teeth without clinical signs and symptoms. Moreover, the MMP-9&#xD;
      levels of teeth showing an painless pulpitis (teeth affected by a caries lesion) will be&#xD;
      compared to a repeated sample of the same tooth collected after removal of the caries lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMP-9 contents in the clinical samples will be determined against a standard curve&#xD;
      (4-parameter logistic curve fit) obtained from the recombinant pro-MMP-9 standard dilution&#xD;
      series. Values between groups will be compared by using Mann-Whitney U test, with the&#xD;
      alpha-type error set at 0.05.&#xD;
