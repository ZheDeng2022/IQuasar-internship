  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing evaluation has been designed to consistently investigate the subject's&#xD;
      preference when switching from a Medtronic® constant voltage or constant current device to a&#xD;
      St Jude Medical Infinity™ or St Jude Medical Brio™ constant current system. As electrodes&#xD;
      will not be re-positioned, differences in subject's preference are to be explained by the&#xD;
      difference in shape of the delivered pulse or waveform between the two systems.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of subjects who indicate preference on constant current over constant voltage at the 3 Month follow-up visit will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of safety events related to battery replacement procedures for hybrid systems</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after IPG replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The event rate will be summarized as (1) number of events per patient-year of follow up and (2) incidence rate. The number of events per patient-year of follow-up will be calculated as the total number of safety events related to battery replacement procedures for hybrid systems divided by total follow-up duration from IPG replacement visit to either 12 months visit or withdrawal visit (patient-years). The incidence rate (%) will be calculated as number of subjects who undergo IPG replacement and encounter safety events related to battery replacement procedure for hybrid system divided by total subjects who undergo IPG replacement.</description>

        Subjects who have a diagnosis matching the approved indication and are being considered for&#xD;
        an IPG replacement comprise the target population of this study. All subjects who meet the&#xD;
        inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and have signed an Ethics Committee (EC) or&#xD;
        Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent will be considered enrolled in&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is bilaterally treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic&#xD;
             nucleus (STN) using a constant voltage device (i.e. Soletra™, Itrel™, Kinetra™,&#xD;
             ActivaPC™ or ActivaRC™ IPG) and in the Investigator's opinion, is responding&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject needs and/or requests an IPG replacement within 12 months after consent and&#xD;
             the current IPG has at least 2.6 V output left (i.e. approx. 30% of full battery&#xD;
             capacity) at the time of subject enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PD symptom onset is no longer than 20 years;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is fluent speaker (as judged by the investigator) of the language spoken in&#xD;
             the country where the investigational site is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IPG battery has less than 30% battery life at the time of consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need to replace or reposition the leads or extensions during the IPG replacement&#xD;
             procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had &gt;10 recurrent falls experienced in the 3 months prior to consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unwilling to change to either a St Jude Medical Infinity™ or a St Jude&#xD;
             Medical Brio™ DBS system for the IPG replacement;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unable to attend the study visits.&#xD;
