  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recommendations concerning the administration of Zostavax® in patients with antibody&#xD;
      deficiency are unclear. The investigators plan to assess the immunogenicity and safety of&#xD;
      Zostavax® in patients with antibody deficiency as compared with healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common variable immune deficiency (CVID), specific antibody deficiency (SAD), and X-linked&#xD;
      agammaglobulinemia (XLA) are among the most common primary antibody deficiencies in which the&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment is gammaglobulin replacement. The use of high doses of immunoglobulin&#xD;
      replacement therapy and the early recognition of co-morbid diseases during the course of&#xD;
      CVID, SAD, and XLA has improved survival and led to an aging population of CVID, SAD, and XLA&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of all&#xD;
      persons aged &gt;60 years with 1 dose of vaccine directed against herpes zoster (Zostavax®) in&#xD;
      the absence of any contraindications. Current standard of care includes avoidance of all&#xD;
      vaccines when receiving gammaglobulin products due to passive immunity obtained from&#xD;
      gammaglobulin against vaccine preventable infections. The exception to this rule is that&#xD;
      patients on gammaglobulin should receive the yearly influenza vaccine due to its enhanced&#xD;
      cell mediated immunity against the influenza virus. Clinical immunologists currently have no&#xD;
      data upon which to advise patients receiving gammaglobulin replacement including those with&#xD;
      CVID, SAD, and XLA concerning use of Zostavax®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All gammaglobulin replacement products maintain protective antibody levels against VZV.&#xD;
      However, humoral immune responses with anti-VZV antibodies are relatively constant and do not&#xD;
      protect against the development of shingles. Varicella zoster virus specific cell mediated&#xD;
      immunity (VZV-CMI), which is T cell dependent, is the critical component in preventing herpes&#xD;
      zoster (shingles). VZV-CMI diminishes with age leaving the elderly most susceptible to&#xD;
      shingles. Several studies have concluded that boosting VZV-CMI protects older adults from&#xD;
      developing herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations on the prevention of herpes zoster published in the Morbidity and Mortality&#xD;
      Weekly Report (MMWR) by the Centers for disease control (CDC) in May 2008 make the following&#xD;
      statements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Zoster vaccine should not be administered to persons with primary or acquired&#xD;
           immunodeficiency including:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Persons with clinical or laboratory evidence of other unspecified cellular&#xD;
           immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persons with impaired humoral immunity (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia or&#xD;
           dysgammaglobulinemia) can/should receive zoster vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that vaccination with Zostavax® in adults with CVID, SAD, and&#xD;
      XLA who have evidence of normal cell mediated immunity with normal T cell quantities and&#xD;
      function will have a boost in VZV-CMI thereby reducing susceptibility to shingles and PHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful completion of this study will provide clinical immunologists with data upon which&#xD;
      to advise antibody deficient patients concerning the use of Zostavax®.&#xD;
