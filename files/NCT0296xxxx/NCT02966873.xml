    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled Phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in reducing Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) severity and Post Traumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptomatology among individuals with current AUD and PTSD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed Phase II study is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC), in reducing (1) Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) severity and (2) Post&#xD;
      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptomatology among individuals (N=200) with current AUD&#xD;
      and PTSD. We will also use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and proton magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate the neural circuitry and neurochemistry&#xD;
      underlying comorbid AUD/PTSD and prognostic indicators of positive treatment response.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of NAC on impairment in associated areas of&#xD;
      functioning (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep, risky behaviors). In order to accomplish this&#xD;
      we will (1) employ an intent-to-treat, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial that will consist of 12 weeks of treatment with NAC (2400 mg per day) or placebo&#xD;
      medication; (2) examine standardized, repeated dependent measures of clinical outcomes at&#xD;
      baseline, week 6, week 12, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up; and (3) employ advanced&#xD;
      neuroimaging methodologies, a laboratory cue paradigm, and collect biologic measures of&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. All participants will also undergo weekly individual cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy sessions (CBT).The following specific aims are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as compared to placebo,&#xD;
      in reducing alcohol use severity (i.e., total standard drinks, percent days drinking,&#xD;
      abstinence rates) and craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as compared to placebo,&#xD;
      in reducing self-report and clinician-rated PTSD symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To use multimodal neuroimaging techniques to investigate the pathophysiology&#xD;
      underlying AUD and comorbid PTSD, and prognostic indicators of treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will answer critical questions regarding the potential of NAC as an&#xD;
      effective pharmacotherapy for AUD and comorbid PTSD, and elucidate possible mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying improved outcomes. This study has the particular advantage of building directly on&#xD;
      positive preliminary findings by (1) further testing NAC in the treatment of individuals with&#xD;
      co-occurring AUD/PTSD using a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design; (2)&#xD;
      measuring functioning in related areas, such as depression and risky behaviors; (3) employing&#xD;
      innovative measurements including neuroimaging and laboratory cue paradigms; and (4)&#xD;
      employing a multidisciplinary team of experts who have successfully collaborated in the past&#xD;
      and are uniquely qualified to implement this type of investigation. This project is directly&#xD;
      responsive to the mission of the National Institute of Alcohol and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the&#xD;
      new AUD/PTSD initiative in that it seeks to evaluate a promising therapeutic agent for the&#xD;
      treatment of AUD/PTSD and identify neurobiological mechanisms common to AUD/PTSD as potential&#xD;
      treatment targets. The findings from this study have the potential to significantly improve&#xD;
      the standard of patient care, advance the comorbidity science in this area, and decrease&#xD;
      public health expenditures associated with AUD and comorbid PTSD.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female; any race or ethnicity; age 18 to 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be able to comprehend English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current alcohol use disorder (AUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current PTSD or subthreshold PTSD. Subjects may also meet&#xD;
             criteria for a mood disorder (except bipolar affective disorder, see Exclusion&#xD;
             Criteria) or other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia,&#xD;
             generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder). The inclusion of&#xD;
             subjects with affective and other anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked&#xD;
             frequency of the co-existence of mood and other anxiety disorders among patients with&#xD;
             AUD and PTSD (Brady et al., 2000; Kessler et al., 2005). Subjects may meet DSM-5&#xD;
             criteria for another substance use disorder as long as AUD is the primary substance of&#xD;
             choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a stable&#xD;
             dose for at least four weeks before treatment initiation. This is because initiation&#xD;
             or change of medications during the course of the trial may interfere with&#xD;
             interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must consent to random assignment to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must consent to complete all treatment and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must live within 50 miles (one hour) of MUSC in Charleston, SC or be willing to travel&#xD;
             to MUSC for visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for a history of or current psychotic or bipolar&#xD;
             affective disorders, as the study protocol may be therapeutically insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a current eating disorder (bulimia, anorexia nervosa) or with&#xD;
             dissociative identity disorder, as they are likely to require specific time-intensive&#xD;
             psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, as evidence by a score of 10 or&#xD;
             above on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA). These&#xD;
             subjects will be referred for clinical detoxification and may be re-assessed for study&#xD;
             eligibility after medically supervised detoxification has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals considered an immediate suicide risk or who are likely to require&#xD;
             hospitalization during the course of the study for suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women who are pregnant, nursing or not practicing an effective form of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of liver failure; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase (AST) levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal; asthma&#xD;
             or any clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would adversely affect safety or study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, methotrexate, 6 azauridine triacetate,&#xD;
             or nitroglycerin within the last 14 days or any other medication felt to have a&#xD;
             hazardous interaction if taken with NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of childhood or adult seizures of any cause.&#xD;
