  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lithium remains the gold-standard treatment for bipolar disorder, with 30-40% of patients&#xD;
      with responding preferentially to this medication. Additionally, lithium is commonly used in&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression, and other psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder). Lithium is especially valuable considering the great difficulty in achieving and&#xD;
      maintaining symptomatic remission, the high rates of disability, as well as tremendous&#xD;
      personal, family, and societal costs associated with bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depression. Despite this, clinicians are increasingly avoiding lithium, largely due to fear&#xD;
      of irreversible chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that lithium exposure, even when dosed safely (&lt;1.0mmol/L in adults 11 and&#xD;
      &lt;0.8mmol/L in geriatric patients 12,13), can increase the risk of CKD by 3 times, in large&#xD;
      part through Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) 14-19. NDI itself has also been associated&#xD;
      with acute kidney injury 20, and life-threatening hypernatremia, which is an electrolyte&#xD;
      imbalance characterized by high levels of blood sodium. Aside from hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, aging, and other nonspecific CKD risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NDI is characterized by excessive thirst (polydipsia) due to increased production of dilute&#xD;
      urine (polyuria). In NDI, lithium is believed to interact with the inositol monophosphate and&#xD;
      protein kinase C pathways, thereby affecting calcium-related intracellular signaling, cyclic&#xD;
      AMP (cAMP), inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 Beta (GSK3Beta), activation of MAP&#xD;
      Kinase and many other pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NDI occurs commonly in lithium users: 50% of chronic lithium users have urinary concentrating&#xD;
      difficulties, with 12-19% have decreased urine osmolality (UOsm) &lt;300mOsm/Kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, amiloride (5-20mg/day) is the only medication with prior evidence of therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness in NDI from randomized clinical trials. However as a potassium-sparing diuretic&#xD;
      31, amiloride can lead to lithium-level elevations, and can thereby theoretically increase&#xD;
      the risk of lithium-associated CNS and acute renal toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for novel, well-tolerated agents for the treatment of lithium-induced NDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently demonstrated that statins, which are well-tolerated and commonly used&#xD;
      medications, are associated with low lithium-induced NDI risk in the first and only previous&#xD;
      cross-sectional study examining statins and NDI in humans (n=71) 33. In this study we&#xD;
      examined current lithium users aged 20-95, who had a mean lithium duration and serum lithium&#xD;
      level of 10.6 years and 0.62mmol/L, respectively. Patients were assessed for UOsm following&#xD;
      10-hour water-restriction, a reliable measure of NDI. We found that 0% (0/17) of statin users&#xD;
      compared to 20.4% (11/54) on non-users had UOsm &lt;300mOsm/Kg following 10-hour&#xD;
      water-restriction (Fisher's Exact p=0.055). The main statin prescribed in our previous study&#xD;
      was atorvastatin 10-40mg/day (n=10) 33, which is the most widely used statin for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Atorvastatin and other statins are well-tolerated and have not been&#xD;
      found to have adverse effects on mood, cognition, or renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which statins may treat NDI is not yet known, but two independent mice&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of statins in treating genetic forms of NDI. In&#xD;
      those mice models of genetic NDI, prostaglandin and intracellular cytoskeleton proteins&#xD;
      pathways were thought to explain statins' activity on NDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for this project, our co-investigators Drs. Trepiccione and Christensen have&#xD;
      initiated a pilot study in mice to investigate whether atorvastatin treatment could improve&#xD;
      the lithium-induced NDI. NDI was induced in 10 mice by feeding mice with a LiCl-enriched diet&#xD;
      for 15 days. After induction of NDI, a group of mice received intraperitoneal injection of&#xD;
      atorvastatin (n=5) and a control group received vehicle (n=5) for additional 5 days in&#xD;
      parallel with continued lithium treatment. Although our small statistical sample do not allow&#xD;
      us to reach significance, (n=5 per group), the mice receiving atorvastatin showed a tendency&#xD;
      to reduce polyuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with this research, our present research protocol aims at conducting a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial investigating a statin, such as atorvastatin, in the treatment of&#xD;
      lithium-induced NDI.&#xD;
