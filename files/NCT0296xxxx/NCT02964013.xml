  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) study of vibostolimab (MK-7684) as&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) or pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed&#xD;
      and carboplatin in adults with metastatic solid tumors for which there is no available&#xD;
      therapy that is expected to convey clinical benefit. Part A of this study is a dose&#xD;
      escalation and confirmation phase to estimate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) for&#xD;
      vibostolimab monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin.&#xD;
      Part A will also evaluate the anti-tumor activity of vibostolimab in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin in participants with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) and vibostolimab (at two dose levels) in combination with pembrolizumab in Japanese&#xD;
      participants with gastric cancer. Part B will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      vibostolimab at the RPTD when used as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      participants with advanced solid tumors in a non-randomized study design. Part B will also&#xD;
      evaluate 2 doses of vibostolimab in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with&#xD;
      programmed death 1 (PD-1) treatment na√Øve cancer using a 1:1 randomized study design. Part B&#xD;
      is expanded with Amendment 11 to include an additional arm that will compare the safety and&#xD;
      PK of a fixed dose of pembrolizumab/vibostolimab coformulation (MK-7684A) to vibostolimab in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab administered as separate intravenous infusions. Part A is&#xD;
      expanded with Amendment 12 to include an additional arm that will compare the safety and PK&#xD;
      of vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab plus the investigator's choice of platinum agent&#xD;
      (carboplatin or cisplatin), and etoposide. Part B is expanded with Amendment 12 to include&#xD;
      evaluation of efficacy of vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab plus the investigator's choice of&#xD;
      platinum agent (carboplatin or cisplatin), and etoposide and efficacy of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab/vibostolimab coformulation in participants from mainland China. The primary&#xD;
      hypotheses are that vibostolimab administered as monotherapy or in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab is safe and tolerable when administered at the RPTD and that&#xD;
      pembrolizumab/vibostolimab coformulation is safe and tolerable when administered as a fixed&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
