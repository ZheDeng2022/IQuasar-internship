    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac condition that results in patients experiencing an&#xD;
      irregular heart beat resulting in symptoms including palpitations and breathlessness. It is&#xD;
      known that in most cases, AF is caused by abnormal electrical activity from the top of the&#xD;
      left side of the heart (left atrium) which overrides the heart natural pacemaker in the right&#xD;
      atrium. Treatment options include tablets which suppress this abnormal electrical activity,&#xD;
      but in some patients these are not sufficient and a procedure is carried out where the areas&#xD;
      of abnormal electrical activity are disconnected or 'ablated' to prevent AF from occurring.&#xD;
      This treatment is well established and performed worldwide, often under general anaesthetic&#xD;
      (GA). The heart and lungs sit close together in the chest, and when the lungs are inflated&#xD;
      and deflated during the procedure, the heart also moves. This movement is then transmitted to&#xD;
      the special wires or 'catheters' that are placed inside the heart to deliver the ablation&#xD;
      treatment. Instability during the treatment can result in ineffective areas of ablation which&#xD;
      may later contribute to reduced success of the procedure. Previous research has shown that by&#xD;
      reducing the movement of the heart under anaesthesia using alternative techniques can improve&#xD;
      catheter stability and improve procedural results. Once such technique is called high&#xD;
      frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) which allows the lungs to filled with air using fast and&#xD;
      shallow breaths resulting in normal blood oxygen levels with little movement in the heart.&#xD;
      This technique has been shown to be safe and effective for this procedure but a direct&#xD;
      comparison with conventional ventilation has not been done. The investigators wish to test&#xD;
      this and determine if using HFJV improves outcomes during the procedure (i.e. can&#xD;
      investigators do the treatment faster and more effectively) and if this translates to better&#xD;
      outcomes long term.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation for the treatment of the symptoms of fibrillation is now a well-established&#xD;
      technique. The technique is complex and commonly undertaken under general anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Catheters are introduced into the circulation from the veins at the top of the leg and&#xD;
      advanced to the right side of the heart. Using x-ray and ultrasound guidance, the catheters&#xD;
      are passed to the left atrium by puncturing the muscle that divides left and right atria&#xD;
      (septum). A model of the left atrium is created and this used to guide the movement of an&#xD;
      ablation catheter across the tissue and create ablation lesions that lead to electrical&#xD;
      isolation of target sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under general anaesthesia, the lungs are inflated and deflated via the ventilator circuit.&#xD;
      The expansion of the lungs results in movement of the heart with each respiratory cycle. This&#xD;
      leads to catheter instability as the tissue is moved towards and away from a catheter&#xD;
      positioned in the left atrium. This movement is particularly marked at the back of the left&#xD;
      atrium. This instability can lead to real time variation in the delivery of energy which can&#xD;
      result in ineffective lesions. These will then translate acutely to incomplete isolation and&#xD;
      the need for further ablation (thereby increasing procedure time) and later into reconnection&#xD;
      of tissue which can result in repeated procedures being needed to achieve an effective&#xD;
      outcome. Each procedure carries risk of minor and major complications therefore measures to&#xD;
      improve first time success are critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research supports the use of steerable catheter sheaths (tubes through which the&#xD;
      catheters travel to the atria) and 3 dimensional mapping in improving ablation parameters.&#xD;
      Data also exists demonstrating significant variation in catheter contact despite these&#xD;
      measures. In order to improve catheter stability further, changes to the mode of ventilation&#xD;
      has been studied. Small studies have shown that by stopping cardiac movement altogether by&#xD;
      transiently stopping ventilation (apnoea) catheter stability is improved and ablation is more&#xD;
      effective. However, intermittent apnoea is not an effective method of ventilation in long&#xD;
      cases. An alternative is high frequency jet ventilation. This is where the lungs are&#xD;
      ventilated with low volume, high speed and high pressure breaths. This technique is well&#xD;
      established and has safety data in upper airway surgery and liver radiology procedures where&#xD;
      movement of airways and diaphragm needs to be minimized. In view of this, this technique has&#xD;
      been studied in AF ablation and has been shown to improve catheter stability and energy&#xD;
      delivery with no increase in complications related to the mode of ventilation. However,&#xD;
      existing studies have focused mainly in paroxysmal AF patients (where less ablation is&#xD;
      needed) and conducted in a non randomized trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to research the use of HFJV in patients undergoing ablation for&#xD;
      persistent AF in a prospective and randomised trial to answer the primary and secondary&#xD;
      questions shown below.&#xD;
