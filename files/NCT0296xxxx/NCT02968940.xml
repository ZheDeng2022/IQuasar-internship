  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how safe and effective treatment with the combination of&#xD;
      Avelumab and radiation is for IDH mutant gliomas that have transformed to glioblastoma after&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human antibody of&#xD;
      the immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) isotype that specifically targets and blocks the Programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1(PD-L1) for Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the&#xD;
      suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells,&#xD;
      resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.&#xD;
