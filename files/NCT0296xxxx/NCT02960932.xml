    <textblock>
      Muscles, paretics and spastics, of cerebral palsy children have very early, for growth (three&#xD;
      at five aged), every alteration of theirs properties. Gastrocnemius muscle, often reaches on&#xD;
      the cerebral palsy, characterised by a modification of the structure (volume decrease) and&#xD;
      the elasticity (increase of the passive stiffness). Every alterations of the muscular&#xD;
      property have impact clinic and functional important. The many treatments of orthopaedic&#xD;
      targeting (lengthening of cast, injections of botulinic toxin), repeated to a multiple&#xD;
      recovery during the growth influences the muscular characteristics. There is a real interest&#xD;
      to measure the muscular property development during children's growth.&#xD;

      Elastography is a technical assessment of characteristic of the soft tissues. In this area,&#xD;
      the method &quot; Supersonic Shear ImagingÂ® (SSI) &quot; provide an important technological change&#xD;
      measuring, swiftly and no invasive, a elasticity modulus reflecting the property&#xD;
      visco-elastic of the muscle. A lot of ex vivo study led in isolated muscle and in vivo in&#xD;
      healthy adults demonstrated the validity of the method SSI on the evaluation of the passive&#xD;
      stiffness from a number of muscle group whose the gastrocnemius muscle. The main objective of&#xD;
      this study must be checked the intersession reproducibility of the method SSI on the&#xD;
      evaluation of the passive stiffness at the medial bundle of the gastrocnemius muscle&#xD;
      therefore their passive lengthening in cerebral palsy children. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      test the correlation level of the relation elasticity modulus/ joint angle and couple&#xD;
      force-angle obtained throughout the passive lengthening at the medial bundle of the&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscle in cerebral palsy children.&#xD;
