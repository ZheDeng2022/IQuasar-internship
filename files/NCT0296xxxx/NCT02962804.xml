  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two primary aims in the study: 1) to determine the tolerability and feasibility of&#xD;
      combination hypofractionated radiation therapy and PD-1 inhibition with nivolumab, and 2) to&#xD;
      determine the ability of hypofractionated radiation therapy to enhance response rate from&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibition versus PD-1 inhibition alone by comparing the observed response rate under&#xD;
      the combination therapy with a previously reported response rate under inhibition alone.&#xD;

      Patients with metastatic or recurrent renal cell cancer who have progressed on standard&#xD;
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy and who have metastatic or primary tumors suitable&#xD;
      for palliative radiation will be eligible for this study. Treatment will consist of nivolumab&#xD;
      plus hypofractionated radiation therapy. The primary endpoint will be objective response&#xD;
      rate, which will be compared against the historical control of 25% using nivolumab alone as&#xD;
      established in the CHECKMATE 025 clinical trial. Patients will continue on nivolumab until&#xD;
      disease progression or withdrawal of consent. Follow-up will continue for 2 years.&#xD;
