  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      50-90% of patients with RA reports foot problems and the metatarsophalangeal joints of the&#xD;
      forefoot are most frequently afflicted. Studies shows that foot problems can influence&#xD;
      negatively on the walking function, physical activity and quality of life. Different foot&#xD;
      orthoses and insoles are used as an intervention. Studies find that different insoles do have&#xD;
      effect on pain, but there are no or minor effect on walking ability. The literature reports a&#xD;
      further need for research and indicates the importance of studies on the effects of&#xD;
      cost-effective insoles for patients with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Custom-built insoles takes time and are often expensive, and many patients, especially women,&#xD;
      do not wear them since they often do not fit the shoes they prefer to wear. In this study, a&#xD;
      4-mm thin, flat insole of a malleable plastic material (CI-Core®) with synthetic textile&#xD;
      material on the upper side is customized to provide support for the transverse and&#xD;
      longitudinal arches of the foot to reduce pressure on painful joints. The insole is easily&#xD;
      customized and ready for use the same day. The purpose of this study was to determine whether&#xD;
      this insole can reduce foot pain and increase walking distance in patients with RA and&#xD;
      forefoot pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental study was performed on patients with RA and forefoot pain in either one or&#xD;
      both feet. The patients walked as fast as they could in 6 minutes (6MWT) with either insoles&#xD;
      (situation A) and without insoles (situation B). The order of situation A and B was&#xD;
      randomized, and the assessor was blinded for the order of the two situations. Both tests were&#xD;
      conducted the same day. After each test round, the patient was asked to register pain in the&#xD;
      foot and perceived exertion. A telephone interview was conducted one year after the effect&#xD;
      study to examine whether the insoles were still being used.&#xD;
