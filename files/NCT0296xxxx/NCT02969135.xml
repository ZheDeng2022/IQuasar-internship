  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder disorders are extremely common, with a life-time prevalence in population of 30%.&#xD;
      About 23% of the working population with shoulder problems are sick-listed. Specifically&#xD;
      rotator cuff tears are considered some of the principal causes of chronic shoulder pain and&#xD;
      disability, especially with advancing age. The National Patient Register in Denmark has&#xD;
      registered 730 rotator cuff repairs in 2006 and 990 in 2012, which represents a 35% increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rotator cuff tear is defined as a rupture of the tendon (s) of the shoulder, and most&#xD;
      frequently involves the supraspinatus and/or the infraspinatus tendon, resulting in loss of&#xD;
      function due to pain and tissue weakness. Little is known about the effects of the&#xD;
      postoperative training/rehabilitation, and this provides an unclear picture of the total&#xD;
      treatment procedure of this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish National Clinical Guidelines from 2013 recommend that these patients are offered&#xD;
      rehabilitation and that the shoulder is immobilized post-surgery, but the evidence for&#xD;
      postoperative training is moderate- low. The past few years, there have been conducted 5&#xD;
      systematic reviews looking at different rehabilitation parameters after rotator cuff surgery.&#xD;
      They conclude that early Range-Of-Motion exercise accelerate healing, reduce stiffness, do&#xD;
      not increase risk of re-rupture and that immobilization do not increase tendon healing or&#xD;
      clinical outcome. They also conclude that there is a further need to evaluate approaches that&#xD;
      foster early initiation of rehabilitation and gradual introduction of functional load in&#xD;
      high-quality, adequately powered trials, also considering key outcomes such as return to&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of a progressive early passive and&#xD;
      active movement protocol with a care as usual (limited early passive movement protocol) on&#xD;
      tendon healing, physical function, pain, and quality of life, in patients operated due to&#xD;
      traumatic full thickness rotator cuff tear in a Randomized Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortterm effects of physical function, pain, and quality of life will be studied as primary&#xD;
      patient reported outcome, while secondary outcomes will be clinical and paraclinical outcomes&#xD;
      in addition to the longterm effects of physical function, pain, and quality of life.&#xD;
