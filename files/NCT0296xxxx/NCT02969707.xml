  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to use functional neuroimaging (fMRI) to understand the brain systems&#xD;
      affected when hypnosis and hypnotic analgesia are augmented with repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation to 100 people with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition. The investigators will measure the effect of&#xD;
      rTMS-augmentation on the brain networks underlying hypnotizability, as well as the effect of&#xD;
      rTMS-augmentation on hypnotic analgesia networks. The investigators hope to demonstrate that&#xD;
      a combination of these psychological and neuromodulatory treatments will be more effective&#xD;
      than hypnosis alone, thereby enhancing the depth of hypnosis, range of hypnosis and the&#xD;
      efficacy of hypnotic analgesia and hopefully creating a new treatment modality for&#xD;
      individuals suffering from pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia pain.&#xD;

      Overall Study Design. The investigators propose to develop a combinatory approach where an&#xD;
      integrative technique (hypnosis) is augmented with a neurotechnology (repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation). This application seeks to utilize the previously established&#xD;
      brain-based mechanisms of both hypnosis and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as&#xD;
      biomarkers to assess the potential synergistic mechanism of this combinatory approach. 100&#xD;
      low-moderately hypnotizable subjects with fibromyalgia will be identified. The subjects'&#xD;
      response to rTMS-augmentation of hypnosis will be measured. The volunteers will be randomized&#xD;
      to active or sham rTMS. Two scan sessions will be performed for each subject, with the first&#xD;
      scan session investigating the effect of rTMS-augmentation on hypnosis and hypnotizability&#xD;
      (120 min scan session) and the second scan session focused on the effect of rTMS-augmented&#xD;
      hypnotic analgesia (120 min scan session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require that participants participate in an in-person screening visit, a&#xD;
      screening MRI scan and 2 MRI scan sessions that include the TMS and hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design. Before each MRI scan session, participants will undergo a preparation&#xD;
      session, where hypnotizability and either psychological testing or experimental pain training&#xD;
      will be conducted. Volunteer subjects will then participate in 2 MRI scan sessions on two&#xD;
      separate days, each lasting approximately 120 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnosis induction procedures. Hypnosis will be induced while the subject is in the scanner&#xD;
      though the use of headphones and a pre-recorded induction script. Hypnotic instructions will&#xD;
      be standardized, and will involve a simple induction instruction used in our prior research&#xD;
      on the brain signature of the hypnotic state and in clinical care. The ability to enter and&#xD;
      maintain the hypnotic state through such an induction mechanism in the fMRI environment has&#xD;
      been previously demonstrated.&#xD;

    <measure>The Change in Functional Connectivity (FC) Between the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (L-DLPFC) and the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 15-20 min post-TMS (up to 30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional MRI (fMRI) measures changes in oxygenated blood in the brain; at rest these levels fluctuate over time. These fluctuations can be similar between different brain regions. FC is the similarity in fluctuations of these fMRI signals and suggests how strongly two regions communicate with each other. We measured how inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over L-DLPFC changes FC between L-DLPFC and dACC. This was done by estimating z-transformed correlation coefficients (CC) for each voxel (-1 to 1) between the L-DLPFC and dACC pre and post cTBS intervention. Negative FC was assigned to voxels with a weight &lt; 0, positive FC to voxels with weight&gt; 0. Total FC includes positive and negative voxels. The change in FC is regarded as the change in the sum of these weighted voxels from pre to post cTBS for total, positive and negative FC, respectively. Greater sums of voxels correspond to more significant levels of coordinated activity (positive, negative, or total).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 15-20 min post-TMS (up to 30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>We examined the effect of active, inhibitory cTBS over L-DLPFC on functional connectivity (FC) in key nodes in the neural network underlying the conflict regulation system. FC between each voxel in the L-DLPFC and the entire dACC was established by estimating z-transformed correlation coefficients (CC) for each voxel (-1 to 1) pre and post cTBS intervention. This paradigm was also used for voxels in the Default Mode Network (DMN) (Schaefer, 2018; Yeo, 2011) to the entire right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Negative FC was assigned to voxels with a weight &lt; 0, positive FC to voxels with weight &gt; 0. Total FC includes positive and negative voxels. The change in FC is regarded as the change in the sum of these weighted voxels from pre to post cTBS for total, positive and negative FC, respectively. Greater sums of voxels correspond to more significant levels of coordinated activity (positive, negative, or total).</description>

    <measure>Stroop Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 15-20 min post-TMS (up to 30 min)</time_frame>
    <description>Active, inhibitory cTBS effect over L-DLPFC on the neural network that underlies the hypnotic Stroop modulation effect was determined by first estimating the average of connectivity weights for all parcel pairs linking Ventral Attentional Network (VAN) to the DMN. Parcels are determined by extracting mean resting state BOLD time-series for each region of the Schaefer 100 parcellation. A correlation matrix between all parcels is created and FC weights for each pair are established by estimating z-transformed correlation coefficients (CC) (-1 to 1). Each parcel pair is then assigned to one of the 7 resting state networks defined by Yeo et al., (2011). Negative FC is defined for parcel pairs with a weight &lt; 0, positive FC pairs with weight &gt; 0 and total FC includes all pairs. FC is thus the average value between parcel pairs in the DMN and VAN pre/post TMS. Greater sums of weighted pairs correspond to more significant levels of coordinated activity (positive, negative, or total).</description>

          <title>Active rTMS</title>
          <description>The active group received active repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
Active repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: The investigators performed two applications of 40s of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) form of rTMS at 80% resting motor threshold (previously determined), with a 15 minute intersession interval. The standardized treatment location for the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was determined by Localite Neuronavigation and targeted at the posterior middle frontal gyrus. The baseline structural scan obtained during the scan 1 was utilized for this localization process. rTMS was delivered using a MagPro TMS system (MagVenture, Denmark).</description>

          <title>Sham rTMS</title>
          <description>The sham repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation group had the stimulation blocked.&#xD;
Sham repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: This was identical to active rTMS except the stimulation was blocked. Both active and sham repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation received simulation from a specially designed coil which is capable of delivering either active rTMS or sham rTMS in a manner, which is randomized by the system itself and therefore blinded to the treater. Sham rTMS was delivered using a MagPro TMS system (MagVenture, Denmark).</description>

        <title>The Change in Functional Connectivity (FC) Between the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (L-DLPFC) and the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)</title>
        <description>Functional MRI (fMRI) measures changes in oxygenated blood in the brain; at rest these levels fluctuate over time. These fluctuations can be similar between different brain regions. FC is the similarity in fluctuations of these fMRI signals and suggests how strongly two regions communicate with each other. We measured how inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over L-DLPFC changes FC between L-DLPFC and dACC. This was done by estimating z-transformed correlation coefficients (CC) for each voxel (-1 to 1) between the L-DLPFC and dACC pre and post cTBS intervention. Negative FC was assigned to voxels with a weight &lt; 0, positive FC to voxels with weight&gt; 0. Total FC includes positive and negative voxels. The change in FC is regarded as the change in the sum of these weighted voxels from pre to post cTBS for total, positive and negative FC, respectively. Greater sums of voxels correspond to more significant levels of coordinated activity (positive, negative, or total).</description>

        <title>The Change in Functional Connectivity (FC) Within The Neural Network Underlying Conflict Regulation.</title>
        <description>We examined the effect of active, inhibitory cTBS over L-DLPFC on functional connectivity (FC) in key nodes in the neural network underlying the conflict regulation system. FC between each voxel in the L-DLPFC and the entire dACC was established by estimating z-transformed correlation coefficients (CC) for each voxel (-1 to 1) pre and post cTBS intervention. This paradigm was also used for voxels in the Default Mode Network (DMN) (Schaefer, 2018; Yeo, 2011) to the entire right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Negative FC was assigned to voxels with a weight &lt; 0, positive FC to voxels with weight &gt; 0. Total FC includes positive and negative voxels. The change in FC is regarded as the change in the sum of these weighted voxels from pre to post cTBS for total, positive and negative FC, respectively. Greater sums of voxels correspond to more significant levels of coordinated activity (positive, negative, or total).</description>

        <title>Stroop Task</title>
        <description>Active, inhibitory cTBS effect over L-DLPFC on the neural network that underlies the hypnotic Stroop modulation effect was determined by first estimating the average of connectivity weights for all parcel pairs linking Ventral Attentional Network (VAN) to the DMN. Parcels are determined by extracting mean resting state BOLD time-series for each region of the Schaefer 100 parcellation. A correlation matrix between all parcels is created and FC weights for each pair are established by estimating z-transformed correlation coefficients (CC) (-1 to 1). Each parcel pair is then assigned to one of the 7 resting state networks defined by Yeo et al., (2011). Negative FC is defined for parcel pairs with a weight &lt; 0, positive FC pairs with weight &gt; 0 and total FC includes all pairs. FC is thus the average value between parcel pairs in the DMN and VAN pre/post TMS. Greater sums of weighted pairs correspond to more significant levels of coordinated activity (positive, negative, or total).</description>

          <title>Stroop Task</title>
          <description>Active, inhibitory cTBS effect over L-DLPFC on the neural network that underlies the hypnotic Stroop modulation effect was determined by first estimating the average of connectivity weights for all parcel pairs linking Ventral Attentional Network (VAN) to the DMN. Parcels are determined by extracting mean resting state BOLD time-series for each region of the Schaefer 100 parcellation. A correlation matrix between all parcels is created and FC weights for each pair are established by estimating z-transformed correlation coefficients (CC) (-1 to 1). Each parcel pair is then assigned to one of the 7 resting state networks defined by Yeo et al., (2011). Negative FC is defined for parcel pairs with a weight &lt; 0, positive FC pairs with weight &gt; 0 and total FC includes all pairs. FC is thus the average value between parcel pairs in the DMN and VAN pre/post TMS. Greater sums of weighted pairs correspond to more significant levels of coordinated activity (positive, negative, or total).</description>

        <title>Metabolic Changes in L-DLPFC Pre- and Post-rTMS</title>
        <description>To determine the relationship between the metabolic alterations pre and post-rTMS. Metabolic changes as measured by MEGA-PRESS spectroscopy were assessed by quantification of excitatory (Glx) and inhibitory (GABA+) neurotransmitter complexes. The E/I ratio is defined as the logarithm of the concentration of Glx/GABA+relative to either the reference water or creatine signal and it is a unitless measure ranging from -1 to 1. Logarithmic transformations are used to account for non-normal distributions of metabolite concentrations across participants and ratios &gt; 0 are thought to be excitatory neurotransmitter dominant while ratios &lt;0 are thought to be inhibition dominant.</description>

repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: The investigators will perform two applications of 40s of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) form of rTMS at 80% resting motor threshold (previously determined), with a 15 minute intersession interval. The standardized treatment location for the left DLPFC will be determined by Localite Neuronavigation and targeted at the posterior middle frontal gyrus.

    <limitations_and_caveats>fMRI BOLD data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 1.5.10 (Esteban, Markiewicz, et al. (2018); Esteban, Blair, et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_016216), which is based on Nipype 1.4.2 (Gorgolewski et al. (2011); Gorgolewski et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_002502) with MNI152NLin2009cAsym and anatomical output spaces. BOLD time series were bandpass filtered to include data in the window of 0.0025-0.025 Hz, which is on the low end of the spectrum. A more typical bandpass window is 0.01 - 0.1 Hz.</limitations_and_caveats>
