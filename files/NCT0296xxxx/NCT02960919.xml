      This is a prospective observational study assessing the clinical outcomes of children 2 to 59&#xD;
      months of age with both pneumonia and other co-morbidities presenting to a tertiary hospital&#xD;
      outpatient setting in Malawi, Africa who are most at risk for mortality or have other&#xD;
      complications and thus, are typically excluded from childhood pneumonia studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 2 to 59 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excluded from enrollment in Innovative Treatment in Pneumonia (ITIP) 1 and ITIP2&#xD;
             clinical trials due to presence of any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypoxia (SaO2 &lt; 90% on room air, as assessed by a pulse oximeter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe respiratory distress (e.g., presence of grunting, nasal flaring, head nodding,&#xD;
             or severe chest-indrawing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe malaria, classified by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on hospital&#xD;
             care for children, including a positive malaria rapid antibody test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe anemia, classified by WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)&#xD;
             guidelines (i.e., severe palmar pallor) only if a positive malaria rapid antibody test&#xD;
             result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) (i.e., weight for height/length &lt; -3 SD, mid-upper arm&#xD;
             circumference (MUAC) &lt;115, or edema).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 seropositivity or HIV-1 exposure, assessed as follows: An HIV-positive result&#xD;
             upon rapid antibody testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a child is less than 24 months of age and has an HIV-negative result upon rapid&#xD;
             antibody test documented from the past three months, the child's biological mother's&#xD;
             HIV status will need to be assessed. If the mother is HIV-positive, the child will be&#xD;
             included. If the mother does not have documentation of an HIV-negative test result&#xD;
             from the past 3 months, she will be tested via rapid antibody testing to determine the&#xD;
             child's eligibility for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness of child's caregiver to provide informed consent and to be&#xD;
             available for follow-up (in the inpatient ward, returning to KCH for a scheduled study&#xD;
             follow-up visit, and by phone) for the planned duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possible tuberculosis (coughing for more than 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stridor when calm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe anemia, classified by WHO IMCI guidelines (i.e., severe palmar pallor) if a&#xD;
             negative malaria rapid antibody test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of an antibiotic treatment in the 48 hours prior to the study based on&#xD;
             caregiver's self-report and/or documentation in child's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Living outside Lilongwe urban area, the study catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychosocial condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, would interfere with the conduct of the study or for which study&#xD;
             participation might jeopardize the child's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical study of an investigational product within 12 weeks prior&#xD;
             to enrollment or planning to begin participation during this study.&#xD;
