      This study evaluates the efficacy of the the pecto-intercostal fascial plane block (PIF&#xD;
      block) for the anesthesia of the intercostal nerves anterior branches and assesses the&#xD;
      association of the serratus block with a PIF block for the breast surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast surgery is one of the most painful post-operative surgery. This surgery is well known&#xD;
      to induce postoperative chronic pain. The paravertebral block, because of its efficacy and&#xD;
      less invasive nature than epidural analgesia, is quickly becoming the reference technique for&#xD;
      pain management of major breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral regional anesthesia for the breast surgery appeared in the past few years. Among&#xD;
      these techniques are the PEC block, Serratus block and more recently the pecto-intercostal&#xD;
      fascial plane block (PIF block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently in the investigators hospital in every day's practice, an association of the&#xD;
      serratus block and the PIF block is made, which allows for a complete block of both the&#xD;
      laterals branches of intercostal nerves (with the serratus block) and of anterior branches of&#xD;
      intercostal nerves (with the PIF block). Therefore, this association of blocks may lead to a&#xD;
      complete analgesia of the breast, while the serratus block alone only allows for analgesia of&#xD;
      the lateral part of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique was previously described. The authors evoked the possibility of the&#xD;
      association of serratus and PIF blocks and described this technique with a patient, but to&#xD;
      the investigators knowledge no evaluation of the efficacy of this procedure was made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to analyze this technique through a collection form that&#xD;
      evaluates the satisfaction and post-operative morphine consumption of women receiving this&#xD;
      association of blocks before a general anesthesia for a unilateral mastectomy with&#xD;
      homolateral total lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a purely observational study that assesses a current practice in this type of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
