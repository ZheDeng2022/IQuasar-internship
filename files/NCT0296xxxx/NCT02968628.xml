  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alterations in the intrauterine environment can have profound effects on fetal development.&#xD;
      Diabetes during gestation results in multiple deleterious short-term outcome differences, and&#xD;
      is correlated with long-term developmental deficits. Multiple studies, in neonates through&#xD;
      school-aged children, have demonstrated differences in language, attention and psychomotor&#xD;
      development in offspring of diabetic pregnancies. Neonatal EEG is a promising and&#xD;
      non-invasive tool for assessment of abnormal brain development or &quot;dysmaturity&quot; in this&#xD;
      population. Multiple conventional EEG (cEEG) and amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) parameters&#xD;
      change predictably with advancing gestational development and have been used to differentiate&#xD;
      between at risk groups in neonatal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that neonatal EEG can identify brain dysmaturity in infants of&#xD;
      diabetic mothers (IDMs) compared to gestational-age matched controls. The primary aim is&#xD;
      documentation of brain dysmaturity in IDMs using cEEG. The secondary aim is establishment of&#xD;
      aEEG as a more accessible tool to quantify the effects of maternal diabetes on neonatal brain&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pilot study comparing cEEG and aEEG parameters of cases to&#xD;
      gestational-age matched controls. Cases will be IDM neonates of at least 35 weeks' gestation&#xD;
      whose mothers were recommended treatment with either insulin or an oral glycemic agent. Video&#xD;
      EEG recording will be planned for approximately 60 minutes and obtained between 24 hours and&#xD;
      5 days of life during birth hospitalization. Additional data will be extracted from maternal&#xD;
      and neonatal medical records and a maternal questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to evaluating the measures of cEEG and aEEG, this project will establish a&#xD;
      research cohort. A subsequent study involving developmental evaluations will allow for&#xD;
      correlation of EEG results with long-term outcomes. The ability to identify those at risk at&#xD;
      birth would provide the opportunity to intervene in order to mitigate outcome differences,&#xD;
      particularly in language development. More significantly, we hope to establish neonatal CNS&#xD;
      outcome measures for future diabetic pregnancy intervention studies. .&#xD;

        The study population will be a convenience sample, comprised of singleton neonates born at&#xD;
        or after 35 weeks post-menstrual age at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC).&#xD;
        Cases will be infants of mothers with either a diagnoses of pre-gestational diabetes or&#xD;
        gestational diabetes whose provider recommends treatment with insulin or oral glycemic&#xD;
        agents. Controls will be neonates whose mothers had normal glucose testing during gestation&#xD;
        and pre-pregnancy BMI of &lt;30. All subjects will be otherwise healthy, as defined by the&#xD;
        exclusion criteria. There is no intended racial, ethnic or gender distribution of these&#xD;
        neonates.&#xD;
