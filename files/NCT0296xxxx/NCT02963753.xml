  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperemesis gravidarum (HEG) is not only nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, but it is also a&#xD;
      clinical syndrome including endocrine and metabolic complications. Recently, some&#xD;
      investigators have been begun performing researches related to the development of gestational&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women with HEG because they think about those metabolic&#xD;
      and endocrine complications of HEG.In the literature there are few studies assessing how HEG&#xD;
      has effects on GDM or 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). So the investigators aim to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of HEG on 75 gram OGTT.&#xD;

      This retrospective controlled study conducted by Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics of Kayseri&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital.Pregnant women who delivered at the Kayseri Education and&#xD;
      Training Hospital of Medicine, in Turkey, between January 2010 and September 2016 were&#xD;
      identified.This study was carried out with two groups. The study group consisted of women&#xD;
      hospitalized for Hyperemesis gravidarum (HEG) during first trimester of their pregnancy,&#xD;
      whereas the control group included all other women who delivered in the same period.Screening&#xD;
      for GDM was performed twice during pregnancy. The first screening was performed during the&#xD;
      first trimester using the random plasma glucose test with a cutoff value of 109 mg/dl.&#xD;
      Screening for GDM was performed for all women during their first prenatal visit, regardless&#xD;
      of the presence or absence of hyperemesis-associated symptoms.The second screening was&#xD;
      performed during the second trimester, between 24 and 27 weeks, using a 75-g oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT), after pregnant women with HEG got rid of hyperemesis. GDM was&#xD;
      diagnosed on the basis of the universal criteria established by the International Association&#xD;
      of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group: a plasma glucose level that met or exceeded the&#xD;
      fasting cutoff value 92 mg/dl, the first-hour cutoff value 180 mg/dl, or the second-hour&#xD;
      cutoff value 153mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be considered for diagnosis of pre-gestational diabetes mellitus, women had to meet at&#xD;
      least one of the following criteria: the fasting plasma glucose test with a cutoff value of&#xD;
      126 mg/dl or the random plasma glucose test with a cutoff value of 200 mg/dl or the&#xD;
      second-hour cutoff value 153mg/dl after 75 gram OGGT (American Diabetes Association) The&#xD;
      delivery midwifery and medical records were retrospectively evaluated. All of the patient's&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI,calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in&#xD;
      meters), urine ketone levels and ages were recorded separately both in the initial exam and&#xD;
      during performing 75 gram OGTT.&#xD;

        This study was carried out with two groups. The study group consisted of women hospitalized&#xD;
        for HEG during first trimester of their pregnancy, whereas the control group included all&#xD;
        other women who delivered in the same period. When the pregnant women had those symptoms&#xD;
        such as the presence of intractable vomiting during pregnancy associated with dehydration,&#xD;
        electrolyte,and/or metabolic disturbances, as well as a weight loss 5% or more, they were&#xD;
        diagnosed as HEG.&#xD;
