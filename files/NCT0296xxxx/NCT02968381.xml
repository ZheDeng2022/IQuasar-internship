  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.&#xD;
      Tobacco quit lines are effective at helping smokers to quit, but quit lines are&#xD;
      underutilized, especially by men and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is effective at&#xD;
      helping people quit smoking, and is appealing to males and diverse racial groups, but has&#xD;
      limited reach. The proposed study will develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      a guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention that is delivered by a combination of quit&#xD;
      line coaches and an interactive website. The investigators hypothesize that guided mental&#xD;
      imagery delivered using the quit line &quot;coaching model&quot; combined with an interactive website&#xD;
      could be an effective intervention strategy.&#xD;

      The objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a&#xD;
      theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking&#xD;
      cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Develop a theory-based, guided mental imagery tobacco cessation intervention for quit&#xD;
      line callers with input from expert consultants in health disparities and a Community&#xD;
      Advisory Board representing diverse populations and tobacco control stakeholders. The&#xD;
      intervention will include phone-based coaching, an interactive website, and optional&#xD;
      cessation medication. It will be focus tested with 40 smokers (from diverse racial/ethnic and&#xD;
      age groups with at least 40% males), and usability tested with 5 smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Develop training and competency standards for, and train, four coaches in the&#xD;
      implementation of the guided imagery and control interventions. Coaches will be assessed at&#xD;
      6-weeks and 6-months post-training for implementation fidelity and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on the effects of the&#xD;
      guided mental imagery intervention on quit line callers' tobacco use, cravings, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy to quit smoking, and to refine study procedures, including recruitment,&#xD;
      retention, and use of intervention components. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either the Imagery Intervention (N=50) or an attention control condition (N=50) as&#xD;
      delivered by study coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months&#xD;
      post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged&#xD;
      abstinence of tobacco use. Biochemical validation will be conducted on a sub-sample to&#xD;
      determine validity of self-reported abstinence in this population. Secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      self-reported cravings and self-efficacy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tobacco use over the past seven days is assessed by project staff at 6-months post-enrollment. Tobacco use includes cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and other types of tobacco. The question is asked &quot;Have you smoked, even a puff, in the last 7 days?&quot; &quot;Have you used any other form of tobacco in the last 7 days?&quot; If yes to either question, the participant is asked to indicate what type of tobacco was used and how much was used (e.g., &quot;how many cigarettes did you smoke on a typical day?&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-efficacy for Quitting From Baseline to Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated version of the Condiotte and Lichtenstein (1981) Confidence Questionnaire consisting of 5 items for quitters and 6 items for non-quitters. All items are scored using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 is low/less and 5 is high/more. We calculated an average score of the items (which would have a value between 1 and 5).</description>

    <description>This was assessed using 1 item adapted from the Shiffman (2004) Rating Scale (&quot;How much have you craved tobacco today?&quot;). Responses were coded using a 6-point Likert scale from &quot;not at all&quot; (code 0) to &quot;a great deal&quot; (code 5).</description>
