      Remifentanil may be an ideal drug for labor analgesia due to its pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile. As compared to epidural analgesia, it demonstrated satisfactory for&#xD;
      pain relief at the beginning of labour with a gradual elevation of pain scores as labour&#xD;
      progresses. However, fast onset and limited time efficacy may render it useful in multiparous&#xD;
      with a faster labor progression, thus even making it an alternative to single-shot spinal&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuraxial analgesia is considered the most effective method of pain relief during labor. When&#xD;
      unavailable, contraindicated, refused by parturient or discouraged by midwife/obstetrician,&#xD;
      alternative methods of analgesia are required which should to be effective, without major&#xD;
      side effects and flexible enough to adapt to variable analgesic requirements during labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil may be an ideal drug for labor analgesia due to its pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile. It is an ultra-short-acting µ1-opioid receptor agonist, rapidly&#xD;
      metabolized by plasma and tissue esterases. It has onset time of 30 to 60 seconds and a peak&#xD;
      effect at 2,5 min. It rapidly crosses the placenta and it is quickly metabolized by the&#xD;
      fetus. Several studies which compared remifentanil patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with&#xD;
      epidural analgesia in nulliparous patients or parturient of mixed parity have demonstrated a&#xD;
      lower analgesic efficacy of remifentanil. Remifentanil, as compared to epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      showed a satisfactory for pain relief only at the beginning of labor with a gradual elevation&#xD;
      of pain scores as labor progressed. However, the fast onset and limited time efficacy may&#xD;
      render it useful in multiparous with a faster labor progression, thus even making it an&#xD;
      alternative to single-shot spinal analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthetic technique may also affect the progress of labor. A combined spinal-epidural&#xD;
      analgesia (CSEA) has been demonstrated to be associated with a greater cervical dilation&#xD;
      relative to conventional epidural analgesia in nulliparous patients. There are no data on&#xD;
      labour progression difference as compared to remifentanil PCA in multiparous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore conduct the study in multiparous patients to compare remifentanil PCA and CSEA&#xD;
      with respect to pain relief and the progress of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval for this observational trial was obtained by Republic of Slovenia National Ethical&#xD;
      Committee (kme.mz@gov.si). Only multiparous fulfilling inclusion criteria will be recruited.&#xD;
      The parturient requesting remifentanil analgesia will receive remifentanil hydrochloride&#xD;
      (Ultiva, GlaxoSmithKline, Oslo, Norway) according to the standard operative protocol. Bolus&#xD;
      doses will be adjusted by anesthesia staff on patient request and side effects (level of&#xD;
      sedation &lt;3 according to Ramsey scale (scale1-5: 1= alert, 2 = slightly drowsy, 4 = very&#xD;
      drowsy, 5 = unarousable), respiratory rate (RR)&gt;8 breaths per min, oxygen saturation (SaO2)&#xD;
      &gt;94%, systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 90 mmHg, heart rate (HR) &gt; 50/min and acceptable&#xD;
      overall clinical assessment performed by the investigator). Women using remifentanil will&#xD;
      have one-to-one midwifery care. All midwives will be familiar with the protocol and have&#xD;
      already received training in this mode of analgesia. Respiratory monitoring will be performed&#xD;
      throughout the labor only in the remifentanil group using a Capno stream capnograph with an&#xD;
      oral-nasal cannula, sampling from both the nose and mouth. Supplemental oxygen (2L/min via&#xD;
      nasal catheter) will be given in all patients. Respiratory monitoring will record continuous&#xD;
      waveform end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), SBP, SaO2 and maternal HR. The audible alarms will&#xD;
      be activated with SaO2&lt;94%, RR&lt;8/min and apnea longer than 20 sec which triggered a staged&#xD;
      intervention starting with a verbal command and/or light tap on the parturient arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSEA will be provided on parturient request according to the standard operative protocol.&#xD;
      Fetal heart rate (FHR) will be monitored to ensure neonatal safety using cardiotocography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisition and retrieval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and medical data will be obtained from personal interviews before analgesia&#xD;
      initiation and throughout the labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal pain will be evaluated using a 11-point verbal numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0&#xD;
      is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable pain. NRS pain scores will be recorded immediately&#xD;
      before starting PCA (baseline), then every 15 min during the first hour and every 30 min&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction with pain relief will be evaluated every 30 minutes after analgesia&#xD;
      administration and within 24 hours after delivery using a five-point categorical scale&#xD;
      (1=very good, 2=good, 3=moderate, 4=poor, 5=very poor). At the same time, each parturient&#xD;
      will be asked if she would choose the same technique for the next delivery and/or recommend&#xD;
      the same technique to somebody else.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive SBP, maternal HR, SaO2 and sedation score will be recorded before analgesia and&#xD;
      every 30 min thereafter. The respiratory monitor data will be recorded and adverse&#xD;
      respiratory events (SaO2&lt;94%, RR&lt;8/min and apnea&gt;20 sec) counted for each woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of epidural boluses as well as the total dose of remifentanil will be registered&#xD;
      automatically in the PCA pump and recorded for each patient. Maternal requests for additional&#xD;
      analgesia will be manually recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning nausea, vomiting and itching will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral temperature will be measured both at the onset of analgesia and within 1 hour of&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on labor progress (first and second stage labor duration, mean cervical dilation rate)&#xD;
      and outcome will be recorded for each patient, including the use and maximum dose of oxytocin&#xD;
      administered, and mode of delivery (spintaneus vaginal, instrumental vaginal, caesarean&#xD;
      section). Cervical dilation will be assessed by the midwife, and all changes recorded till&#xD;
      delivery. The time from onset of analgesia until 10-cm cervical dilation will be defined as&#xD;
      the first stage of labor, while the second stage will be defined as the interval between full&#xD;
      cervical dilation and delivery of the neonate. The mean cervical dilation rate will be&#xD;
      defined as 10 minus last cervical examination before analgesia divided by time between&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, Apgar score at 1 and 5 min,and umbilical artery pH and base excess will be&#xD;
      abstracted from the medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome of pain relief during remifentanil&#xD;
      and CSE analgesia in multiparous measured on an 11 point scale raging from 0 to 10. If the&#xD;
      true difference between the two studied groups is 1 (on 11 point scale with estimated&#xD;
      standard deviation of 2,2), we will need to study 77 subjects in each group to be able to&#xD;
      reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the two groups are not equal with&#xD;
      probability (power) 0,8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null&#xD;
      hypothesis is 0,05.&#xD;
