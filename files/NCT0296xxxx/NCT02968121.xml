      This trial is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      brexpiprazole in the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia. The trial will consist of two&#xD;
      parts across 13-36 months. The trial population will include approximately 110 male &amp; female&#xD;
      subjects between 18 and 64 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as&#xD;
      defined by DSM-V criteria.&#xD;
