    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease, ursodeoxycholic acid&#xD;
      (UDCA) is the only drug approved for the treatment of PBC. Although UDCA can improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in patients with PBC, about 40% of PBC patients show an incomplete&#xD;
      biochemical response to this treatment, accordingly have a significantly increased risk of&#xD;
      developing liver transplantation or death. Therefor there is a urgently needed for better&#xD;
      therapies for these patients. The development of new treatments is therefore needed. The&#xD;
      Fenofibrate is the candidate, there is now a substantial body of circumstantial evidence&#xD;
      supporting that Fenofibrate is well tolerated and can improve biochemical response in PBC&#xD;
      patients with incompleted response to UDCA. The purpose of this protocol is to conduct a&#xD;
      trial in a selected population of patients with PBC based on an incomplete biochemical&#xD;
      response after 12 months of UDCA therapy.&#xD;
