  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the tetraplegics movement strategies, assisted by&#xD;
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES), on the reach and palmar (RP) grasp to different&#xD;
      weights objects.Tetraplegics had their RP grasp movement captured by four infrared cameras&#xD;
      and 6-reflexive markers attached on the trunk and right arm, assisted or not by NMES, in the&#xD;
      triceps, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor digitorum communis, flexor digitorum&#xD;
      superficialis, opponens pollicis and lumbricalis muscles. The grasp was made in three&#xD;
      cylindrical objects (different diameters and weights) placed in trunk midline in an&#xD;
      equivalent distance of the arm's length. The patients were able to reach and made palmar&#xD;
      grasp in all cylinders using the stimulation sequences assisted by NMES.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prior to the kinematic captures, all patients selected in the study received 20 sessions of&#xD;
      NMES therapy, twice a week, with 10 weeks of duration. The strengthening sessions plus&#xD;
      training prior to the kinematic study of movement strategies has the objective to condition&#xD;
      the paretic muscles to the functional activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty sessions was divided in 10 sessions of strengthening and 10 sessions of the functional&#xD;
      training of reaching and grasping assisted with electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strengthening sessions consisted of 20 minutes of electrical stimulation on triceps,&#xD;
      extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor digitorum communis, lumbricalis, flexor digitorum&#xD;
      superficialis and opponens pollicis muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional training sessions was performed through movements the reach and palmar grasp&#xD;
      with NMES of the several cylindrical and conical objects of different weights (30 minutes&#xD;
      sessions). The NMES was used to facilitate movements of reach (triceps muscle), opening&#xD;
      (extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor digitorum communis muscle), positioning&#xD;
      (extensor carpi radialis longus, flexor digitorum superficialis and lumbricalis muscle),&#xD;
      palmar grasp (extensor carpi radialis longus, flexor digitorum superficialis, opponens&#xD;
      pollicis muscle) and releasing (extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor digitorum&#xD;
      communis muscle). Since the temporal organization varied among tetraplegics, some of them&#xD;
      required more time to some stages of the sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For NMES, the eight-channel stimulator, controlled by a microcomputer was used with pulse&#xD;
      frequency, 25 Hz; pulse duration, 300 milliseconds; on/off duration 2/2sec; maximum pulse&#xD;
      width fixed at 250 microampere, and the amplitude individually adjusted to achieve the&#xD;
      excitability threshold for each muscle. The amplitude was adjusted throughout the training,&#xD;
      in order to produce the desired muscle contraction. This parameters was used in all of&#xD;
      therapies and in the kinematic assessment. The stimulation was applied with self-adhesive&#xD;
      surface electrodes taped to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For kinematic captures, the participants performed reach and grasp with the dominant arm&#xD;
      (right), assisted and not assisted by NMES. The subjects had no restriction for trunk&#xD;
      anterior shifting but for safety reasons were kept seating upright in their own daily use&#xD;
      wheelchair (the one they were more adapted to) and the non-dominant arm (left) was left&#xD;
      resting over the abdomen in an attempt to minimize the influence of the non evaluated member&#xD;
      on postural control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the initial position, the dominant arm was held at the side of the trunk, with the elbow&#xD;
      flexed at 90º and the forearm in neutral position on the table. Tetraplegic subjects were&#xD;
      seated in front of a task-table with the cylinder on it. They were instructed to reach and&#xD;
      grasp three different cylinders (object A :200g weight, 115 mm height, 40 mm diameter; object&#xD;
      B: 270g, 115 mm e 50 mm; and object C: 480g, 115 mm e 60 mm), one at a time and bring it to&#xD;
      the initial hand position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of kinematic data was performed from the beginning of the movement (starting&#xD;
      position), until the early return of hand position (with or without the cylinder). The&#xD;
      cylinder was positioned in front of the subject sternum, with a distance equal to the arm's&#xD;
      length (from the medial border of axilla to the distal wrist crease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were asked to perform five repetitions of each task for all three cylinders, in&#xD;
      a total of 15 repetitions assisted and 15 not assisted by NMES. Once the experiment started,&#xD;
      the subject could not touch the table with the forearm, until the task was finished. The&#xD;
      command used to start the experiment was &quot;GO&quot;, and they were instructed to perform the&#xD;
      movement naturally and not to worry about the velocity and time of duration. Patients were&#xD;
      evaluated in the two situations (with and without NMES) with stimulation electrodes placed in&#xD;
      the skin surface and the cables connected to the stimulator.&#xD;
