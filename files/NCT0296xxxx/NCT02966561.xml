      The STAR-study (STay Active after Rehabilitation) investigates in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) the additional effect of a pedometer-based behavior change intervention (BCI)&#xD;
      during in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on objectively measured physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) 6-weeks and 6-months post PR. The BCI uses the behaviour change techniques a)&#xD;
      instruction on how, where and when to perform the behavior, b) prompt goal setting for&#xD;
      physical activity, c) prompt self-monitoring of behavior and d) feedback on behavior. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of PA will be measured using an accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X) for a time&#xD;
      period of seven days, firstly two weeks before rehabilitation begins (T0 = study phase I) as&#xD;
      well as six weeks and six months (T3 and T4) after PR. Additionally to predict PA progression&#xD;
      after PR, a complex personal diagnostic, including questionnaires as well as functional&#xD;
      assessments, is to be carried out at the start (T1 = start of study phase II) and end of PR&#xD;
      (T2). This diagnostic is based on the main ideas of the PA-related health competence model&#xD;
      (PARC-model) and especially incorporates physical and psychological personal determinants of&#xD;
      PA.&#xD;

    <description>Standard care is an in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in a specialized German Rehabilitation Clinic. PR is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary intervention based on a patient assessment followed by a combination of patient-tailored therapies. PR lasts on average 25 days. PR includes the following obligatory main components: Checking and, if required, adjusting the current COPD medication according to current COPD-guidelines; physical training (4-5 units/week endurance training [45 min] and 3 units/week of strength training [45 min] per week, 7 units/week whole body vibration muscle training/week); structured COPD-patient education (6 hours patient education COPD + 1 hour device training); respiratory physiotherapy in groups [2-4 units/week with 45 min]. PR is implemented by an interdisciplinary rehabilitation team.</description>
