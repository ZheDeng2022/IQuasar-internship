  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to determine if supplemental oxygen given only when the&#xD;
      patient is inspiring (demand delivery) is more effective than constant-flow oxygen given&#xD;
      during all phases of the breath regardless if the patient is breathing it in. A previous&#xD;
      study in volunteers (NCT02886312) showed that the oxygen saturation in the blood and the&#xD;
      concentration of oxygen breathed out from the lungs (end-tidal oxygen) was higher when given&#xD;
      in demand (inhalation only) mode. A secondary goal is to determine in patients, whether&#xD;
      turning oxygen delivery off during expiration improves the accuracy of end-tidal CO2 (Carbon&#xD;
      Dioxide) monitoring. This was found to be the case in the previous volunteer study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to determine if these improvements are also observable in relatively&#xD;
      healthy patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia. The efficacy of the demand&#xD;
      mode will be determined by measuring the resulting difference in oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      end-tidal oxygen levels. The investigators will alternate between traditional oxygen delivery&#xD;
      (continuous flow) and demand delivery (flow only during inhalation) for two minutes in each&#xD;
      mode after which oxygen saturation and end-tidal oxygen will be measured. End-tidal CO2&#xD;
      measurement will be compared with those during the brief time when O2 flow is stopped.&#xD;
