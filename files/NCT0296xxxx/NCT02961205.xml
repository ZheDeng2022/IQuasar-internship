      This randomized controlled pilot study evaluates the use of oral nutritional supplementation&#xD;
      in nutritionally at-risk cardiovascular surgery patients. The oral nutrition supplement is&#xD;
      given for 30 days prior to surgery, continuing throughout their surgical hospitalization and&#xD;
      ends at hospital discharge. Half of the participants will receive the oral nutritional&#xD;
      supplement and the other half will not.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular surgery (CVS) is a resource intensive modality in the treatment of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and valvular heart disease. CVS patients who are malnourished experience&#xD;
      increased duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, post-operative infections, impaired wound&#xD;
      healing, muscle wasting, longer lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay,&#xD;
      higher readmission rates, higher treatment costs and marked increases in mortality. Despite&#xD;
      the devastating effects of malnutrition in these patients, physicians and health care&#xD;
      practitioners are poor in respect to identification, monitoring and treatment of&#xD;
      malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two large tertiary hospitals in Ontario, this will be a randomized trial of a novel&#xD;
      nutritional pathway to rapidly identify at-risk CVS patients pre-operatively, and then&#xD;
      provide oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) during the 30 days prior to surgery, then&#xD;
      continue supplementation throughout hospitalization until discharge. Meaningful&#xD;
      patient-centered and economic outcomes will be examined.&#xD;

    <description>This pilot study will be considered as successfully demonstrating feasibility of recruitment if 60 participants are recruited over 12 months. The overarching objective of this pilot study is to prove feasibility of recruitment and of the protocol in order to continue to a large phase 3 trial.</description>
