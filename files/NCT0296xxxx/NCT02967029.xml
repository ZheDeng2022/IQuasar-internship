  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a successful functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), it is crucial to provide&#xD;
      effective controlled hypotension to reduce blood loss and provide a relatively blood-free&#xD;
      surgical environment to facilitate surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of controlled hypotension is to maintain an arterial blood pressure which is&#xD;
      sufficiently low to allow a reduction in bleeding with offering a superior intraoperative&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability during stressful surgical events to maintain intact cerebral&#xD;
      microcirculatory auto-regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auto-regulation impairment during controlled hypotension might increase oxygen extraction&#xD;
      ratio. Thus monitoring the cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) to measure cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      becomes essential and it remains a challenge to clinically assess cerebral oxygenation on a&#xD;
      routine basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various recent studies reported based on facilitating the induction of controlled&#xD;
      hypotension, but the effects of hypotension on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation and its&#xD;
      effects on postoperative cognitive function are still poorly characterized. Moreover, the&#xD;
      relationship between rSO2 and controlled hypotension has not been established in patients&#xD;
      undergoing FESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the last decade, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) INVOS® monitors which is clinically&#xD;
      most broadly spread technique, can be used for non-invasive assessment of cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      by detecting changes in rSO2 by online monitoring of cerebral oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our clinical routine for achieving a controlled hypotension, esmolol and remifentanyl are&#xD;
      the most commonly used hypotensive agents. The aim of this prospective randomized single&#xD;
      blind study was to investigate the influence of remifentanyl as a hypotensive agent in&#xD;
      comparison to esmolol on rSO2 by using NIRS and postoperative cognitive function in patients&#xD;
      undergoing FESS.&#xD;

      blind study was to investigate the influence of remifentanyl as a hypotensive agent in&#xD;
      comparison to esmolol on rSO2 by using NIRS and postoperative cognitive function in patients&#xD;
      undergoing FESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the local institutional research ethics committee approval and written&#xD;
      informed consent from each patient, 140 American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I and II&#xD;
      patients aging between 18 and 65, undergoing for elective FESS and required controlled&#xD;
      hypotension were enrolled in this study. Patients with hypertension, coronary artery diseases&#xD;
      and cerebral insufficiency, severe hypovolemia and anemia, body mass index over 30 kg/m2,&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy and previous hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs were excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were equally randomly assigned to receive either remifentanil or esmolol to maintain&#xD;
      mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) between 55-65 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After insertion of a peripheral venous cannula upon arrival to the operating room, balanced&#xD;
      electrolyte solution at 5 ml/kg/h was initiated. Following the premedication with intravenous&#xD;
      midazolam 0.05 miligram/kg IV 15 min prior to the induction of anesthesia, and standard&#xD;
      monitoring was applied consisting of electrocardiography (EKG), noninvasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2). Further, cerebral oxygen saturation value (rSO2, using&#xD;
      the NIRS with adult probe placed in the median frontal region) was continuously monitored&#xD;
      using NIRS before the induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoxygenation anaesthesia was induced with 2 miligram/kg propofol, 2 μg/kg fentanyl&#xD;
      and to facilitate the endotracheal intubation 0.6 miligram/kg rocuronium was administered.&#xD;
      Following orotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation was adjusted to maintain PaCO2 at 35&#xD;
      to 40 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia maintenance was performed using sevoflurane (0.8 to 1 adjusted MAC) in a mixture&#xD;
      of O2/Nitrous oxide 50%/50%. Then the treatment protocol consisting of remifentanil and&#xD;
      esmolol were delivered in order to induce controlled hypotension that was considered&#xD;
      effective when MAP reached the target pressure of 60 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the esmolol group (Group E) received esmolol 0.5 miligram/kg iv at induction&#xD;
      followed by a continuous infusion of esmolol 5-15 miligram/kg/min and titrated to the maximum&#xD;
      dose 300μg/kg/min to reach target MAP of 50-60 mmHg about a value of 5 mmHg. Patients in the&#xD;
      remifentanil group (Group R) received remifentanil 0.5 μg/kg/min at induction followed by an&#xD;
      infusion of remifentanil 0.1- 0.5 μg/kg/min and titrated between 0,1- 0,5 μg/kg/min to reach&#xD;
      target MAP of 50-60 mmHg about a value of 5 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups no surgical stress was applied during 5 min following start of hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral desaturation was defined as a reduction of rSO2 to higher than 20 % of baseline for&#xD;
      ≥ 15 seconds. When cerebral desaturation occurred, remifentanil and esmolol infusion doses&#xD;
      were decreased and MAP was increased with intravascular fluid administration and ephedrine.&#xD;
      When hypotension below the target MAP and bradycardia below the heart rate 45 beats/min&#xD;
      longer than one minute in duration were occurred, a bolus of ephedrine 10 mg iv and atropine&#xD;
      0.1 miligram/kg iv applied, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations were performed by the same attending surgeon in order to ensure consistency in&#xD;
      the estimation of the surgical field who was blinded to the hypotensive agent. When MAP&#xD;
      reached the desired range (50-60 mmHg) and was maintained for at least 10 minutes, the&#xD;
      quality of the surgical field was defined in terms of blood loss and dryness using a 10 point&#xD;
      scale (0= no bleeding, virtually bloodless field; 10= uncontrolled bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive function of the patients was assessed using Mini Mental State Examination&#xD;
      (MMSE) test. Preoperative MMSE test was done at the premedication room 1 hour before surgery&#xD;
      and 120 minutes after the discontinuation of the drugs for each patient. A decrease in the&#xD;
      MMSE score ≥ 2 points from baseline was considered as an index of decline in cognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamics (Diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Mean blood pressure (MBP), systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR), SPO2 and rSO2 were recorded preoperatively (baseline),&#xD;
      postinduction 5th min (after administration of hypotensive and anesthetic agent),&#xD;
      intraoperatively (10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 minutes), 5 and 10 minutes after stoppage of&#xD;
      hypotensive agents. Additionally, the duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, the&#xD;
      consumption dose of hypotensive agents, desaturated and not desaturated patients among the&#xD;
      groups were also recorded.&#xD;
