    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HLCM051 on functional&#xD;
      outcome in subjects with acute ischemic stroke and to evaluate the safety of HLCM051 in&#xD;
      subjects with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase 2/3 trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous administration of HLCM051 compared with&#xD;
      placebo in subjects with acute ischemic stroke (within 36 hours of onset). Japanese subjects&#xD;
      who developed a subcortical ischemic stroke and are eligible to participate in the trial will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 220 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (HLCM051 group [n=110] or&#xD;
      placebo group [n=110]) to receive a single infusion of HLCM051 or placebo.&#xD;
