  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary question of interest is quantifying the relationship between Y-90 liver therapy&#xD;
      and liver damage. Little is known on this subject. Present assumptions and calculations of&#xD;
      Y-90 administration are based on surgical lobar hepatectomies and external radiation beam&#xD;
      therapies. The investigators hope that by using a functional model of the liver, the&#xD;
      investigators can improve this important knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be enrolling patients planning to receive Y-90 therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of liver malignancies. The diagnosis of a primary liver cancer, hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC), is usually made by a combination of specific imaging findings and clinical&#xD;
      criteria; only rarely is a confirmatory biopsy performed. This is due to the high accuracy of&#xD;
      the present diagnostic model and the significant risk of biopsy and tumor seeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y-90 therapy involves administering radioactive particles to liver tumors by placing a&#xD;
      catheter in a hepatic artery supplying the tumor using angiographic techniques and injection&#xD;
      of these particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y-90 Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging has been established&#xD;
      as a method to validate and quantitate distribution of Yttrium after Y-90 administration. The&#xD;
      post Y-90 therapy PET/CT images provide an imaging distribution of the Y-90, which is&#xD;
      essential for validation of administered versus planned dose to the liver lesion and&#xD;
      background liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators can compare the Y-90 distribution to estimate background liver radiation&#xD;
      distribution and dose (generated by the Y-90 PET/CT scan) combined with the global and&#xD;
      regional function map (generated by the hepatobiliary [HIDA] scan performed before and after&#xD;
      therapy), then the investigators will be assuming that the difference pre and post therapy in&#xD;
      global and regional function can be ascribed to the Y-90 administration. The investigators&#xD;
      will also analyze the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CT sets performed before and after&#xD;
      therapy and correlate the imaging results collected with clinical findings such as&#xD;
      ascites/encephalopathy and routine serological markers (bilirubin, albumin, International&#xD;
      normalized ratio [INR], etc.). With this information, the investigators will have the&#xD;
      potential to establish whether there is a relationship between Y-90 distribution to&#xD;
      non-tumoral (normal) hepatic parenchyma and the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      Radioembolization-Induced Liver Disease (REILD). This would have the potential to improve&#xD;
      selection criteria and outcomes in populations selected for Y-90 therapy in the future.&#xD;

      Little is known on the potential relationship between Y-90 liver therapy and liver damage&#xD;
      this subject. Present assumptions and calculations of Y-90 administration are based on&#xD;
      surgical lobar hepatectomies and external radiation beam therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As most participants that need Y90 based liver therapies have compromised livers, the&#xD;
      importance of knowing what potential collateral liver damage could be induced by Y90 is key&#xD;
      so as not induce liver failure. Successful treatment of a liver malignancy would not be&#xD;
      important if the potential mortality/morbidity risk of the treatment is higher or equal to&#xD;
      the existing malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As apposed to anatomical imaging looking for changes in size/shape which are late changes,&#xD;
      the investigators hope that by using a functional model of the liver, which can show early&#xD;
      changes of liver damage, the investigators can improve the sensitivity for detection of liver&#xD;
      damage and bridge this important knowledge gap. Additionally due to compensatory hypertrophy&#xD;
      of the non treated liver, potential liver damage estimated by lab tests may be masked, again&#xD;
      this emphasizes the importance of the measurement of the functional approach before and after&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be enrolling participants planning to receive Y-90 therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of liver malignancies. The diagnosis of a primary liver cancer, hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC), is usually made by a combination of specific imaging findings and clinical&#xD;
      criteria; only rarely is a confirmatory biopsy performed. This is due to the high accuracy of&#xD;
      the present diagnostic model and the significant risk of biopsy and tumor seeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y-90 therapy involves administering radioactive particles to liver tumors by placing a&#xD;
      catheter in a hepatic artery supplying the tumor using angiographic techniques and injection&#xD;
      of these particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y-90 PET/CT imaging has been established as a method to validate and quantitate distribution&#xD;
      of Yttrium after Y-90 administration. The post Y-90 therapy PET/CT images provide an imaging&#xD;
      distribution of the Y-90, which is essential for validation of administered versus planned&#xD;
      dose to the liver lesion and background liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be performing both specialized nuclear medicine HIDA and MRI scans&#xD;
      aimed at constructing a functional map of the liver before and 3 months after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the Y-90 distribution to estimate background liver radiation&#xD;
      distribution and dose (generated by the Y-90 PET/CT scan) combined with the global and&#xD;
      regional function map (generated by the HIDA and MRI scans performed before and after&#xD;
      therapy), then the investigators will be assuming that the difference pre and post therapy in&#xD;
      global and regional function can be ascribed to the Y-90 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also analyze the MRI and NM data sets performed before and after&#xD;
      therapy and correlate the imaging results collected with clinical findings such as&#xD;
      ascites/encephalopathy and routine serological markers (bilirubin, albumin, INR, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this information, the investigators will have the potential to establish whether there&#xD;
      is a relationship between Y-90 distribution to non-tumoral (normal) hepatic parenchyma and&#xD;
      the incidence and severity of REILD. This would have the potential to improve selection&#xD;
      criteria and outcomes in populations selected for Y-90 therapy in the future.&#xD;
