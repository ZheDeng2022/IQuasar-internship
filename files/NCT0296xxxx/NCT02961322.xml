      This is a study of health economics longitudinal cohort on the evaluation of direct medical&#xD;
      cost of a surgical technique based on the use of an innovative device (the da VinciÂ® surgical&#xD;
      robot Si) and its comprehensive care.&#xD;

      Over 50,000 thyroidectomies are performed each year in France. The externally surgery&#xD;
      produces satisfactory results, but it nevertheless remains a risk of complications in the&#xD;
      order of 10 to 20%. Moreover, the patients operated by traditional externally have a&#xD;
      basi-cervical visible scar which is a major concern for many of them. The team of Montpellier&#xD;
      University Hospital is a pioneer in the use of the technique of endoscopic thyroidectomy&#xD;
      under robotic assistance that saves totally cervical scarring for patients, but also decrease&#xD;
      the rate of complications. This technique based on the use of the da Vinci robotic system if&#xD;
      justified, depending on the manufacturer and the scientific literature, with its minimally&#xD;
      invasive character, an amplitude of greater movement than the hand of man, and movements&#xD;
      called intuitive that reduce tremors instruments during the operation (Patel 2008). In France&#xD;
      and in Europe, there is a growing demand from patients and surgeons to access the surgical&#xD;
      technique. An assessment of the real and specific cost of this technique and its overall&#xD;
      management is essential in order to assess the financial impact of the introduction of this&#xD;
      surgery for our hospitals, or no data is available on this in Literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to describe the direct medical cost of the treatment of&#xD;
      thyroid Lobo-Isthmectomy Robot-Assisted (LIRA) with a follow-up 12 months. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this research are to determine the rate of laryngeal paralysis, the rate of&#xD;
      complications specific to access axillary robot, the size of the incision made for surgery,&#xD;
      the number of channel conversion transaxillary assisted robot traditional externally, to&#xD;
      assess the satisfaction of each patient over his scar, pain over time, the evolution of&#xD;
      potential disorders sensitivity of anterior chest wall, the vocal functional suites and&#xD;
      quality of life self-administered questionnaire (Voice handicap Index VHI 10 and Short Forme&#xD;
      SF-36), and finally to compare the cost of care by the robot with the average cost of a&#xD;
      conventional surgery.&#xD;
