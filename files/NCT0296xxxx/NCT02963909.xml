      Phase 1 study to evaluate two doses of Alum Adjuvanted Zika Virus Purified Inactivated&#xD;
      Vaccine (ZPIV) administered 28 days apart. The study will enroll 75 flavivirus naïve healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects into 3 equal groups sequentially. Each group will include 20 ZPIV recipients&#xD;
      and 5 placebo recipients. Group 1 will receive two ZPIV or placebo doses 28 days apart. Those&#xD;
      in Group 1 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive 5.0 mcg dose of ZPIV or placebo&#xD;
      administered IM on Day 224. Group 2 subjects will receive a two-dose regimen of IXIARO® 28&#xD;
      days apart; two ZPIV or placebo doses three months later 28 days apart. Those in Group 2 who&#xD;
      consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on Day 336. Group 3 subjects will receive one&#xD;
      dose of YF-VAX® followed three months later by two ZPIV or placebo doses 28 days apart. Those&#xD;
      in Group 3 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on Day 308. In each group, those&#xD;
      who do not agree to receive the third ZPIV dose will be followed based on the schedule. The&#xD;
      primary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose homologous&#xD;
      prime boost regimen of ZPIV among flavivirus-naïve, YF-VAX® primed, and IXIARO® primed&#xD;
      subjects; 2) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a third dose of ZPIV in consenting&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, Phase 1&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two doses of alum&#xD;
      adjuvanted Zika Virus Purified Inactivated Vaccine (ZPIV) administered 28 days apart. The&#xD;
      study will enroll 75 flavivirus naïve healthy male and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female&#xD;
      adult subjects (ages 18-49, inclusive) into 3 equal groups sequentially, starting with Group&#xD;
      1 followed by Group 2 and then Group 3. Screening will occur within 40 days of first&#xD;
      vaccination. Each group will include 20 ZPIV recipients and 5 placebo recipients. Two&#xD;
      sentinel subjects from Group 1 will be enrolled first and will receive ZPIV in an open-label&#xD;
      fashion first. The next 23 subjects (18 ZPIV, 5 placebo) will be randomized into Group 1.&#xD;
      This will be followed by the randomization of 25 subjects into Group 2 (JE priming). The&#xD;
      remaining 25 subjects to enroll will be randomized into Group 3 (YF priming). Group 1&#xD;
      subjects will receive two 5.0 mcg doses of ZPIV or placebo administered IM on Days 1 and 29.&#xD;
      Those in Group 1 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive 5.0 mcg dose of ZPIV or&#xD;
      placebo administered IM on Day 224. Group 2 subjects will receive a two-dose regimen of&#xD;
      IXIARO® (Valneva) 28 days apart; two ZPIV or placebo doses will be administered three months&#xD;
      later IM 28 days apart. Those in Group 2 who consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on&#xD;
      Day 336. Group 3 subjects will receive one dose of YF-VAX® (Sanofi Pasteur) followed three&#xD;
      months later by two ZPIV or placebo doses administered IM 28 days apart. Those in Group 3 who&#xD;
      consent to a third ZPIV dose will receive it on Day 308. In each group, those who do not&#xD;
      agree to receive the third ZPIV dose will be followed based on the schedule. The primary&#xD;
      objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose homologous prime&#xD;
      boost regimen of ZPIV among flavivirus-naïve, YF-VAX® primed, and IXIARO® primed subjects; 2)&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a third dose of ZPIV in consenting subjects. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28 days&#xD;
      after the first and second ZPIV administration, and 112, 196, 280, and 364 days after the&#xD;
      first ZPIV administration for each of the three groups in subjects who consent to two doses&#xD;
      of ZPIV; 2) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28 days after the first&#xD;
      and second ZPIV administration, and 112, 196, 224 days after the first ZPIV administration&#xD;
      and at 28, 84, and 168 days after the third ZPIV administration for Group 1 subjects who&#xD;
      consent to third dose; 3) To evaluate the quantitative humoral immune response at 28 days&#xD;
      after the first and second ZPIV administration, and 112, 224 days after the first ZPIV&#xD;
      administration and at 28, 84, and 168 days after the third ZPIV administration for Group 2&#xD;
      and 3 subjects who consent to third dose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Must be willing and able to read, sign, and date the informed consent document before&#xD;
             study-related procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be willing and able to comply with study requirements and be available for&#xD;
             follow-up visits for the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must have a means to be contacted by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;/=18.1 and &lt;35.0 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have acceptable screening laboratory findings within 40 days before day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acceptable clinical laboratory parameters include no more than Grade 1 on&#xD;
                  toxicity scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White Blood Cell (WBC), Hemoglobin, and platelet count will be reported as part&#xD;
                  of the Complete Blood Count (CBC). These labs will be graded according to the&#xD;
                  toxicity scale. Other results included on the CBC panel will not be graded. They&#xD;
                  will be reviewed by an investigator who will determine clinical significance and&#xD;
                  may be used to determine additional workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, random glucose, total&#xD;
                  protein, albumin, calcium, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
                  will be reported as part of the Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP). These labs will&#xD;
                  be graded according to the toxicity scale. Other results included on the CMP&#xD;
                  panel will not be graded. They will be reviewed by an investigator who will&#xD;
                  determine clinical significance and may be used to determine additional workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If laboratory screening tests are out of acceptable range, repeat of screening&#xD;
             tests is permitted one time, provided there is an alternative explanation for the out&#xD;
             of range value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be in good health based on the investigator's clinical judgment when considering&#xD;
             findings from past medical history, medication use, vital signs, and an abbreviated&#xD;
             physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 1: Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in&#xD;
             the exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical exam and vital&#xD;
             signs. If the subject has a preexisting condition not listed in the exclusion&#xD;
             criteria, the condition cannot meet any of the following criteria: first diagnosed in&#xD;
             the last 3 months; worsening in terms of clinical outcome in the last 6 months; or&#xD;
             involves need for medication that may pose a risk to the subject's safety or impede&#xD;
             assessment of AEs or immunogenicity if they participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 2: An abbreviated physical exam differs from a complete exam in that it does not&#xD;
             include a genitourinary and rectal exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 3: Vital signs must be normal by protocol toxicity grading scale or determined to&#xD;
             be normal-variant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal heart rate or blood&#xD;
             pressure due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10&#xD;
             minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be re-measured.&#xD;
             Repeated vital signs may be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening&#xD;
             and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately prior to each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: All female subjects are considered of childbearing potential unless&#xD;
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile and &gt;/=3 months have passed since sterilization&#xD;
             procedure. Postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea for &gt;/=12 months without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. Permanent female sterilization procedures include tubal&#xD;
             ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or successful&#xD;
             Essure placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception from&#xD;
             one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination until at least 60 days after the&#xD;
             last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acceptable methods of contraception include the following: Use highly effective&#xD;
                  contraceptive methods, defined by &lt;1% failure rate per year independent of user&#xD;
                  adherence, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC):&#xD;
                  progestin-releasing subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUD). Use&#xD;
                  effective contraceptive methods, defined by 5-9% failure rate with typical use&#xD;
                  and &lt;1% failure rate with consistent and correct use, including: prescription&#xD;
                  oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, combined pill, progestin-only&#xD;
                  pill, hormone-releasing transdermal patch or vaginal ring, and depot&#xD;
                  medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (Depo-Provera). Have one male sex partner&#xD;
                  who has had a vasectomy &gt;/=3 months prior. Male partner with barrier protection&#xD;
                  plus the use of vaginal spermicide. Practice abstinence defined as refraining&#xD;
                  from heterosexual intercourse from 30 days before first vaccination until at&#xD;
                  least 60 days after last ZPIV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female subjects must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) from the start of&#xD;
             screening period until at least 60 days after receiving the last ZPIV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has plans to become pregnant, or is currently pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has plans to travel to an area with active ZIKV, DENV, YFV, or JEV transmission during&#xD;
             the study or returned from an endemic area with these diseases within 30 days of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
