  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that this serious game (designed to provide a learning&#xD;
      environment that maximizes opportunities for adolescents with autism to discover the&#xD;
      functional utility of eye gaze) will improve sensitivity to eye gaze cues, specifically to&#xD;
      identify gazed-at objects, and will also lead to increased social attention to faces in&#xD;
      adolescents with autism. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a small-scale&#xD;
      exploratory randomized control trial that will include both behavioral and eye tracking&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Given the design of the study, parents and adolescents will know the condition to which they have been assigned. However, researchers involved in data collection will be blinded from condition assignment during the pre-intervention data collection session as these data will be collected prior to randomization. Also, the research team is not involved in the randomization process. The research team members who are involved in ensuring the fidelity of the intervention are not involved in data collection procedures. Although we will attempt to limit unblinding, it is not possible for researchers involved in data collection to be completely blinded to the assignment of participant condition at the post-intervention visit as we cannot prohibit participants from talking to researchers about their experience in the study. Importantly, the primary outcome measures are believed to be robust to investigator bias.</masking_description>

    <description>The game involves viewing subtle nonverbal behaviors of game characters for the purpose of executing their own goal-directed behavior in the game related to solving various crimes. The learning involves interpreting nonverbal cues on the animated characters, such as pointing, head turns, eye gaze cues.</description>
