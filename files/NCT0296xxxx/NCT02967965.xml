      CARIM is a prospective cohort of 2,000 patients with a first myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      undergoing reperfusion therapy. Therefore, male and female patients older than 18 years and&#xD;
      younger than 90 years with onset of chest pain of less than 12 hours who need a primary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a ST elevation segment MI (STEMI) will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the setting of research in ischemic cardiomyopathy, the CARIM cohort aims to meet the&#xD;
      expectation and strategy of Aviesan (Alliance nationale pour les sciences de la VIE et de la&#xD;
      SANté) since it will address the underlying pathophysiology of the determinants of MI injury&#xD;
      and its impact on follow-up, in addition with the potential confounding clinical and&#xD;
      biological factors. Therefore, CARIM cohort will offer a great opportunity of describing the&#xD;
      interactions between myocardial infarction and surrounding environment (clinical, social and&#xD;
      professional). This cohort will use complementary state of the art approaches (cardiac&#xD;
      imaging including Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and echocardiography, biomarkers,&#xD;
      proteomic, genetic and pharmacogenetics) with strong interactions between the different&#xD;
      partners. Therefore CARIM cohort should help to obtain a modeling of the determinants of the&#xD;
      MI size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that CARIM cohort will provide new imaging or biological markers&#xD;
      that may bring early information regarding the severity of lethal reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By optimizing the knowledge on infarct injury in addition with a 5-year clinical and&#xD;
      echographic follow-up, this cohort will better stratify the prognosis after MI and will&#xD;
      therefore give new insights in identifying patients at higher risk of left ventricular&#xD;
      remodeling and subsequent heart failure. It will therefore help and emphasize prevention&#xD;
      messages and patients' education. The aim is to translate this information directly into&#xD;
      patient care by using the science generated by this project to develop new management&#xD;
      guidelines and novel clinical tools (confounder-annotated database, imaging and biological&#xD;
      biomarkers). This cohort may have additional impact in patient care by adapting the treatment&#xD;
      to patient-related confounders (age, diabetes...), genetic polymorphisms and thus&#xD;
      personalizing health care to individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 MAIN OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators main objective is to create a prospective cohort of 2,000 patients (CARIM&#xD;
      cohort) with a first myocardial infarction and undergoing reperfusion therapy in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of patient-related confounders on myocardial infarct size and LRI in&#xD;
      order to further design a modeling of myocardial infarct size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, CARIM cohort will be associated with the creation of a non-invasive cardiac&#xD;
      imaging data-bank (MRI and echocardiography) in addition with a large bio-bank relying on&#xD;
      existing biological certified platforms (i.e. BRC network).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort will provide a population of first acute MI, optimally characterized in terms of&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical and angiography phenotype, specifically characterized by CMR in terms&#xD;
      of infarct size and LRI and by echocardiography in terms of myocardial regional function and&#xD;
      left ventricular remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the specific impact of myocardial infarct injury on myocardial regional&#xD;
           function and left ventricular remodeling (defined by an increase in LV end-diastolic&#xD;
           volume &gt; 20% between week 1 and month 12 post-MI by echocardiography).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the power of the myocardial infarct injury in predicting cardiovascular events&#xD;
           (rehospitalizations, reinfarction, occurrence of HF, transplantation, arrhythmias,&#xD;
           death) in a 5-year patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the value of established or newly identified plasma/serum biomarkers to identify&#xD;
           LRI and to predict post-MI LV remodeling and progression towards CHF during a 5 year&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. This cohort aims ultimately at defining the profile of the MI patient population to be&#xD;
           used for future trials implementing new protective interventions targeting LRI.&#xD;
