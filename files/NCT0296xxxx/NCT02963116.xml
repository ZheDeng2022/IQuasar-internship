    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, 5-period, 5-treatment, single-dose, single-center,&#xD;
      crossover study to estimate the effect of AZD5718 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      rosuvastatin, and to assess the relative bioavailability of AZD5718 oral suspension vs&#xD;
      AZD5718 immediate release (IR) Tablet Formulation and the Food Effect of AZD5718 in Healthy&#xD;
      Volunteers. The study will be performed at a single study center.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from the morning on the&#xD;
           day before dosing with the IMP (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after dosing; discharge&#xD;
           will be on the morning of Day 3, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit within 7 to 10 days after the last administration of the IMPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a minimum of a 7 days washout between each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive 5 treatments. The following treatments will be given:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: 10 mg rosuvastatin tablet alone (fasting state)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: 10 mg rosuvastatin tablet + 200 mg of AZD5718 IR tablet (2 x 100 mg tablet)&#xD;
           (fasting state)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: 200 mg of AZD5718 IR tablet (2 x 100 mg tablet) (fasting state)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: 200 mg of AZD5718 oral suspension 50 mg/mL (fasting state)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment E: 200 mg of AZD5718 IR tablet (2 x 100 mg tablet) (fed state)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;
