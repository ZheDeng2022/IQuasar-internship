  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies how well aspirin works in preventing colorectal cancer in&#xD;
      patients with colorectal adenoma. Aspirin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test for the equivalency of the two aspirin schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. The ratio of cell proliferation (Ki-67)/apoptosis (TUNEL) in rectal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. The ratio of cell proliferation (Ki-67)/necroptosis (MLKL) in rectal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Fecal occult blood test (measures of adverse events) as measured by stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. Methylation biomarkers in genes (i.e. CDKN2A [cell cycle regulation], MGMT&#xD;
      [deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair], DAPK1 [apoptosis], CDH1 [cell invasion], WNT16 [Wnt&#xD;
      pathway] and RASSF1 [RAS signaling]) involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, as measured in&#xD;
      rectal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ie. Abundance of Escherichia (E.) coli and Fusobacterium in rectal swabs. II. To evaluate if&#xD;
      the effects of aspirin arms may be modified by dietary intake of calcium as measured by the&#xD;
      Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive aspirin orally (PO) daily for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive aspirin PO daily at weeks 1-3 and 7-9 and placebo PO daily at weeks&#xD;
      4-6 and 10-12 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;

    <description>All of these variables will be described using appropriate statistics such as means (for continuous) and proportions (for discrete outcomes). Typically, basic scientists like to present the data to each other as bar graphs with standard deviation/standard error bars.

Tests of difference for continuous data (t-test, Wilcoxon test) and of association for discrete data (Chi-square, Fisher) will be provided.</description>

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
