      Supporting HIV positive women to delay or prevent an unwanted pregnancy may improve women's&#xD;
      health through family planning choices, regular health reviews, and support. A cohort study&#xD;
      that was done in Mbarara amongst HIV-infected women documented 50% of the enrolled women&#xD;
      having no desire for a (another) child during the 4 years since ART initiation, 51% had a&#xD;
      serodiscordant partner, with only 45% using effective contraceptive method. Key predictors of&#xD;
      contraceptive use were family planning goals within the DYAD. One of the key predictors of&#xD;
      effective contraceptive use was male partner involvement and CD4 count. The WHO recommends&#xD;
      dual contraception (use of condoms and a hormonal or permanent method) to prevent both HIV&#xD;
      transmission and unwanted pregnancies (WHO,2014).This prospective intervention study aims at&#xD;
      providing information on whether continuous family planning accessibility and support has a&#xD;
      measurable impact on pregnancy intentions and contraceptive usage among postpartum HIV&#xD;
      positive mothers delivering at MRRH, SW Uganda.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV status and availability of ART have been found to widely influence the desirability and&#xD;
      expectations to have children among childbearing women living with HIV (Nieves et al., 2015;&#xD;
      Kaida et al., 2011). Up to 85% of the pregnancies within 3 years following ART are often&#xD;
      unwanted, often leading to illegal abortions and maternal deaths (Desgrees-Du-Lou et al.,&#xD;
      2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uganda's HIV epidemic has declined over time to about a sero prevalence of 7.2% and this&#xD;
      decline has been attributed in part to improved prevention behavior like condom use,&#xD;
      reduction in multiple concurrent partnerships and other strategies to prevent unwanted&#xD;
      pregnancies. Specifically, HIV prevalence is estimated at 7% among women attending antenatal&#xD;
      clinics in Uganda (UN, 2010). Whereas ART availability has improved general health outcomes&#xD;
      through viral load suppression and immune reconstitution, there is still a high unmet need&#xD;
      for family planning among HIV positive women in Uganda (Snow et al., 2011), where modern&#xD;
      contraceptive prevalence is at 33% in the general population despite the widespread&#xD;
      promotional messages across the country. This continues to expose HIV positive women to&#xD;
      increased risks of unwanted/unplanned pregnancies, perinatal HIV transmission, pregnancy&#xD;
      complications, and increased economic burden of care for self and others among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high average fertility rate of 5.9 children per woman in Uganda may further complicate&#xD;
      the immunity and wellbeing of the already burdened HIV positive women and their families even&#xD;
      amongst those already accessing HIV care (Muyindike et al., 2012; Homsy et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supporting HIV positive women to delay or prevent an unwanted pregnancy may improve women's&#xD;
      health through family planning choices, regular health reviews, and support. A cohort study&#xD;
      that was done in Mbarara amongst HIV-infected women documented 50% of the enrolled women&#xD;
      having no desire for a (another) child during the 4 years since ART initiation, 51% had a&#xD;
      serodiscordant partner, with only 45% using effective contraceptive method. Key predictors of&#xD;
      contraceptive use were family planning goals within the DYAD. One of the key predictors of&#xD;
      effective contraceptive use was male partner involvement and CD4 count. The WHO recommends&#xD;
      dual contraception (use of condoms and a hormonal or permanent method) to prevent both HIV&#xD;
      transmission and unwanted pregnancies (WHO,2014).This prospective intervention study aims at&#xD;
      providing information on whether continuous family planning accessibility and support has a&#xD;
      measurable impact on pregnancy intentions and contraceptive usage among postpartum HIV&#xD;
      positive mothers delivering at MRRH, SW Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective To test the effect of a family planning availability and support&#xD;
      intervention on pregnancy intentions and use of effective contraception among recently&#xD;
      postpartum women living with HIV who delivered at MRRH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the influence of the intervention on pregnancy intentions among recently&#xD;
           postpartum HIV positive mothers delivering at MRRH, SW Uganda one year after the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the impact of the intervention (voucher) on contraceptive uptake among&#xD;
           recently postpartum HIV positive mothers delivering at MRRH, SW Uganda&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the influences of the intervention (SMS +Partner involvement) on contraceptive&#xD;
           uptake among recently postpartum HIV positive mothers delivering at MRRH, SW Uganda&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify factors that influence pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the influence of the intervention on the incidence of unintended pregnancy&#xD;
           among recently postpartum HIV positive mothers delivering at MRRH, SW Uganda&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To explore decision making challenges and perceptions of family planning among HIV&#xD;
           positive women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To assess the role of sexual partners on pregnancy intentions and effective&#xD;
           contraceptive use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a prospective randomized controlled trial of 2 arms. I. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to enroll a total of 320 HIV positive women delivering at MRRH. The&#xD;
      participants will be equally randomized into the intervention arm (Family planning support)&#xD;
      and control group (no family planning support, except the routine counseling following&#xD;
      discharge). These women will be followed for 1 year. Their male partners will also&#xD;
      voluntarily choose to participate in the study or not. Eligibility will also require access&#xD;
      to a mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Intervention group. Following delivery, the participants will be given a voucher to&#xD;
      freely access any of the five family planning options of their choice. A voucher will also be&#xD;
      given to the spouse/sexual partner due to its identified effect on family planning&#xD;
      utilization (Ashraf et al., 2014). Although family planning is already free, there are&#xD;
      usually stock outs. The voucher will therefore be an incentive to access the family planning&#xD;
      timely (maximum of 1 hour waiting time) and continuously from the study in case of stock&#xD;
      outs. These include; condoms (40 condoms), injectables, contraceptive pills, copper IUD and&#xD;
      contraceptive implants. The women will be contacted at 6 weeks postpartum for initiation of&#xD;
      family planning by a study nurse well trained in specialized family planning care and support&#xD;
      for HIV positive women if they have not done so yet. The choice of family planning will be&#xD;
      entirely up to the participants. For those women who select oral contraceptive pills, women&#xD;
      will be sent daily [adherence support] reminders for the first 4 months, then weekly&#xD;
      reminders (via SMS) for the next 4 month and then monthly for the next 4 months. This level&#xD;
      of SMS support has been found to have a positive impact on adherence (Haberer et al., 2016).&#xD;
      Sexual partners/regular spouses of women in intervention arm will also receive these&#xD;
      reminders weekly [but not daily or monthly] throughout the study. The reminders will also be&#xD;
      sent monthly if one chooses an injectable contraception [consider whether it's the 2-month or&#xD;
      3-month injectable] for the 12 study months. Daily reminders will also be sent for women who&#xD;
      choose male or female condoms. Routine reviews on family planning will be done for women in&#xD;
      the intervention arm alongside their routine visits at the HIV clinic or post-natal PMTCT&#xD;
      visits. Interviews with study participants will be done at baseline, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      postpartum. The spouses/ sexual partners will be contacted, enrolled and interviewed at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 months and at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Control group: These will be counseled on family planning at discharge and enrolled.&#xD;
      They will be interviewed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year. Data on reproductive history,&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS experience, socio-sexual relationships, fertility aspirations, use and knowledge of&#xD;
      family planning, decision making, and perceptions on Family planning, alcohol use, food&#xD;
      security, education, socio-economic, side effects or undesirable effects, economic and social&#xD;
      support will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural family planning methods like lactation amenorrhea, withdrawal methods and others have&#xD;
      been presented with mixed literature, painting a grim picture on their effectiveness as&#xD;
      standalone contraceptive methods especially among HIV positive women. All women are advised&#xD;
      to exclusively breast feed for 6 months while on ART (MoH, 2015). Because hormonal&#xD;
      contraception inclusive of estrogen interferes with breast milk production among lactating&#xD;
      mothers, progestin-only methods will be recommended to the women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive numbers ranging from 001 to 320 will be computer generated to indicate the 2 main&#xD;
      groups into which mothers can be randomly assigned and enrolled. These consecutive numbers&#xD;
      will be labeled on top of the opaque envelopes. To be eligible, mothers must be HIV positive,&#xD;
      have had a delivery within the last 48 hours, above 18 years of age, anticipating to begin&#xD;
      family planning at 6 weeks postpartum, must be mentally stable and qualify for any family&#xD;
      planning method available. Once eligibility of a mother is confirmed, they will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study and details of the procedures to be involved in the trial, potential&#xD;
      side effects and therapeutic benefits will be explained before randomization occurs. Once the&#xD;
      mothers consent to participate in the study, a study number will be allocated by the nurse&#xD;
      research assistant (who will be recruited to work on the ward/post natal clinic for this&#xD;
      study) by taking the next in a series of similar opaque envelopes provided to conceal&#xD;
      allocation of groups. These opaque envelopes will be labeled with computer-generated list of&#xD;
      numbers with group allocation (either Intervention group or Control Group) of the mothers&#xD;
      randomized in blocks of 20. Nurse research assistants will be blinded to the group allocation&#xD;
      until eligibility and study participation is confirmed. The research assistants will also be&#xD;
      blinded to hypothesis of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be drawn at baseline to confirm the HIV status and or do a CD4 cell count&#xD;
      in case it is unknown at the time of enrollment. This will be done to support women enroll&#xD;
      for the recommended Option B+ in case the women are not yet lifelong ART].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A different study nurse will be enrolled and trained to specifically collect data from&#xD;
      participants. The socio-demographic data and obstetric characteristics will be documented.&#xD;
      Other documented potential covariates of contraceptive use like participant age, primary&#xD;
      partner's age, primary partner's HIV status, personal and partner fertility desires, number&#xD;
      of children, most recent CD4 cell count, Efavirenz-containing ART Regimen (due to its&#xD;
      association in decreasing levels of hormonal contraception thus recommending dual methods and&#xD;
      its teratogenicity concerns- although these concerns have been found to be exaggerated),&#xD;
      socio-economic status, body mass index, education level, time on ART . Prior contraceptive&#xD;
      use experiences, fertility desire/ pregnancy intentions or aspiration will be measured using&#xD;
      the CDC pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Instrument (Ahluwalia et al., 1999)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective contraception use will be defined as consistent use [both self report and&#xD;
      observational chart review from study nurse at the family planning clinic] of a family&#xD;
      planning method (including consistent condom use) , including dual contraception (use of&#xD;
      condoms and another contraceptive method-hormonal or permanent) for HIV-sero discordant&#xD;
      couples/partners (for participants who know partner's status). A primary partner will be&#xD;
      defined either as a regular spouse, who is also a regular sexual partner or the most recent&#xD;
      sexual partner if no main partner is named. These sexual partners will also be enrolled and&#xD;
      interviewed at baseline and at 1 year. In case a consented mother ends up with a serious&#xD;
      adverse event, the time and indication will be documented and reported. In case a woman&#xD;
      changes the contraceptive method, the reasons for the change will also be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Preparation All data will be cross checked for completeness before entry. Data will be&#xD;
      coded and entered independently into the excel sheet and exported into STATA Version 12 for&#xD;
      statistical analysis. For each variable, a reference category will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan Data analysis will be by intention-to-treat (ITT) consisting of all&#xD;
      mothers randomized and thus supposed to be treated (Lesaffre, 2008). Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be used to describe key characteristics of study participants. Different variables will&#xD;
      be explored for normal distribution. Continuous variables will be compared with binary&#xD;
      outcomes of contraception effectiveness and pregnancy intentions using a t- test. Selected&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, post-natal factors will be compared for differences and similarities&#xD;
      in the three groups. Crude relative risks will be derived. Relative risks with 95% confidence&#xD;
      Interval (two tailed) will be calculated and used to compare contraception effectiveness and&#xD;
      pregnancy intentions in all groups. Factors associated with effective contraception use and&#xD;
      pregnancy intentions will be explored using univariate analysis and for results whose p value&#xD;
      ≤ 0.10, a multivariate analysis will be done to rule out confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Reporting The means will be presented with their standard deviations. Relative risks and&#xD;
      odds ratios will be presented with their 95% confidence Intervals. Two-tailed statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be used and statistical significance will be defined at level of p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
