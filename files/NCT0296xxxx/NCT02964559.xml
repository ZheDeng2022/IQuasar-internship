  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with skin&#xD;
      cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or other parts of&#xD;
      the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To establish the response rate of pembrolizumab in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the 6-month progression-free survival and 1 year overall survival of metastatic&#xD;
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (cSCC) treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8-12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
