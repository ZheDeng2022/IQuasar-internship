  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct an outpatient study testing two configurations of the bionic pancreas (bi-hormonal&#xD;
      and insulin-only) with and without remote monitoring of hypoglycemia in 25 adult (≥ 18 years&#xD;
      of age) subjects with type 1 diabetes in a random-order crossover study versus usual care&#xD;
      with an insulin pump with and without remote monitoring of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to measure the safety of eliminating the glycemic monitoring&#xD;
      that the investigators have done in all of the previous outpatient studies under both insulin&#xD;
      only and bihormonal bionic pancreas control. The investigators are planning to transition the&#xD;
      outpatient studies to an integrated bionic pancreas, the iLet, in the near future. The&#xD;
      intended use of this device does not include remote monitoring, which would not be feasible&#xD;
      on a commercial scale. Therefore, in this trial the investigators will test the effects on&#xD;
      hypoglycemia of eliminating blood glucose related monitoring. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will perform a pilot trial testing the effects of the bionic pancreas on food intake,&#xD;
      exercise, weight and body composition. The primary purpose of this pilot is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of performing these measurements in the context of a larger trial and to collect&#xD;
      data that can be used to power sub-studies of pivotal trials looking at these outcomes.&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will test the accuracy of two new CGM devices to see if they have&#xD;
      sufficient accuracy to provide glucose data to the bionic pancreas. If so, this would provide&#xD;
      new options for users who may have difficulties with the only currently validated CGM for&#xD;
      this purpose, the Dexcom G4 AP / G5 platform.&#xD;

Not Monitored for Hypoglycemia: During half of the study arms (one each bihormonal bionic pancreas, insulin-only bionic pancreas and usual care) the subjects will be remotely monitored for device connectivity only, not hypoglycemia.</description>

          <description>Subjects will wear the bihormonal bionic pancreas, consisting of a Dexcom G4 CGM, an insulin and glucagon pump and an iPhone running the study algorithm. They will be monitored for CGM connectivity and hypoglycemia.&#xD;
Monitored for hypoglycemia&#xD;
Bihormonal Bionic Pancreas: Participants will wear a Bionic Pancreas that uses glucagon and insulin (bihormonal) to automate their glucose control based on continuous glucose monitor readings.&#xD;
Monitored for Hypoglycemia: During half of the study arms (one each bihormonal bionic pancreas, insulin-only bionic pancreas and usual care) the subjects will be remotely monitored for device connectivity and hypoglycemia, and will be notified by study staff any time their continuous glucose monitor reads less than 50 mg/dl for 15 mintues.</description>
