      The objective of the REPRISE EDGE 29 mm EU study is to evaluate performance and safety of the&#xD;
      29 mm LOTUS Edge™ Valve System for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in&#xD;
      symptomatic subjects with calcific, severe native aortic stenosis who are considered at&#xD;
      extreme or high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).&#xD;

             atrioventricular block) that in the opinion of the treating physician is clinically&#xD;
             significant and requires a pacemaker implantation (based on the latest available ESC&#xD;
