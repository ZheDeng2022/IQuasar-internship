  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate pain and inflammatory parameters (cytokines, immune cells) in knee joint&#xD;
      tissue of chronic arthritis patients following intraarticular (i.a.) injections of morphine,&#xD;
      a standard steroid or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that i.a. morphine results in significantly lower pain scores and&#xD;
      supplemental analgesic consumption than placebo during the first week after injection, an&#xD;
      efficacy comparable to standard i.a. steroid (triamcinolone) medication.&#xD;

      3 arm, double blind, placebo controlled, prospective, mo-nocenter study, which will be&#xD;
      conducted in the Department of Rheumatology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Cam-pus&#xD;
      Benjamin Franklin in collaboration with several rheu-matology and orthopedic practices in the&#xD;
      Berlin area. Ultra-sound guided synovial needle biopsy and interventions will only be&#xD;
      performed at CBF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be treated with either morphine 3 mg i.a., NaCl 0.9% i.a. or&#xD;
      triamcinolone 40 mg i.a. at Baseline. The entire study period will be 2 weeks per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the primary outcome parameter will be at week 1. The patients will be monitored&#xD;
      closely throughout the entire study period with a total of 4 visits (screening, baseline,&#xD;
      week 1, week 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be collected in the adverse events form, vital parameters, physical&#xD;
      examination and laboratory tests dur-ing the whole study.&#xD;
