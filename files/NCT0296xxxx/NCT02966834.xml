  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GSK2330672&#xD;
      administration for the treatment of pruritus (itch) in participants with primary biliary&#xD;
      cholangitis (PBC). Participants will receive either placebo or one of the 4 dose regimens of&#xD;
      GSK2330672 (20 milligram [mg], 90 mg or 180 mg taken once daily or 90 mg twice daily).&#xD;
      Participants on GSK2330672 will also receive placebo tablets to maintain blinding. The study&#xD;
      has a prospectively defined adaptive design that will utilize interim data to further inform&#xD;
      and potentially optimize the doses under investigation. Hence, additional dose regimen may be&#xD;
      added during study. The total duration of a participant in the study will be up to 45 days of&#xD;
      screening and 24 weeks of study including follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at Week 16 in the Mean Worst Daily Itch Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were required to score the severity of their itching using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0 represents no itching and 10 indicates the worst imaginable itching. The Worst Daily Itch Score is the most severe (highest) NRS recorded on a given day. Mean Worst Daily Itch score was calculated as the average of the worst daily itch scores provided in the 7 days prior to the Week 16 visit. Baseline is the average of the scores in the 7 days prior to the Week 4 (Visit 3 [V3]). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was done using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including treatment group and centered Mean Worst Daily Itch score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at Week 16 in Primary Biliary Cholangitis-40 (PBC-40) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PBC-40 is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire for use in PBC participants. It consists of 40 questions arranged in 6 domains with 3 to 11 questions in each domain. Each question is scored from 1 (least impact) to 5 (greatest impact). All questions within a domain are summed to obtain individual domain score. Domains were: Symptoms (7 questions) with score range 7-35, Itch (3 questions) with score range 3-15, Fatigue (11 questions) with score range 11-55, Cognitive (6 questions) with score range 6-30, Emotional (3 questions) with score range 3-15, and Social (10 questions) with score range 10-50. Higher scores for individual domains represent a poor quality of life. Baseline is the assessment performed at Week 4 (V3) which is conducted prior to first dosing of randomized medication that evening. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA including treatment group and Baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D itch scale had been developed as a brief, single page, instrument for the multidimensional quantification of itch that is sensitive to change over time. It has data to support its validity in a population of participants with pruritus and covers five dimensions of itch experienced by participants: duration, degree, direction, disability and distribution. Each domain was scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (Not present/resolved/never) to 5 (unbearable/getting worse/always), higher scores indicates worst itching. The scores of each of five domains were achieved separately and then summed together to obtain a total 5-D score. A total 5-D scores potentially ranged between 5 (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus) where higher score indicates worse possible itching. Baseline is assessment performed at Week 4 (V3) which is conducted prior to first dosing of randomized medication that evening. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline at Week 16 in the Mean Worst Daily Itch Score</title>
        <description>Participants were required to score the severity of their itching using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0 represents no itching and 10 indicates the worst imaginable itching. The Worst Daily Itch Score is the most severe (highest) NRS recorded on a given day. Mean Worst Daily Itch score was calculated as the average of the worst daily itch scores provided in the 7 days prior to the Week 16 visit. Baseline is the average of the scores in the 7 days prior to the Week 4 (Visit 3 [V3]). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was done using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including treatment group and centered Mean Worst Daily Itch score at Baseline.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline at Week 16 in the Mean Worst Daily Itch Score</title>
          <description>Participants were required to score the severity of their itching using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0 represents no itching and 10 indicates the worst imaginable itching. The Worst Daily Itch Score is the most severe (highest) NRS recorded on a given day. Mean Worst Daily Itch score was calculated as the average of the worst daily itch scores provided in the 7 days prior to the Week 16 visit. Baseline is the average of the scores in the 7 days prior to the Week 4 (Visit 3 [V3]). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was done using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including treatment group and centered Mean Worst Daily Itch score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline at Week 16 in Primary Biliary Cholangitis-40 (PBC-40) Scale</title>
        <description>PBC-40 is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire for use in PBC participants. It consists of 40 questions arranged in 6 domains with 3 to 11 questions in each domain. Each question is scored from 1 (least impact) to 5 (greatest impact). All questions within a domain are summed to obtain individual domain score. Domains were: Symptoms (7 questions) with score range 7-35, Itch (3 questions) with score range 3-15, Fatigue (11 questions) with score range 11-55, Cognitive (6 questions) with score range 6-30, Emotional (3 questions) with score range 3-15, and Social (10 questions) with score range 10-50. Higher scores for individual domains represent a poor quality of life. Baseline is the assessment performed at Week 4 (V3) which is conducted prior to first dosing of randomized medication that evening. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA including treatment group and Baseline.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to measure analyze the following parameters: albumin, calcium, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from creatinine, glucose, potassium and sodium. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, within range [w/in] or no change, or high), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose laboratory value category was unchanged (for example [e.g.], high to high), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the &quot;To w/in Range or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed &quot;To Low&quot; and &quot;To High&quot;, so the percentages may not add to 100 percent (%). Only &quot;To Low&quot; and/or &quot;To High&quot; categories with potential clinical importance data have been presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Hematology Data of Potential Clinical Importance</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the following parameters: hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, w/in or no change, or high), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose laboratory value category was unchanged (e.g., high to high), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the &quot;To w/in Range or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed &quot;To Low&quot; and &quot;To High&quot;, so the percentages may not add to 100%. Only &quot;To Low&quot; and/or &quot;To High&quot; categories with potential clinical importance data have been presented.</description>

        <description>A 12-lead ECG was recorded with the participant in a semi-supine position. 12-lead ECGs were obtained by using an automated ECG machine. Data for abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS) and clinically significant (CS) ECG findings are presented. CS abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>

          <description>A 12-lead ECG was recorded with the participant in a semi-supine position. 12-lead ECGs were obtained by using an automated ECG machine. Data for abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS) and clinically significant (CS) ECG findings are presented. CS abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) Assessment</title>
        <description>GSRS is a validated scale used to assess gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by participants over the preceding 5 to 7 days. GSRS was measured for all 5 domains: Average Diarrhea Syndrome Score, Average Indigestion Syndrome Score, Average Constipation Syndrome Score, Average Abdominal Pain Syndrome Score, Average Reflux Syndrome Score. All individual domains are scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1(not at all) to 7(extremely). Higher score indicate more severe symptoms. The Average Total GSRS score was mean of these 5 domains and ranges from 1 to 7. Higher score indicates worst possible degree of symptoms. The responses summarized at each visit are those given during the week prior to the visit, with exception of Day 1. Baseline is the most recent assessment completed by participant prior to randomization. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Data has been presented for each domain along with the average Total GSRS score.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mean Worst Daily Itch Score of &lt;4 at Week 16</title>
        <description>Participants were required to score the severity of their itching using a 0-10 NRS where 0 represents no itching and 10 indicates the worst imaginable itching. The Worst Daily Itch Score is the most severe (highest) NRS recorded on a given day. Mean Worst Daily Itch score was calculated as the average of the worst daily itch scores provided in the 7 days prior to the Week 16 visit. Number of participants with Mean Worst Daily Itch Score of &lt;4 at Week 16 is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improvement of &gt;=2 in the Mean Worst Daily Itch Score at Week 16 From Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants were required to score the severity of their itching using a 0-10 NRS where 0 represents no itching and 10 indicates the worst imaginable itching. The Worst Daily Itch Score is the most severe (highest) NRS recorded on a given day. Mean Worst Daily Itch score was calculated as the average of the worst daily itch scores provided in the 7 days prior to the Week 16 visit. Baseline is the most recent assessment completed by the participant prior to randomization. Number of participants with improvement of &gt;=2 in the Mean Worst Daily Itch Score at Week 16 from Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Percentage of Responder Days with Worst Daily Itch score was calculated as: (number of days response from Visit 3+1 to Visit 6-1 divided by number of days from Visit 3+1 to Visit 6-1 with worst daily itch scores available) times 100. Days for which no worst daily itch score was available did not contribute to either the numerator or the denominator. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA model including treatment group. Baseline is the most recent assessment completed by the participant prior to randomization.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Sleep Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>Mean Daily Sleep Score is defined as the average of the daily sleep scores provided in the 7 days prior to the relevant visit. Participants sleep quality was recorded in an electronic diary each morning using a 0-10 NRS in which 0: good sleep to 10:worst possible sleep. Higher score indicates worse possible sleep. Baseline is the average of the scores in the 7 days prior to the Week 4 (V3) visit. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA including treatment group and Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Five-Dimensional (5-D) Itch Scale at Week 16</title>
        <description>The 5-D itch scale had been developed as a brief, single page, instrument for the multidimensional quantification of itch that is sensitive to change over time. It has data to support its validity in a population of participants with pruritus and covers five dimensions of itch experienced by participants: duration, degree, direction, disability and distribution. Each domain was scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (Not present/resolved/never) to 5 (unbearable/getting worse/always), higher scores indicates worst itching. The scores of each of five domains were achieved separately and then summed together to obtain a total 5-D score. A total 5-D scores potentially ranged between 5 (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus) where higher score indicates worse possible itching. Baseline is assessment performed at Week 4 (V3) which is conducted prior to first dosing of randomized medication that evening. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluating total bile acid concentration as a biomarker of PBC. Baseline is the assessment performed at Week 4 (V3), or if missing then Visit 2 or Visit 1, excluding unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Monthly Itch Score</title>
        <description>Participants were required to score severity of their itching each morning and evening using a 0-10 NRS where 0(no itching) and 10(worst imaginable itching). The worst of these 2 scores was Worst Daily Itch Score. For each week, mean Worst Daily Itch Score was calculated to form Mean Worst Daily Itch Score. The Monthly Itch Score was defined as worst weekly score (e.g., Mean Worst Daily Itch Score) for that month. The monthly itch score ranges from 0 to 10, higher score indicates worst imaginable itching. Baseline is average of scores in the 7 days prior to Week 4 (Visit 3 [V3]). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Mean change from Baseline in monthly itch score over 12 week treatment period is presented. Analysis was performed on change in Monthly Itch Scores over 12 week treatment period using Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with Baseline itch, treatment group, visit and a treatment group*visit interaction as covariates in the model.</description>

        <title>Ratio to Baseline in Total Serum Bile Acid Concentration</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluation of total bile acid concentration as a biomarker of PBC. Baseline is the assessment performed at Week 4 (V3), or if missing then Visit 2 (Day 1) or Visit 1 (Screening), excluding unscheduled visits. Ratio to Baseline was defined as the geometric mean of post-Baseline visit value divided by the geometric mean of Baseline value. Values were log-transformed and mean change from Baseline on the log-scale was calculated over the 12 week treatment period. Analysis was performed on change in total serum bile acid concentration on the log-scale over the 12 week treatment period using Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with log-transformed Baseline total serum bile acid, visit, treatment group, a log-transformed Baseline total serum bile acid*visit interaction, and a treatment group*visit interaction used as covariates in the model. Afterwards, values were back-transformed to the original scale. Ratios of geometric means are presented.</description>

          <title>Ratio to Baseline in Total Serum Bile Acid Concentration</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluation of total bile acid concentration as a biomarker of PBC. Baseline is the assessment performed at Week 4 (V3), or if missing then Visit 2 (Day 1) or Visit 1 (Screening), excluding unscheduled visits. Ratio to Baseline was defined as the geometric mean of post-Baseline visit value divided by the geometric mean of Baseline value. Values were log-transformed and mean change from Baseline on the log-scale was calculated over the 12 week treatment period. Analysis was performed on change in total serum bile acid concentration on the log-scale over the 12 week treatment period using Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with log-transformed Baseline total serum bile acid, visit, treatment group, a log-transformed Baseline total serum bile acid*visit interaction, and a treatment group*visit interaction used as covariates in the model. Afterwards, values were back-transformed to the original scale. Ratios of geometric means are presented.</description>
