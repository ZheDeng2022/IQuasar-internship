      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pill metformin treats diabetes. But it does not work for all youth, especially&#xD;
      African-Americans. The injectable Liraglutide treats type 2 diabetes in adults. Researchers&#xD;
      want to understand how these drugs work and if they decrease excess sugar made by the liver&#xD;
      in youth with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if using liraglutide and metformin are better than just metformin for decreasing&#xD;
      excess sugar produced by the liver in African-American youth with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      African-Americans ages 12-21 with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and&#xD;
      urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stop taking diabetes medicines for 1 week. They will learn how to check&#xD;
      blood sugars at home twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Overnight at the clinic. Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thin plastic tube (IV catheter) be inserted in each forearm by needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood drawn several times after drinking a sweet drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-ray of total body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and stool collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath tests while wearing a clear hood for up to 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several hours, participants can have only water. At 4 a.m. they will get sugar and fat&#xD;
      with nonradioactive isotopes in one IV. Blood will be collected. Every 30 minutes from 9 a.m.&#xD;
      to 2 p.m., they will drink small amounts of a shake and have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to take either both study drugs daily or just&#xD;
      metformin daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3-4: Participants will bring their blood sugar records and have blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5, after 3 months: Repeat of visit 2....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes in youth is an emerging public health concern that disproportionately affects&#xD;
      minority children. Among minority youth, African-Americans have the highest complication&#xD;
      rates, yet the reasons underlying this health disparity are not fully understood.&#xD;
      Furthermore, current treatment options are limited, and African-American youth have high&#xD;
      treatment failure rates. Metformin therapy is the only oral diabetes drug approved for use in&#xD;
      youth with type 2 diabetes. However, metformin works less than 50% of the time in&#xD;
      African-American youth and there is marked variability among individuals. Improving outcomes&#xD;
      in youth requires understanding the way that drugs such as metformin work in youth and why it&#xD;
      does not work in some individuals. New evidence suggests that the ability of metformin to&#xD;
      work effectively may be influenced by certain genes or differences in gut bacteria. However,&#xD;
      little is known about how genes or gut bacteria may affect youth, especially&#xD;
      African-Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To treat this aggressive disease, it is also necessary to simultaneously evaluate new&#xD;
      therapeutic options, such as combination therapy of metformin with liraglutide in youth at&#xD;
      highest risk for complications. Liraglutide is approved to treat type 2 diabetes in patient&#xD;
      10 years and older as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Liraglutide may be a useful early&#xD;
      treatment in youth with type 2 diabetes because it may decrease glucose produced by the liver&#xD;
      (an early prominent feature of type 2 diabetes in youth). This study is designed to examine&#xD;
      the mechanism of action in the liver of these 2 agents and explore how genetic and gut&#xD;
      factors may influence this action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to compare the ability of two anti-diabetic&#xD;
      regimens (metformin and liraglutide versus metformin alone) to lower gluconeogenesis (glucose&#xD;
      produced by the liver) in African-American youth with type 2 diabetes. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the effect of these regimens on the following: (1) hepatic glucose&#xD;
      production, and insulin sensitivity and (2) insulin and gut hormones concentrations (e.g.&#xD;
      incretins). In addition, we will examine the relationship of known differences in genes&#xD;
      associated with metformin transport and action with changes in gluconeogenesis and begin to&#xD;
      explore the role of gut bacteria to metformin s glucose-lowering effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a parallel-randomized intervention trial of African-American youth with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin therapy and who are within 5 years of diagnosis.&#xD;
      Patients aged 12- 25 years with type 2 diabetes will be enrolled. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into two intervention arms (16 in each group): metformin and liraglutide versus&#xD;
      metformin alone. The study will consist of 5 visits. At Visit 1, a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination and screening labs will be done. Then the eligible participants will undergo a&#xD;
      one-week drug-free run-in. At Visit 2 there will be an overnight inpatient stay to perform&#xD;
      metabolic testing prior to starting the study drug(s). Participants will start the study&#xD;
      drug(s) immediately after Visit 2 and remain on the study drug(s) for 12 weeks. Follow-up&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed at 4-week intervals (Visit 3 and 4). The final visit (Visit 5)&#xD;
      will occur after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this multi-site project is to begin to address diabetes disparities in&#xD;
      African-American youth by understanding the mechanism of action of these diabetes agents to&#xD;
      inform precision medicine initiatives. This project brings together the skills and expertise&#xD;
      of investigators within the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Disorders and Kidney&#xD;
      Diseases (NIDDK), the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), and the Children s&#xD;
      National Medical Center (CNMC). Patient recruitment and data collection will occur at NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center. Eligible patients may be identified through CNMC but no enrollment, informed&#xD;
      consent or study visits will occur at CNMC.&#xD;
