    <textblock>
      Many control mechanisms exist which successfully match the supply of blood with the metabolic&#xD;
      demand of various tissues under wide-ranging conditions. One primary regulator of vasomotion&#xD;
      and thus perfusion to the muscle tissue is the host of chemical factors originating from the&#xD;
      vascular endothelium and the muscle tissue, which collectively sets the level of vascular&#xD;
      tone. With advancing age and in many disease states, deleterious adaptations in the&#xD;
      production and sensitivity of these vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances may be&#xD;
      observed, leading to a reduction in skeletal muscle blood flow and compromised perfusion to&#xD;
      the muscle tissue. Adequate perfusion is particularly important during exercise to meet the&#xD;
      increased metabolic demand of the exercising tissue, and thus any condition that reduces&#xD;
      tissue perfusion may limit the capacity for physical activity. As it is now well established&#xD;
      that regular physical activity is a key component in maintaining cardiovascular health with&#xD;
      advancing age, there is a clear need for further studies in populations where vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction is compromised, with the goal of identifying the mechanisms responsible for the&#xD;
      dysfunction and exploring whether these maladaptations may be remediable. Thus, to better&#xD;
      understand the etiology of these vascular adaptations in health and disease, the current&#xD;
      proposal is designed to study changes in vascular function with advancing age, and also&#xD;
      examine peripheral vascular changes in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), Sepsis, Pulmonary Hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. While there are&#xD;
      clearly a host of vasoactive substances which collectively act to govern vasoconstriction&#xD;
      both at rest and during exercise, four specific pathways that may be implicated have been&#xD;
      identified in these populations: Angiotensin-II (ANG-II), Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Nitric Oxide&#xD;
      (NO), and oxidative stress.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin-II (ANG-II) is the end-product of the renin-angiotensin cascade, and acts as a&#xD;
      potent endogenous vasoconstrictor through binding to the angiotensin receptor (AT1) on&#xD;
      arteriolar vascular smooth muscle. With advancing age, there is a notable decline in plasma&#xD;
      renin activity accompanied by decrements in circulating ANG-II and an increase in AT1&#xD;
      receptor density. However, the functional consequence of this age-related adaptation of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on the peripheral circulation is not well understood.&#xD;
      Likewise, in recent years it has become apparent that cardiovascular disease is a major cause&#xD;
      of morbidity in COPD, which may be related to vascular dysfunction and associated adoption of&#xD;
      a sedentary lifestyle. In these patients, changes in RAS activity have been linked to&#xD;
      peripheral vascular dysfunction, with compelling evidence for improvements in peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen use following angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Like the aging&#xD;
      population, systematic studies evaluating AT1 receptor sensitivity and the efficacy of AT1&#xD;
      receptor blockade on peripheral hemodynamics have not been undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ubiquitous substance nitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as a key pathway for&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation, with the bioavailability of NO serving as an indicator&#xD;
      for overall vascular health. Cardiac risk factors have been shown to cause impairment in&#xD;
      endothelial vasodilator function in both the peripheral and coronary arteries. Coronary&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction is an important phase in atherogenesis and is associated with myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia. Furthermore, peripheral vascular function has been linked to coronary vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction which could have important clinical implications in terms of health screening.&#xD;
      Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been associated with the elderly, patients&#xD;
      with COPD, and most cardiovascular diseases including pulmonary hypertension, and heart&#xD;
      failure (HF), though the functional consequence of this adaptation on peripheral blood flow&#xD;
      regulation remains unclear. Thus, we propose the use of a compound which inhibits the enzyme&#xD;
      responsible for NO production in endothelial cells, N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), to&#xD;
      temporarily block production of NO and thus determine the importance of this pathway at rest&#xD;
      and during physical activity. Additionally, we propose the use of acetylcholine (Ach) to&#xD;
      determine endothelial-dependent vasodilation and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and nitroglycerin&#xD;
      (NTG) to determine the endothelial-independent vasodilation in the coronary arteries and the&#xD;
      periphery. Oxidative stress associated with aging has been shown to reduce vascular function&#xD;
      and antioxidant supplementation restores vascular function to levels that are&#xD;
      indistinguishable from healthy young adults. The manner by which this improvement in vascular&#xD;
      function occurs is not known by may be acting through a NO dependent mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histamine has been reported to mediate sustained post-exercise vasodilation through&#xD;
      histamine-1 (H1) and histamine-2 (H2) receptor activity, which results in a ~50% elevation in&#xD;
      femoral artery blood flow (above resting levels) that lasts for more than 100 minutes after a&#xD;
      single bout of moderate-intensity dynamic exercise. Vasodilation can be markedly reduced by&#xD;
      giving either fexofenadine (Allegra, a selective H1-receptor antagonist) or ranitidine&#xD;
      (Zantac, a selective H2-receptor antagonist). The combination of H1/H2 blockade abolishes&#xD;
      ~80% of the post-exercise vasodilation seen after whole-body exercise such as cycling and&#xD;
      this observation has been observed in multiple studies in young sedentary, recreationally&#xD;
      active, and endurance trained men and women. The impact of histamine on the post-exercise&#xD;
      vasodilatory response is substantial; however, the role of H1/H2 receptors in regulating&#xD;
      skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise is unknown. Thus, we intend to investigate the&#xD;
      role of H1/H2 receptors in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood during exercise as this&#xD;
      may be an important pathway in age and disease related reductions in blood flow during&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training and rehabilitation can be used as an alternative approach to combat the&#xD;
      deleterious effects oxidative stress on aging and disease. An effective exercise training&#xD;
      intervention can decrease sympathetic nervous system activity, improve arterial compliance&#xD;
      and vascular endothelial function, and alter the pro- and antioxidant balance resulting in&#xD;
      improved endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms. Moreover, exercise training concomitantly&#xD;
      improves musculoskeletal strength and function, glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      cardiovascular function, body composition, blood chemistry (decreased triglyceride and&#xD;
      cholesterol levels), and overall well-being. The physiologic effect of an exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation program in diseases such as COPD, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is&#xD;
      incompletely understood. However, recent studies suggest that exercise training in this&#xD;
      patient population is well tolerated and associated with clinically significant physiologic&#xD;
      improvements as well as improvements in various quality of life scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique feature of the proposed studies identified herein is the inclusion of a novel&#xD;
      methodological approach to comprehensively evaluate the functional outcome of the proposed&#xD;
      pharmacologic interventions. The recent development of a unique combination of nuclear&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques by members of our group enables near-simultaneous&#xD;
      measurements of both muscle perfusion and metabolism in vivo. The arterial spin labeling&#xD;
      (ASL) technique allows the measurement of both spatially and temporally resolved&#xD;
      quantification of perfusion, while the kinetics of phosphocreatine (PCr) depletion and&#xD;
      recovery provide high resolution measurements of muscle energetics. The interweaving of these&#xD;
      imaging and spectroscopic modules provides the opportunity for determination of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle perfusion and metabolism kinetics during and following the stress of physical&#xD;
      exercise. Thus, this NMR-based approach, combined with direct measures of muscle fatigue,&#xD;
      offers the potential to further define the individual and collective contribution of these&#xD;
      variables to the attenuated limb blood flow in the elderly and in patients with COPD and PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that each of these pathways outlined above represent an avenue by which vascular&#xD;
      function is compromised in the elderly and in patients with COPD, PAH and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. However, because these pathways are not mutually exclusive, the proposed studies are&#xD;
      designed to systematically evaluate hemodynamic responses to intra-arterial or intravenous&#xD;
      administration of pharmacologic agents specific for the AT1 receptor (ANG-II and Diovan, AT1&#xD;
      agonist and antagonist, respectively), the Endothelin receptor Type-A (ETA receptor) (BQ-123,&#xD;
      ETA antagonist), and the NO pathway (L-NMMA, Ach, and SNP) both before and after exercise&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
