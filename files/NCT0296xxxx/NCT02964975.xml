      Several meta analysis comparing successful Percutaneous Coronary Intervention of Chronic&#xD;
      Total Occlusion (PCI-CTO) with unsuccessful PCI-CTO showed that there is significant&#xD;
      reduction in short-term and long-term mortality. To our knowledge till today no prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial compared percutaneous revascularization of CTO with optimal medical therapy.&#xD;
      For this reason quality of live improvement is one of the most important indications for&#xD;
      revascularization in elective patients with CTO. In contemporary literature Seattle Angina&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SAQ) is a psychometrically solid disease-specific instrument designed to&#xD;
      assess the functional status of patients with angina. It comprises 19 questions that quantify&#xD;
      five clinically relevant domains: physical limitation, angina stability, angina frequency,&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction and disease perception/quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open prospective study patients with CTO of coronary artery will be randomized in two&#xD;
      groups: first - patients with percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusion&#xD;
      with optimal medical therapy and second group - patients with only optimal medical therapy&#xD;
      (control group). Primary endpoint will be quality of life and secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      mayor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). All patients will complete Seattle Angina&#xD;
      Questionnaire before randomization and after 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronary artery chronic total occlusion (CTO) is defined as complete occlusion of coronary&#xD;
      arteries that lasts for more than three months (TIMI 0 coronary flow in occluded segment). In&#xD;
      absence of serial angiograms , occlusion duration can be assumed based on clinical data&#xD;
      regarding event that caused occlusion. Consensus document from the Euro CTO club suggests 3&#xD;
      levels of certainty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Certain (angiographically confirmed): the minority of cases where a previous angiogram&#xD;
      (for instance before a previous CABG operation, or after an acute myocardial infarction) has&#xD;
      confirmed the presence of TIMI 0 flow for &gt; 3 months prior to the planned procedure; b)&#xD;
      Likely (clinically confirmed): objective evidence of an acute myocardial infarction in the&#xD;
      territory of the occluded artery without other possible culprit arteries &gt;3 months before the&#xD;
      current angiogram; c) Possible (undetermined): a CTO with TIMI 0 flow and angiographic&#xD;
      anatomy suggestive of long-standing occlusion (collateral development, no contrast staining)&#xD;
      with stable angina symptoms unchanged in the last 3 months or evidence of silent ischemia; in&#xD;
      case of recent acute ischemic episodes (acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina or&#xD;
      worsening effort angina), a culprit artery other than the occluded vessel should be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTO is an often finding. In spite of that, there is uncertainty should this lesions be&#xD;
      revascularized and in what way. If there are symptoms or objective proof of ischemia and&#xD;
      viability in the area of occluded artery distribution, recanalization of CTO should be&#xD;
      considered. Several studies showed that in the presence of chronic total occlusion collateral&#xD;
      circulation may produce supply of oxygen and preserve viability. However assessment of&#xD;
      collateral circulation with adenosine stress test showed abnormal coronary reserve in over&#xD;
      than 90% was reduced which means that collaterals are not enough Therapeutically&#xD;
      uncertainties lead partially from technical complex procedures of revascularization CTO with&#xD;
      PCI, with success rate of 60-70% which is importantly lower than revascularization rate of&#xD;
      non-CTO lesions (98%). During last decade there has been significant improvement in&#xD;
      technology, equipment and techniques of percutaneous revascularization procedures for CTO&#xD;
      that increased procedural success rate (around 90%). On the other hand there are separate&#xD;
      views regarding possibility of treating this patients with coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      (CABG), and specially patients with single coronary disease Metaanalysis performed by&#xD;
      O'Connor SA et al. showed that presence of chronic total occlusion on non infarct artery in&#xD;
      patients with acute myocardial infarction significantly increases mortality. Furthermore&#xD;
      several mataanalyses that analyzed the effect of PCI CTO on survival, showed significant&#xD;
      reduction of mortality rate in short term and also long term follow up. Studies enrolled in&#xD;
      this metaanalyses were retrospective or prospective registries which compared successful PCI&#xD;
      CTO with PCI CTO failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different explanations for this clinical result (mortality reduction):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. direct benefit of achieving coronary flow and myocardial perfusion improves ventricular&#xD;
           function and reduces risk of malignant arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients in which PCI was unsuccessful probably have more serious coronary&#xD;
           atherosclerosis and fibrosis that contribute to procedural failure and greater mortality&#xD;
           (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to previous metaanalyses study conducted by Prasada et al. showed significantly&#xD;
      greater mortality in the group with procedural failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conducted by Hoye et al. showed significant increase of 5-year mortality rate, CABG and&#xD;
      MACE in the group with procedural failure. Authors explained the difference in survival by&#xD;
      pharmacological management that can be confounding factor. Also authors stated that better&#xD;
      prognosis after successful procedure is probably related to improved left ventricular&#xD;
      function and reduced risk of malignant arrhythmias. To our knowledge, there is no prospective&#xD;
      randomized study which compared PCI CTO with optimal medical therapy. For this reason quality&#xD;
      of life improvement is one of the most important indication for revascularization CTO in&#xD;
      elected patients. However, in contemporary literature there is little data regarding quality&#xD;
      of life assessment in patients with CTO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life assessment is important indicator of successful revascularization in patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease. &quot;Seattle Angina Questionnaire&quot; (SAQ) is validated for quality&#xD;
      of life assessment in patients with coronary artery disease. This questionnaire is based on&#xD;
      five different domains : physical limitation, angina stability, angina frequency, treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction, and disease perception. So far quality of life assessment with SAQ was used in&#xD;
      four studies. Two of them compared results of SAQ in patients with successful recanalization&#xD;
      of CTO and patients with procedural failure. They proved significant improvement in SAQ score&#xD;
      in patients with recanalized CTO. Third study compared revascularization strategies (PCI vs.&#xD;
      CABG) with optimal medical therapy in patients with diagnosed CTO. In the group treated with&#xD;
      medical therapy there were no changes in scores of SAQ domains after one year follow-up,&#xD;
      while in patients that were revascularized in CTO territory improvement in SAQ scores were&#xD;
      documented in three domains (Physical restraint, angina frequency and disease perception).&#xD;
      Fourth study compared quality of life after CTO PCI vs.PCI in on non CTO lesion. In both&#xD;
      groups similar improvement was documented in all domains during 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far no prospective randomized study was conducted that examined quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with CTO.&#xD;
