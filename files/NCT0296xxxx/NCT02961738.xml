    <textblock>
      Narrative reformulation (NR) is an active ingredient of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)&#xD;
      which is assumed to increase engagement and improve outcomes. This trial sought to test these&#xD;
      claims. A randomized and controlled dismantling trial method has been designed to investigate&#xD;
      treatments outcomes for depressed patients receiving CAT in an Improving Access to&#xD;
      Psychological Therapies service. Participants will be randomized to either treatment as usual&#xD;
      (full-CAT) or CAT minus narrative reformulation (CAT-NR). The primary outcome measure is the&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with secondary outcome measures of anxiety,&#xD;
      functioning, helpfulness and the alliance. Outcomes will be assessed at screening, every&#xD;
      treatment session and at 8-weeks follow-up. The trial will enable as assessment of the&#xD;
      utility of NR during CAT. and whether CAT appears suitable for treating depression in Primary&#xD;
      Care.&#xD;

      Rationale Despite extensive outcome research validating psychotherapy in general as an&#xD;
      effective treatment, the outcome literature has been slower to identify the effective, active&#xD;
      ingredients of individual therapies. It has been proposed that different active ingredients&#xD;
      within therapy relate to outcomes; and definitive technical features are hypothesised to gain&#xD;
      importance as psychopathology increases. Therefore research is necessary which compares&#xD;
      components of overall treatments to assess their contribution to outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) is a brief therapy (16 or 24 session intervention) drawing&#xD;
      upon components of cognitive, and psychodynamic psychotherapies. CAT proposes the use of&#xD;
      specific interventions at identified time points within therapy, such as the reformulation&#xD;
      letter after a period of assessment. This narrative account reformulates distress, explicitly&#xD;
      linking problematic repetitive behavioural patterns with their developmental origins. The&#xD;
      client's current life situation is then described alongside target problems and their&#xD;
      underlying maladaptive procedures. The reformulation letter is considered a 'crucial&#xD;
      therapeutic task' and 'powerful agent of change', but its ability to act in such a manner is&#xD;
      largely assumed as the evidence base for these claims has been poorly researched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reformulation Despite numerous claims regarding the benefits of cognitive case formulation,&#xD;
      there is a paucity of methodologically sound research. This is magnified when looking&#xD;
      specifically at the CAT reformulation process. Existing research focuses on accuracy, and&#xD;
      whilst some research does exist regarding the impact of reformulation, these are narrative&#xD;
      case studies and cannot be generalised. Research utilising the single case experimental&#xD;
      design methodology has identified evidence of sudden gains at the point of reformulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression The introduction of the Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)&#xD;
      initiative has focussed on the use of brief, evidence based therapies for this client group&#xD;
      and particularly CBT at step 3 of a stepped care model. However, CAT is increasingly used in&#xD;
      primary care settings where a naturalistic evidence base is growing regarding its&#xD;
      effectiveness for treating depression. The contract can be shortened where 'the threshold to&#xD;
      consultation is low' and patients symptomology suggests mild disturbance. Working with&#xD;
      predetermined time limits acts to heighten the therapeutic process whilst protecting against&#xD;
      over-dependence; hence time-limited interventions can be as clinically effective as lengthy&#xD;
      therapy for most people. Brief CAT interventions may therefore be of use for mild to moderate&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the impact of reformulation letters with mild-moderately depressed clients&#xD;
           in terms of the therapeutic alliance and the helpfulness of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the outcomes (symptom amelioration) for depressed clients receiving a&#xD;
           reformulation letter as part of therapy and those who don't receive the reformulation&#xD;
           letter over time including follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide initial practice-based evidence of the effectiveness of 8-session CAT in Primary&#xD;
           Care with depressed clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients receiving a reformulation letter will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Display enhanced therapeutic alliances in comparison to clients receiving CAT without&#xD;
           the letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perceive therapy as more helpful in comparison to clients receiving CAT without the&#xD;
           letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Achieve better outcomes (greater symptom amelioration) in comparison to clients&#xD;
           receiving CAT without the letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical and Clinical Implications The proposed study will add to the nascent evidence&#xD;
      base for CAT, with regard to the impact of the reformulation letter on therapeutic processes,&#xD;
      outcome and effectiveness. Comparing the impact of receiving a reformulation letter versus&#xD;
      excluding this specific event allows its effects to be isolated. This contributes to&#xD;
      theoretical understandings of the active ingredients of CAT, and more particularly the role&#xD;
      of this specific tool. In addition this may inform the debate surrounding the role of&#xD;
      specific versus non-specific contributions in therapy. Identifying tools that augment&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness offers the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved understanding of how specific tools augment therapeutic processes and affect&#xD;
      outcomes has clinical utility. Producing and negotiating reformulation letters takes valuable&#xD;
      therapist, and in-session time. Their use, impact and perceived helpfulness are therefore&#xD;
      important to investigate thoroughly. This is perhaps of greater importance in brief&#xD;
      therapies, where time is a valuable resource. Furthermore, exploring the potential utility of&#xD;
      a brief 8-session CAT for primary care mental health problems provides a test of whether CAT&#xD;
      could be further adapted and shortened to match the service demands of Primary Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Utilising a randomised deconstruction methodology, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated into one of two active study arms (e.g. 'reformulation letter CAT' or 'no&#xD;
      reformulation letter CAT'). Outcome measures will be matched and taken on a&#xD;
      session-by-session basis, prior to, during, and following CAT treatment in both arms to&#xD;
      enable the comparison of relative efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Participants Participants will be recruited via Barnsley PCT's 's Improving Access to&#xD;
      Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service. They will be working age adults (18-65), referred to&#xD;
      primary care mental health services with mild to moderate depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 24 participants in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For supervisory purposes, fidelity to the CAT model will be assessed using:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A measure of CAT competence (CCAT; Bennett &amp; Parry, 2004). The CCAT measures therapist&#xD;
      competence over ten domains related to practice and model characteristics. Validity,&#xD;
      reliability and internal consistency have been established as sufficient (Bennett &amp; Parry,&#xD;
      2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure A Consultant Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist will identify clients meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria for the study. Suitable participants will be provided with an&#xD;
      information sheet explaining the research and inviting them to participate. Clients agreeing&#xD;
      to participate will be asked to sign a consent form. The consent form clarifies that&#xD;
      participants have read the information sheet and had opportunities to ask questions. The&#xD;
      voluntary nature of participation, confidentiality, and right to withdraw at any time is&#xD;
      stated. Consent will be sought to audiotape therapy sessions for supervision purposes. Once&#xD;
      consent to participate has been established the identified clients details will be passed to&#xD;
      the research team for randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated into one of two arms ('letter' or 'no letter') using&#xD;
      the GraphPad (2005) computer randomisation software package. Randomised participants will be&#xD;
      offered an 8-session course of CAT. The CAT will be delivered by one of three trainee&#xD;
      clinical psychologists in their final year of training, one of which is the researcher. All&#xD;
      of the trainees have completed a two-day introductory CAT workshop, in addition to standard&#xD;
      clinical psychology training to date. To minimise therapist effects participants in each arm&#xD;
      will be equally distributed among the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive eight sessions of CAT with a follow-up appointment eight weeks&#xD;
      post-therapy. Assessment will take place over the initial two sessions followed by&#xD;
      reformulation at session three. At the reformulation stage 12 patients ('letter' arm) will&#xD;
      receive a reformulation letter and provisional sequential diagrammatic reformulation in line&#xD;
      with standard CAT practice. 12 patients ('no letter' arm) will receive the SDR without a&#xD;
      reformulation letter at session 3. The remaining intervention and termination procedures will&#xD;
      follow standard CAT procedures. Patients in both arms will receive, and be invited to&#xD;
      produce, a goodbye letter at termination. All participants will be invited to attend a&#xD;
      follow-up session eight weeks post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure model adherence all therapy sessions will be taped for supervision purposes and&#xD;
      reviewed by the CAT qualified, and supervisor-trained supervisor. A minimum of one full taped&#xD;
      session from each therapist will be assessed for model adherence by the supervisor using&#xD;
      CCAT. In addition, taped excerpts from sessions will be routinely reviewed in supervision;&#xD;
      therapists will be invited to employ CCAT as a self-reflective tool in preparation for this.&#xD;
      Issues of non-adherence will be considered a training implication, representative of areas&#xD;
      for improvement and addressed via standard supervisory procedures. Non-adherence will not&#xD;
      preclude data inclusion for the purposes of this research; rather it will be addressed as a&#xD;
      limitation of the study related to therapist experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis To allow comparisons between the two active study arms the primary outcome&#xD;
      variables relevant to each hypothesis will be subject to analysis using ANOVA. Trend analyses&#xD;
      will be additionally conducted on session-by-session data to highlight and compare patterns&#xD;
      of change within the study arms over time. On the pre-post data assessments of clinical and&#xD;
      reliable change in each arm will be calculated and compared using the Reliable Change Index&#xD;
      (RCI; Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991). Outcome data from the PHQ9 will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      reliable change index (RCI; Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991). This identifies reliable and clinically&#xD;
      significant changes at small (z &gt; 1.96, p&lt;.05), medium (z &gt; 2.58; p&lt;.01), and large (z &gt;&#xD;
      3.29, p&lt;.001) effect sizes. Power analysis suggests sufficient power for a Between x Within&#xD;
      Subjects ANOVA, paying particular attention to the Groups x Time-Points interaction effect.&#xD;
      Assuming a 'medium' effect size of f = .25, a significance level of alpha = .05, and 2 groups&#xD;
      of participants providing data at four time points (pre, reformulation, post, and follow up)&#xD;
      the proposed total sample size of 24 gives 80% power. Power analysis also suggests sufficient&#xD;
      power to conduct a trend analysis form of ANOVA to investigate patterns of change over time&#xD;
      (session-by-session data). Assuming a 'medium' effect size of f = .25, a significance level&#xD;
      of alpha = .05, and 2 groups of participants providing data at eight time points&#xD;
      (session-by-session data excluding follow up) the proposed sample size of 24 will give 95%&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients receiving a reformulation letter will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Display enhanced therapeutic alliances in comparison to clients receiving CAT without&#xD;
           the letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perceive therapy as more helpful in comparison to clients receiving CAT without the&#xD;
           letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Achieve better outcomes (greater symptom amelioration) in comparison to clients&#xD;
           receiving CAT without the letter.&#xD;
