  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of binimetinib in combination&#xD;
      with pemetrexed and cisplatin, and to demonstrate that the combination is feasible and has&#xD;
      preliminary activity in previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC and documented KRAS&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for more effective therapies for patients with advanced NSCLC driven by the&#xD;
      RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. These tumors are generally aggressive, are almost exclusively of&#xD;
      non-squamous histology, and represent the largest group of patients with advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      harboring specific driver mutations in Western populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on recent preclinical and clinical evidence, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase&#xD;
      (MEK)-inhibition plus first-line chemotherapy is a promising new treatment for patients with&#xD;
      NSCLC and KRAS [v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog] mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binimetinib is a medication without marketing authorization. Pemetrexed and cisplatin have&#xD;
      marketing authorization in Switzerland and in EU for the treatment of non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) and will be administered as standard backbone treatment according to their&#xD;
      Swissmedic-approved indication, dose and route of administration. Binimetinib, pemetrexed and&#xD;
      cisplatin are IMP in the context of this phase I trial.&#xD;
