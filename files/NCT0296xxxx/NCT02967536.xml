  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our multi-disciplinary research group works closely with people who have obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnoea. This is a life-long illness that causes breathing to stop during sleep, which leads&#xD;
      to low-oxygen in the blood. Breathing restarts when the airway at the back of the throat&#xD;
      reopens, usually during arousal from sleep. In some people the repeated arousals from sleep&#xD;
      cause daytime sleepiness. Our research has shown that the low blood oxygen levels affect&#xD;
      thinking and feeling, and in some cases we think it damages the brain cells involved with&#xD;
      memory, attention, emotions and decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the relationship between the amount of oxygen in the blood and&#xD;
      the loss (if any) of brain cells. Also how the ability to perform complex tasks is affected&#xD;
      in patients that suffer from sleep apnoea. The results will show whether the brain damage in&#xD;
      patients with sleep apnoea can be reversed with treatment. These findings will guide doctors&#xD;
      in the treatment for sleep apnoea and they will cast light onto the process of memory decline&#xD;
      with the aim to preserve brain function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional physiological study, which is anticipated to last for 4 years. In&#xD;
      order to study the mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA),&#xD;
      patients will start Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment following the&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnoea. CPAP is the treatment of choice for patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe OSA who are sleepy during the day. It is also used in patients with mild&#xD;
      OSA if they are excessively sleepy or suffer from cardiovascular risk factors. It is&#xD;
      recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) as a treatment for&#xD;
      adults with moderate or severe OSA (Sleep apnoea - continuous positive airway pressure, NICE&#xD;
      2008). In the proposed study the initiation of CPAP will be within the 18 week period set out&#xD;
      in the National Health Service (NHS) Improvement Plan and Standards for Better Health&#xD;
      (Standards for Better Health, Department of Health 2004). No patient with a diagnosis of OSA&#xD;
      will commence treatment with CPAP later than advised by the NICE guidelines of clinical&#xD;
      judgement for the best interest of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the neuroinflammation process and discrete changes in the brain of&#xD;
      patients with OSA, a minimum of 9 patients with mild OSA and 9 patients with severe OSA will&#xD;
      be compared to 9 healthy controls following initial sleep (assessment) study. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo a dynamic Positron Emission Tomography with Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (PET-MR) scan with the Translocator protein (TSPO) tracer [Fluorine-18]&#xD;
      N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl]-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-acetamide&#xD;
      (DPA-714) at the time of enrolment to the study. Each participant will also have an MRI scan&#xD;
      and cognitive testing.&#xD;
