  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicentral clinical trial to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of Recombinant Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Receptor Ⅱ IgG Fc fusion protein injection&#xD;
      (Yisaipu®) in the treatment of peripheral enthesitis in active axial spondyloarthritis(SpA)&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mardird sonographic enthesis index (MASEI) was one of the most wide used scoring systems for&#xD;
      peripheral enthesitis and the only one based on OMERACT definition of enthesopathy by EULAR.&#xD;
      The primary purpose is to assess the MASEI to discover the value of US in diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis. The second prupose is to assess different maintaining treatment programme in SpA&#xD;
      patients with improvement of MASEI. The trial will include 96 patients with stable NSAIDs&#xD;
      therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of Yisaipu®. Then at the&#xD;
      second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA, ASDAS&lt;2.1) at 24th week will&#xD;
      be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu® group, half-dose of Yisaipu®&#xD;
      group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 24 weeks. Patients who complete&#xD;
      the 48-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the blind stage would finish the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
