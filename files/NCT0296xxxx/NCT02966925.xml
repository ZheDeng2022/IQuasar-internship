  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvovaginal irritation is a frequent complaint among postmenopausal women. Common symptoms&#xD;
      of vaginal atrophy include dryness, itching, burning and dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will assess the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) combined to&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid (HA) to relieve vulvovaginal dryness in patients who cannot benefit from&#xD;
      reference treatments (hormonal therapies).To achieve this, 20 patients suffering from&#xD;
      vulvovaginal dryness will be treated with one session of injections in the vulva, the&#xD;
      posterior vaginal wall and the perineum, and followed-up for 6 months. Improvement of vaginal&#xD;
      dryness will be primarily appreciated through Friedmann score and pH value, and secondarily&#xD;
      through the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), as measured at baseline and 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A treatment relying on the association of both platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      (HA) could represent a therapeutical alternative for patients suffering from vulvovaginal&#xD;
      dryness who cannot be treated with hormone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, hyaluronic acid is widely distributed in all tissues, and most particularly in&#xD;
      vulvovaginal tissues. Due to its hydrating and healing properties, HA plays a key role in&#xD;
      tissue regeneration, facilitating the entry of a large number and variety of cells into the&#xD;
      injured area, reconstructing in this way an extracellular matrix capable of supporting the&#xD;
      proliferation and differentiation of cells for tissue regeneration. In addition,its ability&#xD;
      to retain water at up to 1000x its weight makes it the ideal substance for ensuring hydration&#xD;
      of the skin. Thus, the gynaecological use of HA could be a promising therapeutic option for&#xD;
      the treatment of vulvovaginal dryness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, numerous studies have shown the role of PRP in the healing of soft and&#xD;
      hard tissues. PRP is an autologous preparation from the patient's own blood playing the role&#xD;
      of growth factors reservoir during treatment. Indeed, platelet activation induces&#xD;
      alpha-granules degranulation, releasing synthesized pre-packaged growth factors. Once&#xD;
      released, growth factors induce different cell signaling cascades that activate angiogenesis,&#xD;
      cell proliferation, cell differentiation and new matrix synthesis for tissue regeneration. A&#xD;
      recent clinical study showed that PRP could significantly reduce sexual distress of patients&#xD;
      suffering from dyspareunia and suggests that PRP could improve vaginal vascularization and&#xD;
      physiologic responsivness in patients with vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present pilot study, a combination of PRP/HA obtained with Cellular Matrix will be&#xD;
      injected in the vulva, vaginal wall and perineum of women with vulvovaginal dryness. Outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared before and at various timepoints after treatment.&#xD;
