  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pasta is an important example of a food which can lower the glycemic index (GI) of the diet,&#xD;
      a property that has been exploited extensively in studies of low GI dietary patterns.&#xD;
      Although low-GI dietary patterns have been shown to improve body weight, glycemic control and&#xD;
      blood lipids, it is unclear whether pasta as part of low-GI dietary patterns will improve&#xD;
      measures of global adiposity including body weight. The lack of high quality knowledge&#xD;
      syntheses to support evidence-based dietary guidance of the cardiometabolic benefits of pasta&#xD;
      represents an urgent call for stronger evidence. To improve evidence-based guidance for pasta&#xD;
      recommendations, the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis&#xD;
      of controlled studies in humans to assess the effect of eating pasta as part of a low GI diet&#xD;
      compared to other diets on measures of adiposity (body fatness) in humans. The systematic&#xD;
      review process allows the combining of the results from many studies in order to arrive at a&#xD;
      pooled estimate, similar to a weighted average, of the true effect. The investigators will be&#xD;
      able to explore whether eating pasta as part of a low GI diet has different effects between&#xD;
      men and women, in different age groups and in people with high or normal sugar. The findings&#xD;
      of this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of Canadians through&#xD;
      informing recommendations for the general public, as well as those at risk of heart disease&#xD;
      and diabetes.&#xD;

      Background: Overweight and obesity is a key modifiable risk factor for the prevention and&#xD;
      management of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, CVD and certain cancers. Low-GI&#xD;
      dietary patterns have been shown to improve body weight, among other risk factors including&#xD;
      glycemic control and blood lipids, and have been associated with risk reduction of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and CVD. Current clinical practice guidelines suggest the replacement of high GI&#xD;
      foods with low GI foods for improvement of glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      Pasta is an important example of a food which can lower the GI of the diet, a property that&#xD;
      has been exploited extensively in studies of low GI dietary patterns. However, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether pasta as part of low-GI dietary patterns will improve measures of global adiposity,&#xD;
      including body weight in addition to other markers of adiposity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a review: The lack of high quality knowledge syntheses to support evidence-based&#xD;
      dietary guidance on pasta represents an urgent call for stronger evidence. A systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials remains the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; of&#xD;
      evidence to support clinical practice guidelines and public health policy. By pooling the&#xD;
      totality of the available evidence, a systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials would provide the best estimate of the effect of pasta on measures of&#xD;
      global adiposity relevant to the prevention and management of overweight and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To provide evidence-based guidance for public health policy, health claims, and&#xD;
      nutrition guidelines relating to pasta as part of low GI dietary pattern, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess&#xD;
      the effect of past as part of a low GI diet on markers of global adiposity, including body&#xD;
      weight in addition to others as well as regional markers of adiposity which have demonstrated&#xD;
      clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Randomized controlled trials that investigate the effect of pasta as part of&#xD;
      a low GI dietary pattern on body weight and other markers of adiposity in humans will be&#xD;
      included. Trials that are less than 3 weeks diet duration, do not have a control group,&#xD;
      include pregnant women, breast feeding women or children, or do not report data on markers of&#xD;
      body weight will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two independent investigators will extract information about study design,&#xD;
      sample size, subject characteristics, GI/GL diet, follow-up, and the composition of the&#xD;
      background diets. Mean ± SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard computations&#xD;
      and imputations will be used to derive missing data. Risk of bias will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The primary outcome will be mean differences in body weight as a global marker of&#xD;
      adiposity which has demonstrated clinical relevance. Secondary outcomes will be mean&#xD;
      differences in other markers of global adiposity with clinical relevance including BMI and&#xD;
      percentage body fat, as well as regional markers of adiposity with clinical relevance&#xD;
      including waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, sagittal abdominal diameter, and visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue [VAT] by imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Pooled analysis will be conducted using the Generic Inverse Variance method.&#xD;
      Separate analyses will be conducted for children and adults. Analyses will be further&#xD;
      stratified by metabolic phenotype (normal weight, overweight/obese, metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      criteria, diabetes, etc.). Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of&#xD;
      statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative&#xD;
      summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Fixed-effects models will&#xD;
      only be used where there is &lt;5 included studies. Paired analyses will be applied to all&#xD;
      crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by&#xD;
      the I2 statistic. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity and subgroup&#xD;
      analyses. If there are ≥ 10 trial comparisons, then a priori subgroup analyses will also be&#xD;
      conducted by dose (&lt;100g/day, ≥100g/day), comparator, follow-up (&lt;6-months, ≥6-months),&#xD;
      baseline body weight (BMI ≤25 &gt;25kg/m2), design (parallel, crossover), energy balance&#xD;
      (negative, neutral, positive), GI (absolute level [≤55, &gt;55], within-treatment change,&#xD;
      between-treatment change), fat intake (absolute level [&lt;30%, ≥30% energy], within-treatment&#xD;
      change, between-treatment change), carbohydrate intake (absolute level [&lt;50%, ≥50% energy],&#xD;
      within-treatment change, between-treatment change), protein intake (absolute level [&lt;20%,&#xD;
      ≥20% energy], within-treatment change, between-treatment change), dietary fibre intake&#xD;
      (absolute level [&lt;25g/day, ≥25g/day], within-treatment change, between-treatment change), and&#xD;
      risk of bias. Meta-regression will assess the significance of categorical and continuous&#xD;
      subgroup analyses. Non-linear relationships will be assessed by spline curve modeling (the&#xD;
      MKSPLINE procedure) to assess whether there is a threshold for benefit. If there are ≥10&#xD;
      trial comparisons, then publication bias will be assessed by inspection of funnel plots and&#xD;
      the Egger and Begg tests. In the presence of significant publication bias, an adjustment for&#xD;
      funnel plot asymmetry will be attempted by using the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as&#xD;
      interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and&#xD;
      publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail&#xD;
      feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers&#xD;
      networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each&#xD;
      stage. Four Knowledge Users will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines&#xD;
      committees. Target adopters will include the clinical practice, public health, industry,&#xD;
      research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide&#xD;
      analyses and improve key messages at each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      pasta as part of a healthy low-GI-dietary pattern on health outcomes strengthening the&#xD;
      evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes, by educating healthcare providers&#xD;
      and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
