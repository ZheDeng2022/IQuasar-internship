  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2b, randomized, open-label study will assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD)/efficacy of 48 weeks of lonafarnib (LNF) and ritonavir (RTV)&#xD;
      combination therapy vs. LNF monotherapy in patients with chronically infected with Hepatitis&#xD;
      Delta Virus (CHD). Sixty patients will be enrolled at a single study site. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will have CHD infection (≥ 6 months) confirmed by positive HDV antibody (Ab) test and HDV RNA&#xD;
      ≥ 3 lg IU/mL by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at study entry.&#xD;
