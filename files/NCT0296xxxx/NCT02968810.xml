  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well simvastatin works in preventing liver cancer&#xD;
      in patients with liver cirrhosis. Simvastatin may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in serum&#xD;
      AFP-L3% from baseline to 6 months following treatment initiation in patients with liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis who have a current model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) =&lt; 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months on the&#xD;
      change in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Serum AFP. Ib. Serum IL-6. Ic. Serum bile acid levels. Id. Liver stiffness. Ie. Fibrosis&#xD;
      4 index (FIB-4) score. If. MELD score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in serum AFP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by liquid-phase binding assay. Will use descriptive statistics and graphics at baseline and 6 months, as well as study random effects regression trends from baseline to 6 months for further hypotheses generation. Results from routine clinical tests into these regression analyses, specifically those that have been shown to be strongly predictive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis in prospective cohorts of cirrhosis including higher alkaline phosphatase, lower platelets, lower albumin, and lower prothrombin activity will be incorporated. Incorporated into these models will be variables representing important HCC risk factors captured through the epidemiological questionnaire, including body mass index, current alcohol use, and current dietary fat, carbohydrate, fiber, coffee, and antioxidants. Analyses will begin with univariate cross-sectional statistics for profiling the study population and bivariate tabulations as a preliminary step to possible model building.</description>

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             result prior to enrollment; women &gt;= 50 years of age who have not had a menstrual&#xD;
             period in the past year; and women who have had a hysterectomy, both ovaries removed,&#xD;
             or a tubal ligation; will not be required to have a pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of simvastatin on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, women who are able to become pregnant&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a&#xD;

             she should inform her study physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             and medical release&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with trial protocol and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had an abdominal imaging test (CT, MRI, or ultrasound) within the past 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or current use of statin medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current systemic use of medications known to interact with statins and potentially&#xD;
             increase toxicity, including gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, danazol, lomitapide,&#xD;
             verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine, ranolazine, strong CYP3A4&#xD;
             inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus [HIV] protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir,&#xD;
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, or cobicistat-containing&#xD;
             products), or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St.&#xD;
             John's wort, bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of adverse effects, intolerance, or allergic reactions attributed to compounds&#xD;
             of similar chemical or biologic composition to simvastatin (i.e., other statin&#xD;
             medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because simvastatin is a lipid-lowering agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects; it is not known whether simvastatin is excreted into human&#xD;
             milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast&#xD;
             milk; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with simvastatin, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with simvastatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior liver transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Any lab results that do not meet inclusion criteria after the Screen 1 blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic myopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior germ cell cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active malignancy within the past 5 years (excluding basal/squamous cell&#xD;
             skin cancer or prostate cancer with a Gleason score 6 or less)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active infection with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical contraindications to blood draw (e.g., hemophilia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent illness which in the opinion of the investigators would compromise either&#xD;
             the patient or the integrity of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current excessive alcohol consumption (average alcohol consumption of more than 5&#xD;
