    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if maternal hyperoxygenation is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for fetal left heart hypoplasia versus room air (placebo). This will be determined&#xD;
      by measuring how well a baby's heart valves and their surrounding tissue are growing and&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the investigators will examine brain growth using fetal ultrasound and MRI, and&#xD;
      MRI of the child's brain after they are born to determine if there is greater neonatal brain&#xD;
      maturity or mothers receiving oxygen compared to fetuses of mothers receiving placebo.&#xD;

      Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, and congenital&#xD;
      heart disease is the leading cause of birth-defect related infant mortality. Despite&#xD;
      advances, conditions related to left heart hypoplasia (LHH) are the most severe, and&#xD;
      contribute significantly to this overall mortality as well as morbidity, including delayed&#xD;
      brain maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions involving left heart hypoplasia (LHH) are among the most severe, and contribute&#xD;
      significantly to this overall mortality. Sequelae are not limited to mortality, as recurrent&#xD;
      interventions and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes are highly prevalent among survivors&#xD;
      with LHH. During the last 15 years, fetal cardiac intervention (FCI) has been introduced as a&#xD;
      novel treatment for these children. The potential to halt disease progression in utero and to&#xD;
      avoid or reduce the complexity of future surgery is very alluring. Current FCI is highly&#xD;
      invasive, and there is limited and controversial data pertaining to efficacy, risk, and&#xD;
      criteria for intervention. There is also a group of fetuses with LHH who require neonatal&#xD;
      intervention, which may include single ventricle palliation, but are not candidates for&#xD;
      current FCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to use a randomized control pilot study design to evaluate a novel&#xD;
      non-invasive FCI to improve left heart growth in the fetus with LHH. The intervention will be&#xD;
      chronic administration of supplemental oxygen provided to pregnant subjects (maternal&#xD;
      hyperoxygenation, MH) versus placebo. Currently, two FCIs are available for left-sided&#xD;
      disease, both of which are invasive and carry significant risk. The interventions include&#xD;
      aortic valvuloplasty for aortic stenosis and atrial septoplasty/stenting for hypoplastic left&#xD;
      heart syndrome with a restrictive or intact atrial septum. While there is tremendous&#xD;
      enthusiasm for these procedures, there is limited and controversial data pertaining to&#xD;
      efficacy, risk, and inclusion criteria for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a further group of patients with LHH without frank aortic stenosis but&#xD;
      hypoplasia of multiple left heart structures. While these patients almost universally require&#xD;
      neonatal intervention which may include single ventricle palliation, they are not candidates&#xD;
      for the fetal interventions currently available. This is the population of fetuses that we&#xD;
      intend to target. The etiologies of left heart obstruction are unknown, although the common&#xD;
      pathway is thought to be diminished blood flow to left heart structures in utero.&#xD;
      Hypothesized etiologies include abnormal or restricted PFO flow, reduced flow across the&#xD;
      mitral valve atrial septal aneurysm, low aortic flow due to aortic valvar abnormalities,&#xD;
      presence of a ventricular septal defect, or subaortic narrowing. In the fetus, maternal blood&#xD;
      with the highest oxygen and glucose concentration is delivered via the umbilical, and travels&#xD;
      via the ductus venosus to the right atrium, where the majority crosses the foramen ovale and&#xD;
      passes to the left heart. Most of that blood is used to perfuse the developing brain. In the&#xD;
      normal fetal heart, about 10% of the left heart output, rather than traveling to the cerebral&#xD;
      circulation, passes through the aortic isthmus and joins the blood that will perfuse the&#xD;
      lower body. The low volume of blood flow through the fetal lungs is due to high pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance. The fetal pulmonary circulation is very sensitive to small changes in&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation and tension. Pulmonary vascular responses to changes in&#xD;
      oxygen levels are very much related to gestational age and this sensitivity increases&#xD;
      dramatically with advancing gestational age in the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in both fetal sheep and human fetuses that when supplemental oxygen is&#xD;
      provided to gravid mothers, there is evidence of an increase in fetal pulmonary blood flow,&#xD;
      and this response becomes more pronounced late in gestation. This increase in pulmonary blood&#xD;
      flow results in greater blood flow to the left atrium, and potentially to the left ventricle&#xD;
      and across the aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From January 2013 to March 2014 , the investigators conducted a pilot feasibility study of&#xD;
      CMH in mothers of fetuses with LHH defined as a combined aortic &amp; mitral valve annuli z-score&#xD;
      (AMZ) less than -4.5. The investigators recruited gravidae with moderate to severe hypoplasia&#xD;
      of left heart structures in which growth potential still existed; therefore gravidae with&#xD;
      fetal hypoplastic left heart syndrome or severe aortic stenosis were excluded. Candidates&#xD;
      were challenged as follows: After a full fetal echocardiogram in room air, Doppler scans were&#xD;
      repeated after 10 minutes of maternal hyperoxygenation at 8 LPM 100% FiO2. Responders&#xD;
      (fetuses with greater than 10% increase in aortic/combined cardiac output) were offered&#xD;
      enrollment. Nine gravidae were enrolled. Chronic MH consisted of a minimum of 8 hours daily&#xD;
      oxygen until delivery. Enrolled gravidae were compared to retrospective controls, who were&#xD;
      all cared for at our institution from January 2013 to March 2014 with fetal LHH not&#xD;
      undergoing CMH (9 total). Rate of growth in aortic and mitral annuli was compared among&#xD;
      groups using longitudinal regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mothers tolerated CMH, and there were no significant maternal or fetal complications.&#xD;
      Mean increase in percent aortic flow after acute maternal hyperoxygenation was 35.3% (range&#xD;
      18.1-47.9%). Mean daily CMH hours = 10 (range 6.5-14.6). Mitral annular growth was 0.19&#xD;
      mm/week compared to 0.14 mm/week in CMH vs. controls (p=0.33). Aortic annular growth was 0.14&#xD;
      mm/week compared to 0.13 mm/week in CMH vs. controls (p=0.75). More than 9 CMH hours daily&#xD;
      was associated with better growth of the aortic annulus in intervention fetuses (0.16 mm/week&#xD;
      vs. 0.08 mm/week, p=0.014). In this pilot study, CMH appears safe and feasible, although&#xD;
      effect estimates of annular growth were small given the studied method of delivery and dose&#xD;
      of oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these findings, the investigators determined that CMH therapy should be further&#xD;
      investigated as a low risk intervention for fetal LHH. The current study design is a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, with a change in the route and dose of oxygen as illustrated&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Objectives The investigators aim to perform a pilot randomized control trial to&#xD;
      investigate the novel fetal cardiac intervention of continuous supplemental oxygen (maternal&#xD;
      hyperoxygenation or MH) to mothers of fetuses with left heart hypoplasia (LHH). It has been&#xD;
      shown that with acute MH, there is evidence of an increase in fetal pulmonary blood flow&#xD;
      resulting in greater blood flow to the left atrium, left ventricle and across the aorta.&#xD;
      There is evidence that chronic MH (CMH) in fetuses with hypoplastic left heart structures may&#xD;
      improve growth of the left heart, although these studies did not include control patients.&#xD;
      CMH also has the potential to attenuate prenatal cerebral changes thought to be secondary&#xD;
      abnormal cerebral blood delivery in fetuses with LHH and resultant poor maturation of the&#xD;
      fetal brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot study, the investigators intend to compare CMH to placebo therapy in 12 mothers&#xD;
      to determine effect estimates for a larger, multicenter randomized control trial (RCT) trial.&#xD;
      The team has recently completed a feasibility pilot in which 9 mothers received CMH therapy.&#xD;
      While there were no significant maternal or fetal complications, and results were promising,&#xD;
      effect estimates were small and controls were only retrospective, and not randomized,&#xD;
      limiting the interpretability of effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine if chronic MH therapy in mothers of fetuses with left heart hypoplasia&#xD;
      results in faster growth of the fetal mitral and aortic annuli compared to fetuses of mothers&#xD;
      receiving placebo. Methods &amp; approach: Recruitment will include mothers of fetuses with LHH.&#xD;
      Enrollees will wear a nasal cannula with 4 LPM flow 40% FiO2 oxygen or room air for 24&#xD;
      hours/day. Fetuses will be followed with echocardiography until delivery, when they will have&#xD;
      an echocardiogram at birth, and further care as clinically indicated. Rates of change in&#xD;
      left-sided valve annular dimensions in the CMH group vs. placebo will be compared, using&#xD;
      longitudinal regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if chronic MH therapy in mothers of fetuses with left heart hypoplasia&#xD;
      results in greater neonatal brain maturity compared to fetuses of mothers receiving placebo.&#xD;
      Methods &amp; approach: Recruitment, enrollment, and the intervention are identical to that&#xD;
      delineated above, as these will be the same patients. For this aim, tbrain maturity in&#xD;
      fetuses exposed to MH versus placebo will be compared using neonatal brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging, as defined by a well-known maturation score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMH for fetal LHH has the potential to have a major impact in the field of congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, as it is noninvasive, inexpensive, and universally available. Other institutions in&#xD;
      the United States and Canada have demonstrated eagerness to join in a multicenter RCT if the&#xD;
      pilot suggests positive results.&#xD;
