      Background: Pelvic pain is common during pregnancy and usually subsides after delivery. Some&#xD;
      women, however, experience severe and long-standing pelvic pain, judged to emanate from the&#xD;
      Sacro-iliac joints (SI-joints). Radiological correlates are absent and there are diverging&#xD;
      opinions regarding the value of different clinical testing procedures and the use of&#xD;
      anaesthetic blocks to reveal SI-joint origin of the pain. In case of slight or moderate pain&#xD;
      the situation may be solved by the use of analgetics and physical therapy, but in case of&#xD;
      severe pain the situation might end up in a discussion whether surgery with arthrodesis of&#xD;
      the SI joint might be of value. To our knowledge, however, the results from surgical&#xD;
      treatment has not been compared with non-surgical treatment in a randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The investigators´ hypothesis is that&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. there exists a specific identifiable subgroup of patients within the chronic low back&#xD;
           pain (CLBP) group in whom the pain emanates from the sacro-iliac (SI) joints, and that&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients in this subgroup may be selected based on thorough symptom analysis, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. that arthrodesis of the actual joint/s may reduce the pelvic pain. Methods: A RCT with&#xD;
           parallel group design with pre- and post-treatment data. Inclusion of women 18-55 years&#xD;
           old with pronounced pelvic pain for at least 2 years and having tried ordinary physical&#xD;
           therapy without improvement and being on sick leave at least 50 percent. Operation by&#xD;
           posterior approach with bone transplantation between the iliac bone and the sacrum,&#xD;
           using microsurgical technique. Patients in both groups, the surgical (S) and&#xD;
           non-surgical (NS) were all treated by formal physiotherapy at a five days stay at the&#xD;
           Clinic and instructed to continue their training at home according to the lines given at&#xD;
           the Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The primary outcome was perceived pelvic pain according to the assessments on the&#xD;
      validated Balanced Inventory for Spinal Disorders questionnaire (BIS) and on a Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) before treatment and at follow-up one year after treatment. The&#xD;
      perceived change in pain was also assessed on a transitional scale in the follow-up version&#xD;
      of the BIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary patient reported outcome measures (PROM) were pain related functions assessed on&#xD;
      the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire (ODI), the BIS and the Roland-Morris&#xD;
      questionnaire. Health related quality of life was assessed by using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36)&#xD;
      and Euro-Quol (EQ-5D) questionnaires.&#xD;

           pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Introduction Background and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. Pelvic pain is common during pregnancy and usually subsides after delivery. Some&#xD;
           women, however, experience severe and long-standing pelvic pain, judged to emanate from&#xD;
           the SI-joints. Radiological correlates are absent and there are diverging opinions&#xD;
           regarding the value of different clinical testing procedures and the use of anaesthetic&#xD;
           blocks to reveal SI-joint origin of the pain. In case of slight or moderate pain the&#xD;
           situation may be solved by the use of analgetics and physical therapy, but in case of&#xD;
           severe pain the situation might end up in a discussion whether surgery with arthrodesis&#xD;
           of the SI joint might be of value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, however, the results from surgical treatment has not been compared with&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment in a randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 b. The investigators´ hypothesis is that&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. there exists a specific identifiable subgroup of patients within the chronic low back&#xD;
           pain (CLBP) group in whom the pain emanates from the sacro-iliac (SI) joints, and that&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients in this subgroup may be selected based on thorough symptom analysis, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. that arthrodesis of the actual joint/s may reduce the pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3 a. A RCT with parallel group design with pre- and post-treatment data. 3 b. No changes&#xD;
           were made after trial commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participant 4 a. Inclusion criteria Women 18-55 years old with pronounced pelvic pain&#xD;
           for at least 2 years and having tried ordinary physical therapy without improvement and&#xD;
           being on sick leave at least 50 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4 b. Eligible outpatients at the Clinic of Spinal Surgery, Strängnäs, Sweden, were&#xD;
           informed about the study and those who consented to participate were included. The other&#xD;
           women received ordinary treatment. Data were collected at the Clinic of Spinal Surgery,&#xD;
           Strängnäs, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interventions 5. A percutaneous mechanical provocation test was developed to obtain&#xD;
           information regarding the possible pain origin in the SI joints. Injections with saline&#xD;
           or local anaesthetics blind for the patients were performed against the posterior&#xD;
           aspects of the SI joints, not intra-articular, to analyse the pain response at needle&#xD;
           contact with the joint capsule, the pain reaction during injection and also the pain&#xD;
           situation during the first hour after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Operation was performed by posterior approach with bone transplantation between the&#xD;
           iliac bone and the sacrum, using microsurgical technique. Internal fixation was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients in both groups, the surgical (S) and non-surgical (NS) were all treated by&#xD;
           formal physiotherapy at a five days stay at the Clinic and instructed to continue their&#xD;
           training at home according to the lines given at the Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 a. The primary outcome was perceived pelvic pain according to the assessments on the&#xD;
           validated Balanced Inventory for Spinal Disorders questionnaire (BIS) and on a VAS&#xD;
           before treatment and at follow-up one year after treatment. The perceived change in pain&#xD;
           was also assessed on a transitional scale in the follow-up version of the BIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary patient reported outcome measures (PROM) were pain related functions assessed&#xD;
           on the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire (ODI), the BIS and the Roland-Morris&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Health related quality of life was assessed by using the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 b. No changes in the trial were made during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size The sample size estimation was performed before study start by the&#xD;
           statistician (ES). It was based on our previous experience of improvements in 55-60 % of&#xD;
           the patients undergoing SI-joint arthrodesis compared to 10 % following physiotherapy.&#xD;
           Assuming similar results of improvements a total sample size of 34 (17 + 17) will detect&#xD;
           such a difference with the statistical power of 80 % (p &lt; 0.05) when using statistical&#xD;
           methods designed for change in rating scale assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7b. No interim analysis was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization 8 a and b. A randomization scheme balanced for surgery /non-surgery&#xD;
           patients was performed by using random permuted blocks in order to reduce&#xD;
           predictability. A set of closed envelopes in numbered order with the message &quot;operate&quot;&#xD;
           or &quot;do not operate&quot; was delivered to the Clinic by the statistician (ES) not involved in&#xD;
           the treatment of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allocation concealment mechanism 9. The patients were consecutively included in the&#xD;
           study according to the randomization envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Implementation 10. A statistician not involved in the treatment of the patients&#xD;
           generated the random allocation sequence. The surgeon enrolled the participants and a&#xD;
           research nurse at the Clinic performed the practical assignment, i.e. opened the closed&#xD;
           envelopes in consecutive order.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding 11 a. In accordance with the treatment alternatives the participants and the&#xD;
           care givers could not be blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11 b. Patients in both groups, the surgical and non-surgical, received equal treatment&#xD;
           with formal physiotherapy. Besides, the patients in the surgical group were operated&#xD;
           with arthrodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical methods 12 a and b. The patients reported outcome variables (PROMs) were&#xD;
           assessed on rating scales that generate ordered categorical data. Characteristic&#xD;
           features are the ordered structure with lack of information regarding size and&#xD;
           inter-categorical distances. Non-parametric rank-based statistical methods that take&#xD;
           account of these limited mathematical properties of ordered categorical data are used&#xD;
           for description and analysis. Frequency distribution, proportions, bar charts, median&#xD;
           and quartiles are used for statistical descriptions. Statistical analysis of difference&#xD;
           in outcomes assessed by transitional scales in the BIS by the two groups of patients was&#xD;
           performed by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Statistical evaluation of change in the&#xD;
           paired assessments made before treatment and on the follow-up occasion was made by&#xD;
           Svensson´s methods for paired ordinal data that provides measures of systematic change&#xD;
           in common for the group and additional measure of individual variability. The measures&#xD;
           and the 95% confidence intervals of systematic change in position (RP), and in&#xD;
           concentration (RC), and the measure of additional individual variability (RV) will be&#xD;
           calculated as well as the differences in these measures between the two treatment&#xD;
           groups. This statistical approach has been found to have a high power of detecting&#xD;
           differences in small samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Results 13. All patients in both groups received the allocated treatment and all&#xD;
           patients in both groups were also seen at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment 14 a. Recruitment started October 22, 2008 and ended when the last patient&#xD;
           was included in the study November 19, 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The follow-up took place from October 27, 2009 to November 19, 2012. 14 b. The trial was&#xD;
           performed as planned but stopped after 3 years when 19 patients were included because of&#xD;
           difficulties in recruiting eligible patients within reasonable time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           16. The analyses will be carried out on the complete groups of 9 patients in the Surgery&#xD;
           group and 10 patients in the NonSurgery group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           17 a and b. The analyses are ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ancillary analysis 18. None.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Harms 19. Will be reported when the analyses are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comment Limitation 20. There was a small sample size because of difficulties in&#xD;
           recruiting eligible patients, but a good research team and the choice of appropriate&#xD;
           statistical analysis shows the power of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Generalizability 21. Provided that the patients being selected according to the same&#xD;
           criteria as in the present study and the surgery being performed in the same way our&#xD;
           results may be generalizable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           22. During the last few years a remarkable increase is seen in the number of articles&#xD;
           published concerning arthrodesis in case of presumed SI-joint pain, this due to the use&#xD;
           of minimal invasive techniques. This increase in SI-joint surgery, however, is not a&#xD;
           result of a better pre-operative evaluation of the patients. To our knowledge our study&#xD;
           is the first RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other information Registration 23. The study protocol was approved by the Regional&#xD;
           Ethics Committee, Stockholm, (reference number 2008/289-31/3). In accordance with the&#xD;
           Declaration of Helsinki, all patients were thoroughly informed concerning all parts of&#xD;
           the study, both verbally and in written text, and gave their written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
