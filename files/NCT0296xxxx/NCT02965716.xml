  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma. Biological therapies, such as talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with melanoma&#xD;
      by shrinking the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (confirmed complete and partial responses) of&#xD;
      treatment with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      following progression on prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy alone or in combination with&#xD;
      other agents different from talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the durable response rate. II. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      defined as confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses in the injected lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the ORR in the non-visceral, non-injected lesions. IV. To estimate the ORR&#xD;
      in the visceral lesions (Cohort A). V. To estimate the median progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS). VI. To estimate the median overall survival (OS). VII. To evaluate the toxicity of the&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether adding talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) to PD1 blockade can increase&#xD;
      T-cell infiltration into tumors and whether change in T-cell infiltration is associated with&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate whether adding talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) to PD1 blockade can increase&#xD;
      T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality in tumors and in peripheral blood and whether increased TCR&#xD;
      clonality is associated with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate whether intra-tumoral injection of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) can&#xD;
      improve the tumor immune microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate whether tumor mutational load, mutations in the IFN pathway, and circulating&#xD;
      tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile are is associated with response to talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec (T-VEC) plus pembrolizumab (MK-3475) therapy in the anti-PD1/L1 therapy&#xD;
      refractory melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intralesionally (IL) and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 36&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 1 year&#xD;
      and then annually for a total of 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>Will assess the association between durable response rate and CD8 T-cell infiltration in the injected tumors using a two-sample t-test to test for difference in mean quantitative CD8 expression between patients who have a durable response and patients who do not have a durable response. If the distributions are far from normal or subject to influential points, then instead of t-tests, robust, rank based or non-parametric alternatives such as the Wilcoxon test will be used. The analysis will be repeated to assess the association between durable response rate and CD8 T-cell infiltration in the non-injected tumors.</description>

    <measure>Change in increased T-cell infiltration (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 28</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in T cell receptor (TCR) clonality levels assessed in peripheral blood (Cohort A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Will compute the clonality metric as the normalized Shannon entropy for all patients at baseline and day 28. The change in clonality metric will be computed and compared between durable responders and non-durable responders using a two-sample t-test with significance determined at the two-sided alpha=0.05 level.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in TCR clonality within tumor assessed in peripheral blood (Cohort B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the hypothesis that TCR clonality is higher in patients who respond to the combination therapy, suggesting that the T-cells are targeting the tumor, the clonality metric will be computed as the normalized Shannon entropy for all patients at baseline and day 28. The change in clonality will be compared between durable responders and non-durable responders using a two-sample t-test with significance determined at the two-sided alpha=0.05 level. The analyses examining TCR clonality in peripheral blood will be repeated.</description>

    <measure>Change in tumor microenvironment following talimogene laherparepvec (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Will examine the expression of approximately 10 candidate immune markers: PD-L1, PD-1, dendritic cell markers (CD80, CD86), immune suppressive cell markers (anti-FoxP3 for regulatory T cell, anti-CD68 antibody for macrophage, clone PG-M1, DAKO, anti-CD14 for monocyte, and CD15 for granulocytes). For each marker, a difference in expression will be tested between baseline and day 28 using paired t-tests at the alpha = 0.005 level to accommodate multiple comparisons. The association between change in expression level of each marker (from baseline to 28 days) with response using a two-sample t-test at the alpha = 0.005 level will be tested.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mutational load (Cohort A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the association between overall mutational load at each time point, separately, and durable response rate. Logistic regression to regress response status on the mutation rates (at baseline or at day 28) and use a 1-df test to obtain a p-value for the association between durable response and mutation rate will be used.</description>

          -  Patients must not have any other malignancy that requires active treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to risk of fetal or nursing infant harm;&#xD;
             women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to registration; women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to&#xD;
             use an effective contraceptive method while on study and for 120 days after last study&#xD;
             treatment; a woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had&#xD;
             menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine&#xD;
             contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy&#xD;
             and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy&#xD;
             prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation; however, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become&#xD;
             heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures&#xD;
             outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures&#xD;
