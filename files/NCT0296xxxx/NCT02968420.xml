  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to further understand the memory response to HPV vaccination&#xD;
      in subjects who have received 2 versus 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Although memory&#xD;
      responses can be detected shortly after immunization, the best approach to measure the&#xD;
      long-lasting anamnestic response is to challenge with a booster dose years (&gt; 5) after the&#xD;
      original exposure.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single center, interventional study to evaluate long term memory response to Q-HPV&#xD;
      vaccination and to natural infection. Memory response will be assessed by measuring&#xD;
      seroprotection 8-10 years post Q-HPV vaccination and to challenge with a booster dose years&#xD;
      after the original exposure to measure the long-lasting anamnestic response.&#xD;
