    <textblock>
      This is 3-arm, multicenter study that will be conducted through the Pacific Pediatric&#xD;
      Neuro-oncology Consortium (PNOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the safety and immune activity of a synthetic peptide vaccine specific&#xD;
      for the H3.3.K27M epitope given in combination with poly-ICLC and the H3.3.K27M epitope given&#xD;
      in combination with poly-ICLC and the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in HLA-A2 (02:01)+ children&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed DIPG or other midline gliomas that are positive for H3.3K27M.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are eligible will receive a specific peptide vaccine, along with a helper drug&#xD;
      called poly-ICLC, in combination with nivolumab, every 3 weeks for the first 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects will be monitored routinely by laboratory assessments, physical&#xD;
      evaluation, vital signs, and MRI. Subjects who tolerate therapy well and have stable or&#xD;
      improved disease after 6 months of treatment can continue to receive treatment, nivolumab&#xD;
      continuing every 3 weeks but vaccine and poly-ICLC now every 6 weeks, for a total of 96 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Safety of the vaccine (Strata A and B) or vaccine in combination with nivolumab (Stratum C) will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events (AEs), scheduled laboratory assessments, vital signs, &amp; physical examinations for subjects who receive the vaccination. The severity of toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0. AEs &amp; clinically significant lab abnormalities (meeting Grade 3, 4, or 5 criteria according to CTCAE) will be summarized by maximum intensity &amp; relationship to study drug(s). Grade 1 &amp; 2 AEs will be summarized if related to study therapy. Descriptive statistics will be utilized to display the data on toxicity seen.</description>

Any eligible subject that receives at least one dose of the K27M/TT vaccine will be considered evaluable for clinical efficacy. For subjects who are still alive at 12 months, OS12 will be censored at the last contact date. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
