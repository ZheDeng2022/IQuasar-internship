    <textblock>
      Aspirin is an essential drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The standard dose&#xD;
      is 75mg per day (much lower than that for inflammation or fever). One of the side-effects of&#xD;
      aspirin is a gastric ulcer which can be fatal. To prevent this it is common to use&#xD;
      enteric-coated aspirin. This passes through the stomach intact and dissolves in the&#xD;
      intestines. This prevents high levels of drug forming in the stomach reducing ulcer&#xD;
      formation. Recently there is evidence of high levels of aspirin resistance, ie, patients who&#xD;
      appear not to achieve the maximum benefit from aspirin. Clinical studies have shown a&#xD;
      significant increase in mortality among these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study that we performed showed that enteric-coated aspirin is not as effective as&#xD;
      plain aspirin. This was especially noticeable in heavier volunteers. In fact it appeared that&#xD;
      enteric-coated aspirin only delivers 50mg aspirin instead of the full 75 mg. For volunteers&#xD;
      resistant to enteric-coated aspirin simply switching them to plain aspirin solved the&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to recruit patients on 75 mg enteric aspirin and test them for evidence of poor&#xD;
      response to aspirin. Poor responders will then be given 75mg plain aspirin and tested for&#xD;
      their response. Those that fail to respond will then receive 150 mg aspirin. If the results&#xD;
      of the healthy volunteer study are replicated this would provide a very cheap and effective&#xD;
      solution to a serious problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study we have shown clear evidence for pharmacokinetic aspirin resistance in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers due to poor bioavailability of enteric-coated aspirin. However, it is&#xD;
      necessary to confirm that pharmacokinetic resistance is an important factor in aspirin&#xD;
      resistance in a patient population as well. To achieve this we will compare the response of&#xD;
      patients to enteric-coated aspirin and plain aspirin in an open-labeled cross-over study in&#xD;
      patients undergoing treatment with enteric-coated aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population: Patients will be recruited from Dr. David Foley's clinic in Beaumont&#xD;
      Hospital. All patients who have been prescribed enteric-coated aspirin (75 mg, any brand)&#xD;
      will be considered eligible for enrollment providing they are competent to give informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients of any diagnosis, any age and those on other medication will be considered&#xD;
      eligible. Patients who are likely to stop aspirin therapy within a few weeks due to planned&#xD;
      surgery or who are showing signs of adverse effects to aspirin will be excluded. Patients&#xD;
      already enrolled in a clinical study will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: After obtaining informed consent an appointment will be made with a patient to&#xD;
      return to give a blood sample (ideally 1-2 weeks). The patient will be reminded of the&#xD;
      importance of compliance and asked to keep a diary of aspirin use. On the scheduled visit a&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken and the patient will be advised to keep taking their aspirin and&#xD;
      that they would be advised of the outcome of the test within a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the platelet function assessment those patients with adequate inhibition of platelet&#xD;
      function will be informed that their aspirin dose is fine, reminded of the importance of&#xD;
      compliance and their role in the study terminated. Patients who do not meet the target level&#xD;
      of inhibition will be asked to return to the hospital where they will be switched to plain&#xD;
      aspirin. They will be asked to return after two weeks for a further visit. Platelet function&#xD;
      will then be assessed again. If the target inhibition is achieved they will be terminated&#xD;
      from the study and with the agreement of their physician they will be switched to plain&#xD;
      aspirin for future use. Those patients who do not achieve the target inhibition will be&#xD;
      switched to 150 mg plain aspirin daily. A final escalation to 300 mg will used if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet function tests Serum thromboxane. The gold-standard test of aspirin effects will be&#xD;
      serum thromboxane production as determined by ELISA. A 5ml blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      into a serum tube and incubated at 37ºC for 30 mins. The tube will then be centrifuged and&#xD;
      the serum removed and frozen at -20ºC until analysed. In a previous study the baseline serum&#xD;
      thromboxane levels in healthy volunteers was 276±99 ng/ml (±SD; n=142) and thus 95%&#xD;
      inhibition would represent 13 ng/ml. We have previously shown that a serum thromboxane value&#xD;
      of 2.2 ng/ml is a more effective marker of platelet function. This test will be unaffected by&#xD;
      other medications except for anti-coagulants such as warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. A second test to measure the effectiveness of aspirin&#xD;
      is arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. Blood will be collected into sodium citrate and&#xD;
      centrifuged to generate platelet-rich plasma. Arachidonic acid will be&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design (continued)&#xD;
&#xD;
      added to PRP and stirred in a platelet aggregometer. In healthy volunteers plain aspirin&#xD;
      reduced the aggregation response to 4% aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supernatant thromboxane. We have recently developed a novel assay that is extremely sensitive&#xD;
      to inhibition by aspirin. This is in effect a combination of the two assays described above.&#xD;
      The supernatant from the arachidonic acid-induced aggregation experiment will be collected&#xD;
      and frozen at -20ºC. The thromboxane levels in these samples will be determined by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verify Now (aspirin): Point-of-care assays are very useful for diagnosing aspirin resistance.&#xD;
      It allows instantaneous feedback for the doctor and allows remedial action to be taken&#xD;
      immediately. One of the more effective point-of-care devices is the Ultegra Verify Now device&#xD;
      from Accumetrics. This is a cartridge-based system that monitors aggregation in response to&#xD;
      arachidonic acid in whole blood. A small aliquot of blood will be tested for aspirin&#xD;
      resistance using the Verify Now assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This study will provide an estimate of the incidence of incomplete inhibition of COX in&#xD;
           patients on enteric coated aspirin. We plan on recruiting 50 patients with &lt;95%&#xD;
           inhibition which will provide a margin of error of 15% on the estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will determine if enteric-coating of aspirin is responsible for this incomplete&#xD;
           inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We will determine if patients with incomplete inhibition of COX on plain aspirin can&#xD;
           benefit from an increased dose of aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We will obtain data on the sensitivity and reliability of various aspirin response&#xD;
           assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the research. Cardiovascular disease is still the major cause of death in Ireland&#xD;
      today. Treatment with low-dose aspirin is a key strategy in preventing further cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. Recently enteric-coated aspirin preparations have become standard despite the paucity&#xD;
      of information on their bioequivalence to plain aspirin. The poorly defined phenomenon of&#xD;
      aspirin resistance has been shown to adversely impact on the benefits of aspirin therapy and&#xD;
      this has been associated with the use of enteric-coated aspirin. This study will allow us to&#xD;
      quantify the extent of aspirin non-response in patients on enteric-coated aspirin and confirm&#xD;
      if the use of plain aspirin will overcome this resistance. This will provide a very&#xD;
      cost-effective solution to a major problem in cardiovascular disease treatment strategies.&#xD;
