  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of lapaquistat acetate, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), taken with statins on cholesterol levels in subjects with hypercholesterolemia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemias are a group of metabolic disorders produced by raised concentrations of&#xD;
      lipoproteins, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is the lipoprotein that&#xD;
      transports endogenous cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues. Increased&#xD;
      cholesterol and triglycerides levels lead to an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, which is&#xD;
      the underlying cause of heart attack, strokes and peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite changes in lifestyle and the availability of potent lipid-lowering agents,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease continues to be the major cause of death in Western Europe and North&#xD;
      America. Serum cholesterol levels exceeding 5 mmol/L (193 mg/dL) are common in adults in&#xD;
      Britain and much of Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapaquistat acetate taken with either&#xD;
      torvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin or lovastatin (stable statin&#xD;
      therapy) in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Total participation time in this study is&#xD;
      expected to be up to 12 weeks, with an optional, 48-week, open-label extension period for&#xD;
      participants who qualify.&#xD;
