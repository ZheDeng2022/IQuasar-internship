      Clinical Part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of SUTENT in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme.Patients with tissue based diagnosis of&#xD;
      intracranial glioblastoma multiforme, above 18 years of age and of both genders, who have a&#xD;
      first tumor recurrence or progress after surgery, radiation- and chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      included. The hypothesis is that SUTENT will significantly increase the progression free&#xD;
      survival rate at 6 months in the study population.&#xD;

      Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary brain&#xD;
      tumor in adults and shows an incidence of 5/100.000 inhabitants per year1. In Austria,&#xD;
      approximately 350 patients are diagnosed with malignant glioma annually. Advances in surgery,&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy do only have a minor impact on the natural course of these&#xD;
      hardly treatable tumors. The mean survival time of adult patients with GBM is only 9-15&#xD;
      months from the time of diagnosis1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches based on a better molecular understanding of tumor progression and&#xD;
      tumor neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular Neurooncology has begun to elucidate the complexity of the transformed phenotype of&#xD;
      GBM with the goal to identify important molecular changes in the tumor cell that may be&#xD;
      amenable for targeted therapies3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elucidation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways responsible for the malignant&#xD;
      phenotype is now being translated into molecular therapies. At present, targeted therapies&#xD;
      with small molecule inhibitors directed against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or&#xD;
      downstream signaling pathways seem to be the most promising therapeutic approaches by&#xD;
      directly influencing oncogenetically altered signaling pathways4. Imatinib Mesylate (STI571,&#xD;
      Gleevec) is a potent inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl, PDGFR-α/ß, c-Fms and c-KIT tyrosine kinases.&#xD;
      Its ability to inhibit PDGFR signaling suggested therapeutic potential in malignant gliomas,&#xD;
      but single-agent imatinib showed only minimal therapeutic activity5. Erlotinib (OSI-774,&#xD;
      Tarceva) and Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) are potent inhibitors of the&#xD;
      Epidermal-Growth-Factor-Receptor (EGFR). However, both inhibitors have also demonstrated only&#xD;
      limited activity in GBMs with response rates of 10 to 15% and no significant prolongation of&#xD;
      survival6. Tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the&#xD;
      farnesyl-transferase and influences the Ras oncogene pathway. Overexpression of Ras is&#xD;
      implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant gliomas, but also amplified receptors as EGFR,&#xD;
      PDGFR and VEGFR can lead to its downstream activation. Clinical trials with inhibition of the&#xD;
      Ras signaling pathway showed also only limited biologic effects in GBM patients7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Rationale for SUTENT treatment of GBM Patients Reason for the limited activity of&#xD;
      selective targeting single agents, but also chemotherapeutic treatments, in GBM patients is&#xD;
      the heterogeneity and redundancy of the molecular pathways in glioma cells8. Therefore, a&#xD;
      multi-targeted therapy approach, inhibiting multiple molecular signaling pathways involved in&#xD;
      tumor progression and tumor neovascularization seems to be a more promising treatment&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUTENT (SUNITINIB, SU11248) is a potent multi-target inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, PDGFR-α/β, FLT3,&#xD;
      c-KIT, RET and CSF-1R. This drug has shown good solubility, bioavailability and&#xD;
      protein-binding characteristics9 and was highly effective in metastatic clear-cell renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (MRCC)10-12 and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)13,14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aggressiveness of GBM is reflected by a diffuse local infiltration into the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma and a high tumor vascularization15,16. Neuropathological hallmarks of GBMs are&#xD;
      pseudopalisades and microvascular hyperplasia. Pseudopalisades are characterized by an&#xD;
      accumulation of hypoxic tumor cells around a central necrosis (Fig. 3A), resulting from&#xD;
      increased metabolic demands of tumor cells or vascular occlusion. Such tumor cells express&#xD;
      high levels of hypoxia-inducible regulators of angiogenesis, including the hypoxia-inducible&#xD;
      factor (HIF)-α. HIF-α accumulates in the tumor cell and binds with its constitutively present&#xD;
      partner HIF-β. The HIF complex leads to transcription of hypoxia-induced genes, such as VEGF&#xD;
      and PDGF17. These growth factors are secreted into the extracellular space by tumor cells and&#xD;
      bind to its high-affinity receptors located on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. tumor cells (autocrine action), leading to tumor cell proliferation and survival, but&#xD;
           also stimulation of the HIF-α protein synthesis and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes (paracrine action),&#xD;
           leading to tumor-related neoangiogenesis18-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, VEGF may induce microvascular hyperplasia (Fig. 1B), a typical form of&#xD;
      neoangiogenesis immediately related to pseudopalisading cells16,22. Since necrosis and&#xD;
      hypoxia are located in the GBM's core, the most biologically relevant hypoxia-induced&#xD;
      neovascularization occurs further peripherally, favouring diffuse infiltration by individual&#xD;
      glioma cells and allows peripheral GBM expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of molecular and clinical rationales for SUTENT treatment of GBM patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The target molecules of SUTENT (i.e. VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT-3, c-KIT, RET) are strongly&#xD;
           expressed in GBM tissue and have a crucial role in tumor progression and tumor&#xD;
           neovascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vascular density in GBMs is among the highest of all human neoplasm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical studies with SUTENT demonstrated a radiological response and a significant&#xD;
           improvement in progression free survival due to SUTENT treatment in MRCC and&#xD;
           Imatinib-resistant GIST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In clinical trials using SUTENT the incidence and severity of adverse events and&#xD;
           laboratory abnormalities was relatively low (MRCC and GIST patients)&#xD;
