    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, tolerability and remission duration of&#xD;
      UVA 1 therapy versus 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy for patients with severe generalized atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be randomized assigned to UVA 1 phototherapy or to 5-MOP UVA&#xD;
      photochemotherapy as a first therapy. Besides emollients no additional treatment will be&#xD;
      allowed. First a detailed history inclusive drug history will be gathered. The skin type will&#xD;
      be determined and a clinical photo will be made. Prior to 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy an&#xD;
      ophthalmological examination, blood cell count and blood chemistry will be routinely&#xD;
      performed. A determination of the serum level of 5 MOP will be routinely made at the minimal&#xD;
      phototoxic dose (MPD) determination before start of the 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy. The&#xD;
      serum levels of total Ig E and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) will be additionally&#xD;
      determined at the start and at the end of each therapy. In all patients receiving 5-MOP UVA&#xD;
      photochemotherapy reliable eye protection by wearing photoprotective glasses during the&#xD;
      treatment and on the day of taking 5-MOP until night will take place. The skin of the&#xD;
      patients should not be exposed to direct sun light or to other artificial UV sources at the&#xD;
      day of irradiation. A determination of SCORAD Score will be performed by a blinded&#xD;
      investigator at baseline, after 10 and 15 irradiations as well as at every follow-up visit at&#xD;
      month 1, 3, 6 and 12. A clinical photo will be made at the beginning of each therapy, at the&#xD;
      end as well as at every follow-up visit. In case of a relapse (SCORAD Score &gt; 50 % of initial&#xD;
      value), or on patients' request for a premature resumption of the therapy (despite SCORAD&#xD;
      Score &gt; 50 %) patients will receive that treatment which have not been performed until now.&#xD;
      That means, patients who were treated with 5-MOP UVA as a first therapy will now receive the&#xD;
      UVA 1 phototherapy and vice versa. The minimum interval between the two therapies is at least&#xD;
      1 month except in a case of complete non response on the first therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irradiation protocol of the UVA 1 phototherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irradiation 5 x week for 3 weeks (altogether 15 exposures) Determination of the UVA 1 MED&#xD;
      prior to treatment Start with 1 MED if MED &lt; 70 J/cm2. Increase of the dose by 20 % every&#xD;
      time if there is not an erythematous reaction and by good tolerability until a maximal dose&#xD;
      of 70 J/cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irradiation protocol of the 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irradiation 3 x week for 5 weeks (altogether 15 exposures) Intake of 5-methoxypsoralen&#xD;
      (Geralen) 2 hours prior to each irradiation in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg Determination of a minimal&#xD;
      phototoxic dose (MPD) prior to treatment Determination of the 5-MOP serum level at the MPD&#xD;
      testing Start with 70 % of MPD, no dose increments during the first week. From the second&#xD;
      week increase of the UVA dose by 20 % if there is no an erythematous response (respectively&#xD;
      by 10 % if there is a light erythemal reaction), but at the earliest 96 hours after the last&#xD;
      increment.&#xD;

Determination of the minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) and Geralen serum level prior to treatment. Start with 70 % of the MPD, no dose increments in the first treatment week. From the second week increments of the UVA dose by 20 % in the absence of an erythemal reaction, respectively by 10 % in cases of a barely perceptible erythemal response. Increments of the UVA dose at the earliest 96 hours after the last increments. Treatment frequency 3 x week for 5 weeks (=15 exposures). No maintenance therapy except emollients.</description>
