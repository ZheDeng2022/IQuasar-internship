      RATIONALE: Developing a questionnaire that patients can use to assess their quality of life&#xD;
      related to the appearance of their face after surgery may help doctors plan the best&#xD;
      treatment for patients undergoing surgery and reconstruction for head and neck cancer in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is developing a questionnaire for assessing quality of life&#xD;
      related to facial appearance in patients who have undergone or are planning to undergo&#xD;
      surgery and reconstruction for head and neck cancer; and after dermatologic surgery for&#xD;
      patients with cutaneous skin cancers.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop and validate a new patient-reported outcome measure of quality of life&#xD;
           related to facial appearance following oncologic head and neck resection and&#xD;
           reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 (questionnaire content generation and development of preliminary instrument&#xD;
           [post-operative patients only]): Patients undergo semi-structured interview with a&#xD;
           trained interviewer and answer open-ended questions. Statements concerning facial&#xD;
           appearance post-resection and reconstruction are extracted to generate items for the&#xD;
           preliminary instrument. The preliminary instrument is developed from review of the&#xD;
           literature, qualitative interviews with patients, and expert opinion (head and neck&#xD;
           surgeons, reconstructive surgeons, and other relevant health care providers, including&#xD;
           nurse clinicians). The instrument is then pre-tested on a small sample of patients via&#xD;
           mail to clarify ambiguities in the wording of items, confirm appropriateness, and&#xD;
           determine acceptability and completion time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 (field-testing with item reduction and development of final rating scale):&#xD;
           Post-operative patients complete 2 copies of the preliminary questionnaires in the mail&#xD;
           or clinic approximately 2 weeks apart. Pre-operative patients complete the questionnaire&#xD;
           prior to surgery (during preoperative appointment) and again at least 1 month after&#xD;
           surgery (via mail). Data are analyzed to determine the most valid grouping of items into&#xD;
           measurement scales for development of the final instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 3 (psychometric evaluation of the patient-reported outcome questionnaire):&#xD;
           Post-operative patients complete 2 copies of the questionnaires in clinic or by mail&#xD;
           approximately 2 weeks apart. They also complete several other well-established,&#xD;
           validated instruments used to measure patient-reported quality of life and&#xD;
           symptomatology in order to aid in the evaluation of convergent and discriminant&#xD;
           validity. Pre-operative patients complete the final questionnaire prior to surgery&#xD;
           (during preoperative appointment) and again at least 1 month after surgery by mail or in&#xD;
           clinic.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this study is to develop a PRO instrument that measures quality of life as relates to facial appearance after head and neck cancer reconstruction surgery and after dermatologic surgery for patients with cutaneous skin cancers. . To develop this measure, we will adhere to the following sequential steps recommended by quality of life experts. Thus, the study will have three parts:&#xD;
Questionnaire content generation and development of preliminary instrument&#xD;
Field-testing the preliminary questionnaire with item reduction and development of final questionnaire&#xD;
Psychometric evaluation of final questionnaire</description>
