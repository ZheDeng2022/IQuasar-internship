      The purpose of this study is to determine if the pressure in the eye of a severely&#xD;
      head-injured person correlates with the pressure in the person's skull. This is a prospective&#xD;
      study of patients aged 18 and older who have experienced a traumatic closed head injury and&#xD;
      are intubated either before or during the time they are in the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
      Identified patients have an eye pressure measurement performed in the trauma bay by an OSU ED&#xD;
      physician not involved in their care. Information about their hospital stay, including the&#xD;
      first brain pressure measurement if a such a measuring device is used, will be collected. In&#xD;
      addition, the outcome of their hospital stay will be recorded.&#xD;

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United&#xD;
      States, with an estimated 1.5 million American sustaining a TBI and 50,000 people dying from&#xD;
      a TBI each year. While the immediate, or primary, injury causes significant damage, secondary&#xD;
      injury is caused by cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and resultant&#xD;
      hypoperfusion and ischemia. Elevated intracranial pressure is strongly associated with poor&#xD;
      recovery and death; failure to control intracranial pressure is likewise associated with poor&#xD;
      outcomes and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of elevated ICP allows for the initiation of early therapy. However, patients&#xD;
      with significant head injuries are often intubated for airway protection. The sedation&#xD;
      required for intubation obscures the ED neurologic exam. Precise measurement of elevated ICP&#xD;
      has required invasive monitoring via ventriculostomy. Yet this method is only provided at set&#xD;
      institutions with neurosurgical services. Further there are distinct time delays between the&#xD;
      trauma occurrence, transportation to a facility with neurosurgical services and placement of&#xD;
      ventriculostomies. There is at the forefront, then, to establish non-invasive measures of ICP&#xD;
      that are both time efficient and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies, including a pilot study conducted at this institution, showed a correlation&#xD;
      between intraocular and intracranial pressure. However, this relationship has not been tested&#xD;
      in an acute care trauma setting. We propose an observational cohort study of critically&#xD;
      injured trauma patients with suspected closed head injury. Patients requiring intubation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation pose a significant challenge to assess neurologically, as they are&#xD;
      almost always sedated and often chemically paralyzed to facilitate airway management.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is in this population of intubated trauma patients with suspected head injury&#xD;
      that we will evaluate the use of tonometry to predict intracranial pressure from intraocular&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Too unstable to allow the investigator access to the head of the bed to perform&#xD;
