    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Pemetrexed plus Carboplatin plus Bevacizumab&#xD;
      plus Enzastaurin, followed by maintenance Bevacizumab plus Enzastaurin can extend survival&#xD;
      time without disease progression in the first-line treatment of participants with advanced&#xD;
      stage non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to measured PD or death from any cause up to 12.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to the first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cutoff date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment. For participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from all study treatment) prior to objective disease progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to measured progressive disease or death from any cause up to 12.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response rate was defined as number of participants with overall best response of CR or PR over number of protocol qualified participants using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all tumor lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs or complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not worsening) of 1 or more non-target lesions. In either case, no new lesions may have appeared.&#xD;
Percentage of participants was calculated as: (number of participants with CR or PR/ number of participants qualified for tumor response analysis) × 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to date of death up to 14.3 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For participants who were not known to have died as of the data cutoff, OS was censored at the last contact date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progressive Disease (TTPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to measured PD or death from any cause up to 12.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTPD was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD). For participants who died without objective PD (including death from study disease), TTPD was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment. For participants not known to have died as of the data cutoff and did not have PD, TTPD was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of response to disease progression or death from any cause up to 12.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death from any cause. Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs. For participants who died without progressive disease or who were alive, DoR was censored at the last contact of progression free assessment. For participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from all study treatment) prior to PD, DoR was censored at the date of last progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy. Due to early study closure, DoR was not analyzed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacology Toxicity and Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to 14.3 months and 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically significant events were defined as serious AEs (SAEs) and other non-serious AEs. Participants who died due to progressive disease (PD) or an AE while on treatment and or died during the 30 day post-treatment follow-up are included. A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

          <title>Disease Stage</title>
          <description>Cancer staging is a process describing the severity of the cancer, size of the tumor and how far it has spread from the original location. Stage IIIB: a tumor of any size that has spread (metastasized) to distant lymph nodes, has invaded other structures in the chest (such as the heart or esophagus), or has a malignant pleural effusion (fluid build-up containing cancer cells between the layers lining the lungs). Stage IV: a tumor of any size that has spread (metastasized) to another region of the body or to another lobe of the lungs.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to the first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cutoff date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment. For participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from all study treatment) prior to objective disease progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Response Rate)</title>
        <description>Tumor response rate was defined as number of participants with overall best response of CR or PR over number of protocol qualified participants using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all tumor lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs or complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not worsening) of 1 or more non-target lesions. In either case, no new lesions may have appeared.&#xD;
Percentage of participants was calculated as: (number of participants with CR or PR/ number of participants qualified for tumor response analysis) × 100.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DoR)</title>
        <description>The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death from any cause. Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs. For participants who died without progressive disease or who were alive, DoR was censored at the last contact of progression free assessment. For participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from all study treatment) prior to PD, DoR was censored at the date of last progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy. Due to early study closure, DoR was not analyzed.</description>
