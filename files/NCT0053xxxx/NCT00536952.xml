      RATIONALE: Nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution may decrease the thickness of saliva in&#xD;
      the mouth and improve quality of life in patients undergoing radiation therapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy for head and neck cancer. It is not yet known whether dornase alfa inhalation&#xD;
      solution is more effective than a placebo in lessening the discomfort of treatment in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well dornase alfa inhalation solution&#xD;
      works compared with a placebo in treating patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck&#xD;
      cancer undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if use of nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution can improve the&#xD;
           overall daily symptom and quality of life as well as reduce treatment discomfort during&#xD;
           radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
           of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if once daily nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution given prior to&#xD;
           radiotherapy can reduce thick oropharyngeal secretions associated with curative&#xD;
           radiotherapy and chemotherapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if reduction in thick oropharyngeal secretions with the use of nebulized&#xD;
           dornase alfa inhalation solution can decrease the incidence of mucositis, infections,&#xD;
           and aspiration pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution via oral inhalation&#xD;
           approximately 30 minutes prior to radiation therapy on days 1-5. Treatment continues for&#xD;
           up to 4 weeks (weeks 3-6 of radiation therapy) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive nebulized placebo via oral inhalation approximately 30 minutes&#xD;
           prior to radiation therapy on days 1-5. Treatment continues for up to 4 weeks as in arm&#xD;
           I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are assessed for treatment-related symptoms and treatment disturbance daily&#xD;
      during radiation therapy. Patients are assessed for quality of life weekly during radiation&#xD;
      therapy and then monthly during follow-up for 3 months. Clinical symptoms (i.e., mucositis,&#xD;
      bacterial and fungal infections, and aspiration pneumonia) are also assessed weekly during&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum samples are collected prior to initiating radiation therapy (at baseline) and&#xD;
      periodically during week 3 of radiation treatment and evaluated for salivary DNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every&#xD;
      3-4 months for a minimum of 2 years.&#xD;
