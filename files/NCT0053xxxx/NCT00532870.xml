      The laparoscopic repair of ventral hernias is still a controversial therapeutic option. To&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic repair we compare the results of the open&#xD;
      and laparoscopic repair of ventral hernia,. 53 patients were undergo laparoscopic or open&#xD;
      repair of ventral hernia . All defects were estimated to be larger than 5 cm in diameter.&#xD;
      Twenty six patients underwent attempted laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) with mesh&#xD;
      and twenty seven patients underwent open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) with mesh&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between March 2003 and December 2004, 53 patients (16 males and 37 females) with ventral&#xD;
      hernias were treated by a laparoscopic or open approach. Patients were divided into two&#xD;
      groups: one group underwent laparoscopic repair with GORE-TEX Dual Mesh, and the other group&#xD;
      underwent open repair with proline mesh. Informed written consents were obtained from all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria involved any patient aged over 30 years, medical fitness for general&#xD;
      anesthesia, the absence of coagulopathy, and hernial defect ≥ 5 cm in any dimension or&#xD;
      recurrent hernias. Exclusion criteria were neoplastic patients, immune compromised patients,&#xD;
      mentally incompetent patients and those who refused to give signed consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic features, operative details and postoperative outcomes were collected&#xD;
      prospectively and included patient age, gender, body mass index (BMI) (weight in kg/height in&#xD;
      m2), number of prior abdominal operations, number of previous hernia repairs, technique of&#xD;
      repair, size of facial defect, type of prosthetic mesh, operating time, conversion rate,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, operative and postoperative complications, and hernia recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-seven patients presented with an incisional hernia (12 upper midline, 15 lower&#xD;
      midline, and 10 transverse abdominal), 8 had an epigastric hernia, 8 had an periumbilical&#xD;
      hernia, . All defects were estimated to be larger than 5 cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard bowel preparation was undertaken for every patient on the day before the operation.&#xD;
      Prophylactic short-term antibiotic therapy with a one gram of third-generation cephalosporin&#xD;
      was also administered routinely two hours before the operation. Nasogastric suction and&#xD;
      bladder catheterization were used routinely during the operation only. All operations were&#xD;
      performed under general anesthesia; Open mesh repair was done as described else where (9,&#xD;
      10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative Procedure of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair:&#xD;
&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum was established by using a Verses needle. The initial entry site was usually&#xD;
      just inferior to the tip of the eleventh rib to establish a 15 mmHg pneumoperitoneum for&#xD;
      exploration of the abdomen. One 10-mm trocar and three to five 5-mm trocars were then placed&#xD;
      outside the perimeter of the hernia. Adhesiolysis was performed to free the anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall and identify the hernia defect. The peritoneal sac was not reduced and the&#xD;
      mesh was placed in an intraabdominal position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mesh was prepared to extend 3 to 5 cm beyond the hernia defect. Four anchoring sutures&#xD;
      were placed in the corners of the mesh, which was then introduced into the abdomen via a&#xD;
      10-mm port. The sutures were secured across the full thickness of the abdominal wall with the&#xD;
      use of a laparoscopic suture passer. A laparoscopic mesh stapler device was used to place&#xD;
      5-mm spiral staples at 1-cm intervals around the mesh edge. . No drains were placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management intravenous analgesia was administered postoperatively. All patients&#xD;
      were encouraged to move as soon as possible. Postoperatively, the severity of pain was&#xD;
      assessed daily by a visual analogue scale (VAS) on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst&#xD;
      pain). Upon discharge, all patients were taught to complete a pain score chart at home for&#xD;
      daily documentation of pain score at rest and on coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up at the surgical Clinic was scheduled at 1 week, 8 weeks and 1 and 2 years after&#xD;
      operation for assessment of postoperative complications: seromas (collection of fluid&#xD;
      persisting &gt; 4 weeks or causing local discomfort), hematomas, infection, abdominal wall pain,&#xD;
      bowel obstruction, recurrences, aesthetic evaluation. The pain score charts were collected by&#xD;
      the surgeon at the surgical clinic. All complications were recorded and clinical recurrence&#xD;
      was documented during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the outcome evaluation was measured by the duration of return to activity, pain free&#xD;
      return to activity, return to work and pain free return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Variables measured on a nominal scale were analyzed in the form of 2 x K&#xD;
      tables and Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Variables measured on an ordinal scale were&#xD;
      analyzed by kruskal Wallis test. All tests were two tailed and made at a level of&#xD;
      significance of &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
