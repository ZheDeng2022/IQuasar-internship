  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I study designed to explore the feasibility, safety and biologic&#xD;
      activity of epigenetic priming with decitabine prior to standard cytarabine, daunorubicin&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy in younger patients with less-than-favorable risk AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To find an appropriate dose level for decitabine when used as priming for&#xD;
      cytarabine and daunorubicin &quot;7+3&quot; induction chemotherapy in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the safety and expected toxicities of decitabine when used as priming for&#xD;
           cytarabine and daunorubicin &quot;7+3&quot; induction chemotherapy in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the optimal dose schedule of decitabine required to broadly demethylate&#xD;
           cytosine residues in genomic regulatory regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate, in selected cases, the molecular and cellular consequences of&#xD;
           decitabine-induced hypomethylation by a) establishing the extent and degree of&#xD;
           hypomethylation at specific genomic loci required to reactivate the expression of&#xD;
           repressed genes and by b) determining the effect of hypomethylation on the&#xD;
           differentiation and/or apoptosis of leukemic blasts.&#xD;

    <description>Decitabine will be administered by intravenous injection at a dose of 20 mg/m2/day as a daily 1hr infusion (Arm A) or by continuous infusion (Arm B) for 3, 5 or 7 days. On the day following the final dose of decitabine, standard &quot;7+3&quot; induction chemotherapy will begin.</description>
