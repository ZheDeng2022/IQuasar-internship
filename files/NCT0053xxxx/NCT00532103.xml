      This study will develop a new methodology to evaluate any treatment-emergent suicidal&#xD;
      ideation that might occur when an antidepressant treatment has been started and/or during&#xD;
      times when doses are increased in patients with major depressive disorder.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study to begin to develop a measurement procedure to help guide the clinical&#xD;
      management of suicide risk in people beginning a type of antidepressant medication called a&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The goals of the study are: 1) to identify the&#xD;
      best method and assessment measures to evaluate the severity of suicidal ideation, 2) to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate frequency and duration of assessment required to adequately&#xD;
      evaluate this suicidal ideation, 3) to evaluate the presence of symptoms that are associated&#xD;
      with suicidal ideation (such as anxiety, panic attacks, difficulty in sleeping) and 4) to&#xD;
      identify the most critical time periods during which suicidal ideation appears or worsens&#xD;
      (such as how long after initiation of treatment or dosage increase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all, 300 adult participants with major depressive disorder (MDD), between the ages of 18&#xD;
      and 75, may be enrolled at primary and psychiatric care sites across the US. All patients&#xD;
      will be treated with an SSRI for eight weeks. The choice of SSRI used in treatment will be&#xD;
      chosen by the study physician at each site. For this study, physicians will choose from the&#xD;
      following six SSRIs: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, paroxetine-CR, and&#xD;
      fluoxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients beginning an SSRI for MDD in &quot;real world&quot; psychiatric and primary care settings,&#xD;
      will have clinic visits and receive evaluations of their symptoms of depression, side&#xD;
      effects, suicidal thinking and symptoms that are thought to be associated with suicidal risk,&#xD;
      every other week for eight weeks. They will be evaluated by phone for symptoms and side&#xD;
      effects each week they do not come to the clinic. They will also receive phone calls three&#xD;
      times a week for the first two weeks of the study, after beginning the antidepressant, and&#xD;
      after a dose increase to evaluate suicide risk.&#xD;
