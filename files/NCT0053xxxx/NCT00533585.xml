    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find the highest tolerable dose of BAY 43-9006 (sorafenib) and&#xD;
      bevacizumab that can be given with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). The safety and effectiveness of this drug combination will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is designed to stop the growth of cells that are caused by genetic changes often&#xD;
      associated with cancer. Paclitaxel is designed to work by blocking the mechanisms of cell&#xD;
      division in cancer cells, which may cause them to die. Carboplatin is designed to work by&#xD;
      interfering with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell division. Bevacizumab is&#xD;
      designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the effects of a&#xD;
      blood-vessel stimulating agent that plays an important role in the growth of both normal and&#xD;
      abnormal blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 4 different&#xD;
      drugs during the study. This study will follow a 3-week schedule known as a study &quot;cycle.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study, researchers are trying to find out the highest dose of the&#xD;
      study drugs that can be safely given together. The first group of 6 participants will receive&#xD;
      lower doses of sorafenib and bevacizumab. The doses of paclitaxel and carboplatin will stay&#xD;
      the same for up to 6 cycles for the study for all participants who complete 6 cycles. If the&#xD;
      first 6 participants do not have intolerable side effects, the next group of patients will&#xD;
      get higher doses of bevacizumab. The doses of sorafenib will be increased until at least some&#xD;
      participants have unacceptable side effects. The dose that you get will not increase during&#xD;
      the study, but if you have bad side effects, your dose of sorafenib, bevacizumab, paclitaxel,&#xD;
      or carboplatin may be lowered at future visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will be given bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in your&#xD;
      vein as an infusion. Paclitaxel will be infused over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin over 30&#xD;
      minutes, followed by bevacizumab over 90 minutes for the first 2 cycles. Your bevacizumab&#xD;
      infusion may be given over a shorter time period in later cycles. You will stay in the clinic&#xD;
      for at least 30 minutes after your bevacizumab infusion for all cycles after 1 and 2. You&#xD;
      will take sorafenib by mouth twice a day, once in the morning before 11:00 am and once in the&#xD;
      evening before 11:00 p.m. Sorafenib should be taken with about 1 cup of water on an empty&#xD;
      stomach (either 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal) or with a moderate fat diet&#xD;
      (about 30% of calories from fat). Sorafenib must be swallowed whole without chewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2, your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will have&#xD;
      a physical exam including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will be asked&#xD;
      questions to find out how the disease is progressing and how the disease affects the quality&#xD;
      of life. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. If possible, you&#xD;
      should not change your medications between Cycle 1 Day 1 until all procedures are completed&#xD;
      on Cycle 2 Day 3. Blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
      You will receive infusions of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Cycle 1 Day 2, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Cycle 1 Day 3, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests. After your&#xD;
      blood samples have been collected, you will be given your morning dose of sorafenib. You will&#xD;
      be given sorafenib to take at home that night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Cycle 2 Day 2, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Once your blood&#xD;
      samples has been collected, your morning dose of sorafenib will be given to you in the&#xD;
      clinic. You will be given sorafenib to take at home that night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Cycle 2 Day 3, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Once your blood&#xD;
      sample has been collected, your morning dose of sorafenib will be given to you in the clinic.&#xD;
      Before you leave the clinic, you will be given enough sorafenib tablets to last until your&#xD;
      next cycle visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Cycles 1-2 Days 8 and 15, your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will&#xD;
      have a physical exam including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will have a&#xD;
      performance status evaluation. You will be asked about any side effects you may be&#xD;
      experiencing. Blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and remaining cycles, you will return all study medication and/or the&#xD;
      empty bottle. Your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical&#xD;
      exam including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will be asked questions to&#xD;
      determine how the disease is progressing, and how the disease affects your quality of life.&#xD;
      You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. Blood (about 5 teaspoons)&#xD;
      and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will receive infusions of paclitaxel,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and bevacizumab. You will stay in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after your&#xD;
      bevacizumab infusion. Before you leave the clinic, you will be given enough sorafenib to last&#xD;
      until the next cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 3 and remaining cycles, blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be&#xD;
      collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of all odd-numbered cycles (starting with Cycle 3, 5, 7, 9...), you will have CT&#xD;
      scans, MRI scans, and/or other x-rays to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Dose Levels 4 and 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if interrupted dosing of sorafenib will result in fewer or less severe side&#xD;
      effects, 2 additional dose levels, where the dose of sorafenib will be changed (modified),&#xD;
      will be performed. For Modified Dose Level 4, sorafenib will be interrupted for 2 days after&#xD;
      every 4-5 days . For Modified Dose Level 5, sorafenib will be interrupted for 1 week after 2&#xD;
      weeks of continuous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these 2 additional dose levels, the sorafenib dosing schedule will be changed. There will&#xD;
      be 6 patients enrolled at each dose level. Participants in Dose Level 4 may continue&#xD;
      treatment for 4 to 6 cycles. This is done to accurately evaluate the dose level. Researchers&#xD;
      will evaluate any side effects related to this new dosing schedule of sorafenib. After all 6&#xD;
      patients have been enrolled in Dose level 4, then 6 additional patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Dose Level 5. If no intolerable side effects are seen at Dose Level 5, then 6 additional&#xD;
      patients can be enrolled in that dose level. This is done so additional PK testing can be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Modified Dose Level 4 and 5, &quot;on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2, you will be given bevacizumab,&#xD;
      paclitaxel, and carboplatin in your vein as an infusion. Paclitaxel will be infused over 3&#xD;
      hours, followed by carboplatin over 30 minutes, followed by bevacizumab over 90 minutes for&#xD;
      the first 2 cycles. Your bevacizumab infusion may be given over a shorter time period in&#xD;
      later cycles. You will stay in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after your bevacizumab&#xD;
      infusion for all cycles after 1 and 2. &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Dose level 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Modified Dose level 4, on Day 3 through Day 19 of Cycle 1, you will receive sorafenib by&#xD;
      mouth in the morning, after the morning PK tests have been collected (on Day 3 only).&#xD;
      Participants will take the evening dose of sorafenib on their own. After that, participants&#xD;
      will take sorafenib on their own twice a day for 5 days on and 2 days off. This will continue&#xD;
      through Day 19 on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 through Day 19 of Cycle 2, you will receive sorafenib by mouth in the morning, after&#xD;
      the morning PK tests have been collected on Day 2 (Cycle 2 only). Participants will take the&#xD;
      evening dose of sorafenib on their own. After that, participants will take sorafenib on their&#xD;
      own twice a day for 5 days on and 2 days off. This will continue through Day 19 on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis. The modified dose level 4 and 5 patients will not take sorafenib on Days 1,&#xD;
      2, 6, 7, 13, 14, 20 and 21 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Dose level 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Modified Dose Level 5, on Day 3 through Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will receive sorafenib by&#xD;
      mouth in the morning, after the morning PK tests have been collected (on Day 3 only).&#xD;
      Participants will take the evening dose of sorafenib on their own. After that, participants&#xD;
      will take sorafenib on their own twice a day for 14 days through Day 15 on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis. Participants will not take sorafenib on Days 1, 2 and Days 16-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 through Day 15 of Cycle 2, you will receive sorafenib by mouth in the morning, after&#xD;
      the morning PK tests have been collected (on Day 2 Cycle 2 only). Participants will take the&#xD;
      evening dose of sorafenib on their own. After that, participants will take sorafenib on their&#xD;
      own twice a day for 14 days through Day 15 on an outpatient basis.Participants will not take&#xD;
      sorafenib on Days 1, 2 and Days 16-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may stay on study as long as the disease does not get worse, and intolerable side effects&#xD;
      do not develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit 21-35 days after your last dose&#xD;
      of the study drug. You will need to return all unused study medication and/or the empty&#xD;
      bottles. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height,&#xD;
      and weight. You will have a performance status evaluation and an ECG. You will be asked about&#xD;
      any side effects you may be experiencing. CT scans, MRIs, and/or x-rays will be taken to&#xD;
      check the status of the disease. Blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for&#xD;
      routine blood tests. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about&#xD;
      1-2 teaspoons ) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sorafenib, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab are all&#xD;
      FDA approved and commercially available. The combination of these 4 drugs is not FDA&#xD;
      approved, and it has been authorized for use in research only. Up to 60 patients will take&#xD;
      part in this multicenter study. Up to 30 patients will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.&#xD;
