    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how the immune system responds to influenza infection and compare&#xD;
      how the infection differs in patients with a weakened immune system versus those with a&#xD;
      healthy immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the NIH Clinical Center who are older than 2 years of age and who are diagnosed&#xD;
      with influenza A or B may be eligible for this study. Patients with healthy immune systems&#xD;
      and weakened immune systems are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants answer questions about how they are feeling and have a physical examination to&#xD;
      evaluate their symptoms. Blood and nasal fluid are collected on the first day and then every&#xD;
      other day for a total of 8 days. Nasal fluid is collected by either inserting a small tube in&#xD;
      the nose and washing the nose with salt water and collecting the fluid obtained, or by&#xD;
      rubbing the inside of the nose with a swab. Physical examinations are repeated on the days&#xD;
      that blood and nasal fluid are collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity each year, and past epidemics and pandemics&#xD;
      have caused significant mortality. The impact influenza has or could have on the increasing&#xD;
      number of patients who are immunocompromised due to acute and chronic diseases as well as&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies is largely unknown. Limited information is available about the&#xD;
      innate immune response to influenza and how chronic illness and immunosuppression may affect&#xD;
      the immune response to the virus in comparison to that seen in normal hosts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised (control group) patients&#xD;
      from the local community, and the NIH Clinical Center. Patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      influenza will be evaluated by recording their symptoms, collecting their blood and nasal&#xD;
      specimens, and isolating their viruses. Each patient s infection will be mapped by performing&#xD;
      genomic analysis of the viral isolates collected during the patient s infection (which will&#xD;
      include analysis of sequences known to confer resistance to antiviral medication), measuring&#xD;
      cytokine levels in blood and nasal mucosal samples, and measuring influenza-specific antibody&#xD;
      responses. Correlation of these results with clinical symptoms and clinical outcomes will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Elucidation of these responses and the genomic changes the virus may undergo&#xD;
      during infection and treatment for influenza in both normal and immunocompromised patients&#xD;
      may help to better understand the impact influenza has on the overall health of patients, as&#xD;
      well as what strategies may be performed to better protect or treat patients during the&#xD;
      emergence of a new pandemic.&#xD;
