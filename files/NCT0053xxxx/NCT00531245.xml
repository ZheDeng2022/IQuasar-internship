  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine and oxaliplatin(XELOX) is active first-line therapy for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Phase II study of TS-1, a novel oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, showed&#xD;
      activity in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Preclinical data of TS-1 with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin showed synergistic activity in vivo human colorectal cancer xenograft. There is&#xD;
      no data about the optimal dose of TS-1 with 2 weeks schedule combined with oxaliplatin.&#xD;
      Therefore in a phase I study, we would like to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of&#xD;
      TS-1 and oxaliplatin and define the recommended dose for subsequent phase II study. And then,&#xD;
      in a phase II study we would like to evaluate the efficacy(response rates) and toxicities of&#xD;
      the new combination regimen in advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrolment into the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Histologically documented colorectal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous chemotherapy up to two regimens(including adjuvant chemotherapy and first-line&#xD;
           chemotherapy without oxaliplatin) is allowed in phase I portion; patients are required&#xD;
           to have discontinued chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for at least 4weeks before entry&#xD;
           into phase I portion. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy allowed(adjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy would be allowed) in phase II portion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age 18 to 75 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At least one unidimensional measurable lesion with a diameter &gt;20 mm using conventional&#xD;
           CT or MRI scans or &gt;10 mm using spiral CT scans (use of spiral CT must be documented in&#xD;
           medical records and used consistently throughout study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In phase I study, prior radiotherapy is permitted if it was not administered to target&#xD;
           lesions selected for this study, unless progression of the selected target lesions&#xD;
           within the radiation portal is documented, and provided it has been completed at least 4&#xD;
           weeks before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Performance status (ECOG scale): 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients can take food and drugs orally&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Adequate organ functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Life expectancy â‰¥ 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Written informed consent&#xD;
