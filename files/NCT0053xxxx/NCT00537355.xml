      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter&#xD;
      study. After passing the initial Screening Visit, subjects will be in the environmental&#xD;
      exposure chamber(EEC), a room with a controlled amount of ragweed pollen, for 4 hours each&#xD;
      day on 4 consecutive days. At the last visit, subjects who have achieved a minimum Total&#xD;
      Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) will be randomized to receive either TOLAMBA or placebo&#xD;
      treatments. Subjects will receive 6 weekly subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of the&#xD;
      study drug. About three weeks after the last injection, subjects will be asked to be in the&#xD;
      EEC for 2 consecutive days (Visits 11 and 12, Days 60 and 61). Approximately 3 weeks after&#xD;
      Visit 12 (Day 61), the subjects will again be in the EEC for 4 consecutive days (Visits&#xD;
      13-16, Days 82-85).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all EEC visits, the subjects will be exposed to ragweed pollen at an average&#xD;
      concentration of 3500 ± 500 pollen grains per cubic meter. Each EEC visit will last 4 hours.&#xD;
      During each EEC visit, patients will be asked to record symptom scores for nasal and&#xD;
      non-nasal symptoms at scheduled time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of a subject's participation in this study is expected to be a minimum of&#xD;
      85 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ragweed allergy is the most common seasonal allergy in North America. Allergen immunotherapy&#xD;
      is a therapeutic option for patients who have allergy symptoms that cannot be adequately&#xD;
      controlled by avoidance of the allergen or medication. It may also be appropriate for those&#xD;
      who cannot tolerate their medications due to side effects or have difficulties with&#xD;
      medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter&#xD;
      study. After passing the initial Screening Visit, subjects will be in the environmental&#xD;
      exposure chamber(EEC), a room with a controlled amount of ragweed pollen, for 4 hours each&#xD;
      day on 4 consecutive days. At the last visit, subjects who have achieved a minimum Total&#xD;
      Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) will be randomized to receive either TOLAMBA or placebo&#xD;
      treatments. Subjects will receive 6 weekly subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of the&#xD;
      study drug. About three weeks after the last injection, subjects will be asked to be in the&#xD;
      EEC for 2 consecutive days (Visits 11 and 12, Days 60 and 61). Approximately 3 weeks after&#xD;
      Visit 12 (Day 61), the subjects will again be in the EEC for 4 consecutive days (Visits&#xD;
      13-16, Days 82-85).&#xD;

      non-nasal symptoms at scheduled time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of a subject's participation in this study is expected to be a minimum of&#xD;
      85 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Allergy symptoms of subjects treated with TOLAMBA™ compared with subjects treated&#xD;
      with placebo.&#xD;
