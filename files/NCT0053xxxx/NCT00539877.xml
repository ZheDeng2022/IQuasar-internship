  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stomach cancer is the most common cancer, and is still leading cause of death in Korea.&#xD;
      Peritoneal seeding is the most common metastases of gastric cancer, and is the most frequent&#xD;
      cause of death from this disease. In addition, there is no standard treatment for peritoneal&#xD;
      dissemination. Even though systemic intravenous chemotherapy is the standard treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic stomach cancer at present, it does not improve the survival of patients with&#xD;
      peritoneal dissemination. Because intraperitoneal(IP) administration results in high&#xD;
      concentration locally with low systemic toxicity, clinical investigators have confirmed the&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetic advantage associated with IP delivery of a number of&#xD;
      antineoplastic agents with known activity in cancer. In ovarian cancer, a large randomized&#xD;
      trial demonstrated a small but statistically and clinically significant survival advantage&#xD;
      for women receiving a portion of their therapy intraperitoneally. Drugs such as&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, mitomycin-C, paclitaxel and docetaxel are used for IP chemotherapy&#xD;
      in patients with gastric cancer. Even the small number of phase III trials reported, some&#xD;
      studies showed improvement in survival for patients randomized to IP therapy compared to&#xD;
      those receiving no postoperative treatment.&#xD;
      Irinotecan(7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-pipperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxy camptothecin; CPT-11),&#xD;
      clinically effective in the treatment of colorectal, lung and gastric cancer, is a carbamate&#xD;
      prodrug metabolized to its active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38). In&#xD;
      mouse model, IP administration of CPT-11 was significantly more effective than intravenous&#xD;
      administration for control of both peritoneal seeding and liver metastasis. However,&#xD;
      phamacokinetics of CPT-11 with peritoneal administration in human beings is not well studied.&#xD;
      Although Japanese investigators reported pharmacokinetic data of CPT-11 with few patients,&#xD;
      there is no data about maximum tolerated dose of CPT-11 intraperitoneally.&#xD;

      Objectives : The objectives of this study are to assess the feasibility, to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose, and to assess the toxicities of intraperitoneally administered CPT-11&#xD;
      in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal seeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : This is open-labeled, non-randomized phase I study in the patients eligible for the&#xD;
      following criteria. Patients more than 18 years old with gastric adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      histologically proven, will be enrolled at the time of surgery, and the signed informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained prior to surgery. Preoperative studies should have resectable&#xD;
      advanced disease. The operative finding and biopsy of suspected peritoneum must show&#xD;
      peritoneal involvement of adenocarcinoma. The subjects should not have any previous&#xD;
      chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy and any major biological abnormalities. Prior to&#xD;
      the initiation of study, patient will receive palliative gastrectomy(total or subtotal) and&#xD;
      has a CAPD catheter. Postoperative day 1, IP chemotherapy will be given by CAPD catheter. For&#xD;
      dose level 1, CPT-11(provided by CJ Pharmaceutical Company) 50mg/m2 in 1L of normal saline,&#xD;
      prewarmed to 37°C will be given intraperitoneally. Plasma samples will be collected prior IP&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and samples of plasma, peritoneal fluid and urine will be obtained at 0.5, 1.5,&#xD;
      2, 3.5, 8, 12, and 25.5, 49, 56 hours following chemotherapy. Three patients will be accrued&#xD;
      to each dose level. If none of these three patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT), the dose will be increased in a subsequent group of three patients to 100 mg/m2.If one&#xD;
      of the first three patients experienced DLT, three more patients will be accrued to that dose&#xD;
      level. If none of these additional three patients experienced DLT, then the dose will be&#xD;
      escalated. If one of the additional three patients experienced DLT, then either an additional&#xD;
      cohort of patients could be added or escalation terminated. If two or more of the second&#xD;
      group of three patients experienced DLT, then accrual is stopped. If two of the first three&#xD;
      patients experienced DLT, then an additional three patients could be accrued at that dose&#xD;
      level, but dose escalation could take place only if none of the additional cohort experienced&#xD;
      DLT. The last planned dose escalation is to 300 mg/m2. Cohorts of at least 3 patients will be&#xD;
      entered at each dose level and monitored for at least 4 weeks after treatment before dose&#xD;
      escalation. Intrapatient dose escalation is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level Dose of IP CPT-11(mg/m2)&#xD;

        2. 100&#xD;

        4. 200&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 300&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, DLT is defined as follows: any grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity or as noted&#xD;
      below; ≥ grade 3 diarrhea or stomatitis lasting ≥ 7 days despite optimal supportive care;&#xD;
      hematologic dose-limiting toxicity is defined grade 4 neutropenia complicated by fever ≥&#xD;
      38°C; grade 4 hemorrhage or thrombocytopenia; failure to recover neutrophils (≥ 1500/ mm3) or&#xD;
      platelets (≥ 100 000/ mm3) by day 28. The maximal tolerated dose is defined as that dose&#xD;
      level that produced dose-limiting toxicity in ≥ 50% of patients. The recommended dose is one&#xD;
      level below that. During the study, the evaluation of toxicities will be done daily of&#xD;
      postoperative 6 days then weekly using National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria&#xD;
      (NCI-CTC). Physical examination, complete blood count, and blood chemistry, and serum&#xD;
      electrolytes will be measured. Pharmacokinetic study : Plasma, peritoneal fluid and urine&#xD;
      samples will be assayed for irinotecan and its metabolites: SN-38,&#xD;
      7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyl camptothecin (APC), and SN-38&#xD;
      glucuronide(SN-38G).&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative day 1, IP CPT-11 chemotherapy will be given by CAPD catheter. CPT-11 in 1L of normal saline, prewarmed to 37°C will be given intraperitoneally.&#xD;
If there is no DLT and patients agree with the treatment, patients can receive 3 more times of IP chemotherapy with same dose of CPT-11 at 3 weeks interval. After total 4 cycles of IP chemotherapy, peritoneal disease will be reassessed with abdominal-pelvis CT. Pharmacokinetic study is not planned with this treatment.</description>
