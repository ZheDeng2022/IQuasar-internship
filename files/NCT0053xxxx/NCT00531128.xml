    <textblock>
      This study will determine if dietary supplements of sitosterol (a plant cholesterol commonly&#xD;
      found in vegetables) can modify blood sugar and cholesterol levels and reduce the stiffness&#xD;
      of the blood vessels in people with an abnormal copy of a gene that causes sitosterolemia.&#xD;
      People who carry only one copy of the abnormal gene are healthy but have increased blood&#xD;
      levels of sitosterol. People with two abnormal copies of the gene have increased levels of&#xD;
      sitosterol and have an increased risk of heart attack. This condition is called&#xD;
      sitosterolemia. Although extremely rare in the general population, up to 4% of the Amish&#xD;
      carry an abnormal copy of this gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of Amish background who are 18 years of age or older and in whom one person carries&#xD;
      one copy of the abnormal gene that causes sitosterolemia and the other does not have an&#xD;
      abnormal gene may be eligible for this study. Subjects must be of the same sex and within 5&#xD;
      years of age of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During two periods of one month each participants receive pills containing sitosterol and&#xD;
      then a special diet and meal supplements to change the levels of sitosterol in the diet.&#xD;
      During only one of the two study periods, subjects receive sitosterol supplements in the&#xD;
      pills for one month and then for 10 days in the diet. At the end of each study period,&#xD;
      subjects come to the NIH Clinical Center for one day for the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adipose (fat) tissue biopsy. A small piece of fat from under the skin of the abdomen is&#xD;
           removed to examine how sitosterol affects fat tissue and its ability to process sugar&#xD;
           and fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indirect calorimetry. A plastic transparent hood is placed over the subject s head to&#xD;
           collect the air that is breathed for about one-half hour to study how the body uses&#xD;
           sugar to generate energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial vascular function. An ultrasound picture of a blood vessel in the forearm is&#xD;
           taken and a blood pressure cuff is inflated around the arm to measure the vessel s&#xD;
           ability to stretch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous glucose tolerance test: A small plastic tube is placed in a vein in each&#xD;
           arm. Then over one minute the subject receives glucose through one of the tubes. Twenty&#xD;
           minutes later the subject is given a small amount of insulin through the same tube.&#xD;
           Blood samples are drawn through the tube in the other arm at frequent intervals for 3&#xD;
           hours. This test measures how sitosterol affects how the body processes sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan. The subject lies on an x-ray table for 20 minutes during the scan, which&#xD;
           measures total body fat.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The relative distribution of the various amounts of lipids in the membranes of the adipocytes&#xD;
      plays an important role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Sitosterolemia, a rare&#xD;
      genetic disease is caused by a defective ABC transporter in the gut and biliary tract, which&#xD;
      results in increased absorption and decreased excretion of plant sterols, ultimately leading&#xD;
      to accelerated atherosclerosis and premature death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very recently, a mutation of the ABCG8 gene, very rare in the general population, has been&#xD;
      described in 4% of the Old Order Amish, a well-characterized founder population in Lancaster&#xD;
      County, Pennsylvania. Preliminary data indicate that otherwise healthy carriers&#xD;
      (heterozygotes) of the mutation showed, as compared to controls, reduced body mass index,&#xD;
      more large buoyant LDL cholesterol, decreased carotid intima media thickness (IMT), and a&#xD;
      trend toward lower insulin and glucose levels, consistent with an improved metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      profile. These data suggest that a mild excess in plant sterols could play a role in the&#xD;
      modulation of the energy metabolism, and that dietary sitosterol may improve lipid profile&#xD;
      and other aspects of the metabolic syndrome in genetically normal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to characterize mechanistically the effects of sitosterol, the most abundant plant&#xD;
      sterol in the diet, on the development of the metabolic syndrome, we propose to study in&#xD;
      greater detail the carriers of the ABCG8 gene mutation; that will provide the opportunity to&#xD;
      analyze new insights into dietary sitosterol and its role in lipid and energy metabolism. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that sitosterol in the diet will affect metabolic syndrome indices differentially&#xD;
      in carriers of the mutation as compared to non-carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a nutrigenomics intervention on 15 ABCG8 mutation carriers and sex-matched&#xD;
      unaffected persons (age +/- 5 years). They will be treated with high-, low- sitosterol&#xD;
      iso-caloric diets. Study subjects will be then evaluated in the NIH Clinical Center for&#xD;
      changes in the following parameters: circulating lipids and free fatty acids, glucose&#xD;
      disposal, resting energy expenditure and RQ, and endothelial vascular function. The Division&#xD;
      of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition at the University Of Maryland School of Medicine&#xD;
      will carry out the genotyping, study volunteer recruitment, cell membrane lipid content&#xD;
      analysis, and ex-vivo adipocyte analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that carriers of the ABCG8 gene mutation will further improve metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome indices when challenged with a high-sitosterol diet, and will regress toward the&#xD;
      non-carrier controls when treated with a low-sitosterol diet. Non-carrier controls will&#xD;
      remain unchanged or show modest improvement in metabolic syndrome indices when challenged&#xD;
      with a high-sitosterol diet, which will worsen, compared to baseline and carrier sibs, when&#xD;
      treated with a low-sitosterol diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical data, combined with the in vitro analysis of the effects of sitosterol on cell&#xD;
      membranes and adipocyte metabolism will advance knowledge in the field of lipid metabolism on&#xD;
      the relation of lipid composition to common disorders such as the metabolic syndrome. Data&#xD;
      obtained from this project could then potentially be translated into nutritional and&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions in the general population.&#xD;
