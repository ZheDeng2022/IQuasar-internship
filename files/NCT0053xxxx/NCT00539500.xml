      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how long it takes for certain types of&#xD;
      transplanted stem cells to produce new blood cells. The safety of this treatment will also be&#xD;
      studied. Finally, researchers want to learn if collecting the cells with the CliniMACS device&#xD;
      can decrease the possibility of tumor cells contaminating (appearing in) the stem cells that&#xD;
      are reinfused into participants.&#xD;

      Researchers want to learn if a CD133+ selected autologous stem cell transplant can help to&#xD;
      control the disease in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. After your cells are collected,&#xD;
      they will be treated in the cell processing lab using the CliniMACS device. This device will&#xD;
      separate out the CD133+ cells. These selected cells will then be given back to you on the day&#xD;
      of transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a small plastic&#xD;
      tube placed in the collar bone area or the femoral vein (groin area). This is called a&#xD;
      central venous catheter (CVC). You will sign a separate consent form for the CVC placement&#xD;
      and the general anesthesia that is given. There may be several weeks between the collection&#xD;
      of stem cells and the reinfusion of these cells after high-dose chemotherapy. If the CVC is&#xD;
      placed in the femoral vein, the CVC will be removed after the stem cells are collected and a&#xD;
      new CVC will be placed in the collar bone before you are admitted for the stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. The CVC will be used for chemotherapy, fluids, blood products, stem cells, and&#xD;
      other medications. The CVC will remain until it is no longer needed (usually 2-3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help move the needed stem cells from your bone marrow to your blood, a drug called&#xD;
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor G-CSF (filgrastim) will be injected under the skin.&#xD;
      These injections may be given once a day for Days 2-7. You or your caregiver will be taught&#xD;
      how to give the injections at home. After 2 days of filgrastim injections, a blood sample&#xD;
      (about 4 teaspoons each time) will be drawn each day until you begin leukapheresis. This&#xD;
      blood test is used to check the number of stem cells and to watch for possible side effects.&#xD;
      You will then be instructed to either continue with the daily injections or stop. When the&#xD;
      number of stem cells in the blood is high enough, you will go to the MD Anderson Apheresis&#xD;
      Unit to have your stem cells collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure to collect your stem cells is called leukapheresis. It is similar to donating&#xD;
      platelets to a blood bank. For this procedure, the stem cells will be removed from the blood&#xD;
      through the CVC, and the remaining blood will be given back to you through the CVC. You will&#xD;
      have one leukapheresis procedure per day, for 1-5 days in a row, until enough stem cells are&#xD;
      collected for the transplant. &quot;Back-up&quot; cells (extra cells collected during the leukapheresis&#xD;
      procedure) will also be collected. These cells will be stored in the cell processing lab and&#xD;
      may given back to you later if your white cell count does not recover. Each leukapheresis&#xD;
      procedure takes about 4-6 hours. This research study will use the CliniMACS device to process&#xD;
      the blood and separate the cells needed for transplantation. Researchers will test a small&#xD;
      sample of the collected cells to see if any tumor cells that might be present in the blood&#xD;
      before using the CliniMACS device are no longer present in the processed blood after using&#xD;
      the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin and etoposide are designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      stopping cell division, and melphalan is designed to damage the DNA (the genetic material) of&#xD;
      cells. The combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan causes a large amount of bone&#xD;
      marrow cells to die, which stops blood cells from being produced as normal. In order to try&#xD;
      to restart the production of blood cells, an autologous stem cell transplant is often&#xD;
      performed. For an autologous transplant, stem cells are removed from the blood. Usually when&#xD;
      stem cells are collected, they are either given back to the patient as collected, or else a&#xD;
      smaller group of cells that have a certain &quot;marker&quot; on their cell surface is selected&#xD;
      (separated out) before being given back to the patient. The CliniMACS device is a machine&#xD;
      that processes blood and separates the cells needed for transplantation. The CliniMACS device&#xD;
      is designed to select stem cells with a different marker on the cell surface than is normally&#xD;
      selected. The marker is called CD133+, and researchers believe that transplanting cells that&#xD;
      have this marker will make the infused cells less likely to be contaminated with&#xD;
      neuroblastoma cells, compared to the standard method of cell selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 days of leukapheresis procedures, if the number of stem cells collected is lower than&#xD;
      a certain level, you will no longer be eligible to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests&#xD;
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. If these tests&#xD;
      have been performed recently, they may not need to be repeated. To check the status of the&#xD;
      disease, you will have CT scans, bone marrow aspirations and biopsies, and a chest x-ray. The&#xD;
      CT scans will be performed on the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (and if needed, the brain). To&#xD;
      collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and&#xD;
      a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. You will have a&#xD;
      pulmonary function test (to measure lung function), an echocardiogram (to measure heart&#xD;
      function), and an electrocardiogram (EKG -- a test to measure the electrical activity of the&#xD;
      heart). You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (such as blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate), height, and weight. Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for&#xD;
      routine tests and to check for diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Females who are able to&#xD;
      have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test. You will also have a 12 or 24-hour&#xD;
      urine test before carboplatin can be given. For this test, you will collect your urine over&#xD;
      12 or 24 hours. You will be provided with a container to collect the urine in. This test will&#xD;
      be used to help decide the dosing of carboplatin that you receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enough stem cells are collected, and at a time decided upon by your neuro-oncologist&#xD;
      and transplantation doctors, you will be admitted to the hospital to receive fluids and then&#xD;
      the chemotherapy drugs carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan, according to the standard&#xD;
      schedule. After the chemotherapy, you will have 3 &quot;rest&quot; days where no chemotherapy is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day after the third rest day, your stem cells will be infused back into your CVC. To&#xD;
      help speed up the recovery of your white blood cells, a drug called filgrastim will be&#xD;
      injected under the skin. You will receive a filgrastim injection under the skin once a day,&#xD;
      until the white blood cell count recovers (usually 2-3 weeks). You may also receive standard&#xD;
      antibiotics, fluids, and/or other medications, if your doctor feels it is necessary based on&#xD;
      symptoms you may have. While you are in the hospital, you will have physical exams once a&#xD;
      day. Blood (about 4 teaspoons each time) will be drawn about 3-7 days per week, until your&#xD;
      blood counts are fully recovered and any side effects of the chemotherapy have resolved. At&#xD;
      that time, you will be able to leave the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the time you leave the hospital until about Day 60, you will have follow-up visits at&#xD;
      least once per week. At these visits, you will have a physical exam. Blood (about 4 teaspoons&#xD;
      each time) will be drawn for routine tests. However, your participation in this study will&#xD;
      not be over until after your annual follow-up at which time you will have a medical history&#xD;
      and physical exam, blood (about 4 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests, and a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur at any time in this study, you&#xD;
      will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study are commercially&#xD;
      available and FDA approved for use in neuroblastoma. The CliniMACS device is not commercially&#xD;
      available or FDA approved. It has been authorized for use in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at The University of&#xD;
      Texas (UT) MD Anderson.&#xD;
