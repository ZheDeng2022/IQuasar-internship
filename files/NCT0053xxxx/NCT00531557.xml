  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to study the effects of switching from an antiretroviral&#xD;
      combination that includes two ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors to replacement of these&#xD;
      two protease inhibitors with a new protease inhibitor called Darunavir (also boosted with&#xD;
      ritonavir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the effect of the switch on viral load (the levels of the HIV&#xD;
      virus in the blood), on immunological parameters (CD4 count) and on other safety parameters&#xD;
      and also on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subgroup of patients the impact of the switch on the body's response to the hormone&#xD;
      insulin will also be measured (Euglycaemic clamp sub group)&#xD;

      HIV-RNA and CD4+ cell count to monitor virological and immunological response on switching to&#xD;
      DRV/r.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine safety bloods to include haematology and biochemistry (including U&amp;E, fasted glucose&#xD;
      and insulin, liver function test, fasting cholesterol and triglycerides and serum lactate&#xD;
      measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life EuroQOL questionnaires at baseline, and throughout the study to evaluate&#xD;
      quality of life in the continued treatment/ treatment switch arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub group of 10 patients will undergo two euglycaemic clamp procedures in order to&#xD;
      determine the extent of glucose disposal. The first clamp will be performed prior to the&#xD;
      switching from a double boosted PI therapy to DRV/r and the second one following&#xD;
      administration of DRV/r for 4 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV-1 infected as documented by a licensed HIV-1 antibody ELISA test&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently on an antiretroviral regimen including a ritonavir boosted double protease&#xD;
             inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject is virologically suppressed with a viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL for three&#xD;
             months or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a CD4+ count above 100 cells/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ≤ Three DRV associated mutations on previous genotypic resistance test -or if no&#xD;
             resistance test available, likely to have ≤ four protease inhibitor mutations based on&#xD;
             their clinical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If the subject is a woman of child bearing potential, she must agree to use a barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, prior to&#xD;
             participation in any screening procedures and must be willing to comply with all study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals with prior darunavir exposure&#xD;

          6. Subjects with a grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality as defined by DAIDS grading table&#xD;
             (see appendix 3: DAIDS AE grading Table), with the following exceptions unless&#xD;
             clinical assessment foresees an immediate health risk to the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with pre-existing diabetes or with asymptomatic glucose grade 3 or 4&#xD;
                  elevations&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with asymptomatic triglyceride or cholesterol elevations of grade 3 or&#xD;
                  4.&#xD;
&#xD;
