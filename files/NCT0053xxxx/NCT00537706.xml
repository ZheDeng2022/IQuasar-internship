      This study will identify what programs, along with traditional healthcare, low-income urban&#xD;
      residents would choose to improve their health. The information is intended as a step toward&#xD;
      designing public policies aimed at improving the health of low-income populations in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents of Washington, D.C., who are between 18 and 64 years of age and are in a specified&#xD;
      income bracket may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take part in audio-taped group discussions led by a trained facilitator. During&#xD;
      a 3 hour session, participants engage in 4 cycles of choosing benefits. Participants select&#xD;
      benefits as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For themselves individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For their neighborhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For an entire city.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once again individually.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing recognition that health status is only partially a function of health&#xD;
      care. Socio-economic determinants of health, particularly income status and education, have&#xD;
      significant effects on health status and outcomes. In light of these socio-economic&#xD;
      determinants, several governments in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and&#xD;
      Development (OECD) are adopting evidence-based policy recommendations for improving the&#xD;
      health of their populations. Britain has conducted research that has been path breaking in&#xD;
      identifying these determinants of health and in planning to address them. Canada has similar&#xD;
      plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of designing public policies aimed at&#xD;
      improving the health of urban low-income populations in the US. Toward this end, this project&#xD;
      will engage health policy experts and low-income residents in an exploratory exercise aimed&#xD;
      at designing an affordable, evidence-based intervention program targeted at addressing&#xD;
      socio-economic factors and reducing health disparities among low income residents of&#xD;
      Washington, DC. A three step process will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of candidate interventions that have been shown to ameliorate the&#xD;
           socio-economic determinants of health, through literature review and consultation with&#xD;
           experts;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consideration of a reasonable per capita expenditure for the purpose;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Engagement of low-income residents to ascertain their priorities for publicly funding&#xD;
           the proposed interventions within the assigned budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several hundred low-income adults recruited from clinical and community settings will&#xD;
      participate in this engagement process through small group exercises in which a facilitated&#xD;
      discussion will take place using a previously tested group decision tool, REACH (Reaching&#xD;
      Economic Alternatives that Contribute to Health). Data pertaining to participants'&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes toward health, and preferences for possible&#xD;
      interventions will be collected anonymously. Group discussions will be audio-taped. Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to determine preferences for various&#xD;
      interventions and their association with socio-demographic characteristics. Participants will&#xD;
      be financially compensated with $75 for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND BENEFITS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the anonymous nature of the data collection, we anticipate no risks other than those&#xD;
      entailed in discussion of poor health outcomes associated with lack of insurance and low&#xD;
      income. Participants may benefit from learning about factors that improve health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME AND MEANING TO THE FIELD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results will yield information about benefits that are of utmost priority to low income&#xD;
      urban residents. This is unique information that may contribute to efforts to find affordable&#xD;
      strategies for ameliorating the socio-economic determinants of health for low-income urban&#xD;
      population in the US.&#xD;
