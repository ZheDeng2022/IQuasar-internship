      Spirometry testing should include both expiratory and inspiratory measurements as it may&#xD;
      influence the expiratory flow volume curve indices. The ability to inhale medication may by&#xD;
      judged by inspiratory flows. However, the inspiratory portion of the forced flow/volume&#xD;
      maneuver in young healthy children has not yet been described.Objectives: To document and&#xD;
      analyze the forced inspiratory flow volume curve indices in healthy young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings: Community kindergartens around Israel. participants; Healthy preschool children&#xD;
      (age 2.5-6.5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The teaching method included multi-target, interactive spirometry games (SpiroGame®)&#xD;
      and accessory games for inspiration (e.g. inspiratory whistle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: One hundred and fourteen of 157 children performed duplicate full adequate&#xD;
      inspiratory maneuvers. Repeatability between two maneuvers was 5.6%, 4.0%, 5.1%, 7.3% for&#xD;
      inspiratory capacity (IVC), forced inspiratory capacity (FIVC), peak inspiratory capacity&#xD;
      (PIF), and mid inspiratory flow (MIF50), respectively. Inspiratory flow indices were&#xD;
      significantly lower than the parallel expiratory flow indices and the time to reach PIF was&#xD;
      significantly slower than the time to reach peak expiratory flow (meanSD; 22921ms vs. 92&#xD;
      8ms; p&lt;0.0001). The shape of the inspiratory curve was parabolic and did not change with&#xD;
      age. Predicted equations that were formed were in agreement with the extrapolated prediction&#xD;
      equation values of older children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We found that the majority of healthy young children can produce reliable inspiratory curves.&#xD;
      Our results provide a framework for reference equations for inspiratory flow volume curve in&#xD;
      the young ages. The clinical applications of these equations are yet to be explored.&#xD;

      Study protocol: The study included healthy children (according to questionnaire) in their&#xD;
      early childhood. Any children with previous symptoms or present treatment for asthma,&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms (cough, post nasal drip, pneumonia, rhinitis) other respiratory diseases&#xD;
      were excluded from the study. Forced maneuvers were measured with a commercial spirometer,&#xD;
      ZAN100 (ZAN Messgerate, Oberthulba, Germany). The spirometer software included online&#xD;
      analysis of inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers. The curves were monitored on the computer&#xD;
      screen to ensure best effort. The software also included an incentive-guided spirometry game.&#xD;
      Inspiratory indices were not part of the games, therefore efforts were continued until the&#xD;
      child could not pass the former inspiratory attempt any further. Healthy children performed&#xD;
      the tests in a designated room in the kindergarten. Tests were performed in a standing&#xD;
      position without a nose-clip. Maneuvers were repeated to obtain best possible efforts on at&#xD;
      least three technically acceptable maneuvers. Technically acceptable curves were stored and&#xD;
      the three consecutive curves with the maximal inspiratory maneuvers were analyzed for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>The study included healthy children (2.5-6.5 years old) from a number of public kindergartens. An initial screening questionnaire based on the ATA-DLD-78-A for adults, adapted for children and translated into Hebrew, concerning the child's birth, past and present health status, was completed by the parents.&#xD;
Exclusion criteria: Previous symptoms or treatment for asthma, current respiratory symptoms or other present respiratory diseases.</description>
