      The purpose of this protocol is to determine if the 3 variable mortality prediction model&#xD;
      established using data from a retrospective, multi-center patient registry (The ADHERE Acute&#xD;
      Decompensated HEart FailuRE National Registry) will hold for a prospective, observational&#xD;
      outcome study of OSU patients diagnosed in the Emergency Department (ED)with Acute&#xD;
      Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF). In the retrospective registry, three parameters were&#xD;
      found to be highly predictive of inpatient mortality for patients admitted with ADHF - on&#xD;
      admission, BUN &gt; 43 mg/dL, systolic BP &lt; 115 mmHg, and Cr &gt; 2.75 mg/dL. However, the very&#xD;
      nature of the ADHERE database limited the analytic potential of this model, as the data&#xD;
      captured by ADHERE is retrospective and limited to the inpatient stay, and the only outcome&#xD;
      evaluated was inpatient mortality. Due to its inherent limitations, the model did not and&#xD;
      could not address longer term outcomes, such as repeat visits to the emergency department&#xD;
      after discharge, or need for readmission to an acute care setting, which frequently occurs&#xD;
      soon after discharge in patients who survive to discharge after being admitted with ADHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will create a registry of patient information obtained from an&#xD;
      interview with the patient and a review of the patient's medical record. Follow up&#xD;
      information at 30 days post discharge will be obtained by phone interview with the patient&#xD;
      and a review of the patient's OSUMC visit history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most ED patients diagnosed with ADHF are admitted, as emergency physicians are aware that&#xD;
      heart failure in general carries a very high mortality rate. However, as risk stratification&#xD;
      for ADHF is a severely under researched area, it is not at all clear which patients with&#xD;
      acutely decompensated heart failure will have a poor outcome in the short and intermediate&#xD;
      term. With an improved understanding of the risk profile of our ADHF patients, more&#xD;
      appropriate decision making and disposition assignment can be made.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects nearly 5 million people in the United States and is&#xD;
      steadily increasing in prevalence. It is the single most expensive diagnosis for CMS in the&#xD;
      United States, responsible for one million hospitalizations per year. There is a wealth of&#xD;
      evidence based management strategies for the long term care of the patient with chronic,&#xD;
      stable heart failure. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of evidence for the management of the&#xD;
      patient with acutely decompensated heart failure. By way of illustration, the American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) issued a voluminous&#xD;
      guideline for the management of chronic CHF; to date no recommendations for the management of&#xD;
      ADHF have been issued by the ACC/AHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an observational study, the experimental portion is solely data collection. The&#xD;
      research team will not attempt to guide clinical care. Demographic data, vital signs at&#xD;
      presentation, medical history, advance directive status, laboratory values on admission (BNP,&#xD;
      BUN, Cr, troponin), use of intravenous vasoactive medications, laboratory values if&#xD;
      discharged alive (discharge BNP, BUN, Cr), critical care utilization, final discharge&#xD;
      diagnosis, and hospital length of stay will be collected. Patients will be contacted by phone&#xD;
      at 30 days from initial presentation to assess survival, ED usage, and rehospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: We will evaluate the performance of the three factor model (BUN &gt; 43 mg/dL,&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure &lt; 115 mmHg, Cr &lt; 2.75 mg/dL) using a prospective cohort of all&#xD;
      patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of ADHF to predict ICU utilization and hospital&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: We will test the ability of the model to predict an expanded combined&#xD;
      endpoint of mortality, readmission to an Emergency Department, and readmission to an&#xD;
      inpatient or observation setting within 30 days of presentation with ADHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: We will incorporate and test additional variables into the Fonarow model to&#xD;
      derive a rule to predict the 30 day combined endpoint of death, readmission to an Emergency&#xD;
      Department, and readmission to an inpatient or observation setting within 30 days of&#xD;
      presentation with ADHF.&#xD;
