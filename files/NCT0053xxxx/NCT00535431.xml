  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, repeated dose asthmatic&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects will receive AER 001 (60 mgs) or placebo twice daily for 28 days. Before&#xD;
      and after treatment subjects will be experimentally challenged with inhaled allergen to&#xD;
      induce decreases in lung function. The primary outcome is late phase response to allergen as&#xD;
      measured by the average percent change in FEV1 from 4-10 hours following allergen. Because&#xD;
      AER 001 is a Th2 anti-inflammatory, it is hypothesized that AER 001 treatment will inhibit&#xD;
      the late phase response to allergen challenge.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To investigate the effects of AER 001 on the late asthmatic response in&#xD;
      mild to moderate asthmatics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effects of AER 001 on antigen induced airway hyperactivity to adenosine&#xD;
           monophosphate and blood levels of circulating IgE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterise the pharmacokinetics of nebulised AER 001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effects of AER 001 on circulating sIL-13Rα2 and IFNgamma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the results of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of IL-4, IL-13,&#xD;
           IL-4Rα and IL-13R α to determine if there is any correlation between AER 001 response&#xD;
           and genotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine levels of anti-AER 001 following administration of AER 001&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, repeated dose study in male and&#xD;
           female asthmatic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sufficient number of subjects (at least 30 subjects) will be recruited to ensure that&#xD;
           at least 26 completed sets of data will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be randomised to receive either AER 001 60 mg / matched volume Placebo in&#xD;
           a ratio of 1 active : 1 placebo ( block size of 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments will be administered by nebulization from a PARI LC Plus nebulizer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects are to receive b.i.d. administration of AER 001 / placebo for 27 days. A&#xD;
           morning dose will be given on Day 28, (24 hours after Day 27 am-dose).&#xD;
