      This Phase 2, randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study will compare plasma concentrations of BH4 in subjects with&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction following 14 days of treatment by each of 2 regimens: sapropterin&#xD;
      dihydrochloride with vitamin C and sapropterin dihydrochloride alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study designed to compare the plasma concentrations of BH4 in subjects&#xD;
      with endothelial dysfunction following 14 days of treatment by each of 2 regimens:&#xD;
      sapropterin dihydrochloride with vitamin C and sapropterin dihydrochloride alone. Each&#xD;
      subject received each regimen; the 2 treatment groups varied only in the sequence of the 2&#xD;
      regimens. The washout period between treatment regimens comprised the 1 day period between&#xD;
      the last dose of study drug under the first regimen and the first dose of study drug under&#xD;
      the second regimen (Day 14 morning to Day 15 morning).&#xD;

    <description>Total biopterin concentration area under the curve (AUC0-12hours) at the end of each regimen in subjects with endothelial dysfunction is theoretically the sum of BH4, BH2 and B. Biopterin is the metabolite of BH4 after oxidative conversion of BH4 and BH2 to biopterin. Total biopterin concentrations represent the summation of drug and metabolites: BH4, BH2 and B. The total biopterin concentrations can be converted to BH4 concentration using the conversion factor 2.150.</description>
