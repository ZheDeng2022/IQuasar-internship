      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic validity of a new immunofecal occult&#xD;
      blood test (IFOBT) (Teco Diagnostics) in U.S. veterans and to compare it with the guaiac&#xD;
      based FOBT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women in the United States&#xD;
      with an estimated 147,000 new cases and more than 56,000 deaths each year. Early detection of&#xD;
      colon cancer and removal of precancerous adenomatous polyps have been shown to reduce its&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and incidence. There are several recommended CRC screening tests,&#xD;
      including fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, air-contrast barium enema,&#xD;
      and colonoscopy. In the VA, FOBT is the predominant screening test for CRC. Numerous&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials have established the efficacy of FOBT in CRC screening. Its&#xD;
      advantages include privacy, noninvasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Use of guaiac-based&#xD;
      testing, however, is hampered by low patient compliance, sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      positive predictive value. The poor patient compliance, and low specificity and positive&#xD;
      predictive value, may be related to the testing procedure. For example, dietary and&#xD;
      medication restrictions are recommended to decrease false-negative and false-positive tests.&#xD;
      Such restrictions may impede patient compliance. Recently, several studies have evaluated the&#xD;
      effectiveness immunochemical-based testing as a potential alternative, with reportedly better&#xD;
      compliance, sensitivity, and specificity than guaiac-based tests. The purpose of our study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the diagnostic validity of a new IFOBT (Teco Diagnostics) in U.S. veterans and to&#xD;
      compare it with the guaiac based FOBT.&#xD;
