      The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)&#xD;
      of a standard dose of orally administered artesunate, in order to determine if the current&#xD;
      adult dose (200 mg) is appropriate in parasitemic pregnant women when compared to the same&#xD;
      women at three months postpartum and to parasitemic non-pregnant women. Preliminary evidence&#xD;
      on safety, tolerability and efficacy will be gathered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annually, approximately 25 million African women become pregnant and are at risk of&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection during pregnancy [WHO]. The adverse effects of&#xD;
      malaria during pregnancy include increased risk of maternal anemia, low birth weight (LBW)&#xD;
      and infant death. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that intermittent preventive&#xD;
      treatment (IPT) of malaria be used routinely in pregnant women living in areas of Africa&#xD;
      where malaria infection is endemic. IPT involves the periodic presumptive administration of&#xD;
      antimalarial treatment to all pregnant women as part of routine antenatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This strategy has proven to be effective in much of sub-Saharan Africa where diagnostic&#xD;
      facilities are often unavailable and pregnant woman are at high risk for malaria infection&#xD;
      [WHO 2005]. This is representative of our study site in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of&#xD;
      Congo (DRC), where a 2004 pilot study conducted by the Global Network for Women's and&#xD;
      Children's Health Research (GN) revealed that the prevalence of malaria in pregnant women was&#xD;
      34.3% [personal communication, Tshefu]. Currently sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the&#xD;
      WHO-recommended drug for prevention of malaria during pregnancy where transmission of&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria is stable and where resistance to SP is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DRC is an area of stable malaria transmission. In stable areas of transmission,&#xD;
      non-pregnant adults have high levels of immunity to malaria and usually do not become&#xD;
      severely ill with infection. However, pregnant women, especially primigravidas, have&#xD;
      increased susceptibility to malaria. Pregnant women are not protected by immunity acquired in&#xD;
      the non-pregnant state because parasites are exposed to different antigens in pregnancy than&#xD;
      in the non-pregnant state. In addition, Plasmodium falciparum infection in pregnancy can lead&#xD;
      to anemia and can affect placental nutrient transport, resulting in the birth of low birth&#xD;
      weight infants with an increased risk for infant mortality [Steketee, 2001]. In a 2004 pilot&#xD;
      study conducted by the Global Network in two large maternity clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, 34.3%&#xD;
      (182/530) of pregnant women were thick smear positive for malaria [personal communication,&#xD;
      Tshefu].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in Kinshasa, DRC the standard of care for IPT treatment of malaria during&#xD;
      pregnancy is to administer 1500 mg sulfadoxine with 75 mg pyrimethamine during the second&#xD;
      trimester (after the fourth month and usually in association with the mother's report of&#xD;
      fetal quickening) and again during the third trimester, between 28-32 weeks gestation. SP has&#xD;
      proven to be safe when used as IPT in pregnant women; clinical studies have shown no serious&#xD;
      adverse events or cases of kernicterus nor has there been a significant difference in the&#xD;
      rate of spontaneous abortions, premature deliveries, or neonatal deaths between IPT/SP and&#xD;
      other interventions [Newman, 2004].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1980's, SP resistance in Africa and Asia has been steadily increasing. The&#xD;
      1999-2000 data from the East African Network for Monitoring Anti-malarial Treatment indicated&#xD;
      that in vivo SP failure at some sites in Kenya was greater than 25% and had reached 45% at&#xD;
      one site in Tanzania. Focal areas of low- to moderate-level SP resistance exist throughout&#xD;
      Africa [Bilj, 2000; Deloron 1989; Landgraf, 1994; Nizla, 2000]. Resistance is likely to&#xD;
      progress geographically and rapidly if nothing is done to interrupt this course. One of the&#xD;
      reasons for the increasingly high SP failure rates may be the recently observed&#xD;
      cross-resistance between SP and cotrimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim) in Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum [Lyer, 2001]. A second possible reason is that the long half-life of the drug may&#xD;
      result in prolonged maintenance of subtherapeutic concentrations of the drug in the plasma&#xD;
      [Nzila, 2000].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to SP in Kinshasa appears to be low, but on the verge of&#xD;
      increasing with selective pressure. In 2000, an in vivo drug efficacy trial in children found&#xD;
      that 94.5% of the subjects responded adequately to SP [Kazadi, 2003]. These results have been&#xD;
      corroborated by the genotyping of clinical samples from pregnant women in the 2004 pilot&#xD;
      study conducted by the Global Network in Kinshasa for molecular markers for drug resistance&#xD;
      [personal communication, Tshefu]. Molecular markers are used to survey the development and&#xD;
      evolution of drug resistance. SP resistance is associated with mutations in the genes DHFR&#xD;
      and DHPS. Presence of a quintuplet mutation (51, 59, 108, 437, and 540) is most strongly&#xD;
      associated with SP resistance. Only 4.1% of the clinical samples in the pilot study contained&#xD;
      the quintuplet mutation, which suggests that drug resistance was minimal at the time the&#xD;
      study was conducted. However, 33.2% of the samples were found to be one mutation away from&#xD;
      having the quintuplet mutation, indicating that full SP resistance (5 mutations) is likely to&#xD;
      occur soon. Therefore, if adequate selective pressure were applied, e.g. by widespread use of&#xD;
      SP, as is currently being practiced in the DRC, the prevalence of the quintuplet mutation and&#xD;
      treatment failure due to drug resistance would increase dramatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug resistance to SP has spread more rapidly in the eastern part of the DRC, some 2000&#xD;
      kilometers (km) from Kinshasa. A report from a 2001 in vivo drug efficacy study in Bukavu,&#xD;
      located on the Rwandan border in Eastern DRC, reported that 85.0% of the children responded&#xD;
      adequately to SP [Kazadi, 2003]; however, a subsequent drug efficacy study in Rutshuru, also&#xD;
      located on the Rwanda/Uganda border of Eastern DRC approximately 200 km south of Bukavu,&#xD;
      demonstrated that only 39.4% of children responded adequately to treatment [Kazadi, personal&#xD;
      communication]. In addition, 43.4% of these clinical samples contained the quintuplet&#xD;
      mutation [Alker, personal communication]. Given this rise in resistance to SP in eastern DRC&#xD;
      and the likelihood of increased resistance in Kinshasa, it is necessary to begin to explore&#xD;
      other alternatives for SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the pharmacokinetics of artemisinin is well known in non-pregnant adults, little is&#xD;
      known about the specific pharmacokinetics of artemisinin in pregnant women, particularly&#xD;
      pregnant women in developing countries. Dosages of drugs often need to be adjusted because of&#xD;
      physiological and metabolic changes associated with pregnancy. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the most appropriate dosage of artesunate to use in pregnant women in order to&#xD;
      begin to investigate artesunate and artesunate combinations as options for IPT.&#xD;
