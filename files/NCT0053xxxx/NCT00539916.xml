  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies definitively show that fruit and vegetable consumption is positive&#xD;
      for health and more specifically for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevention. In France,&#xD;
      among fruits, those which are the most frequently consumed are citrus fruits essentially as&#xD;
      juices and more specifically as orange juices. However, their health effects have been poorly&#xD;
      studied so far. Citrus fruits contain vitamin C associated with various phytomicronutrients&#xD;
      i.e. carotenoids (essentially -cryptoxanthin) and polyphenols. Each fruit contains specific&#xD;
      compounds: hesperetin in orange, naringenin in grapefruit, eriodyctiol in lemon. Some&#xD;
      scientific studies performed either in vitro or in animal models demonstrated properties of&#xD;
      these micronutrients which could contribute to a positive health effect of citrus fruits on&#xD;
      vascular protection. However data are still missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this project is to characterize the effect of orange juice consumption on&#xD;
      vascular disease risk factors and to evaluate the specific role of their micronutrient&#xD;
      compounds (polyphenols and carotenoids) in this protection. To reach this goal, a randomized&#xD;
      &quot;cross-over&quot; clinical study will be performed on volunteers presenting a mild&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. They will consume for 4 weeks an orange juice or a reconstituted drink&#xD;
      similar to the orange juice for its composition in carbohydrates, minerals, vitamin C and&#xD;
      folates but without phytomicronutrients. The effect of the juice consumption on the vascular&#xD;
      function will be monitored exploring lipid abnormalities in plasma, measuring endothelial&#xD;
      vasoreactivity (FMD) (Flow Mediated Dilatation), as well as endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      thrombosis, inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in plasma. Comparison of urinary&#xD;
      metabolomes after orange juice consumption or that of the reconstituted drink will lead to&#xD;
      the identification of the metabolic pathways modulated by the orange juice micronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover ELISA tests for the two major flavanones from citrus fruits (hesperetin and&#xD;
      naringenin) will be developed. They will be used to determine the plasma levels of these&#xD;
      molecules in order to analyze the relation &quot;ingested quantity - bioavailable quantity -&#xD;
      physiological effect&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained in this project will allow clarifying citrus fruit effects, and&#xD;
      particularly orange juice, in vascular protection.&#xD;

      Scientific context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arteriosclerosis is a chronic pathogenic inflammatory-fibro-proliferative process of large&#xD;
      and medium-sized arteries that results in the progressive formation of fibrous plaques which&#xD;
      in turn, impair the blood flow in vessels. These lesions can either promote an occlusive&#xD;
      thrombosis in the affected artery (heart attack, thrombotic stroke) or produce a gradual but&#xD;
      relentless stenosis of the arterial lumen. A number of subtle dysfunctions occur at the&#xD;
      cellular and molecular levels in the early stages of disease progression associated with the&#xD;
      loss of cellular homeostatic functions of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and&#xD;
      macrophages which constitute the major cell types in the atheroma environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several epidemiological studies shown a negative association between consumption of&#xD;
      polyphenol-rich foods (fruits and vegetables) and CVD. This association has been partially&#xD;
      explained by the fact that polyphenols interrupt lipid peroxidation which is implicated in&#xD;
      the initiation of arteriosclerosis. Polyphenols contribution to the prevention of CVD could&#xD;
      be attributable to their antioxidant capacity, hypolipidemic and/or anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties as well as on their effects on metabolic pathways. Among fruits, citrus fruits are&#xD;
      interesting sources of polyphenols (flavanones as glycosides) and carotenoids. A single glass&#xD;
      of orange juice may contain between 40 and 140 mg flavanones, which may significantly&#xD;
      contribute to the total daily polyphenol intake for the high citrus consumers. The clinical&#xD;
      evidence of a role of citrus fruit consumption in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      concerns their hypocholesterolemic effect and the improvement of some biomarkers of oxidative&#xD;
      stress, but the specific protective role of the phytomicronutrient provided by these&#xD;
      beverages has never been considered. According to the type of citrus, the flavanone molecules&#xD;
      are different: hesperetin in orange and clementine, naringenin in grapefruit and eriodyctiol&#xD;
      in lemon. These molecules were shown to display antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects. Citrus&#xD;
      also contains various carotenoids, like violaxanthin, lutein etc… as well as cryptoxanthin&#xD;
      which acts as pro-vitamin A and has a positive role in CVD prevention. The specific health&#xD;
      benefits brought by these phytomicronutrients are unknown and a clinical study with specific&#xD;
      design to assess the contribution of citrus micronutrients has not been performed yet.&#xD;
      Moreover, polyphenols and carotenoids are able to affect the expression of genes involved in&#xD;
      atherogenesis. The interaction between these molecules on cellular responses is of particular&#xD;
      interest. In fact, they could interplay in the cellular antioxidant network or directly&#xD;
      (synergistically or antagonistically) affect gene expression. The unravellings of the&#xD;
      mechanisms of regulation of transcriptional control of gene expression seems a promising&#xD;
      future line of investigation. Newly developed high throughput technologies make a significant&#xD;
      contribution to integrative biology. Studies on phytomicronutrients using the analysis of&#xD;
      functional genomics and analysis of phenotypes by metabolic are still in its infancy.&#xD;
      Integrated databases are necessary to understand their biological functions. The translation&#xD;
      of basic scientific discoveries into applied nutrition is an increasing challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social and economic context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVD in adults are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries. In France,&#xD;
      CVD are responsible for about 170 000 deaths a year i.e. 32% of all deaths, representing a&#xD;
      total public heath expenditure estimated to 7.9%. As epidemiological studies show a&#xD;
      protective effect of fruit and vegetable consumption towards CVD incidence, the National&#xD;
      Programme for Nutrition and Health set up in France advices at least a 400g consumption of&#xD;
      fruits and vegetable per day, equivalent to 5 items of crude or cooked fruits or vegetables.&#xD;
      The present project will give a solid background for the understanding of the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms of the beneficial effects of polyphenols on human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientifics and socio-economics goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goals are to clearly establish the effects of phytomicronutrient consumption&#xD;
      through orange juice on vascular risk factors. This orange juice intake will take place into&#xD;
      a French traditional controlled diet. This means that the project deals with nutritional&#xD;
      prevention of one of the major cause of death and health costs in France. It involves one of&#xD;
      the most popular sources of citrus fruits. This goal will be reached through an&#xD;
      interventional clinical study. The final aim of the present project is to give and diffuse&#xD;
      nutritional advices on citrus fruits consumption towards consumers, and to make fruit juices&#xD;
      producers aware of the interest to optimize the content of their juices in&#xD;
      phytomicronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality and new concepts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary originality of the present project is to focus on the specific contribution of the&#xD;
      phyto-micronutrients fraction of citrus (polyphenols and carotenoids) within their natural&#xD;
      food matrix to the cardiovascular protection. Such an approach is elicited by conducting a&#xD;
      cross over randomized study including in its experimental design a regular intake of orange&#xD;
      juice compared to the consumption of a beverage mimicking the composition of orange juice.&#xD;
      This control beverage will contain the main nutrients of orange juice (carbohydrates, Vit C,&#xD;
      Mg++, K+, folates) except polyphenols and carotenoids. It is now well established that CVD&#xD;
      are closely associated with endothelial dysfunction. Thus the present study will focus on the&#xD;
      endothelium by evaluating both functional (FMD) and systemic (plasma endothelial biomarkers)&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected biochemical parameters are usually measured in clinical studies to demonstrate the&#xD;
      metabolic effects of studied nutrients. However, these approaches do not properly deal with&#xD;
      the complexity of the interactions occurring between nutrients or with the multiplicity of&#xD;
      their biological targets. The metabolic approach offers the novel opportunity to investigate&#xD;
      the impact of complex food on the whole physiology of the human organism, through elucidation&#xD;
      of subtle but highly significant metabolic changes. The present project will highlight the&#xD;
      potentiality of metabolic technology to study the health effects of complex food and dietary&#xD;
      patterns in free-living populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disposition of data on micronutrients bioavailability (plasma levels) and biological,&#xD;
      biochemical and physiological effects will allow establishing correlation studies between&#xD;
      &quot;ingested-circulating-physiological effects&quot;.&#xD;
