    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as prescribed in&#xD;
      current medical practice for use in amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients fails to&#xD;
      deliver adequate breathing support over a night of use in the patient's home. ALS patients&#xD;
      who come to the ALS Center for their routine 3 month follow up exam and are currently using&#xD;
      NIV will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their quality of sleep, quality of&#xD;
      life and general level of function, and to undergo a home sleep study, using a safe,&#xD;
      comfortable and reliable breathing monitoring system during a night of sleep. If the&#xD;
      questionnaires or the sleep study show failure of the breathing device, the investigators&#xD;
      will work with the patient to fix the problem and then offer a second study to make sure that&#xD;
      the changes were helpful. The results of this study may help to develop subsequent studies&#xD;
      and to improve the guidelines used for care of ALS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as &quot;Lou Gehrig's Disease&quot;, is a fatal&#xD;
      disorder that causes breathing failure due to progressive weakness of the muscles of&#xD;
      breathing. Breathing assist devices known as noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are offered to ALS&#xD;
      patients when their breathing function worsens. These devices deliver breathing assistance&#xD;
      via a mask on the nose or nose and mouth, and are thought to be particularly important to be&#xD;
      used during sleep, when breathing often becomes more shallow and irregular. However, although&#xD;
      these devices have become the standard of therapy in ALS patients once their lung function&#xD;
      worsens, it remains unclear how effective these devices actually are when a patient is&#xD;
      sleeping, partly because of the practical difficulties in applying the device properly and&#xD;
      keeping it applied throughout the sleep period, and partly because they are most commonly&#xD;
      prescribed without objective evidence regarding how much breathing support the patient needs&#xD;
      as the disease progresses and the breathing muscles weaken further.&#xD;
