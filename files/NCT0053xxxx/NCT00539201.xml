    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is healthy. Healthy, as judged by a responsible physician, with no&#xD;
             clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory evaluation,&#xD;
             including 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for this age group may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce additional risk factors and&#xD;
             will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is ≥18 and ≤65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),&#xD;
             including any female who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a hysterectomy or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a bilateral tubal ligation or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is post-menopausal (a demonstration of total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year&#xD;
                  from the date of screening visit). An FSH level will be performed to confirm a&#xD;
                  post-menopausal state. For this study FSH levels ≥ 40mIU/mL are consistent with&#xD;
                  menopause. If a subject is on estrogen replacement and menopausal status is&#xD;
                  questionable, estrogen replacement should be discontinued for 2 weeks and then&#xD;
                  the subject rescreened, as estrogen replacement can suppress FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he is surgically sterile&#xD;
             OR if he either agrees to abstain from sexual intercourse with a female partner or&#xD;
             agrees to use a condom/spermicide, in addition to having his female partner use&#xD;
             another form of contraception, such as an IUD, occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
             cervical/vault cap) with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,&#xD;
             subdermal implants, female condom, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring,&#xD;
             or has had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy. These criteria must be followed from the&#xD;
             time of the first dose of study medication until 84 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg (110 lbs.) for men and ≥ 45 kg (99 lbs.) for women and body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) between 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions&#xD;
             and protocol-stated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             investigations, the Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic&#xD;
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of&#xD;
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100bpm for male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History/evidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary&#xD;
             artery bypass grafting surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or&#xD;
             any clinically significant cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen; positive HCV antibody; or&#xD;
             positive HIV-1 antibody result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of regular alcohol consumption averaging &gt;7 drinks/week for women or &gt;14&#xD;
             drinks/week for men (1 drink (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces&#xD;
             (360 ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits) within 6 months&#xD;
             of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for 72 hours prior to the start of dosing until&#xD;
             collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample during each treatment period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to refrain from the use of illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated&#xD;
             restrictions while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received an investigational drug or participated in any other research&#xD;
             trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect&#xD;
             of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in the study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL&#xD;
             within a 56 day period.&#xD;

             or drugs of their class, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the physician responsible, contraindicates their participation. This includes subjects&#xD;
             with a history of known or suspected sulfa related hypersensitivity. In addition, if&#xD;
             heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin&#xD;
             or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled. Note: &quot;Study&quot; or&#xD;

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor the&#xD;
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, or&#xD;
             serum creatinine values greater than the upper limit of normal or hemoglobin outside&#xD;
             the normal range at screening. A single repeat is allowed for eligibility&#xD;
             determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal&#xD;
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history&#xD;
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded. Subjects with, or having a history of,&#xD;
