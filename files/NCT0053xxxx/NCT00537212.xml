  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between psoriasis and obesity has been questioned by physicians for many&#xD;
      years. Studies have shown that the risk of having psoriasis is increased in people with a&#xD;
      high body mass index, which is a measurement of obesity. There have been case reports of&#xD;
      remission of psoriasis after gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, other studies have shown&#xD;
      that certain inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis) can be improved by dietary&#xD;
      changes. The purpose of this study is to assess whether a low carbohydrate or low fat diet&#xD;
      can be helpful in the treatment of psoriasis.&#xD;

      This study involves the use of diet as a therapeutic agent in subjects with obesity and&#xD;
      psoriasis who are eligible for and willing to undergo phototherapy. Subjects undergoing&#xD;
      phototherapy alone will be compared to subjects randomized to receive phototherapy and&#xD;
      dietary modification with the goal of weight loss. The primary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      success rate of weight loss programs in the setting of psoriasis. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      include evaluating the effect of weight loss on efficacy of narrow band ultraviolet B&#xD;
      phototherapy, and assessing the efficacy of lower carbohydrate and low fat diets in psoriatic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
