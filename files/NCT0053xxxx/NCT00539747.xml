      This exploratory study will examine ways in which individuals approach a positive genetic&#xD;
      test for Huntington Disease (HD). HD is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes emotional,&#xD;
      cognitive, and movement problems, and currently there is no way to prevent, stop or reverse&#xD;
      the progression of the disease. It is passed down through a mutation in a normal gene, and&#xD;
      each child of an HD parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the HD gene. The study is&#xD;
      designed to explore how individuals adjust to their new genetic status and evaluate any&#xD;
      perceived mental or emotional barriers to that adjustment. Currently, little is known about&#xD;
      how individuals come to terms with a positive genetic test result for a condition that has no&#xD;
      known cure or effective treatment. The results of this study may give health care providers&#xD;
      and counselors more information about how to help patients who are at risk for developing HD&#xD;
      make sense of their new genetic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be prescreened and referred to the study by clinics that specialize in&#xD;
      genetic testing and counseling. Candidates must be 18 years old or older and must have&#xD;
      received a positive genetic test result for HD at least one month prior to the study. They&#xD;
      must also perceive themselves to be asymptomatic-that is, without existing HD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will be interviewed and asked a series of questions about&#xD;
      their decision to pursue testing, their life since the testing, and the things that they have&#xD;
      found helpful or unhelpful since receiving the test results. The interviews will be recorded&#xD;
      and will last approximately 60 minutes. Participants also will receive a follow-up phone call&#xD;
      within two to three days to ensure their general psychological well-being after the&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntington Disease (HD) is a progressive neurological condition, eventually leading to death.&#xD;
      Presymptomatic, predictive genetic testing can inform individuals of their genetic status. A&#xD;
      positive genetic test result can be a threatening event. In adapting to threatening events&#xD;
      people often try and find meaning in the experience. Meaning making refers to the attempt to&#xD;
      understand an event or experience and its significance in the context of one's life. The&#xD;
      search for meaning can eventually lead to acceptance of an event or experience, and is&#xD;
      considered an important component of adaptation. Although it has been established that&#xD;
      testing for HD can be a significantly stressful event, and that meaning making is a frequent&#xD;
      response towards adaptation, little is known about this process among individuals faced with&#xD;
      a positive genetic test result for HD. This study will describe meaning making in a&#xD;
      population of presymptomatic individuals with a positive genetic test result for HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. A typology&#xD;
      of common themes will be compiled and reported. Data gathered from these interviews will&#xD;
      improve understanding of the phenomenon of meaning making in this population, and will&#xD;
      contribute to the existing literature on the role of meaning making in cognitive adaptation.&#xD;
      This study will specifically help gain insight into the process of meaning making among&#xD;
      individuals who have tested positive for HD, and may potentially inform the ways in which&#xD;
      health care professionals can help facilitate meaning-making among this population, in their&#xD;
      process of adaptation to a stressful live event.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants for this study will be men and women, age 18 or older, who have undergone&#xD;
        presymptomatic genetic testing for HD, received a positive test result and currently&#xD;
        perceive themselves as being asymptomatic. To obtain a range of experiences, the&#xD;
        investigator (PR) will attempt to recruit individuals with a range of elapsed time since&#xD;
        their positive test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak and understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received results that they believe are positive at least one month ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Perceive themselves to be asymptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to read and describe the consent form before the phone interview&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Test result less than a month ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Believe that they got a negative test result&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Believe themselves to be symptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obvious symptoms of dementia or serious mental illness that would preclude consent&#xD;
