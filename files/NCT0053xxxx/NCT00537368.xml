  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if CNTO 888 is safe and to determine how long CNTO&#xD;
      888 stays in the body and what effects it might have on cancer tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CNTO 888 is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are substances in the body that are involved in&#xD;
      many biological processes. CNTO 888 is thought to work by blocking a protein called&#xD;
      CC-Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2). In research studies CCL2 has been shown to increase the growth&#xD;
      of new blood vessels which help the tumor to survive. When new blood vessels do not grow,&#xD;
      tumors cannot get the food or oxygen they need to grow. Blocking CCL2 may help fight&#xD;
      disease.This study consists of two parts, Part A and Part B. In Part A, five different groups&#xD;
      of patients will be treated with five different, increasing dose levels of CNTO 888. In Part&#xD;
      B, two of the dose levels of CNTO 888 will be tested further in different treatment&#xD;
      schedules. CNTO 888 is given by intravenous (into the vein) infusion. Between 1 and 30&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer will take part in Part A of the study. Between 24 and 33&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer will take part in Part B of the study.There are three phases in&#xD;
      part A of the study. Screening phase, which may last up to 4 weeks. Treatment phase, which&#xD;
      may last up to 8 weeks (4 treatments) and can be extended for an extra 9 weeks (4 extra&#xD;
      treatments) in case the patient's tumor is not getting bigger. The total treatment period&#xD;
      could be up to 17 weeks. Follow up phase will include an end of treatment visit 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the last infusion of CNTO 888, visits through week 18 after last infusion as well as long&#xD;
      term collection of follow up data. After Part A is completed, up to two doses will be&#xD;
      selected for evaluation in part B. In Part B, patients will be placed into one of 3 study&#xD;
      groups. There are three phases in Part B of this study. The screening phase, which may last&#xD;
      up to 4 weeks. The treatment phase, which may last up to 9 weeks (4 treatments). If the&#xD;
      patient's tumor is not getting bigger, the patient's treatment phase may be extended up to 12&#xD;
      weeks (4 treatments). The total treatment period could be up to 21 weeks. The follow up phase&#xD;
      will include an end of treatment visit 4 weeks after the last infusion of CNTO 888, visits&#xD;
      through week 18 after last infusion as well as long-term collection of follow up data. Safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study&#xD;
      and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical&#xD;
      examinations and collection of information about the occurrence and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events. In Part A of this study, patients will receive either 0.3 , 1.0, 3.0, 10, or 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      CNTO 888. The time between the first and second infusion is 4 weeks, with all of the&#xD;
      following infusions will be given 2 weeks apart. Patients eligible for Part B will be&#xD;
      assigned to either the lower dose selected from Part A, given every 2 weeks or the higher&#xD;
      dose selected from Part A given either every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks. All patients may be in&#xD;
      the study for 18 weeks after their last infusion.&#xD;
