  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine confirmed objective response rate to combination&#xD;
      therapy with cetuximab plus XELOX for 4 cycles followed by maintenance treatment with&#xD;
      cetuximab plus capecitabine as first line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This open-label, non-controlled, multicentre, phase II study will recruit 53 elderly&#xD;
           patients with diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive 4 cycles of treatment with cetuximab plus XELOX followed by&#xD;
           cetuximab plus capecitabine as maintenance therapy until progression of disease,&#xD;
           occurrence of unacceptable toxicity to the study drugs, or withdrawal of consent by the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The planned duration of a cycle is 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab therapy will not be delayed for chemotherapy-related toxicity and vice versa.&#xD;
           If patients benefit from combination therapy, but develop unacceptable intolerance to&#xD;
           oxaliplatin and/or capecitabine, cetuximab may be continued in combination with the&#xD;
           other chemotherapy drug and/or as a single agent. In case of cetuximab intolerance,&#xD;
           patients should continue with chemotherapy treatment until progression disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Efficacy data (response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response and&#xD;
                survival) and safety data will be collected. The investigators will assess&#xD;
                responses to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When the treatment is stopped either because of disease progression or occurrence&#xD;
                of unacceptable toxicity, the patients will enter a follow-up period where the&#xD;
                progression-free survival, the subsequent lines of treatment and the survival data&#xD;
                will be collected every 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Weekly administration of Cetuximab (initial infusion of 400 mg/m2 for 120 minutes followed by subsequent maintenance doses of 250 mg/m2 for 60 minutes) Oxaliplatin. 130 mg/m2 every three weeks. on day 1 for 4 cycles Capecitabine. 1000 mg/m2 twice daily (2.000 mg/m2 total daily dose) or 750 mg/m2 if Cl Cr=30-50 ml/min (1500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for two weeks (on days 1 to 14) followed by one week of rest (on days 15 to 21).&#xD;
The patients will receive 4 cycles of cetuximab plus combination chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks in order to achieve a noticeable response. Then, oxaliplatin treatment will be stopped after a maximum of 4 infusions to prevent appearance of neuropathy and then followed by capecitabine 2 weeks out of 3, and cetuximab weekly as maintenance treatment.</description>
