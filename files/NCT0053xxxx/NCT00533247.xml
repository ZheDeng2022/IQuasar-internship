      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double blinded, placebo controlled, study seeks to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      preoperative anti-inflammatory therapy on the reduction of postoperative pain in knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery. Pre-emptive use of NSAIDS has demonstrated only modest reduction in&#xD;
      post-operative pain in previous studies. However, the short duration of dosing in those&#xD;
      studies did not capitalized on the anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDS. Short-term use of&#xD;
      NSAIDS only provides pain relief and does not address inflammation. Traditional NSAIDS cannot&#xD;
      be used preoperatively due to platelet effects. Celecoxib, however, is both an analgesic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, but does not interfere with bleeding. It can therefore be safely used&#xD;
      before surgery. This study hypothesizes that the use of celecoxib for seven days&#xD;
      preoperatively reduces postoperative inflammation and consequently pain. A detailed Medline&#xD;
      search has not identified any studies into the preoperative use of an NSAID at a dosing level&#xD;
      that achieves anti-inflammatory effects.If effective in reducing postoperative pain, this&#xD;
      research could lead to a new understanding of the role inflammation plays in orthopedic&#xD;
      procedures and other elective procedures and thus improve patient outcomes in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is commonly accepted that inflammation significantly increases pain. To date, no study has&#xD;
      examined the potential benefits of preemptively treating inflammation before surgery. While&#xD;
      the analgesic effects of NSAIDs have a rapid onset, the maximal anti-inflammatory effect can&#xD;
      take one to three weeks to be realized. Due to bleeding concerns, traditional NSAIDS such as&#xD;
      naprosyn or ibuprofen cannot, and have not, been used preoperatively. Following surgery, the&#xD;
      inflammatory cascade of cells and chemical mediators inundates the surgical wound and creates&#xD;
      acute inflammation. Once this has happened NSAIDs have missed the opportunity to treat this&#xD;
      acute inflammation. Post-operative and single dose preoperative use of NSAIDs act exclusively&#xD;
      as analgesics. Since celecoxib has no impact on postoperative bleeding, it can be safely&#xD;
      administered preoperatively. With adequate time before an elective operation, one has the&#xD;
      opportunity to reach steady state pharmacokinetics and a sufficient serum level to prevent&#xD;
      inflammation -- and therefore pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Compare the efficacy of a seven-day preoperative course of celecoxib 200mg taken orally&#xD;
      once daily against the efficacy of a single preoperative 200mg dose administered on the day&#xD;
      of the operation in reducing postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Comparison of the total pain rating in group receiving seven days of&#xD;
      preoperative of celecoxib against total pain rating in the group receiving the single dose of&#xD;
      celecoxib. Total Pain will be calculated by summing ten point verbal rating scale (VRS) at&#xD;
      time intervals of: &quot;When you woke up following surgery,&quot; 24 hours postoperatively and 48&#xD;
      hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of pain rating VRS &quot;When you woke up following surgery,&quot; and at 24 hours and&#xD;
           48 hours postoperatively in the two study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of patient reported maximum pain on VRS in the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty will receive celecoxib 200mg once daily for&#xD;
      seven days preoperatively 50 Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty will receive placebo&#xD;
      once daily for six days preoperatively and on the day of the operation will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of celecoxib 200mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be able to detect a difference of 2 points on the 0-10 scale between either&#xD;
      intervention group and placebo group, with 80% power (at 5% 2 sided significance level and&#xD;
      assuming a SD of 3.5) 50 subjects per group would be sufficient. That detectible difference&#xD;
      combined with the assumed SD is equivalent to a moderate to large effect size (i.e. one that&#xD;
      is clinically relevant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Recruitment of Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients scheduled for knee arthroplasty surgery who meet the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria would be enrolled and randomized to either the seven day course group or the single&#xD;
      dose/placebo group. Randomization will be done via sealed, coded study packages that include&#xD;
      either medication or placebo. These packages will be dispensed to the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians recruiting patients will will dispense study information brochures. If patients&#xD;
      are interested in participating, the study nurse will then contact them and she will provide&#xD;
      full study details and obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria - Subjects will be excluded from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must not be taking another NSAID while the study is conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt;1.2 x upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver Disease (SGPT(ALT) or SGOT(AST) &gt; 1.5x upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ulcers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking an ACE inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking a diuretic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must not be taking an NSAID on a daily basis during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or planning to start a pregnancy soon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celecoxib begins to act as an analgesic within minutes of oral administration.&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory efficacy of NSAIDS has been shown to have a latency of one to two weeks.&#xD;
      Ibuprofen, for example requires a dosing of 1200mg/day (the maximum over the counter dose)&#xD;
      and reaches peak anti-inflammatory efficacy in 7-14 days. For other NSAIDS, anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      dosing is at a higher level than at analgesic dosing. Celecoxib reaches steady state in five&#xD;
      days. To ensure that this study achieves steady state levels of celecoxib in the serum, and&#xD;
      that it is acting as an anti-inflammatory rather than just as an analgesic a one to two-week&#xD;
      time frame is needed. To improve patient compliance, once daily dosing of 200mg was selected&#xD;
      over twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessments will be made on prepared pain forms that contain a visual pain scale. Data&#xD;
      will be collected by patients on their pain diary and will be reported to the researchers via&#xD;
      a toll-free phone number. The study nurse will also contact patients directly at each study&#xD;
      interval to ensure collection of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be done by telephone conversation with patients once they have returned&#xD;
      home from the surgery as they recover. Patients will be asked to report their pain on a&#xD;
      ten-point scale. The scale will be described to the patient as &quot;zero being no pain and ten&#xD;
      being the worst pain imaginable.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have diaries dispensed and will be asked to telephone a toll free number at the&#xD;
      appropriate times. Additionally, the study nurse will call patients at the study data&#xD;
      collection intervals (i.e &quot;When you woke up following surgery,&quot; 24 hours and 48 hours) to&#xD;
      ensure data collection. Patients will also be asked to state the number indicating the worst&#xD;
      pain that they experienced during their postoperative period - this will be asked/recorded at&#xD;
      the 48 hour postoperative interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be analyzed by an independent statistician.&#xD;
