      The proposal seeks to establish:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comprehensive compilation (database) of clinical information comprising clinical,&#xD;
           histopathological, treatment and follow-up characteristics of past and future&#xD;
           gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) cases in Singapore that can be shared by investigators.&#xD;
           The characteristics will include clinical (eg age, sex, stage), histopathological (eg.&#xD;
           grade, type), treatment (eg. treatment status, regimens) and outcome data (eg. survival,&#xD;
           toxicity) from medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A collection (bank) of corresponding frozen and fixed tissue, blood and processed&#xD;
           samples (enriched blood mononuclear cells, protein, RNA, DNA, tissue arrays) in&#xD;
           Singapore that can be shared by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A gastrointestinal cancer co-operative group (GCCG) of clinicians and scientists&#xD;
           researching prognostic and predictive markers in GIC, which will benefit from the&#xD;
           multidisciplinary knowledge, information and samples of its members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the current difficulties in the management of GIC is the decision to treat and the&#xD;
      type of treatment to select. Tumour staging and histopathological assessment provides some&#xD;
      indication of the likely aggressiveness of a cancer and hence the need to treat; however even&#xD;
      within specific disease stages and histopathological types there is much variability in&#xD;
      disease outcomes and further sub-categorization is desirable. For the type of treatment to&#xD;
      select, there are currently no established criteria, despite the fact there is much&#xD;
      inter-individual variability in response rates and the occurrence of drug toxicity. Currently&#xD;
      this has also become an increasingly important issue as the numbers of available regimens for&#xD;
      GIC chemotherapy such as 5-FU, capecitabine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, gefitinib, erlotinib,&#xD;
      cetuximab, and bevacuzimab either alone or in combination has recently increased, making the&#xD;
      treatment selection even more difficult. There is clearly a need for additional prognostic&#xD;
      (predictive of disease aggressiveness) and predictive (predictive of likely response to&#xD;
      treatment) indicators for GIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In over 10 years devoted to developing prognostic and predictive markers in different&#xD;
      laboratories and clinics in Australia, Singapore, Europe and USA, the PI has gained deep&#xD;
      experience in what it takes to run a successful program for the development of prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive markers (Soong et al. 1996, Soong et al. 2000, Mattison et al. 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly needed is a comprehensive database linking clinical, histopathological, treatment and&#xD;
      outcome characteristics of each case. This provides multiple functional endpoints to&#xD;
      understand the significance of the candidate marker and a complete overview of likely&#xD;
      influencing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly needed is a collection of samples linked to the database that are suitable for the&#xD;
      testing of candidate markers. In this regard, the types of samples analyzed are also&#xD;
      critical:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years, the distinction between prognostic and predictive markers has been&#xD;
      found to be increasingly important (Elsaleh et al. 2000). Some cancers may be aggressive&#xD;
      (poor prognosis) but respond well to treatment giving the appearance of good outcome, while&#xD;
      others may be relatively benign (good prognosis) but resistant to treatment, giving a poor&#xD;
      outcome. Without taking this into consideration, some markers considered to be markers of&#xD;
      poor prognosis may be actual markers of poor treatment response but good prognosis, and all&#xD;
      the other possible misleading permutations. The methods to clearly delineate prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive significance have now been defined: Prognostic significance for a marker is&#xD;
      determined by examining its associations with survival in patients without treatment.&#xD;
      Predictive significance is determined by comparing the survival of patients with treatment&#xD;
      against those without in patient subgroups with and without the candidate marker. The&#xD;
      significance of this is that to clearly develop prognostic and predictive markers,&#xD;
      investigators need a group of cases that has not received treatment. Since the mid-1990s,&#xD;
      chemotherapy became a mainstay for advanced GIC cancer and it is now considered unethical not&#xD;
      to treat, implying the only way to accurately assess a marker on its prognostic or predictive&#xD;
      significance is to analyze samples pre-mid 1990s with a recording of their treatment status,&#xD;
      and this can be obtained from archived fixed tissue collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other sample consideration is that to integrate well into clinical practice, prognostic&#xD;
      and predictive markers preferably are analyzable on non-invasive samples and are able to be&#xD;
      proven in prospective analysis. The collection of minimally-inconveniencing blood samples&#xD;
      would serve this purpose, and to have sufficient sample size available for the validation of&#xD;
      future prognostic and predictive markers, it would be provident to begin collection as early&#xD;
      as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, to have sufficient statistical power and understand the complexity of the disease&#xD;
      from various angles of expertise in the management of GIC, cross-department and&#xD;
      -institutional collaboration is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors have gone into the proposal of the specific objectives of this current protocol&#xD;
      given above.&#xD;
