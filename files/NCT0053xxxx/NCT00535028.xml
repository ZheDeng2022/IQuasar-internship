    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blind, randomised parallel group design study to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of AER 001 on the late phase asthmatic resonse in asthmatic subjects. AER 001 is&#xD;
      to be administered subcutaneously (25 mg, once daily) for 28 days. The asthmatic subjects&#xD;
      will be challenged with allergen both before and after AER 001 treatment (at screen and at&#xD;
      Day 28). The primary outcome will be late phase sthmatic response (the max drop in FEV1 from&#xD;
      4-10 hours after an allergen challenge).&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the late asthmatic response in mild to moderate asthmatics.. Secondary&#xD;
           Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effects of AER 001 on cutaneous antigen response, antigen induced airway&#xD;
           hyperactivity and sputum eosinophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single centre, phase IIa, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, repeated dose study&#xD;
           in male and female asthmatic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sufficient number of subjects (at least 24 subjects) will be recruited to ensure that&#xD;
           at least 20 completed sets of data will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be randomised to receive either AER 001 25 mg / Placebo in a ratio of 1&#xD;
           active : 1 placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments will be administered as a sub-cutaneous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects are to receive a daily administration of AER 001 / placebo over a 4 week&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be admitted to the unit at least 2 hours prior to the first dose&#xD;
           administration. On the first dosing occasion the subjects will remain in the unit under&#xD;
           clinical supervision for at least 30 minutes post dose or until the Investigator is&#xD;
           satisfied for them to be discharged. On subsequent dosing days the subjects will be&#xD;
           admitted to the unit at least 45 minutes prior to dosing and remain in the unit for at&#xD;
           least 15 minutes post dose or until the Investigator is satisfied for them to be&#xD;
           discharged.&#xD;
