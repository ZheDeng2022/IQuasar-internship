      The purpose of the study is to determine the role of beta-cell function and insulin&#xD;
      resistance in the development of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes in&#xD;
      children and adolescents who have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to&#xD;
      overweight/obesity or a family history of overweight/obesity, diabetes and/or impaired&#xD;
      fasting glucose. It is hypothesized that: 1)Obese adolescents with IGT will be more insulin&#xD;
      resistant than obese adolescents with NGT. Insulin resistance will be the best predictor of&#xD;
      changes in glucose tolerance status., 2)Beta cell function will be impaired in obese&#xD;
      adolescents with IGT compared to obese adolescents with NGT., 3)Obese adolescents with IGT&#xD;
      will present with greater intramyocellular, intrahepatic and visceral fat than obese&#xD;
      adolescents with NGT. Furthermore, obese adolescents with IGT will have larger adipocytes,&#xD;
      while having significantly fewer adipocytes compared to obese adolescents with NGT. Obese&#xD;
      adolescents with IGT will also have altered expression of key genes related to insulin&#xD;
      resistance., and 4)Abnormalities in endothelial function as manifested by low FMD and PAT are&#xD;
      already present in obese adolescents with IGT and are linked to insulin resistance.&#xD;

      Type 2 diabetes is a serious and common chronic disease affecting an estimated 6.6% of the&#xD;
      U.S. population 20 to 74 years of age. Among children, type 2 diabetes has previously been&#xD;
      reported to account for 2% to 3% of all patients with diabetes mellitus. Recent studies,&#xD;
      however, indicate that the prevalence of this disorder is increasing in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. This phenomenon parallels the increased prevalence of obesity in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, particularly in African-American and Hispanic ethnic groups. Despite the wealth&#xD;
      of knowledge concerning the epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of type 2 diabetes in&#xD;
      adults, we know little about the disease in children.Paralleling the rise in childhood&#xD;
      obesity and type 2 diabetes is an increase in the metabolic syndrome in youth. The metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, also known as &quot;Syndrome X,&quot; is characterized by hypertension, type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia and obesity. This syndrome was first described in 1966 by Camus and again by&#xD;
      Reaven in 1988. Cook et al. showed that the metabolic syndrome is already present in 6.8% of&#xD;
      12-19 year-olds with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles, and in 28.7% of those with&#xD;
      a BMI greater than the 95th percentile. In addition, recent studies from our group suggest&#xD;
      that risk factors for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are already present in&#xD;
      overweight children and adolescents. As the degree of obesity worsens, the prevalence of&#xD;
      these risk factors greatly increase.Overweight and obese adolescents with NGT and with IGT&#xD;
      will be recruited. Progression from NGT to IGT and from IGT to type 2 diabetes will be&#xD;
      assessed by annual oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). Comprehensive metabolic assessments&#xD;
      will be employed to examine within and between group differences in insulin action and&#xD;
      beta-cell function at baseline and during the follow-up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lean (not overweight or obese) will be defined as a body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) less&#xD;
             than the 85th percentile specific for age and gender, overweight will be defined as a&#xD;
             BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles, and obesity will be defined as a BMI&#xD;
             greater than the 95th percentile1. Following the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, 75&#xD;
             gm) (HIC #11190), children will be classified as normal glucose tolerant if plasma&#xD;
             glucose at two hours is &lt;140 mg/dl and as impaired glucose tolerant if plasma glucose&#xD;
             is â‰¥140 mg/dl. To enter the study all children and adults must be in good general&#xD;
             health, have a normal medical history and physical exam, and have no endocrinopathies&#xD;
             (normal thyroid function test) or other diseases that might affect glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility will be determined by a comprehensive family and medical history and&#xD;
             physical examination prior to enrollment in the study. Tanner stage of pubic breast&#xD;
             and gonadal development will be determined by physical examination and by measurements&#xD;
             of estradiol, testosterone and IGF1 as biochemical markers of pubertal development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medications that are known to alter glucose or insulin metabolism, such as oral&#xD;
             steroids, or certain psychiatric medications, such as Celexa, Lithium and Paxil.&#xD;
             Children and adults will be excluded from participating in the PAT test if they have a&#xD;
             latex allergy. Lean subjects must have at least one parent, grandparent or sibling&#xD;
             with overweight/obesity (BMI &gt;25), type 2 diabetes, and/or impaired fasting glucose&#xD;
             (IFG) (fasting glucose &gt;100 mg/dl). A fasting plasma glucose level will be obtained&#xD;
             via finger stick in parents of potential volunteers in whom status of diabetes or IFG&#xD;
             is unknown. Exclusion criteria also include known diabetes or taking any medication&#xD;
             that alters liver function and blood pressure. Youth on chronic anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             medications or who consume alcohol are also excluded.&#xD;
