  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cranial electrotherapy stimulation(CES) is a noninvasive procedure that has been used for&#xD;
      decades in the United States to treat anxiety, depression, and insomnia in the general&#xD;
      population. Whether CES is an effective treatment for patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has not previously been explored. The goal of this study&#xD;
      was is to evaluate the efficacy of CES in alleviating anxiety in patients with&#xD;
      DSMIV-diagnosed GAD. Specifically our hypothesis was that CES would demonstrate possible&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing symptoms associated with GAD from baseline to end of trial, as&#xD;
      determined by: (1) change from baseline in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score.&#xD;
      a.) the proportion of responders (much or very much improved) as assessed by the CGI&#xD;
      Improvement ratings by visit b.) the proportion of responders (50% reduction from total HAM A&#xD;
      baseline score) according to the HAM A scores by visit c.) the proportion of patients in&#xD;
      remission (HAM A score ≤7) by visit&#xD;

      This study utilized a 6-week open-label design to test CES in the treatment of GAD. The study&#xD;
      was funded by Saban Family foundation. The devises were provided by Electromedical Products&#xD;
      Inc. (EPI) which is a technology company manufacturing the cranial stimulators. This company&#xD;
      has no relationship with any of the investigators of the study. There are no explicit or&#xD;
      implicit conflicts of interest. Participants were recruited from August 2005 to March 2006&#xD;
      from the UCLA Anxiety Disorders Program at the Semel Institute for Human Behavior. Permission&#xD;
      from UCLA's Institutional Review Board was obtained to conduct this study. All eligible&#xD;
      subjects provided approved written consent prior to the initiation of any study related&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection: Male or female outpatients aged 18 to 64 years were eligible if they had a&#xD;
      current diagnosis of GAD. At screening, GAD diagnosis was confirmed by conducting the MINI&#xD;
      interview.(Sheehan, Lecrubier et al. 1998) Patients had to have a score ≥ 16 on the Hamilton&#xD;
      Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and &lt; 17 on the 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)&#xD;
      at baseline to be considered for enrollment.(Hamilton 1959; Hamilton 1960) Lower then usual&#xD;
      HARS were permitted to include milder cases of GAD. Patients were excluded if they had a&#xD;
      primary diagnosis meeting DSM-IV criteria for any other Axis I disorder other than GAD, as&#xD;
      were patients who met DSM-IV criteria for mental retardation, any pervasive developmental&#xD;
      disorder or neurological impairment. Also excluded were those with a recent (6 months)&#xD;
      history or current diagnosis of drug or alcohol dependence or abuse, current suicidal&#xD;
      ideation and/or history of suicide attempt or any personality disorder of sufficient severity&#xD;
      to interfere with participation in the study. Other exclusion criteria included a history or&#xD;
      presence of a medical disease that might compromise the study or be detrimental to the&#xD;
      patient. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding and women of childbearing potential who&#xD;
      were not practicing a reliable form of contraception were also excluded from the study and&#xD;
      the use of any psychotropic medication. Patients were permitted to be on a stable,&#xD;
      therapeutic dose of SSRI or SNRI if they were taking their medications for at least 3 month&#xD;
      and were still symptomatic after at least 3 months of treatment. Patients who used PRN&#xD;
      as-needed benzodiazepines were permitted to enter the study if their use of the medications&#xD;
      did not exceed two times per week. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding and women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential who were not practicing a reliable form of contraception were also&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Study visits were conducted at baseline and at the end of 3 and 6&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. Patients who met all of the eligibility criteria at baseline were&#xD;
      enrolled and administered CES treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Fifteen subjects expressed interest in the study and engaged in an initial telephone&#xD;
      screen. Eight percent (n=3) of participants were deemed ineligible to participate. Reasons&#xD;
      for ineligibility included age (n=1; 3%) and psychiatric co morbidity (n=2; 6%). Twelve&#xD;
      subjects enrolled and received CES treatment. The mean age of the sample was 42.83±10.7&#xD;
      years. Of the twelve individuals enrolled in the study 9 (75%) were female and 3 (25%) were&#xD;
      male. Five participants (41.6%) had been taking psychotropic medications for at least 3&#xD;
      months prior to enrollment and continued throughout the study; two participants took&#xD;
      venlaflaxine and the remaining 3 patients took benzodiazepines on an as-needed basis no more&#xD;
      than twice a week (2 took alprazolam, and 1 took lorazepam). Overall, 75% of patients (n=9)&#xD;
      completed the study. Three subjects discontinued after baseline due to adverse events,&#xD;
      including dizziness (n=2) and headache (n=1). A significant change (11.5 points) was found&#xD;
      from baseline to endpoint in HARS scores (t= 8.59 p= 0.001). The mean change from baseline&#xD;
      was significant after 2 weeks of treatment and continued to increase over time. At endpoint,&#xD;
      6 (66%) of 9 patients had a 50% decrease on HARS and a score of 1 or 2 on CGI improvement,&#xD;
      and were considered responders to treatment. An additional patient improved but did not meet&#xD;
      criteria for response. Mean HDRS score changed from 10.5±15.01 at baseline to 6±3.64 at&#xD;
      endpoint (t= 3.01, p=0.01). A significant change was also found from baseline (30.3±11.49) to&#xD;
      endpoint (23.3±6.76) in UCLA 4D Anxiety Subscale scores (t=2.63, p= 0.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the current study demonstrate a significant improvement with CES, with a decrease&#xD;
      in HARS score similar to that found in clinical trials with antidepressant and anxiolytic&#xD;
      medications .(Katz, Reynolds et al. 2002; Rickels and Rynn 2002; Pollack, Meoni et al. 2003;&#xD;
      Sheehan and Mao 2003; Bielski, Bose et al. 2005; Brawman-Mintzer, Knapp et al. 2006; Dhillon,&#xD;
      Scott et al. 2006). The effect size is 2.4 appears to be very large. However, it is expected&#xD;
      in an open trial where some part of the parts of the effect could be due to placebo response.&#xD;
      The above cited studies had an effect size for placebo ranging from 0.74 to approximately&#xD;
      1.72. Most of the recent pharmacological studies in GAD observed a large placebo response&#xD;
      which makes it imperative to conduct placebo-controlled or sham-controlled study to fully&#xD;
      evaluate the treatment effect in this population (Rickels and Rynn 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients generally liked the treatment and 3 of them continued to use the devise after&#xD;
      the experiment was over and purchased their own CES stimulator. However, 3 of the subject&#xD;
      experience the side effects which caused them to withdraw prematurely from the study.&#xD;
      Presence of side effects in some of the patients could be the sign of some physiological&#xD;
      effect in these patients which needs to be studied in future studies.&#xD;
