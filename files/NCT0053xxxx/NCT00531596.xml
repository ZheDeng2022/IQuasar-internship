  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to examine the adhesion characteristics and dermal&#xD;
      tolerability (irritation) of EMSAM in two populations consisting of non-elderly (18 - 64&#xD;
      years) and elderly (65 years and older) healthy volunteers. EMSAM will be dosed over the&#xD;
      range of proposed sizes for marketing [(6mg/24hr), (9mg/24hr), and (12mg/24hr)]. Adhesion and&#xD;
      tolerability (irritation) will be examined at three different application site areas (upper&#xD;
      torso [includes chest and back], upper arm, and upper thigh).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to examine if the adhesion characteristics and dermal tolerability&#xD;
      (irritation) of EMSAM may be influenced by the secondary factors such as gender, race,&#xD;
      physical activity, and bathing/showering practices.&#xD;
