      This study comprises of a dose-escalation and dose expansion phase and will determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of oral Panobinostat on a continuous schedule in adult in combination&#xD;
      with bortezomib. Safety, tolerability, PK and PD profile of the combined treatments will be&#xD;
      assessed as secondary objectives. Dose expansion phase will explore in a non continuous&#xD;
      Panobinostat schedule with bortezomib and dexamethasone, safety and tolerability and PK&#xD;
      profile of Panobinostat and Bortezomib with and without Dexamethasone&#xD;
