      1. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy of Photon Stimulation compared with placebo, in treating the pain&#xD;
           of diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show that Photonic Stimulation for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy is&#xD;
           cost effective compared to traditional medical interventions. The latter will be&#xD;
           explored by an extensive search of the literature and from an equal number of patients&#xD;
           being treated in traditional medical practices using traditional medical interventions.&#xD;
           At the conclusion of the study the data will be analyzed for cost-benefits and the&#xD;
           possibility of crafting a best-practices approach to treat these syndromes that cost&#xD;
           billions of dollars a year in health care expenses and lost productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 120 patients with painful&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy. These 120 will be randomly assigned treatments utilizing Photon Therapy,&#xD;
      using a defined treatment protocol. We expect that some patients will drop out, and our goal&#xD;
      is 100 treated patients, for statistical purposes. The Photon Therapy group will be split&#xD;
      into two groups, one group that receives Active Photon Therapy and one group that will be&#xD;
      treated with the same type of equipment that has been modified to emit no infrared photons&#xD;
      (Non Active Photon Therapy Group (&quot;Placebo&quot;)). The patients in the &quot;Non Active Photon Therapy&#xD;
      Group&quot; will be offered an Active Photon Treatment Session after completion of the study. The&#xD;
      patients in the Photon Therapy Groups will be randomized. There will also be an Historical&#xD;
      Control Group of patients, fifty, will have received traditional medical interventions (e.g.,&#xD;
      narcotics, seizure medications) in traditional medical practices. Data from these individuals&#xD;
      will be used to calculate potential cost savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and have signed a valid informed&#xD;
      consent will be eligible to participate in the study. After screening, subjects in the Photon&#xD;
      Therapy groups (both active and nonactive) will undergo four treatment sessions. The first&#xD;
      treatment session will vary from the second, third and fourth. During all treatment session,&#xD;
      each patient will be imaged with the TIP Infrared Camera before, and after treatment.&#xD;
      Infrared imaging can visualize skin temperature changes in a noninvasive manner (2). The&#xD;
      first treatment will utilize slightly different protocol than subsequent visits, reduced&#xD;
      Photon dosage, 120 instead of 240 joules. Proprioception and protective sensation,&#xD;
      characterized by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, and visual and analog pain scoring&#xD;
      will also be evaluated before and after each Photon Therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Finding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, we have just completed 120 patients, using a block randomization scheme not&#xD;
      previously reported in this field. We have collected data on nerve function, pain, quality of&#xD;
      life, and skin circulation. The data will remain stored until the study is complete to&#xD;
      preserve the blinded nature of the project. Data analysis is still incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Clinical Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic neuropathy is a chronic and progressive condition that potentially leads to&#xD;
      disabling pain, and worse, amputation, for many individuals in the United States each year.&#xD;
      Present treatments utilize antiseizure medications, opiate analgesics, and antidepressants,&#xD;
      and are inconsistently effective. Development of a new treatment strategy potentially could&#xD;
      have significant benefit for a great many patients.&#xD;

      â€¢ PURPOSE, METHODS, AND PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy of Photon Stimulation compared with placebo, in treating the pain&#xD;
           of diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show that Photonic Stimulation for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy is&#xD;
           cost effective compared to traditional medical interventions. The latter will be&#xD;
           explored by an extensive search of the literature and from an equal number of patients&#xD;
           being treated in traditional medical practices using traditional medical interventions.&#xD;
           At the conclusion of the study the data will be analyzed for cost-benefits and the&#xD;
           possibility of crafting a best-practices approach to treat these syndromes that cost&#xD;
           billions of dollars a year in health care expenses and lost productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of approximately 170 patients&#xD;
      with painful diabetic neuropathy. The study sample size is 170 patients. Of these 120 will be&#xD;
      given treatments utilizing Photon Therapy, using a defined treatment protocol. We plan to&#xD;
      recruit 120 patients to allow for drop out, and to provide 100 completed patients, as&#xD;
      requested by FDA. The Photon Therapy group will be split into two groups, one group that&#xD;
      receives Active Photon Therapy and one group that will be treated with the same type of&#xD;
      equipment that has been modified to emit no infrared photons (Non Active Photon Therapy Group&#xD;
      (&quot;Placebo&quot;)). The patients in the &quot;Non Active Photon Therapy Group&quot; will be offered an Active&#xD;
      Photon Treatment Session after completion of the study. The patients in the Photon Therapy&#xD;
      Groups will be randomized. The Historical Control Group of patients, fifty, will have&#xD;
      received traditional medical interventions (e.g., narcotics, seizure medications) in&#xD;
      traditional medical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Procedures: Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and have signed a valid&#xD;
      informed consent will be eligible to participate in the study. After screening, subjects in&#xD;
      the Photon Therapy groups (both active and nonactive) will undergo four treatment sessions.&#xD;
      The first treatment session will vary from the second, third and fourth. During all treatment&#xD;
      session, each patient will be imaged with the TIP Infrared Camera before, and after&#xD;
      treatment. Infrared imaging can visualize skin temperature changes in a noninvasive manner&#xD;
      (2). The first treatment will utilize slightly different protocol than subsequent visits,&#xD;
      reduced Photon dosage, 120 instead of 240 joules. Proprioception and protective sensation,&#xD;
      characterized by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, and visual and analog pain scoring&#xD;
      will also be evaluated before and after each Photon Therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUBJECT SELECTION: Subjects were initially recruited from the PI's clinic, from a list&#xD;
           of patients diagnosed by Dr. Beckley (Electromyographer) with painful diabetic&#xD;
           neuropathy, and from local referrals. In October 2004, we received permission to post&#xD;
           flyers and solicit patients (identified by Dr Beckley) from primary providers (flyer and&#xD;
           letter attached). We also recruited by posting flyers in VANCHCS facilities, and with&#xD;
           VANCHCS diabetes educators. Word of mouth also provided many subjects. In September 2006&#xD;
           we modified the flyer to reflect a focused recruitment at Mather. Vulnerable populations&#xD;
           will not be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RISKS: The potential risks to subjects include physical, psychological, social and&#xD;
           economic. These are not likely: The physical risks include discomfort from the photon&#xD;
           machine. The psychological risks include boredom. The social risks include being labeled&#xD;
           as having a chronic illness, and the risk of loss of privacy. The economic risk includes&#xD;
           time off from work that may be needed to participate in the treatment program.&#xD;
           Confidentiality will be maintained as much as possible, by storing paper data in locked&#xD;
           offices, without name identifiers, and electronic data on spreadsheets on&#xD;
           password-protected computers in locked offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BENEFITS: Individual subjects may derive benefit via pain relief; this would also obtain&#xD;
           to the whole group of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RISK-BENEFIT RATIO: The risk is minimal, and the benefit minimal to moderate&#xD;
           (potentially greater).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAFETY MONITORING: Research staff will monitor for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES: The PI (Dr. Swislocki) and his staff (Ms. Orth, Ms.&#xD;
           Weisshaupt) will conduct, obtain, and document informed consent within VANCHCS&#xD;
           facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS: Confidentiality will be maintained as much as&#xD;
           possible, by storing paper data in locked offices, without name identifiers, and&#xD;
           electronic data on spreadsheets on password-protected computers in locked offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COSTS TO SUBJECTS: No added expenses are expected. No compensation is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE RESEARCH STUDY AND SPONSOR: The&#xD;
           Principal Investigator has no personal or financial interests in the research or&#xD;
           personal or financial interest in the entity.&#xD;
