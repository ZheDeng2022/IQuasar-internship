  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, newborns receive 100% supplemental oxygen by free flow when they remain cyanotic&#xD;
      despite demonstrating regular respiratory effort. Resuscitating infants with continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) in room air may improve oxygen saturations more quickly than&#xD;
      providing FFO2 because of its ability to establish functional residual capacity in the lungs.&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that in this blinded, randomized control trial, more infants (≥35&#xD;
      weeks gestation) resuscitated with CPAP in room air will have an oxygen saturation ≥80% at&#xD;
      five minutes of age compared to infants resuscitated with the 50% FFO2.&#xD;

      INTERVENTION Resuscitation will proceed as per standard of care and infants are only to&#xD;
      receive respiratory support if they remain cyanotic despite 30 seconds of spontaneous regular&#xD;
      respirations. All infants will have a pulse oximetry probe placed on the right hand&#xD;
      (pre-ductal position) immediately after birth. Alarm limits will not be set. The pulse&#xD;
      oximetry probe will first be placed on the infant and then attached to the cable connected to&#xD;
      the pulse oximeter as this has been shown to result in a shorter time to detecting a good&#xD;
      quality signal. The pulse oximeter will be set at &quot;maximum&quot; sensitivity with an averaging&#xD;
      time of 2 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur at the time of delivery. Infants that meet the entry criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized to resuscitation with one of two Neopuff CPAP circuits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1 (21% CPAP) - infants will receive CPAP with 21% oxygen at 6 cm H2O continuously for&#xD;
      at least 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2 (50% FFO2) - infants will receive the equivalent of 100% FFO2 for at least 5 minutes.&#xD;
      Note that infants receiving 100% FFO2 actually inspire approximately 50% oxygen because of&#xD;
      entrained room air. To allow us to maintain blinding of the intervention, infants in the FFO2&#xD;
      group will actually receive 50% oxygen provided via a T-piece infant resuscitator that has&#xD;
      been modified so as not to deliver any pressure to the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FiO2 (21% or 50%) will be set by the study investigator attending the delivery. An&#xD;
      anaesthesia monitor (Datex Ohmeda) will be connected in-line between the Neopuff T-piece and&#xD;
      the face mask to record airway pressures, end tidal carbon dioxide levels and concentration&#xD;
      of inspired oxygen (to confirm that infant are receiving either 21% or 50% oxygen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment failure for both groups will be defined as any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infant stops making a spontaneous respiratory effort&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infant fails to achieve an oxygen saturation of 75% by 3 minutes of age or 80% by 5&#xD;
           minutes of age. These values are near the lower limit of normal for healthy infants&#xD;
           transitioning in room air.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart rate &lt;60 beats per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of a treatment failure, resuscitation will proceed with intermittent PPV&#xD;
      delivered with 100% oxygen using a flow-inflating bag and mask system which is available on&#xD;
      all of our resuscitation warmers. We have chosen to switch to a bag and mask system in this&#xD;
      instance so as not to unblind the study (see section on blinding). Chest compressions will be&#xD;
      started after 30 seconds of tactile stimulation and positive pressure ventilation have failed&#xD;
      to increase the HR to &gt;60 bpm. We recognize that there is no data to suggest that providing&#xD;
      100% oxygen is the best approach in treating bradycardia in the preterm newborn. However, it&#xD;
      is the current standard of care. None of the preterm infants enrolled in our room air&#xD;
      resuscitation study have required chest compressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pulse oximeter does not register a good signal, resuscitation will continue at the&#xD;
      current inspired O2 concentration as long as the HR &gt;100 bpm. This also applies to the period&#xD;
      of time immediately following birth prior to the POM giving a clear reading. In our&#xD;
      experience, we are able to reliably obtain a good-quality pulse oximetry signal within 30&#xD;
      seconds of probe application in newborn infants using the method suggested by O'Donnel and&#xD;
      colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood gases will be drawn within 30 to 60 minutes of admission to the NICU as per routine&#xD;
      practice for infants admitted for respiratory support. All intubated infants will have&#xD;
      arterial access established via either an umbilical artery, left radial artery, right or left&#xD;
      posterior tibial arteries (all post-ductal in location) or via the right radial artery&#xD;
      (pre-ductal location). Infants without arterial access will not have blood gas data collected&#xD;
      given the limited utility of PaO2 estimates from capillary or venous samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION AND CONCEALEMENT Block randomization will be used with random block sizes of 2&#xD;
      and 4 using a computer generated randomization schedule to increase the likelihood of equal&#xD;
      enrolment into each group. The randomization procedure will occur on site and treatment&#xD;
      assignment (21% CPAP, 50% FFO2) will be kept in opaque (manila envelopes with foil inserts),&#xD;
      sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes in a locked drawer in the NICU. Infants will be&#xD;
      randomized immediately prior to birth since randomizing infants following clinical assessment&#xD;
      would delay the onset of resuscitative procedures. It is recognized that some infants who are&#xD;
      randomized will not require respiratory support. While central and computer randomization&#xD;
      have definite advantages over the use of opaque envelopes, their use in a resuscitation study&#xD;
      is difficult given the time constraints. Treatment assignment will be concealed from everyone&#xD;
      apart from the study investigator attending the delivery. The resuscitation team,&#xD;
      biostatistician, data collector and clinical team providing ongoing care for the infant in&#xD;
      the NICU will be blinded to the intervention. This will be achieved by randomizing infants to&#xD;
      either a modified or standard T-piece infant resuscitator circuit. The circuit for the 50%&#xD;
      FFO2 group will be altered so that pressure is not generated when the mask is held against&#xD;
      the infant's face. The circuit for the 21% CPAP group will be unaltered and hence will&#xD;
      generate CPAP when held against the face. It is not possible to detect if a unit has been&#xD;
      modified without dismantling it. The circuit pressure gauge will also be covered. The study&#xD;
      investigator will not be blinded so that he/she can appropriately set the FiO2 to either 21%&#xD;
      or 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have a custom mobile research cart which shields the oxygen blender, pulse oximetry&#xD;
      monitor, T-piece infant resuscitation unit and the anaesthesia monitor from the view of the&#xD;
      resuscitation team&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION The sample size estimate is based on the primary outcome of&#xD;
      proportion of infants reaching an oxygen saturation of ≥80% by 5 minutes of age. A sample&#xD;
      size of 138 infants (69 in each group) would be required to detect a difference of 20% (71%&#xD;
      to 91%) with 80% power at the 5% level of significance (two-tailed). The sample size estimate&#xD;
      for the secondary outcome measure of proportion of infants reaching an oxygen saturation of&#xD;
      ≥90% by 10 minutes of age is 214 (107 in each group). This will have 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 20%(43% to 63%) between two adjacent means at the 5% level of significance&#xD;
      (two-tailed test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 220 infants (110 in each group) to provide adequate power to address both&#xD;
      our primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS An intention to treat principal will be used so that infants receiving&#xD;
      respiratory support will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized. Exclusion&#xD;
      after randomization will occur only for those infants that would not have qualified to&#xD;
      receive 50% FFO2 as per NRP guidelines. A comparison of the proportion of infants achieving&#xD;
      the target saturations at 5 and 10 minutes of age will be performed using the Chi-squared&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other clinical parameters that are continuous variables will be analyzed using t-tests where&#xD;
      the distributions are approximately normal. These variables include duration of respiratory&#xD;
      support in NICU, length of stay in NICU and PaO2 at time of NICU admission. If normalizing&#xD;
      transformations cannot be found or if censored observations occur, the time variables will be&#xD;
      analyzed using survival analysis techniques. Binary outcomes (occurrence of air leaks, IVH,&#xD;
      death, NICU admission) will be compared using the Chi Square test. Apgar scores at 1, 5 and&#xD;
      10 minutes are ordinal variables and will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank sum test). An interim analysis is not planned.&#xD;
