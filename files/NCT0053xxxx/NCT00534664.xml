&#xD;
          -  Patients with Child Pugh A and B cirrhosis scores&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of medical or psychiatric contraindication which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating investigator, would make the patient's participation in this trial&#xD;
             inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of one or more measurable lesion(s) according to the RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesions treated with chemoembolization or ablation by means of radio frequencies will&#xD;
             not be considered measurable in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on a liver transplant waiting list may be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have curative treatment options other than liver transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may have been treated with intrahepatic treatment (chemoembolization or&#xD;
             intrahepatic chemotherapy) or conventional chemotherapy or sorafenib or other&#xD;
             experimental therapies prior to study entry. There is no limit for the number of prior&#xD;
             therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extra hepatic metastases do not constitute an exclusion criterion, except for active&#xD;
             CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since administration of any anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other anti-cancer treatments are not permitted during this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be more than 18 old and must be able to understand and sign an informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must agree to be followed up according to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have either stable disease or disease progression according to the&#xD;
             principal investigator assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who carry a pacemaker or any other implantable electronic device are not&#xD;
             allowed in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected or biopsy confirmed brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hepatic cirrhosis with Child-Pugh class C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had a surgical resection of the disease and who do not have measurable&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who still show objective response (complete or partial response) according to&#xD;
             the RECIST criteria due to the last anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed with another type of cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma) during&#xD;
             the last five last years or whose cancer diagnosed previously is not in remission&#xD;
