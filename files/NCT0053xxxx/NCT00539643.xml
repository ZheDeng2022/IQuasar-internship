  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of blocking the blood vessels to the&#xD;
      tumor in your liver with small beads alone (Bead Block) versus blocking them with the same&#xD;
      bead that contains and releases doxorubicin (a chemotherapy agent). The reason for the study&#xD;
      is to see if adding doxorubicin kills more tumor than would be killed by just blocking the&#xD;
      blood supplying the tumor. The chemotherapy, doxorubicin, has been used for many years to&#xD;
      treat patients with cancer. This procedure to block the blood vessels is called embolization.&#xD;
      Embolization is a common treatment for patients with liver cancer who cannot have surgery.&#xD;
      The investigators are comparing the standard treatment (using the small beads alone) with&#xD;
      another that should be at least as good, but possibly better (with the addition of the drug,&#xD;
      doxorubicin). There is no guarantee that the new treatment is better and it is possible that&#xD;
      there might be more side effects (related to the doxorubicin) than what is seen with the&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;

      Biocompatibles LC Bead (also known as DC Bead in Asia &amp; Europe) microspheres are preformed&#xD;
      soft, deformable microspheres that may be loaded with doxorubicin and used to occlude blood&#xD;
      flow to a cancerous tumour. LC Bead microspheres consist of a macromere derived from PVA. The&#xD;
      fully polymerized microsphere is approximately 90% water and is compressible to approximately&#xD;
      30% by diameter. The microspheres can be delivered through conventional catheters (4-5Fr) or&#xD;
      micro-catheters in the 2-3Fr range. These microspheres, like all agents used for arterial&#xD;
      embolization, are mixed with radiographic contrast prior to administration in order to allow&#xD;
      for fluoroscopic control of the embolization procedure.&#xD;
