      The purpose of this study is the use of magnetoencephalography or MEG (a machine that&#xD;
      measures magnetic activity in your brain) and electroencephalography or EEG (a technique that&#xD;
      measures electrical activity in your brain) to study how sounds are processed in individuals&#xD;
      with schizophrenia after three months of taking the antipsychotic medication quetiapine.&#xD;

      .Problems with attention and perception are core features of schizophrenia and are&#xD;
      hypothesized to result from defects in the filtering or gating of sensory input. Examination&#xD;
      of this requires neuoimaging techniques with high temporal resolution. High-density EEG and&#xD;
      MEG in combination with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) are used to map sensory&#xD;
      gating. In a number of recent studies patient treated with novel antipsychotics have been&#xD;
      shown to have P50 gating ratios resembling those of normal controls rather than that of&#xD;
      schizophrenia subjects treatment with conventional antipsychotics. To date, there is no&#xD;
      literature on the effects of quetiapine on sensory gating. Subjects who meet all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and have been on a stable dose of quetiapine for three months will receive a&#xD;
      clinical interview, an MRI, MEG, and neuropsychological testing to determine if patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia who are treated with quetiapine will demonstrate a sensory gating ratio similar&#xD;
      to normal controls, indicating no deficit in sensory gating.&#xD;
