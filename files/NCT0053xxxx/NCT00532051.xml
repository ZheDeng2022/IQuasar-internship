  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to utilize very high-speed optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) technology to guide surgical treatments of corneal diseases. OCT is well known for its&#xD;
      exquisite resolution, but until recently it has not had sufficient speed to capture the shape&#xD;
      of the cornea because of eye motion during OCT scanning. The development of Fourier-domain&#xD;
      (FD) OCT technology has made the requisite speed possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to develop methods for imaging the cornea with an FD-OCT&#xD;
      system that will precisely measure corneal shape and use this information to guide surgery.&#xD;
      Cataract surgery in patients with previous laser vision correction often leads to significant&#xD;
      near- or far-sightedness, a problem that could be resolved by using a more accurate&#xD;
      intraocular lens power selection formula based on the measurement of corneal refractive power&#xD;
      with OCT.&#xD;

      This study is about an imaging method called Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) which&#xD;
      provides detailed cross-sectional (layered) views of structures in the eye. The OCT system&#xD;
      scans a beam of light across the eye to take a picture. OCT provides a more detailed image&#xD;
      than other imaging methods of the eye such as ultrasound, CT scan (computed tomography) and&#xD;
      MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). In addition, OCT imaging does not touch the eye. OCT is&#xD;
      routinely used in imaging structures in the back of the eye (retina) and cornea. This study&#xD;
      uses high-speed FDA approved OCT systems. The proposed research plan is a combination of&#xD;
      clinical studies and software development to be performed synergistically. Clinical studies&#xD;
      will provide OCT images for image processing software development and testing. The image&#xD;
      processing software will provide automated measurement of anatomic parameters essential for&#xD;
      clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cataract extraction and IOL implantation is the most common eye surgery. The power of the IOL&#xD;
      implant is calculated from 2 measurements: the axial eye length (AL) and keratometric power&#xD;
      (K). The Holladay II formula also uses the external corneal diameter (&quot;white-to-white&quot; or&#xD;
      WTW) and anterior chamber depth (ACD). These formulae work well (Â±0.5D) in normal eyes.&#xD;
      However, these formulae can leads to biased and unpredictable refractive results in eyes that&#xD;
      had refractive surgery procedures such as LASIK, PRK, and RK. With a large number of patients&#xD;
      undergoing refractive surgery every year, the problem is becoming more severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional IOL formulae fail because several inherent assumptions are no longer true in&#xD;
      the eye that had refractive surgery. These assumptions are: 1) The corneal refractive power&#xD;
      is uniform. 2) The anterior and posterior corneal power has a fixed relationship such that&#xD;
      the overall corneal refractive power can be calculated from the anterior keratometry (or&#xD;
      topography) using the keratometric index. 3) The position of IOL can be predicted by K with&#xD;
      or without additional information such as WTW and ACD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative to the posterior curvature, the anterior curvature becomes flatter after myopic&#xD;
      correction and steeper after hyperopic correction with LASIK or PRK. To adapt the&#xD;
      conventional IOL formulae to this situation, most surgeons use rigid contact lens&#xD;
      over-refraction to calculate an &quot;effective K.&quot; However, the accuracy of refraction in&#xD;
      cataract patients is poor due to poor vision. Alternatively, one could use a historical&#xD;
      method to calculate the effective K from pre-refractive surgery values. However, those&#xD;
      measurements are often no longer available. If many years have lapsed, the historical value&#xD;
      may no longer accurately reflect the current shape of the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The axial position of the IOL is determined by the positions of lens zonules and capsule&#xD;
      which is in turn related to the corneal curvature (K) in the normal eye. A flatter cornea&#xD;
      (lower K) is usually associated with a larger anterior segment, where the lens apparatus is&#xD;
      located further back. A more complex model that also uses a separately measured&#xD;
      white-to-white corneal diameter may be even more accurate. In post-refractive surgery eyes,&#xD;
      however, K is altered and no longer has the normal relationship with the size of the eye. One&#xD;
      way to get around this is to enter the pre-refractive surgery K. However, this historical&#xD;
      information is not always available. We believe that a better solution would be use an&#xD;
      entirely different approach that does not depend on the 3 above assumptions at all. Since OCT&#xD;
      can separately measure the corneal anterior and posterior surfaces and AC and lens&#xD;
      dimensions, we believe it has the potential of being the basis of a much better IOL&#xD;
      calculation formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously we developed a method to measure both anterior and posterior corneal surface&#xD;
      curvatures and obtain more accurate corneal power measurements than conventional keratometry,&#xD;
      which only measures the anterior surface. This was the basis of an OCT-based intraocular lens&#xD;
      (IOL) formula that showed better results than other formulas for post-myopic LASIK cataract&#xD;
      surgery. However, this formula was only on par with the best regression-based formulas in&#xD;
      eyes with previous hyperopic LASIK or radial keratectomy (RK), because IOL position&#xD;
      prediction error and higher-order corneal aberration limited the accuracy of optical&#xD;
      calculations in in these cases. We propose to improve IOL position prediction by using the&#xD;
      long-range OCT that can image the entire anterior eye and accurately measure the lens&#xD;
      equatorial position. We propose to more accurately determine corneal power in the presence of&#xD;
      high aberration by developing ray tracing techniques based on ultrahigh-speed OCT mapping of&#xD;
      corneal surfaces. Together, these new methods should improve IOL selection and refractive&#xD;
      outcome for all types of eyes. In addition, we will develop a new OCT-based toric IOL formula&#xD;
      that takes into account posterior corneal astigmatism, which is ignored in conventional&#xD;
      keratometry.&#xD;
