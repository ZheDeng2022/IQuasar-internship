  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that an association exists between the acquisition of some respiratory&#xD;
      pathogens and prognosis of CF people. About 57 % of patients has a lung infection due to&#xD;
      P.aeruginosa (PA). Transmission of PA between CF patients is possible and several prevention&#xD;
      measures are recommended. Among these measures, all international guidelines recommend that&#xD;
      CF people maintain a minimum distance of 1 meter between them. However, this recommendation&#xD;
      is not supported by specific studies and scientific evidence. In other words, the&#xD;
      investigators don't know if this measure is sufficient or excessive, as it is based only on a&#xD;
      theoretical rationale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at measuring experimentally the distance that can be reached by PA emitted&#xD;
      from airways of colonized CF patients during cough and during conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, the investigators will evacuate the presence of PA on surfaces placed at 4&#xD;
      different distances from patients, through the collection of 8 swabs, 4 of which following&#xD;
      cough and 4 following conversation. Swabs will be collected on sterile surfaces comprised&#xD;
      between tra 0 - 0,5 mt; 0,5 -1,00 mt.; 1,00 - 1,5 mt and 1.5-2 mt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the PA-positive CF patients of the CF Centre of Tuscany aged 14 or more will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) represents the most frequent genetic disorder with autosomal recessive&#xD;
      transmission having a negative prognosis in Caucasian populations, with an incidence of about&#xD;
      1 in 3000. CF is a multisystemic disease involving the exocrine functions, in particular, of&#xD;
      the respiratory tract and the gastroenteric system. The mutated gene causes an alteration in&#xD;
      the transportation of chloride and sodium that leads to the production of denser bronchial&#xD;
      secretion, favouring the onset of chronic respiratory infections, inflammations and&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency. Indeed, pulmonary infections are one of the primary&#xD;
      characteristics, as well as the main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an association between the acquisition of some respiratory pathogens (mainly B.&#xD;
      cepacia complex [BCC] and P. aeruginosa [PA]) and the worsening of the parameters of&#xD;
      respiratory function and a lower survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent epidemiological data show that 57.3% of CF patients have a pulmonary infection caused&#xD;
      by PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to prevent the clinical consequences deriving from chronic colonization of PA,&#xD;
      avoiding contact with the infected patient when possible can be of fundamental importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The means by which the patient comes in contact with these pathogens is still not entirely&#xD;
      clear; nevertheless, it is believed that transmission can occur through direct contact or&#xD;
      droplets, or through indirect contact with inert surfaces used in common by colonized and&#xD;
      non-colonized patients, or by reservoirs and surfaces in the care environment itself.&#xD;
      Droplets are defined as large drops (&gt;5 microns) produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking,&#xD;
      or by the implementing of certain procedures such as aspiration or broncoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for indirect means of transmission, it has been demonstrated that these pathogens have&#xD;
      high survival rates on inert surfaces: for example, PA suspended in physiological solution&#xD;
      can survive on dry surfaces for 24 hours and in patient expectoration for 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If expelled with coughing or sneezing from the CF patient's respiratory tract, therefore, PA&#xD;
      and BCC [20] can linger on the surfaces of the health care centre for a long time, later to&#xD;
      enter into contact with the respiratory mucosa of CF patients attending the same centre,&#xD;
      through contact of the patients' hands on contaminated surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a limited number of studies has evaluated the prevalence of pathogens on non-critical&#xD;
      surfaces in a CF centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one recent study our research group evaluated over a 4-year period the prevalence of the&#xD;
      pathogenic micro-organisms for CF in specimens taken from non-critical surfaces and sinks of&#xD;
      an out-patient clinic dedicated exclusively to the care of CF patients, with the aim of&#xD;
      improving the prevention of cross-infections in CF centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for direct transmission of PA, there are various international prevention guidelines. All&#xD;
      the guidelines include the recommendation that CF patients maintain a minimum distance of 1&#xD;
      meter between one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study has demonstrated the theoretical possibility of airborne PA transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Rationale According to all international guidelines for controlling and&#xD;
      preventing infections in CF patients, it is necessary to maintain a minimum distance of 1&#xD;
      meter from other CF patients in order to avoid the transmission of PA and BCC and the&#xD;
      clinical consequences of a chronic infection from this pathogen. This indication derives from&#xD;
      a similar recommendation contained in the CDC Guidelines on hospital isolation precautions&#xD;
      relative to all infectious diseases transmitted through droplets. It is based on the&#xD;
      theoretical assumption that, besides transmission by direct contact, the transmission of PA&#xD;
      takes place prevalently through droplets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been only two studies on the distance reached by PA emitted from the respiratory&#xD;
      tract of CF patients. The first study [18] examined PA emission from CF patients' coughing,&#xD;
      making them cough onto a dish held by the patients themselves, then onto a plate held at a&#xD;
      distance of about a meter. In the second study six PA-colonized patients coughed in the&#xD;
      direction of a soap bubble holder held at a distance of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm and 50 cm&#xD;
      from the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained in these two studies have shown the possibility of transmitting PA&#xD;
      through coughing at a distance of at least one meter, and the possibility of emitting PA at&#xD;
      distances greater than 40 cm. However, these studies do not provide proof that one meter is&#xD;
      an effective indicator of the distance necessary for preventing PA emitted by one patient&#xD;
      from reaching another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears that no study has ever investigated if PA can be expelled from a carrier's&#xD;
      respiratory tract by coughing at a distance greater than the recommended one meter &quot;safety&#xD;
      distance&quot; between CF patients, and no study has been done on the maximum distance PA emitted&#xD;
      during a normal conversation can reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case, aside from the distance PA can actually reach; there are no studies on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a 1-meter distance between CF patients as a measure for preventing PA&#xD;
      cross-infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there are very few data available on how far PA emitted from the respiratory tract of a&#xD;
      colonized CF patient through coughing can reach and no data relative to simple conversation,&#xD;
      the recommendation of a one-meter distance does not seem to be backed up by sufficient&#xD;
      evidence. In other words, one meter may not be a great enough distance for preventing the&#xD;
      potential risk of transmission; therefore, the recommendation to maintain a minimum distance&#xD;
      of one meter may be inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study thus intends to contribute to filling the knowledge gap to this regard, and to&#xD;
      clarifying the validity of the minimum distance of one meter as a prevention measure in the&#xD;
      transmission of PA from one CF patient to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate what distance can be reached by PA expelled through the emission of droplets&#xD;
           from the respiratory tract of a CF patient during a simple conversation and coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify if the 1-meter distance from patients colonized by PA is actually an effective&#xD;
           prevention measure in regard to PA infection, as reported in the International&#xD;
           Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental study not checked with convenience sample. This study will evaluate the distance&#xD;
      reached by Pseudomonas aeruginosa after a normal conversation and after coughing by CF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this aim, we will evaluate the presence of PA on surfaces at 4 different distances from&#xD;
      the patient, by culturing 8 swabs taken from the surfaces themselves, 4 of which after normal&#xD;
      conversation and 4 others after coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection At the time of inclusion in the study the following data will be collected:&#xD;
      Patient name and surname, age in months, Rx score, FEV1, BMI, Micro-organisms present in the&#xD;
      previous and current expectorate culture, PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the specimens and preparing the culture plates, PA growth in the mediums&#xD;
      corresponding to the various collection distances will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the laboratory analysis will be reported in the patient's file, thus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after conversation: 0 - 0.5 m; 0.5 - 1.00 m; 1.00 - 1.5 m; 1.50 - 2.00 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after coughing: 0 - 0.5 m; 0.5 - 1.00 m; 1.00 - 1.5 m; 1.50 - 2.00 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures Personnel will wear single-use gloves and coats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis The data will be entered into Microsoft Access 2000&#xD;
      database. For each of the four distances and for each of the two modes (coughing and&#xD;
      conversation) the percentage of PA presence will be determined and the confidence intervals&#xD;
      will be defined to 95% of the percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we will look for associations between the presence/absence of PA at each distance&#xD;
      and for each of the modes, and the clinical variables in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For qualitative variables statistical analysis will be made with Chi-square test. For&#xD;
      quantitative variables statistical analysis will be done with Student's T-distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to obtain estimates of the proportion of contaminated areas so as to estimate the&#xD;
      CF patient risk of being reached by secretions expelled from the respiratory tract of other&#xD;
      CF patients at different distances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon a patient receiving a check-up at the CF Centre, the researcher will decide, on the&#xD;
      basis of demographics and microbiology, if the patient can be included in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has reached the age of 14 and the last microbiological culture of his&#xD;
      expectorate is positive for PA, the patient will be asked (and his parents, if under age) to&#xD;
      participate in the study and will be given background information. After all his questions&#xD;
      are answered, if the patient decides to participate his written consent will be taken&#xD;
      (co-signed by his parents, if under age). Subsequently, the patient's entry data will be&#xD;
      taken by filling out a patient questionnaire, after which the specimens will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not call for the assignment of a therapeutic strategy; the clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data relative to the patients participating in the study will be obtained during&#xD;
      routine follow-up, without modifying current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen collection methods To collect the specimens, a special ruled table (0.5 X 2.10) will&#xD;
      be set up and covered with a single-use waterproof surgical cloth after the patient has been&#xD;
      enlisted in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then be asked to place himself in front of the table at the 0 m point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The table will be regulated according to the patient's height, at the level of his navel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the patient will be asked to read a text placed in front of him out loud, in order to&#xD;
      recreate a normal conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will then proceed to take the specimens with 4 sterile swabs, each one of which will be&#xD;
      used for collecting specimens on the table surface subdivided into the following distances: 0&#xD;
      - 0.5 m; 0.5 - 1.00 m; 1.00 - 1.5 m; 1.50 - 2.00 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen collection with a sterile swab from the surface of the sterile cloth will be done by&#xD;
      rubbing entirely each of the four surfaces into which the sterile cloth is subdivided&#xD;
      entirely, using a boustrophedonic movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first set is collected, the single-use cloth will be substituted in order to&#xD;
      restore sterile conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the patient will be asked to perform two FET sequences which consist in giving one or&#xD;
      two forced expirations with the glottis open, starting with medium-low lung volume, followed&#xD;
      by a rest period in which diaphragm breathing is maintained. At this point the collection of&#xD;
      the next 4 specimens will be taken in the method described above.&#xD;
