      This study, conducted at the NIH Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at the Phoenix Indian Medical&#xD;
      Center, will compare the effects of two methods of bariatric surgery, the adjustable BAND and&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, on insulin. Bariatric surgery is a treatment for achieving and&#xD;
      maintaining weight loss. The study will look at how this surgery might improve how insulin (a&#xD;
      hormone important for regulating blood sugar levels) is made and works in the body and the&#xD;
      possible role of changes in other hormones produced by the gut (stomach and intestines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 18 and 50 years of age who are scheduled to have either laparoscopic&#xD;
      adjustable BAND or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened about 4 to 6 weeks before their surgery with a medical history, blood&#xD;
      tests and an oral glucose tolerance test for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants spend 4 days at the CRU or 2 days overnight and an out-patient visit&#xD;
      approximately 4 to 6 weeks before their surgery and again 3 to 6 weeks after their surgery.&#xD;
      They return for a 4-6 hour visit at the CRU at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after surgery and for&#xD;
      half-day outpatient visits at 3, 4 and 5 years after surgery for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests, including a pregnancy test for women. (4-day and 2-day admissions&#xD;
           and years, 3, 4 and 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA, an x-ray scan to determine body fat content. (4-day and 2-day admissions and&#xD;
           years, 3, 4 and 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan to measure fat tissue in the abdomen. (4-day and 2-day admissions and years, 3,&#xD;
           4 and 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous (I.V.) glucose tolerance test for risk of obesity and diabetes. A sugar&#xD;
           solution is given through a needle in a vein of one arm and blood samples are drawn&#xD;
           through another needle in a vein in the other arm. (4-day admissions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meal test to measure blood sugar and insulin and gut hormone levels after a meal. After&#xD;
           an I.V. line is placed in an arm vein, the subject eats breakfast over 20 minutes. Blood&#xD;
           samples are collected halfway through the meal, at the end of the meal, and at 15, 30,&#xD;
           60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after completing the meal. Subjects fill out questionnaires&#xD;
           on feelings of hunger and fullness before, during and after the meal test. (4-day and&#xD;
           2-day admissions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose clamp test to measure the effect on the body of insulin given through a vein. An&#xD;
           I.V line is placed in a vein in the arm and in a vein of the hand on the other side of&#xD;
           the body. While insulin is infused through one I.V., blood sugar levels are checked&#xD;
           every 5 minutes and a sugar solution is given into a vein as needed. A radioactive sugar&#xD;
           is also infused very slowly over 4 hours to determine how much sugar the body produces&#xD;
           by itself. (4-day admissions)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is a treatment for obesity that, in many cases, also improves fasting blood&#xD;
      sugar levels even in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) - within days or weeks after&#xD;
      surgery . Both inability to use insulin (insulin resistance) and inability to make enough&#xD;
      insulin when needed (impaired insulin secretion) must be present for T2DM to occur, and both&#xD;
      have been reported to improve after bariatric surgery. It is generally thought that the&#xD;
      immediate improvement in blood sugar levels, including remission of T2DM or &quot;prediabetes&quot; in&#xD;
      many patients, following bariatric surgery is due to the markedly reduced intake of calories.&#xD;
      However, it is not known why blood sugar levels before and after meals tend to improve&#xD;
      earlier and to a greater extent in patients who have a Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)&#xD;
      procedure than in patients who have either the adjustable gastric banding (BAND) or sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy (SG) procedure. It has been proposed that the surgical alteration of the gut and&#xD;
      subsequent re-routing of food that occurs with RYGB procedure results in unique changes in&#xD;
      how the gut and pancreas (the organ that secretes insulin) respond to food and that these&#xD;
      changes are also related to improved insulin resistance and/or secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to study, before and after surgery, volunteers who either&#xD;
      have normal or impaired (&quot;pre-diabetic&quot;) blood sugar regulation and who have been approved to&#xD;
      undergo either elective RYGBP, BAND or SG bariatric surgery (n=16 each per surgery group,&#xD;
      total = 48 individuals with normal blood sugars; n= 10 each per surgery group, total = 30&#xD;
      individuals with prediabetes). The primary aims are to compare the early effects of the BAND,&#xD;
      SG and RYGBP procedures on: a) the ability to maintain blood sugar levels, b) how much&#xD;
      insulin is made (secretion) and works (insulin action) in the body, and c) responses of gut&#xD;
      and pancreas hormones to a meal test before any significant weight loss occurs after surgery.&#xD;
      To achieve these goals, we initially will screen volunteers at the NIH Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
      in Phoenix approximately 4-6 weeks prior to surgery (1-day outpatient visit) to determine&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance status (OGTT). Within 3 weeks (1-4 weeks prior to surgery), subjects&#xD;
      will then be admitted (4-day in-patient stay) or a 2 day overnight stay and an outpatient&#xD;
      (4-6 hour) visit to measure weight, body fatness (DXA scan), waist circumference, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, insulin secretion, fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; a substance&#xD;
      that indicates how well the body keeps overall blood sugar levels in a normal range), and&#xD;
      plasma hormone responses of the gut and pancreas to a standard meal test. These measurements&#xD;
      will be repeated at 3-6 weeks following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to: 1) compare long-term effects (up to 5 years) of BAND, SG or RYGBP&#xD;
      surgery on fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels, 2) determine if these levels are related to&#xD;
      the responses of gut and pancreas hormones during a meal test, and 3) determine whether&#xD;
      pre-op or early post-op measures of insulin secretion, insulin action, or responses of gut&#xD;
      and pancreas hormones to a meal can predict long-term levels of fasting blood sugar and HbA1c&#xD;
      after accounting for changes in weight or body fat. To achieve these goals, subjects will&#xD;
      return to the NIH CRU (out-patient, 4-6 hour visit) at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery to&#xD;
      have repeat measurements of body weight, fatness (DXA, non-contrast MRI of waist and thigh),&#xD;
      waist circumference, fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels and the gut and pancreatic hormone&#xD;
      responses to a meal test. Thereafter, subjects will have annual outpatient measurements of&#xD;
      body weight, body fat and fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels at 3, 4 and 5 years after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
