  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug that is under investigation during this study is RhuDex® and is expected to be used&#xD;
      as an oral treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Normal stomach juices contain acid and&#xD;
      previous studies have shown that this acidity reduces the solubility and therefore the&#xD;
      absorption of RhuDex®. Administering the alkaline buffer meglumine with RhuDex® has shown to&#xD;
      increase the solubility of RhuDex® by decreasing the stomach acidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the optimum level of meglumine which is required to achieve the best uptake of RhuDex®&#xD;
           from the stomach into the blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the concentration of RhuDex® in the blood in the presence of the optimum&#xD;
           level of meglumine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate further the safety and tolerability of RhuDex®. The study will be&#xD;
           conducted in healthy male volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RhuDex® is a novel, orally bioavailable, low molecular weight modulator of co-stimulation of&#xD;
      T lymphocytes. RhuDex® binds to the protein CD80 on the surface of antigen-presenting cells&#xD;
      and inhibits its interaction with CD28 (but not with CTLA-4) presented by CD4+ T lymphocytes.&#xD;
