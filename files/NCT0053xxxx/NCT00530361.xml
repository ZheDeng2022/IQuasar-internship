      The purpose of this study is to assess whether nesiritide compared to placebo when given with&#xD;
      standard of care therapies, helps preserve kidney function in heart failure (HF) patients&#xD;
      undergoing heart bypass graft surgery that requires the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      machine (CPB pump or heart-lung machine).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In coronary heart disease (CHD), the coronary arteries become clogged with calcium and fatty&#xD;
      deposits. The deposits, called plaques, narrow the arteries that carry blood to the heart&#xD;
      muscle and could cause ischemic heart disease (too little blood and oxygen reaching the heart&#xD;
      muscle). Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery is a treatment option for ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease. CABG surgery is surgery to create new routes for blood to flow around narrowed and&#xD;
      blocked arteries so that the heart muscle will receive needed oxygen and nutrients. Acute&#xD;
      kidney injury is a serious risk of CABG surgery while on CPB pump (heart-lung machine), which&#xD;
      could result from ischemia during and following surgery. This study is a double-blind&#xD;
      (neither the patient or the doctor knows whether the patient is assigned to receive study&#xD;
      drug or placebo), randomized (assigned to treatment by chance), placebo-controlled (study&#xD;
      drug results compared to placebo results) study to determine the effectiveness of nesiritide&#xD;
      compared to placebo when given to HF patients undergoing CABG surgery requiring the use of a&#xD;
      CPB pump . The study drug (nesiritide) or placebo dose being studied is 0.010 mcg/kg/min via&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion. The study hypothesis is that compared to placebo, nesiritide will&#xD;
      reduce kidney ischemia, preserve glomerular filtration rate (GFR),which measures the rate at&#xD;
      which the kidneys filter blood, and the need for dialysis or occurrence of death in HF&#xD;
      patients who have undergone heart bypass surgery requiring the use of a cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass machine. Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations and electrocardiograms at various time&#xD;
      points throughout the study. The patients assigned to the nesiritide group will receive a&#xD;
      continuous I.V. infusion at 0.010 mcg/kg/min of nesiritide for at least 48 hours and could be&#xD;
      extended to up to 96 hours. The patients assigned to the placebo group will receive matching&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
