    <textblock>
      To evaluate the overall response rate of gemcitabine and vinorelbine combination (GV) and&#xD;
      gemcitabine followed by vinorelbine (Gâ‡’V) when used as palliative therapy in patients with&#xD;
      stage IV and recurrent breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, two-arm, parallel group phase II study. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to each of the two treatment regimens, one of which is gemcitabine and&#xD;
      vinorelbine combination therapy (Group A) and the other is gemcitabine monotherapy followed&#xD;
      by vinorelbine monotherapy (Group B). Patients In group A monotherapy will receive&#xD;
      gemcitabine and vinorelbine in combination, while patients in group B will receive&#xD;
      gemcitabine monotherapy until the evidence of disease progression followed by vinorelbine. A&#xD;
      total of 82 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be randomized after&#xD;
      stratified according to the number of prior chemotherapy including adjuvant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      visceral disease. No maximum number of cycles is pre-determined. Patients may continue on&#xD;
      study therapy until documented treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group A who discontinue study therapy will proceed to the post-therapy follow-up&#xD;
      phase of the study. Patients in group B who discontinue study therapy while treated with&#xD;
      gemcitabine will proceed to receive vinorelbine on disease progression. Patients on&#xD;
      vinorelbine who discontinue study therapy will proceed to the post-therapy follow-up phase of&#xD;
      the study. Further treatment upon discontinuation of study therapy is at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two arm, open label phase II study without control is appropriate for exploring the&#xD;
      efficacy of gemcitabine with concurrent or sequential vinorelbine in this patient population&#xD;
      and for evaluating and characterizing toxicities of two treatment approaches, qualitatively&#xD;
      and quantitatively. The purpose of randomization in this phase II study is to diminish the&#xD;
      possible impact of selection bias on treatment outcome and thus on interpretation of efficacy&#xD;
      and safety data.&#xD;
