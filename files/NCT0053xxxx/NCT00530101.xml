      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate MR imaging in subjects receiving&#xD;
      doxorubicin chemotherapy to see if MR can detect heart damage as well as or better than MUGA&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is expected to enroll approximately 10 subjects over 12 months at the&#xD;
      University of Miami / Miller School of Medicine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is one of the most widely used chemotherapy agents, despite its&#xD;
      well-known causation of cardiac toxicity. Doxorubicin causes apoptotic cell death, as shown&#xD;
      with uptake of antimyosin antibodies on nuclear medicine studies (1,2). Myocyte damage is&#xD;
      dose-related, and produces left ventricular dysfunction that may lead to clinically&#xD;
      significant heart failure, especially in patients with limited cardiac reserve. An estimated&#xD;
      7% of patients develop doxorubicin-related congestive heart failure (CHF) after a cumulative&#xD;
      dose of 550 mg/m2 (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods to detect and prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have been investigated for&#xD;
      years. Serial evaluation of left ventricular function using Multigated Acquisition (MUGA)&#xD;
      scans (radionuclide angiocardiography) was proposed over 20 years ago as one method for&#xD;
      detecting cardiotoxicity (4). More sophisticated nuclear imaging (PET) has not been able to&#xD;
      demonstrate early changes of cardiotoxicity (5). There are a number of potential indicators&#xD;
      of early cardiotoxicity such as toxic effects on the right ventricle and on left ventricular&#xD;
      diastolic (vs. systolic) function that MUGA is not optimally suited to demonstrate. Even&#xD;
      earlier, an imaging manifestation of cell death could provide the first clue to impending&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity (1,2,6). Cardiac MR (CMR) has the potential to address all of these facets of&#xD;
      doxorubicin toxicity. Biventricular function can be assessed from cine images, and CMR is&#xD;
      well-established as a highly reliable method for cardiac functional assessment. Of even&#xD;
      greater potential interest, cell injury and death can be demonstrated using gadolinium&#xD;
      enhancement, both for myocardial infarction (focal enhancement) as well as myocarditis (both&#xD;
      focal and diffuse enhancement) (7,8). Doxorubicin toxicity may in fact share&#xD;
      pathophysiological characteristics with myocarditis (9). It is our hypothesis that CMR will&#xD;
      be able to show both functional and cellular (infarct, microinfarct, or myocarditis-type)&#xD;
      effects of doxorubicin toxicity as determined during and at the conclusion of doxorubicin&#xD;
      therapy. Specifically, we hypothesize that myocardial tissue will demonstrate a greater&#xD;
      increase in signal (decrease in T1 after contrast administration) after chemotherapy as&#xD;
      compared to before chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 1. Patient Selection: Ten patients selected to receive doxorubicin for breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment will be recruited from Oncology Services at the Sylvester Cancer Center and Jackson&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital. This pilot study will select patients who are at increased likelihood to&#xD;
      develop cardiotoxicity, due to borderline cardiac function at baseline, advanced age, or the&#xD;
      anticipation of a high cumulative dose of administered doxorubicin. Patients who will receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy to the left chest during chemotherapy (i.e., left breast cancer) will be&#xD;
      excluded so as to eliminate possible cardiotoxic effects from radiation. CMR studies will be&#xD;
      performed at no charge to the patient, supported by the sponsor of this study. CMR imaging&#xD;
      will be subject to IRB approval, informed consent, and HIPAA regulations. Contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      CMR will be obtained at three time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the first dose of doxorubicin (image characteristics will serve as control&#xD;
           values to indicate later changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After first cycle of doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At conclusion of therapy, typically 4-6 cycles; cumulative dose of 360 to 600 mg/m2&#xD;
           doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to standard screening for contraindications to MR imaging, patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) within 30 days prior to each MR&#xD;
      scan. This is to avoid the rare but potential complication of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis&#xD;
      in patients with severe or end-stage renal failure who receive gadolinium MR contrast (10).&#xD;
      GFR will be calculated from serum creatinine, patient age, gender, and race, using the MDRD&#xD;
      GFR Calculator ( Stephen Z. Fadem, M.D.) at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      http://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not undergo contrast-enhanced MR unless calculated GFR is equal to or greater&#xD;
      than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Imaging: CMR will be performed on the Siemens 1.5T Sonata located at the University of&#xD;
      Miami Outpatient Diagnostic Imaging Center. It is anticipated that each scan will require&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes. Three imaging planes (short axis [SA] series through the&#xD;
      ventricles, and individual 4 chamber [4CV] and 2 chamber [2CV] views) will be utilized.&#xD;
      Sequences will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Precontrast imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. T1-weighted (SA series)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA) [The TI scout sequence obtains images at multiple&#xD;
           inversion (TI) times at a single slice level]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TrueFISP cine gradient echo imaging (SA series, 2CV, 4CV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Postcontrast imaging: after 0.1 mmol/kg OptiMARK intravenous&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1 minute post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2-4 minutes post-injection: Turboflash inversion recovery (single mid-ventricular SA) at&#xD;
           serial TI values to determine time of myocardial nulling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 5 minutes post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 6-9 minutes post-injection: Turboflash inversion recovery (single mid-ventricular SA) at&#xD;
           serial TI values to determine time of myocardial nulling&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 10-14 minutes post-injection: Segmented IR delayed imaging using TI of myocardial signal&#xD;
           nulling (SA series, 2CV, 4CV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 15 minutes post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 16-19 minutes post-injection : Turboflash inversion recovery (single mid-ventricular SA)&#xD;
           at serial TI values to determine time of myocardial nulling&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 20 minutes post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. 21 minutes post-injection : T1-weighted (SA series)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Analysis: ANOVA will be used to assess for differences in measured values of the discrete&#xD;
      variables listed in A, B, C, and D below. Data will be analyzed for all three imaging&#xD;
      sessions together using ANOVA, and for each pair of sessions (pretreatment vs. first cycle of&#xD;
      doxorubicin, first cycle of doxorubicin vs. maximum cumulative dose, and pretreatment vs.&#xD;
      maximum cumulative dose) using the paired t-test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test if variances&#xD;
      unequal). The MR image sets will be analyzed in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. TrueFISP cine: analysis will utilize the ARGUS software package on the Siemens system.&#xD;
      End-diastolic and end-systolic endocardial contours will be generated using a semi-automated&#xD;
      technique whereby initial manual contouring is followed by automated contour generation,&#xD;
      which are then manually edited before final calculations are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ejection fraction (biventricular) and ventricular volumes (end-systole and&#xD;
           end-diastole).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diastolic left ventricular function I. 1/3 peak filling rate (PFR) II. 1/3 filling&#xD;
           fraction (1/3 FF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Wall motion: The AHA 17-segment model will be utilized (6 segments each at basal,&#xD;
           mid-ventricular, and near-apical levels, and a single apical segment). A five-point&#xD;
           scale will be assigned to each segment (normal, mildly hypokinetic, severely&#xD;
           hypokinetic, akinetic, dyskinetic). Summed values will yield a single measure of&#xD;
           contractility for each imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. T1-weighted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Region-of-interest signal intensity in the myocardium will be measured in the mid-left&#xD;
      ventricular free wall, the mid-interventricular septum, and skeletal muscle for both&#xD;
      precontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted imaging. We will calculate a variable representing&#xD;
      &quot;percent enhancement&quot; for each location as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      % enhancement = signal intensity (postcontrast) - signal intensity (precontrast) signal&#xD;
      intensity (precontrast)&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. The TI scout image sets will provide a single TI value of optimal myocardial nulling as&#xD;
      well as an exponential curve to reflect the T1 recovery of myocardium at each time point of&#xD;
      acquisition (precontrast, 1 minute postcontrast, 5 minutes postcontrast, 15 minutes&#xD;
      postcontrast, 20 minutes postcontrast). The TI scout will be performed at multiple time&#xD;
      points due to the dynamic nature of tissue enhancement after gadolinium administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. The turboflash inversion recovery image (mid-ventricular) will provide an alternative&#xD;
      single TI value of optimal myocardial nulling at each time point of acquisition (2-4 minutes,&#xD;
      6-9 minutes, and 16-19 minutes postinjection). The turboflash inversion recovery image will&#xD;
      be performed at multiple time points due to the dynamic nature of tissue enhancement after&#xD;
      gadolinium administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Segmented IR delayed imaging will provide images of the entire myocardium which will be&#xD;
      evaluated for focal myocardial signal hyperintensities, whether due to infarction or&#xD;
      myocarditis. The optimum TI value determined from (D) above will be used. If identified,&#xD;
      lesions will be manually contoured with use of the irregular region of interest tool on the&#xD;
      console. The infarct size will then be calculated as total infarct area multiplied by the&#xD;
      section thickness and the specific gravity (assumed to be 1.05 g/mL) of the myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records will provide data regarding cardiac morbidity or mortality.&#xD;
