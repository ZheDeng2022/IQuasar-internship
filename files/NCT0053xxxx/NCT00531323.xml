  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at whether changing directly from one medication for HIV&#xD;
      (efavirenz) to a new medication for HIV (TMC125) has any effect on the levels of TMC125 in&#xD;
      the blood, compared to when TMC125 is taken without efavirenz having been taken immediately&#xD;
      beforehand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to help the investigators understand whether it is safe to change directly&#xD;
      from efavirenz to TMC125 (with no gap between the treatments) in patients who need these&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the blood levels of TMC125 when it is taken both once and twice a&#xD;
      day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetic parameters of TMC125 will be evaluated when TMC125 is given without and with&#xD;
      a 14-day efavirenz intake preceding period in order to evaluate the risk of achieving sub&#xD;
      therapeutic concentrations of TMC125 when switching straight from efavirenz containing&#xD;
      regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability of medications will also be assessed by questions, physical&#xD;
      examination and laboratory parameters. These will be performed at regular intervals during&#xD;
      the drug study.&#xD;
