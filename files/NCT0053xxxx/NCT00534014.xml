      Study Goal #1: Determine the optimal oral dose of vitamin C to reduce surrogate markers of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (blockages in blood vessels) following the consumption of an atherogenic high&#xD;
      fat lunch in type 2 diabetic individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Goal #2: After conducting the original study, we found that vitamin E was not effective&#xD;
      in reducing the markers of oxidative stress, hypercoagulation, inflammation, and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, data from randomized trials have largely demonstrated no significant benefit of&#xD;
      vitamin E supplementation on the prevention of primary and/or secondary cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease as once thought. Therefore, we decided to amend our current protocol to add a Part B&#xD;
      to study only the effects of vitamin C at the following doses: 500 mg, 1000 mg, and 2000 mg&#xD;
      daily (and include a placebo arm, as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 70% of type 2 diabetic individuals will die of atherosclerotic disease (1). This is&#xD;
      partially explained by the abnormal lipid profile frequently observed in type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      These patients are also frequently afflicted with &quot;Syndrome X,&quot; an assortment of risk factors&#xD;
      for atherosclerosis, including hypertension, abdominal obesity, hyperuricemia, prothrombotic&#xD;
      and proinflammatory states, and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several approaches have been suggested to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis in type 2&#xD;
      diabetic individuals. Changes in lifestyle leading to increased exercise and weight loss will&#xD;
      result in the reduction of adipose stores (and restore tissue sensitivity to insulin).&#xD;
      However, this approach is very difficult for many individuals to achieve. For them, this can&#xD;
      be supplemented with medications such as aspirin, angiotensin inhibitors, angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers, and the statins. Unfortunately, each of these medications is either&#xD;
      expensive and/or includes undesirable side effects (3). In addition, clinical experience&#xD;
      shows that many patients are against taking medication for cultural reasons and/or fear of&#xD;
      long-term unknown consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, there is great interest in using vitamins to reduce atherogenic risk. More&#xD;
      than half of the U.S. adult population consumes vitamins on a regular basis. They are&#xD;
      inexpensive and easily accessible in grocery stores and health food stores. The FDA does not&#xD;
      consider them as &quot;drugs&quot; and they undergo a less rigorous approval procedure (4,5). Vitamins&#xD;
      are natural compounds found in the body, and many individuals do not consider them drugs, but&#xD;
      feel they are simply fortifying their bodies against disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently a focus on vitamins that are antioxidants, including vitamin C. Patients&#xD;
      with diabetes usually have a decreased antioxidant status, which leads to increased oxidative&#xD;
      stress and vascular dysfunction (6,7). Oxidative stress refers to the excessive production of&#xD;
      oxygen free radical species, which damage their surrounding molecules, and this leads to the&#xD;
      increased release of inflammatory mediators, oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and&#xD;
      increased coagulation (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C, another antioxidant, has been shown to regenerate Vitamin E, and in patients with&#xD;
      increased oxidative stress (i.e. patients with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia), it restores endothelium-dependent artery&#xD;
      vasodilation, and may reverse endothelial dysfunction in peripheral arteries (6). It has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that supplementation of vitamin C may be more effective than vitamins taken&#xD;
      together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that atherosclerosis may be prevented by blocking the oxidative metabolism of&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol, hence decreasing its uptake into the arterial lumen, is what incited the&#xD;
      interest in vitamin C for treating coronary heart disease (CHD). Basic science and animal&#xD;
      studies had shown beneficial effects of vitamin C on several different stages of the&#xD;
      atherosclerotic process. This was followed by several observational studies on patients with&#xD;
      no initial coronary artery disease, which suggested that vitamin C lowered the risk of future&#xD;
      CHD. However, this was followed by several large randomized control trials, the majority of&#xD;
      which showed no benefit of vitamin C in the prevention of CHD in patients with at least one&#xD;
      coronary risk factor. However, this did not answer the question of whether vitamin C was&#xD;
      beneficial in differeing doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2002, Fang et al. published a study that investigated the efficacy of vitamins C and E on&#xD;
      the prevention of transplant-associated arteriosclerosis (another highly oxidative state).&#xD;
      The primary outcome was change in average intimal index (plaque area divided by vessel area),&#xD;
      which was measured with intavascular ultrasonography (IVUS). The vitamin C and E plasma&#xD;
      concentrations were measured at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. At follow-up the placebo&#xD;
      group showed a significant increase but the treatment group showed no change. The authors&#xD;
      concluded that early progression of transplant-associated coronary arteriosclerosis is&#xD;
      delayed with combined vitamin C and E therapy (6,10). In 2003, Salonen et al. published the&#xD;
      six-year effects of combined vitamin C and E from the ASAP (Antioxidant Supplementation in&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis Prevention) study, which studied the effects of supplemented doses on the&#xD;
      progression of common carotid atherosclerosis in middle-aged high-risk men and women, using&#xD;
      high-resolution ultrasound to assess this outcome. The group receiving combined vitamins&#xD;
      showed a decrease in rate of progression of carotid intimal thickness, but this effect was&#xD;
      limited to men only (8,10). In the Heart Protection Study (2002), a combination of synthetic&#xD;
      vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene daily had no effect on the incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in a group of approximately 20,000 high-risk individuals (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, not all studies showed positive benefits. Vitamin C has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      overall oxidative stress by scavenging free readicals within the body (11). Some trials&#xD;
      failed to report antioxidant levels, making compliance difficult to measure (8) (except&#xD;
      through pill counting - and unfortunately, volunteers can dispose medications prior to visit,&#xD;
      in order to give the image of compliance). Some trials used suboptimal timing regarding&#xD;
      administration of antioxidant vitamins in relation to meals (1). Also, it is not known just&#xD;
      what exactly is the optimal dosage of vitamins C is. The doses of vitamin C has differed in&#xD;
      these trials (8); some investigators hypothesize that at least 500 mg/day of vitamin C are&#xD;
      effective for slowing the progression of atherosclerosis, but speculation is rampant (7,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data from these studies (1,7,8), we believe that only sufficient doses of&#xD;
      vitamins C will be effective for slowing the progression of atherosclerosis. It is our goal&#xD;
      to find the optimal dosing combination. We will use a high-risk population (diabetic&#xD;
      volunteers) because they are known to have high oxidative stress and may benefit tremendously&#xD;
      from this therapy.&#xD;
