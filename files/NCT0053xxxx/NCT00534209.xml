      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may help the body build an immune&#xD;
      response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and&#xD;
      to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer who have finished first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I (single site [University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center]):&#xD;
           Patients receive allogeneic B7.1 and human leukocyte antigen-A1 (HLA-A1) transfected&#xD;
           tumor cell vaccine intradermally (ID) in weeks 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 6&#xD;
           weeks for 2 courses. If no more than 1 of 6 patients experience a probable or&#xD;
           definitively treatment related adverse effect (i.e., grade 2 autoimmune or grade 3-4 of&#xD;
           any type), patients proceed to the phase II portion of the study. If 2 or more (out of&#xD;
           6) patients experience treatment related adverse effects the study stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II (randomized): Patients are stratified according to study site (University of&#xD;
           Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center or Memorial Regional Hospital), type of&#xD;
           prior first-line treatment (platinum and taxane vs platinum and gemcitabine), and&#xD;
           presence of brain metastasis (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I: Patients receive allogeneic B7.1 and HLA-A1 transfected tumor cell vaccine&#xD;
                ID in weeks 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II: Patients receive a placebo vaccine as in arm I. Patients undergo blood&#xD;
                sample collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for&#xD;
                cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), and natural&#xD;
                killer cell (NK) response and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and T helper cell&#xD;
                1 (TH1)/T helper cell 2 (TH2) bias, including levels of interleukin (IL) IL-1β,&#xD;
                IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis&#xD;
                factor-alpha (TNF-α) via ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every&#xD;
      6 months for 4 years, and then once a year thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (6 patients for phase I and 60 patients for phase&#xD;
      II) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
