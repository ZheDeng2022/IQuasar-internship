    <textblock>
      Depression is very common in people who have experienced a traumatic brain injury. Few&#xD;
      treatments have been found to be effective in treating depression in this situation. We&#xD;
      intend to investigate the effectiveness of a form of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation, which has been found to be effective in treating depression in people who have&#xD;
      not undergone a brain injury. By evaluating new methods of treating depression in this&#xD;
      population, we hope to increase the options available for treating people in this difficult&#xD;
      situation. Furthermore, problems with aspects of thinking are also commonly present post&#xD;
      brain injury, as in some individuals with depression. Various brain stimulation techniques,&#xD;
      including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been shown to have a positive effect&#xD;
      on cognition. We also intend to investigate whether a therapeutic effect on cognitive&#xD;
      deficits is present following TMS, in addition to any effects on depression. New treatment&#xD;
      protocols will be developed, and understanding of the pathology and treatment of post&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury depression will be enhanced.&#xD;

      It is plausible to propose that the same treatment paradigm may result in an improvement in&#xD;
      mood and cognition with the possibility that these changes will be self reinforcing resulting&#xD;
      in enhanced quality of life and reduced service demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal for the use of rTMS in the treatment of post TBI depression is also supported by&#xD;
      aetiological models. In particular, rTMS would seem to have considerable potential to improve&#xD;
      pathophysiological changes relevant to the treatment of post TBI depression and cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Early models of the mechanism of action of rTMS treatment in depression were&#xD;
      based on the observation that rTMS is able to produce localised changes in cortical activity&#xD;
      [7]. The standard treatment paradigm generally has been found to produce an increase in local&#xD;
      prefrontal cortical excitability. However, more recently there has been an increased&#xD;
      understanding that rTMS modulates distal brain regions as well and potentially the strength&#xD;
      of connections between brain regions. It has been proposed that its therapeutic effects in&#xD;
      non TBI-related depression occur through modulation of dorsal frontal - subcortical limbic&#xD;
      connectivity and potentially the actual integrity and strength of connections between these&#xD;
      regions. If this is the case, altering cortical - cortical or cortical - subcortical&#xD;
      connectivity may lead to therapeutic benefits in post TBI depression due to likely&#xD;
      involvement of white matter changes in the development of TBI related mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims/Objectives/Hypothesis/es Primary Aim: To assess the effectiveness of rTMS in treating&#xD;
      depression post traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To gain preliminary data as to the possible effectiveness of rTMS in treating&#xD;
      cognitive deficits post traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Active bilateral sequential rTMS will lead to an improvement in the symptoms of&#xD;
      post TBI depression, as measured by MADRS scores, when compared to sham treatment Hypothesis&#xD;
      2: Active bilateral sequential rTMS will lead to an improvement in cognitive executive&#xD;
      functioning in individuals post TBI, when compared to sham treatment Hypothesis 3: Active&#xD;
      bilateral sequential rTMS will lead to an improvement in life satisfaction and level of&#xD;
      functioning in individuals post TBI, when compared to sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Experimental Design and Randomisation Procedures The study has been designed to&#xD;
      allow the reporting of results in a manner consistent with the international CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines. The study will involve a 4-week (20 session) randomized double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial with 2 treatment arms conducted at the Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre in Melbourne.&#xD;
      Randomization will occur via the generation of a computer number sequence. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized immediately prior to the commencement of the first treatment session, after the&#xD;
      measurement of bilateral resting motor thresholds with standard means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study phase (phase 1) will involve the 4 week randomized controlled trial conducted&#xD;
      under strict double-blind conditions. Fidelity of the blinding process will be assessed at&#xD;
      the end of this period with patients and raters. Phase 2 will involve the provision of open&#xD;
      label treatment to patients who received sham treatment and wish to receive 'active' rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responders to active treatment from phase 1 or 2 (defined as a 50% reduction in MADRS scores&#xD;
      persisting for 1 week following the end of acute treatment) will enter phase 3, a 6 month&#xD;
      maintenance phase. During this time, a single rTMS treatment session will be provided every&#xD;
      week for 2 months and then every 2 weeks for 4 months. Acute treatment for up to 4 weeks will&#xD;
      be reinstated if there is a persistent (2 week) increase in MADRS score of &gt;25%.&#xD;
