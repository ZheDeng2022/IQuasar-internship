    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is necessary for healthy bones. Vitamin D is made in our skin when we are exposed&#xD;
      to sunlight, but it is also found in foods that we eat and in vitamin pills. Low levels of&#xD;
      vitamin D are common in many groups of people, because we do not get enough sun during the&#xD;
      winter and because we eat few foods that have vitamin D in them. Some foods with vitamin D&#xD;
      are salmon, mackerel, tuna, and fortified milk, which has had vitamin D added to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that nearly all kidney disease patients on dialysis do not have enough vitamin D in&#xD;
      their bodies. We believe this condition can cause muscle weakness, leading to falls and&#xD;
      broken bones. These are common problems for patients who are receiving dialysis. For example,&#xD;
      dialysis patients have a much higher risk of hip fractures (broken hips). However, no formal&#xD;
      research has been done on patients with low vitamin D levels receiving dialysis, to see if&#xD;
      they actually have muscle weakness and related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two goals of this study. First, we want to see if patients on dialysis who have low&#xD;
      vitamin D levels are actually at risk for muscle weakness, muscle pain, and broken bones. We&#xD;
      also want to find out if giving vitamin D pills to these patients will result in better&#xD;
      muscle strength, less muscle pain, and fewer falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will compare vitamin D to placebo. Placebo capsules look exactly like&#xD;
      vitamin D capsules but contain no active ingredients. We use placebos in research studies to&#xD;
      be sure that the study results are due to the study drug and not to other reasons.&#xD;
