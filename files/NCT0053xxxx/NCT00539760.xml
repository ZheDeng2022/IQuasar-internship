             proof distilled spirits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is unwilling to abstain from alcohol consumption from 48 hour prior to&#xD;
             dosing until discharge from the clinic, and for 48 hour prior to all other out-patient&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or any other previous Mycobacterium infection.&#xD;
