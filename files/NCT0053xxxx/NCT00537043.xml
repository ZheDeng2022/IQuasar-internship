  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carvedilol controlled release is a marketed drug to treat high blood pressure. This study is&#xD;
      to compare carvedilol controlled release to carvedilol controlled release plus lisinopril&#xD;
      (fixed-dose combination) after repeat dosing in patients with high blood pressure. This is to&#xD;
      make sure that when carvedilol controlled release is given with lisinopril it acts the same&#xD;
      in the body as when given alone. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the fixed-dose combination.&#xD;
