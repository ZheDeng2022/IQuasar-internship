    <textblock>
      A therapeutic as well as preventive role of probiotics has been suggested from results of&#xD;
      different studies using different probiotics that have been tested, usually lactic acid&#xD;
      producing bacteria such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and streptococcus species. The&#xD;
      supplementation of probiotics to infants may also have a prophylactic effect against acute&#xD;
      diarrhoeal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present proposal, we plan to examine if daily intake of a probiotic beverage, which&#xD;
      includes 15 billion probiotic Lactobacilli, has a beneficial role in protecting children from&#xD;
      infectious diarrhea in Kolkata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the impact of probiotics in the prevention of acute diarrhoeal diseases in&#xD;
           children&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the impact of probiotics on nutrition and growth of the children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in duration, frequency of diarrhoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of pathogens causing diarrhoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examination of faecal microflora&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a double blind randomized controlled field trial involving 4000 children aged&#xD;
      between 1 and 5 years in an urban slum of Kolkata, India. The 4000 children will be&#xD;
      identified through demographic survey. The study will be double blinded where the study arm&#xD;
      will receive Probiotic drink, which includes 15 billion probiotic Lactobacilli, one bottle&#xD;
      (65ml) daily (under supervision of a Health Worker) for 12 weeks and the control arm will&#xD;
      receive a similar drink without the lactobacilli (Nutrient drink) daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done in a ratio of 1:1, i.e., the study arm and control arm will&#xD;
      include 2000 children each. All the children under the study will be visited daily by a&#xD;
      health worker who will supervise intake of Probiotic drink or Nutrient drink by the children.&#xD;
      All the children will be followed up daily for 24weeks for identification of acute diarrhoea&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a double blind randomized controlled field trial involving 4000 children aged&#xD;
      between 1 and 5 years in an urban slum of Kolkata, India. The 4000 children will be&#xD;
      identified through demographic survey. The study will be double blinded where the study arm&#xD;

      All the children will be followed up daily for 24weeks for identification of acute diarrhoea&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slum areas in Kolkata Municipal Corporation with approximately 60,000 populations&#xD;
      (approximate 15,000 families) will be selected from ward 66 to reach a sample size of minimum&#xD;
      4,000 children (1-5 year age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline anthropometric measurements will be taken. The diarrhoeal surveillance will be&#xD;
      through regular household visit by CHW and stool container will be kept at each child's house&#xD;
      to collect stool sample if diarrhoea occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION/ EXCLUSION CRITERION FOR RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS Children of either sex aged&#xD;
      1-5 years will be eligible for screening and parents will give and a written, informed&#xD;
      consent form (Appendix 7) will be required from either of the parents/ guardians of each&#xD;
      participating child. Participating children should be free from any chronic illness and also&#xD;
      any recent illness that may compromise the immune system. In general they will have good&#xD;
      health without known underlying illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with history of diarrhoea in the preceding 2 weeks will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATION OF STUDY AGENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a setup of 5 health outposts and 20 clusters (each cluster with 40 children)&#xD;
      will be approximately of 800 children will be assigned for each health outpost. There will be&#xD;
      20 Community Health Workers (CHW), allocated in each health outpost will be responsible for&#xD;
      administer of one agent code for 40 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical monitor will evaluate adverse events due to intake of the drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from demographic survey (Appendix 4), daily reports and other proforma will be&#xD;
      entered in a PC using suitable software. Data will be scrutinized for accuracy and&#xD;
      consistency before it is entered into the PC. Data will be entered into computers in a&#xD;
      dedicated area located at NICED, using data entry programs specially created for the project&#xD;
      by programmer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the following between the probiotic and nutrient&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Average duration of diarrhoea ii) Severity of the disease iii) Incidence of diarrhoeal&#xD;
      disease iv) Nutritional gain v) Analysis of fecal microflora&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASSURANCE FOR PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from the parent/guardian of each participating&#xD;
      child for the Probiotic and Nutrition studies and for the safety and for permission to&#xD;
      collect feces. The probiotic or nutritional drink is safe and has been administered to infant&#xD;
      children, adults and the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic and nutrient will be stored at 4 to 10ï‚°C. Bottles taken to the field will be&#xD;
      carried in carrying bags. Each box will have a single ice pack, and care will be taken not to&#xD;
      freeze the contents of the bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING, AUDITING, INSPECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsibilities of the investigator(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal and co-investigators at NICED will be responsible for overall supervision and&#xD;
      management of the project. Field investigators and other co-investigators will support the&#xD;
      PI. The PI and co-investigators will supervise all activities at health facilities and in the&#xD;
      sites (demographic surveillance, data collection, and samples collection and transportation).&#xD;
      They will also visit the study sites regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical principle&#xD;
&#xD;
      The justification for using a nutrient in this study is that: 1) no probiotic is currently&#xD;
      recommended for use for prevention of diarrhoeal diseases in public health programs in India&#xD;
      and 2) a valid assessment of probiotic efficacy in Kolkata, which is endemic for diarrhoea,&#xD;
      can only be obtained with use of a nutrient. The nutrient will consist of nutrient without&#xD;
      lactobacillus, which will help for nutritional growth of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both phases of the project, the potential benefits to participants include proper&#xD;
      treatment and referral when needed, as well as free and accurate diagnosis of the causative&#xD;
      agent of diarrhoeal disease. During the trial phase, the probiotic recipients are expected to&#xD;
      benefit from the protection offered by the probiotic against diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential risk to the participants will be minimal, since there is extensive&#xD;
      documentation for the safety of the probiotic to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/benefit ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct benefit the participants may expect from participating in this study will be free&#xD;
      laboratory examination and treatment for diarrhoea diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main benefit of obtaining data on the efficacy of the probiotic in Kolkata will be that&#xD;
      these data will be crucial in guiding the decision of the Indian, and perhaps other&#xD;
      developing country governments as to whether this probiotic will be alternative approach for&#xD;
      growth of the children as well as prevention of diarrhoeal diseases. All recipients of the&#xD;
      probiotic will potentially benefit from the probable protective effects against diarrhoea.&#xD;
      The risks associated with the use of the probiotic or the nutrient and various other study&#xD;
      procedures proposed to be used in this trial are expected to be minimal to nonexistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laws and regulations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in accordance with the principles that govern biomedical research&#xD;
      involving human subjects, specifically the ICMR Ethical Guidelines, the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, and the International Conference on Harmonization's Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines to provide assurance that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial&#xD;
      subjects are protected and that reported results are credible and accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual informed consents from parents of eligible children between 1-5 years old will be&#xD;
      obtained. Consent will be documented by signature or thumbprint of the parents/guardian on&#xD;
      separate sheet. The privacy and confidentiality of all data and information collected from&#xD;
      trial participants will be ensured both during and after the conduct of the trial.&#xD;
      Individuals will not be identified in any reports and publications based on the trial data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional review committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation of the study, the final protocol and the informed consent will require&#xD;
      clearance Scientific Advisory Committee of NICED, Institutional Ethics Committee of NICED,&#xD;
      Health Ministry Screening Committee of the Government of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record retention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator and NICED will keep all trial documents for at least 5 years after&#xD;
      the completion or discontinuation of the study.&#xD;
