    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to study nipple-areolar complex (NAC) sparing mastectomy as an&#xD;
      alternative procedure to the standard skin-sparing mastectomy for women who have breast&#xD;
      cancer or are at high-risk for developing breast cancer. You have been asked to take part in&#xD;
      this study because your treating surgeon feels you are a candidate for skin-sparing&#xD;
      mastectomy and because you want breast reconstruction after surgery. Outcomes that will be&#xD;
      measured include how much nipple sensation can be kept after surgery; how satisfied you are&#xD;
      with how the breast looks after surgery; complication rates; and your quality-of-life.&#xD;

      Operative Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a skin-sparing mastectomy performed with preservation of the NAC. During&#xD;
      surgery, the tissue will be tested while you are still under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAC may be removed completely during the surgery if malignant cells are found during the&#xD;
      testing done during the surgery or if suspicious cells that are not clearly benign cells are&#xD;
      found. This will be up to your doctor. The NAC may also be removed surgically if the primary&#xD;
      tumor is found to be located less than an inch from the border of the NAC, or you are found&#xD;
      to have breast cancer with multiple &quot;center&quot; sites. The nipple can also be removed by itself,&#xD;
      with the areola spared (this is called &quot;areolar-sparing mastectomy&quot;) if your doctor is&#xD;
      worried about its blood supply. These decisions will be made by your pathologist and treating&#xD;
      surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then undergo immediate reconstruction, with either your own tissue, prosthetic&#xD;
      tissue, or a combination of the two. This is up to your plastic surgeon. You will have met&#xD;
      with your plastic surgeon before surgery to discuss the best reconstructive method for you,&#xD;
      and you will be given an informed consent to sign at that time with details about the method&#xD;
      you decide to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breast tissue under the NAC will be biopsied and tested after your surgery. After that&#xD;
      tissue has been tested, a second surgery may be needed if cancer cells are found, the tumor&#xD;
      is too close to the NAC, or it has more than 1 &quot;center&quot; site. You will have the whole NAC&#xD;
      removed in a separate operation. The place where the NAC was removed will be repaired by a&#xD;
      plastic surgeon, who will choose the best method to get an acceptable cosmetic result. This&#xD;
      may involve one or more extra surgeries, and you will be given separate informed consent&#xD;
      documents to sign for each surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, 4 sensory tests will be conducted on both breasts&#xD;
      using a variety of hand-held devices. These tests are painless and will be performed at&#xD;
      regularly scheduled follow-up visits in clinic. They will measure nipple and areolar&#xD;
      sensitivity, as well as nipple erectibility. The tests will involve the placement of fibers&#xD;
      of various thicknesses and blunt metal probes on the skin of your nipple and areola. All&#xD;
      tests will be performed once before the surgery and then at about 3 months, 6 months, and 1&#xD;
      year after surgery, at your follow-up clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your breasts will be photographed at your 6-month and 1-year follow-up visits after surgery.&#xD;
      At these visits, you will look at those photographs to decide how satisfied you are with how&#xD;
      the breasts look. Two (2) plastic surgeons not directly involved in your surgery will also&#xD;
      study those photographs by themselves and fill out a similar questionnaire rating their&#xD;
      impression of the results of your plastic surgery. These results will not be made available&#xD;
      to you. You will also complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaires within 1 month of your&#xD;
      surgery, and then at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after surgery (+/- 1&#xD;
      month). The questionnaires will ask questions about nipple sensation, cosmetic outcomes,&#xD;
      complications, and your quality of life. The questionnaires will take about 30 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 37 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
