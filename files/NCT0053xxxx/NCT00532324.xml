      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is an emerging&#xD;
      pathogen of the 21st century whose incidence as a cause of local and invasive infections has&#xD;
      significantly increased, especially in previously healthy term and near term newborns. The&#xD;
      etiology of the increasing incidence of infection in previously healthy term and near-term&#xD;
      newborns remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The incidence of previously healthy newborns infected with CA-MRSA skin &amp; soft tissue&#xD;
           (SSTI) and invasive infections is higher in those born to mothers colonized with&#xD;
           CA-MRSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnant women colonized with CA-MRSA are at higher risk for post-partum infection with&#xD;
           this organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the incidence of nasal and vaginal colonization with CA-MRSA in pregnant&#xD;
           women and determine the genetic similarities of these strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study CA-MRSA transmission dynamics and evaluate the incidence of SSTI and invasive&#xD;
           infections in newborns born to S. aureus colonized mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the efficacy of attempted decolonization in CA-MRSA colonized mothers in&#xD;
           decreasing the incidence of transmission and development of SSTI and invasive infections&#xD;
           in their infants during the first month of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the epidemiology of the transmission dynamics of CA-MRSA in previously healthy&#xD;
      newborns will provide important information to support the development of strategies aimed at&#xD;
      the interruption of transmission and prevention of infection caused by CA-MRSA in newborns,&#xD;
      as well as in pregnant women. This will also allow for the development of infection control&#xD;
      strategies to prevent the spread of this organism among post-partum units and nurseries.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is an emerging&#xD;
      pathogen of the 21st century whose incidence as a cause of local and invasive infections has&#xD;
      significantly increased, especially in previously healthy term and near term neonates where&#xD;
      it may be associated with high morbidity and mortality(1, 2, 3). The etiology for this&#xD;
      increase remains unclear, but may be a consequence of perinatal or postnatal acquisition via&#xD;
      maternal transmission through skin, breast milk, or vaginal colonization(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major goals of our study are: to determine the incidence of pregnant women who are&#xD;
      colonized with CA-MRSA, gain a better understanding of the transmission dynamics of this&#xD;
      organism between the mother and the newborn infant, and to develop strategies for the&#xD;
      prevention of transmission, spread and infection with this organism in both these&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This staged study is a collaborative effort between investigators from the Children's&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital Division of Infectious Diseases, Northwestern Memorial Hospital Department&#xD;
      of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Division of Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases. Collaboration across multiple specialties provides strength to the study by&#xD;
      allowing the investigators to address multiple issues that are pertinent to both the care of&#xD;
      pregnant mothers and newborn infants in the inpatient and outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The incidence of previously healthy term and near-term neonates infected with CA-MRSA skin&#xD;
      &amp; soft tissue (SSTI) and invasive infections is higher in those born to mothers vaginally&#xD;
      and/or nasally colonized with CA-MRSA and, 2. Pregnant women vaginally and/or nasally&#xD;
      colonized with CA-MRSA are at higher risk for post-partum infection with this organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the incidence of nasal and vaginal colonization with CA-MRSA in pregnant&#xD;
           women and determine the clonality of these strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study CA-MRSA transmission dynamics and evaluate the incidence of SSTI and invasive&#xD;
           infections in term and near-term newborns born to S. aureus vaginal and/or nasal&#xD;
           colonized mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the efficacy of attempted decolonization in CA-MRSA colonized mothers in&#xD;
           decreasing the incidence of transmission and development of SSTI and invasive infections&#xD;
           in their infants during the first month of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vaginal and anterior nasal cultures will be obtained prospectively over several months&#xD;
           from pregnant women who obtain their prenatal care through Obstetrical practices at&#xD;
           Prentice Women's Hospital and Maternity Center of Northwestern Memorial Hospital during&#xD;
           the time of GBS screening at 34-36 weeks gestation. Together, these practices account&#xD;
           for 300-500 deliveries per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cultures will be plated on blood agar and incubated at 37oC for 48 hours. S. aureus&#xD;
           strains will be identified by colony morphology and latex agglutination. MRSA isolates&#xD;
           will be identified by PCR or latex agglutination for penicillin binding protein 2a by&#xD;
           detecting the mecA gene and clonality by PFGE. PCR testing will then be used to identify&#xD;
           strains carrying the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin gene as a marker of virulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In a prospective case-control cohort study, newborns born to CA-MRSA colonized mothers&#xD;
           will have anterior nares cultures for S. aureus obtained at birth and followed for the&#xD;
           development of SSTI and invasive infections for one month. Samples positive for MRSA&#xD;
           will be tested for similarities to maternal isolates through methods described above.&#xD;
           The newborn incidence of MRSA infection will be compared between those born to&#xD;
           non-colonized mothers and those born to colonized mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In further stages of this study, women found to be nasally and/or vaginally colonized&#xD;
           with CA-MRSA will be randomized to receive postpartum, either: 1) attempted&#xD;
           decolonization with intranasal mupirocin with or without diluted chlorhexidine or Clorox&#xD;
           baths or, 2) no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the epidemiology of the transmission dynamics of CA-MRSA in previously healthy&#xD;
      neonates will provide important information to support the development of strategies aimed at&#xD;
      the interruption of transmission and prevention of infection caused by CA-MRSA in this&#xD;
      patient population, as well as in pregnant women. This will also allow for the development of&#xD;
      infection control strategies in the hospital setting to prevent the spread of this organism&#xD;
      among post-partum units and nurseries.&#xD;
