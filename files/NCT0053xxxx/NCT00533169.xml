    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of the drug&#xD;
      ZactimaTM (ZD6474) in patients with neuroblastoma or medulloblastoma that has gotten worse,&#xD;
      has come back, or has not responded to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, dose-limiting toxicities, and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of ZD6474, alone in children with medulloblastoma, and alone in combination with&#xD;
      retinoic acid, in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess progression-free survival (PFS) and objective tumor response rates in children&#xD;
      with relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma treated with ZD6474 +/-&#xD;
      retinoic acid in the context of a Phase I trial.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ZD6474 is a drug that slows down the function of proteins in tumor cells called protein&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine kinases normally cause tumor cells to grow. It is thought to have&#xD;
      anti-cancer effects when given with or without other chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin has been shown to help stop the growth of neuroblastoma cells. It helps cells&#xD;
      look more normal and grow more slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level and Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 parts in the study. If you have medulloblastoma, you will be assigned to Part&#xD;
      A. If you have neuroblastoma, you will be assigned to Part A, Part B, or Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, participants will receive the study drug ZD6474 alone. In the Part B portion,&#xD;
      participants will receive ZD6474 along with isotretinoin. In Part C, an additional number of&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled and will receive ZD6474 along with isotretinoin at the highest&#xD;
      dose level that was found in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Part A will take ZD6474 daily by mouth in the form of pills or liquid for 28&#xD;
      days. This 28-day period is called a study &quot;cycle.&quot; In Part A, the study drug will be given&#xD;
      at different doses. Three (3) participants will be enrolled in each dose level. New groups&#xD;
      will continue to be enrolled at higher doses until intolerable side effects are seen. If you&#xD;
      are assigned to Part A, the dose assigned to you will depend on the number of participants&#xD;
      that have been enrolled before you and the side effects they may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose of ZD6474 is found, participants will then begin enrolling in&#xD;
      Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Part B will take ZD6474 daily by mouth in the form of pills or liquid on Days&#xD;
      2-28 of each 28-day cycle. Participants will also take isotretinoin by mouth 2 times a day&#xD;
      every day for 2 weeks in a row, at some point during each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part C, participants will follow the same schedule as in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Diary (all participants):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a &quot;diary&quot; to record when you take the study drugs. You will need to bring&#xD;
      the diary with you to each study visit. At each visit, you will also be asked about any side&#xD;
      effects that you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits (all participants):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 2 months of the study, you will have a study visit weekly. After the first 2&#xD;
      months, you will have study visits at least 1 time a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Before each&#xD;
           cycle, some of the blood collection will be used for blood clotting tests. Once a month,&#xD;
           this routine blood/urine test will include a pregnancy test for women who are able to&#xD;
           have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have been able to&#xD;
           maintain a healthy diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before every other cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have a CT scan, MRI scan, and/or bone scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have bone marrow aspirations and a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have neuroblastoma, you may have an MIBG scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have neuroblastoma, urine will be collected to test your HVA and VMA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during Weeks 1, 2, 4, 9, 13, and then up to 7 days before every other cycle, you&#xD;
      will have ECGs to make sure that your heart remains healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each cycle, urine will be collected for routine tests and you will have an ECHO to&#xD;
      make sure that your heart remains healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra blood samples will be drawn during the study for pharmacokinetic (PK) test. PK tests&#xD;
      are used to measure the amount of study drug in the blood. The amount of blood draw will be&#xD;
      about 1/2 teaspoon each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for PK testing at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before and 6 hours after taking ZD6474&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 2, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1 before you take ZD6474&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 before you take ZD6474&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 4, 6, and 8 before taking ZD6474&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are 1 of the first 3 participants enrolled in the study, blood will be drawn at 2, 4,&#xD;
      6, and 8 or 12 and 24 hours after the very first dose during Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early&#xD;
      if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-Of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed. If any tests or procedure has been performed in the&#xD;
      last month, it will not be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have a CT scan, MRI scan, and/or a bone scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have bone marrow aspirations and a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have neuroblastoma, you will have an MIBG scan to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have neuroblastoma, urine will be collected to test your HVA and VMA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up visits every month once you are off study. These visits will continue&#xD;
      indefinitely. At these visits, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. ZD6474 is FDA approved for the treatment of follicular,&#xD;
      medullary, anaplastic, and locally advanced and metastatic papillary thyroid cancer.&#xD;
      Isotretinoin is FDA approved for acne. The use of these drugs for this disease and the use of&#xD;
      the drugs together is investigational. Up to 66 patients will take part in this study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

             upon completion of frontline therapy must undergo a biopsy to document presence of&#xD;
             viable neuroblastoma or medulloblastoma. If only active target lesion was radiated of&#xD;
             patients with stable disease, biopsy must be done at least 4 weeks after radiation was&#xD;
             completed and must demonstrate viable tumor, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. (Con't # 3): Evaluable disease documented by bone marrow obtained prior to study entry&#xD;
