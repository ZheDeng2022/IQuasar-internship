      Primary objective is to evaluate the response rates and clinical benefits of letrozole +&#xD;
      goserelin in premenopausal patients versus letrozole alone in postmenopausal patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer as first line hormonal therapy&#xD;

      The sites of estrogen synthesis are the ovaries of premenopausal women and extragonadal sites&#xD;
      such as fat, muscle, and skin, normal breast stromal cell and breast tumor tissue. After&#xD;
      ovarian failure, estrogen is synthesized in peripheral tissues such as fat and muscles and&#xD;
      this peripheral aromatization in postmenopausal women is almost completely inhibited by&#xD;
      single-agent administration of the third generation inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole and&#xD;
      exemestane etc). In contrast, there is a barrier to using aromatase inhibitors as monotherapy&#xD;
      in premenopausal women. First, high level of androstenedione competes initially with the&#xD;
      inhibitors as substrate for the enzyme complex. Second, suppression of estrogen results in a&#xD;
      reflex increase in gonadotrophin levels, provoking an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome,&#xD;
      which causes a steep increase of aromatase in the ovary and in turn overcomes the blockade by&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of combination therapy regimen of a gonadotropins-releasing hormone (GnRH)&#xD;
      agonist such as goserelin plus aromatase inhibitor in premenopausal patient is that, having&#xD;
      effectively rendered the patients postmenopausal with the use of goserelin, the peripheral E2&#xD;
      production can be inhibited by aromatase inhibitor. Goserelin alone has been shown to produce&#xD;
      castrate level of estradiol (E2) and response rates similar to oophorectomy in premenopausal&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective aromatase inhibitors including letrozole have now become the standard second-line&#xD;
      endocrine therapy, after the failure of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitor is now challenged as first-line endocrine therapy for&#xD;
      hormone-sensitive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian expression of aromatase is regulated by gonadotropins, LH and FSH. Theoretically, the&#xD;
      combination of a GnRH analogue and an aromatase inhibitor can induce a complete estrogen&#xD;
      blockade in premenopausal breast cancer patients. Although combination of goserelin and&#xD;
      tamoxifen is an established therapeutic option in premenopausal patients with breast cancer,&#xD;
      from the results of earlier studies comparing tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors as first&#xD;
      line therapy in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer, it can be hypothesized&#xD;
      that letrozole may accomplish better clinical results than tamoxifen as a first line hormonal&#xD;
      therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer who become menopause by GnRH agonist as&#xD;
      first line hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing this combination therapy would be particularly useful since more than 50% of&#xD;
      breast cancers are developed in less than 50 years old women in Korea. Therefore, we are&#xD;
      going to evaluate the clinical and endocrine results of first-line goserelin plus letrozole&#xD;
      in premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer with first-line letrozole alone in&#xD;
      postmenopausal patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, CYP19 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in tumor tissue was shown to be&#xD;
      associated with the efficacy of aromatase inhibitor. In a study, when 67 postmenopausal&#xD;
      patients with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer were treated with letrozole,&#xD;
      median TTP was significantly longer in patients with the rs4646 variant of intratumoral&#xD;
      CYP19, a SNP in 3'-UTR, compared with normal CYP19 (17.2 months versus 6.4 months; P=0.02).&#xD;
      This result suggests the importance of both the local aromatase activity and the tumor&#xD;
      specific genetic alterations in the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to recently, tumor-specific genetic markers have been assessed primarily in tumor&#xD;
      biopsies. However, in advanced stage patients, tumor tissues are often unavailable, since&#xD;
      surgery is not always performed or in some cases even the biopsy samples cannot be obtained,&#xD;
      which limits the use of tumor tissue for genetic assessment. The detection of tumor specific&#xD;
      genetic alterations in cancer patients at distant sites from the tumor, such as in blood,&#xD;
      would provide a useful predictor for the efficacy to treatment. Some of the tumor genetic&#xD;
      alterations have been observed in extracellular circulating DNA in blood samples of breast&#xD;
      cancer patients, including alterations in microsatellites, LOH, TP53 gene mutations and so&#xD;
      on.&#xD;
