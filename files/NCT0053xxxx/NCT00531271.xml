&#xD;
          1. Concurrent therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             etc) for breast cancer. Bisphosphonates are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Parenchymal brain metastases, unless documented to be clinically and radiographically&#xD;
             stable for at least 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
