  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) experience significant functional limitations&#xD;
      due to ischemic symptoms (claudication) and are at high risk for CVD morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      resulting from untreated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and aggressive&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. The overall Goal of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to examine&#xD;
      the synergistic effect of a multifactor risk reduction on walking distance, blood flow and&#xD;
      quality of life in 300 patients with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will compare the effects of 24 months of a novel, yet well-tested multiple&#xD;
      risk factor reduction program, the Health Education and Risk Reduction Training (HEAR2T)&#xD;
      Program for PAD versus enhanced standard care on: 1) symptom limited walking distance as&#xD;
      assessed by treadmill exercise testing and walking impairment questionnaire; 2) endothelial&#xD;
      function as measured by flow mediated vasodilation (FMVD) via brachial artery ultrasound. We&#xD;
      will also explore the association between FMVD and decreased oxidative stress (as measured by&#xD;
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity and urinary isoprostanes) and reduced degradation of&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO) and/or increased NO biosynthesis (as measured by urine nitrogen oxide,&#xD;
      plasma nitrogen oxide, plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine, plasma, urine and platelet cyclic&#xD;
      GMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses examine the association between reducing CVD risk factors, improved&#xD;
      endothelial function, increased walking distance, improved quality of life and number of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome abnormalities in PAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. This study will contribute to evidence on the efficacy of multiple risk factor&#xD;
      reduction on improving physical function and quality of life in the understudied, elderly PAD&#xD;
      patient. This study will also provide preliminary evidence for the biological basis for the&#xD;
      efficacy of multifactor risk reduction in restoring vascular homeostasis, critical because of&#xD;
      its role in antiatherogenesis and maintaining vasoreactivity, both necessary for slowing the&#xD;
      progression of atherosclerosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects eligible for this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 50 years or older with one or more CVD risk factor&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. PAD secondary to atherosclerosis with significant claudication&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Claudication is defined as pain, ache, cramp, numbness or severe fatigue of muscles of&#xD;
             one or both lower extremities, reproducibly provoked by walking causing the patient to&#xD;
             slow or stop walking pace&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt; 0.90&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In diabetics ABI is inaccurate, in which case, we will substitute toe pressures &lt; 60&#xD;
             mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ABI one minute after exercise is at least 20% lower than index leg resting ABI&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Capable of walking at least 50 feet&#xD;
