  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile of oral iron supplementation&#xD;
      (OIS) with Sprinkles in a pediatric population with high prevalence of Iron deficiency (ID)&#xD;
      and moderate or severe malnutrition (MSM); the efficacy profile will also be investigated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency (ID) affects many children in developing countries. Anemia and impaired brain&#xD;
      development are its most significant consequences. These may be prevented by giving oral iron&#xD;
      supplements (OIS), such as Sprinkles. ID treatment was controversial because high dose&#xD;
      parenteral iron therapy is strongly associated with severe infections when given to severely&#xD;
      malnourished children. Many studies have since demonstrated the safety of low dose OIS. WHO&#xD;
      guidelines reflect this finding: population-wide iron supplementation campaign (PWISC),&#xD;
      without prior screening, is recommended when ID prevalence is ≥ 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a gap in the safety evidence has been identified: children with moderate or severe&#xD;
      malnutrition (MSM) are strikingly absent from the studies performed to date to investigate&#xD;
      the link between OIS and infectious morbidities. In this context, PWISC may have unrecognized&#xD;
      deleterious effects when the prevalence of MSM is high, since safety is assumed, but&#xD;
      incorrectly extrapolated from available evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to emphasize an additional concern with regards to safety studies published thus far:&#xD;
      all were designed as superiority trials. In this context, it is statistically incorrect to&#xD;
      conclude that failure to show a significant difference between iron and placebo means that&#xD;
      their respective side-effect profiles are similar.&#xD;
