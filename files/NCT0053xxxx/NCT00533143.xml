    <textblock>
      The occurrence of acute respiratory failure (ARF) is often seen by oncologists as a terminal&#xD;
      phase of the disease, this view being based on studies reporting limited survival at&#xD;
      considerable costs in such patients. A large proportion of cancer patients with severe&#xD;
      respiratory failure are denied admission to an ICU because intensive care specialists are&#xD;
      aware that intubation and mechanical ventilation are both strong predictors of mortality in&#xD;
      critically ill cancer patients. This holds particularly true in the subset of patients who&#xD;
      are not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy because of the advanced stage of their&#xD;
      disease, and who are also not affected by an episode of ARF, related to a reversible cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients often receive oxygen therapy and morphine in an attempt to improve oxygenation&#xD;
      and/or relieve the ensuing dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is now the first line treatment of ARF in selected&#xD;
      populations (e.g., those with COPD) and has been used sporadically as a potential treatment&#xD;
      of acute respiratory failure in patients with a &quot;do-not-intubate&quot; order. The International&#xD;
      Consensus Conference on Intensive Care Medicine stated that &quot;the use of NIV may be justified&#xD;
      in selected patients who are &quot;not to be intubated&quot; and may provide patient comfort and&#xD;
      facilitate physician-patient interaction.&quot; &quot;Early&quot; NIV has been successfully used so far in&#xD;
      cancer patients only to prevent intubation among those with hematologic malignancies, while a&#xD;
      pilot study has assessed the feasibility of NIV also as a &quot;palliative&quot; treatment of end-stage&#xD;
      solid cancer patients. So far we are lacking data about the &quot;pure palliative&quot; effects of&#xD;
      NIV,in patients with end-stage solid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicenter randomised study will be to evaluate on a large scale the&#xD;
      feasibility, clinical efficacy and impact on quality of life and dyspnea of NIV versus&#xD;
      standard medical in patients with respiratory failure, not related to a reversible cause, and&#xD;
      solid cancer needing palliative care treatment.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of ARF is often seen by oncologists as a terminal phase of the disease, this&#xD;
      view being based on studies reporting limited survival at considerable costs in such patients&#xD;
      (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). A large proportion of cancer patients with severe respiratory failure are&#xD;
      denied admission to an ICU because intensive care specialists are aware that intubation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation are both strong predictors of mortality in critically ill cancer&#xD;
      patients (1, 3, 5, 7). This holds particularly true in the subset of patients who are not&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy because of the advanced stage of their disease, and&#xD;
      who are also not affected by an episode of ARF, related to a reversible cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients often receive oxygen therapy and morphine in an attempt to improve oxygenation&#xD;
      and/or relief the ensuing dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is now the first line treatment of ARF in selected&#xD;
      populations (e.g. those with COPD) (8) and has been used sporadically as a potential&#xD;
      treatment of acute respiratory failure in patients with a &quot;do-not-intubate&quot; order (9). The&#xD;
      International Consensus Conference on Intensive Care Medicine stated that &quot;the use of NIV may&#xD;
      be justified in selected patients who are &quot;not to be intubated&quot; and may provide patient&#xD;
      comfort and facilitate physician-patient interaction&quot; (8). &quot;Early&quot; NIV has been successfully&#xD;
      used so far in cancer patients only to prevent intubation among those with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies (10), while a pilot study has assessed the feasibility of NIV also as a&#xD;
      &quot;palliative&quot; treatment of end-stage solid cancer patients (11). So far we are lacking data&#xD;
      about the &quot;pure palliative&quot; effects of NIV,in patients with end-stage solid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. The aim of this multicenter randomised study will be to evaluate on a large scale the&#xD;
      feasibility, clinical efficacy and impact on quality of life and dyspnea of NIV vs standard&#xD;
      medical in patients with respiratory failure, not related to a reversible cause, and solid&#xD;
      cancer needing palliative care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Multicenter randomised study. The sample size has been estimated on about 50&#xD;
      patients for each group (i.e. hypercapnic and hypoxic ARF, with different randomisation) ,&#xD;
      TOTAL= 200 pts based on the survival rate of cancer patients with acute respiratory failure&#xD;
      and DNR order (18%) (2) versus that of patients treated with NIV in a pilot study (57%) (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive separate random sequence according to the degree of PaCO2. Methods&#xD;
      Consecutive solid cancer patients with ARF, in which palliative treatment is the only one&#xD;
      indicated, and: 1) have signed or expressed a DNI order or 2) judged by the attending&#xD;
      physician having &lt; 6 months or life expectancy (Mc Crabe index= class 3-4) or PPI &gt; 5&#xD;
      (Palliative Prognostic Index) and not deserve to be intubated by a &quot;blind&quot; ICU physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief trial lasting &lt; 5 minutes will be performed before randomization using either NIV or&#xD;
      Venturi mask to assess the willing of the patient to be enroll in the protocol (since they&#xD;
      are not familiar with both techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major criteria for enrollment into the study were one of the following: 1) PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;&#xD;
      250 + one of the two following: 1) dyspnea with recruitment of the accessory muscles and/or&#xD;
      abdominal muscles recruitment and 2) respiratory rate &gt; 30 b/ min. Hypercapnia per se is not&#xD;
      a criteria of inclusion, but it is not an exclusion criteria if chronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: potentially reversible causes of exacerbation such as (CPE,&#xD;
      pneumonia or exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders) coma, refusal of treatment,&#xD;
      inability to protect the airways, an agitated or uncooperative patient, anatomical&#xD;
      abnormalities interfering with mask fit, uncontrolled cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias,&#xD;
      failure of more than two organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIV settings. The positive end-expiratory pressure initially set at 5 cm H2O and could be&#xD;
      increased by 1 cm H2O until a brisk increase in oxygen saturation (SaO2) is observed, whereas&#xD;
      the inspiratory pressure support is initially set at 10 cm H2O and then increased in&#xD;
      increments of 2 cm H2O up to the maximum tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure the inspiratory pressure is adjusted&#xD;
      according to the patient's tolerance, with the external PEEP not exceeding 6 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case both settings are aimed to achieve a respiratory rate &lt; 25 breaths/min, no&#xD;
      evident sign of wasted respiratory efforts on the flow trace, expired VT &gt; 6 mL/kg and &lt; 10&#xD;
      mL/kg and satisfactory gas exchange (i.e. SaO2 &gt; 90%, with pH &gt; 7.35). The inspiratory&#xD;
      trigger is set at the minimal level to avoid auto-triggering or that delivered by default by&#xD;
      the ventilator, while the initial pressurization rate was adjusted according to subjective&#xD;
      comfort. The fractional concentration of oxygen is such to achieve an SaO2 &gt; 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Medical Therapy The usual standard of care. Sedatives and morphine could be&#xD;
      administrated, but the dosage should be recorded in a data sheet (se data base)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, sex, chronic health care status measured using the McCrabe index, the number of&#xD;
           co-morbid conditions, and the SAPS II index (Simplified Acute Physiology Score).&#xD;
           Neurological status was assessed by the Kelly and Matthay scale, which is specifically&#xD;
           designed for respiratory patients and Glasgow coma scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causes of ARF (if apparent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type and cancer status before respiratory failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial blood was withdrawn from a radial artery at baseline and at fixed intervals&#xD;
           (see protocol) and analyzed immediately (ABL 300 and ABL 625 Radiometer, Copenhagen,&#xD;
           Denmark)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breathing frequency and hemodynamic variables (i.e. heart rate and blood pressure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyspnea score measured with a modified Borg scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom Distress Scale (at enrollment and at discharge) as a surrogate of QoL &quot;easy&quot;&#xD;
           measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Types and dosages of sedatives or morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total days on NIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total days of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality at hospital discharge, at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causes of death ABG, respiratory rate and hemodynamic variables, Kelly score, Glasgow&#xD;
           scale, PPI, Mc Cabe and dyspnea will be recorded at fixed intervals: baseline (T0), 1 h&#xD;
           after beginning the treatment (T1), after 3 h (T2), after 24 h (T3), after 48 h (T4) and&#xD;
           at discharge from the hospital (T5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAPS II score is recorded at the end of the first day of admission. QoL questionnaire&#xD;
      will be recorded at enrollment and hospital discharge Primary outcomes of the study were:&#xD;
      hospital death, treatment failure, use of morphine or other sedatives and dyspnea and QoL&#xD;
      scores. Treatment failure will be considered the &quot;theoretical need of intubation&quot;= MEET the&#xD;
      INTUBATION CRITERIA defined as: 1) intolerance to NIV (only NIV group clearly) 2) no changes&#xD;
      or worsening of ABG after 2 h of ventilation (pH &lt; 7.35 or 20% decrease in PaO2/FiO2 ratio)&#xD;
      3) alteration of neurological status (1 point higher than admission in the Kelly score) 4)&#xD;
      gasping for air or come. Secondary outcomes were: 6-month and 12-month mortality, the&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay, changes of some physiological variables over time (i.e. ABG,&#xD;
      respiratory rate) and QoL.&#xD;
