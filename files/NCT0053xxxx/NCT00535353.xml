      RATIONALE: AZD2281 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving AZD2281 together with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of AZD2281 and&#xD;
      irinotecan in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of AZD2281 and irinotecan hydrochloride in&#xD;
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety, tolerability, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicities, and&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the correlation, if any, between the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
           this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in patients with&#xD;
           measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the pharmacodynamic activity of this regimen by establishing its effects&#xD;
           in tumor biopsies, cheek swabs, and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the correlation, if any, between patients with tumors demonstrating&#xD;
           microsatellite instability and antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the impact of common genetic polymorphisms of genes of relevant pathways&#xD;
           (drug metabolism, DNA repair, and apoptosis) on outcome and toxicity as well as other&#xD;
           pharmacodynamic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of AZD2281 and irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part I: Patients receive oral AZD2281 twice a day on days -7 to 21 in course 1 and on&#xD;
           days 1-21 in all subsequent courses. Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV&#xD;
           over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days (course 1 is 28 days) until the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose is determined in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part II: Patients then receive oral AZD2281 once daily on days 1-5 and irinotecan&#xD;
           hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 3 at the maximum tolerated dose determined in&#xD;
           Part I. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo cheek swabs, tumor tissue, and blood sample collection periodically for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
