&#xD;
          1. Provide signed and dated informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adults, 18 years of age or older of either gender and of any race. Female patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential MUST be nonpregnant (confirmed by negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test), nonlactating, and must be willing to practice reliable birth control measures&#xD;
             during and for at least 28 days after treatment with study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must exhibit clinical signs/symptoms and radiographic appearance of pneumonia:&#xD;
             presence of new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph; fever (oral &gt;38.0 degree&#xD;
             C/100.4 degree F); and at least one of the following signs and symptoms consistent&#xD;
             with the diagnosis of acute bacterial pneumonia: acute onset, chills, chest&#xD;
             pain/dyspnea, cough, or sputum production.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pneumonia which: requires hospitalization; requires IV antibiotic therapy; anticipated&#xD;
             &gt;=5 days IV therapy; and (for Grade II) O2 saturation &lt;90% and PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg on room&#xD;
             air.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Provide a suitable sputum specimen for Gram's-stain and culture. If expectorated&#xD;
             sputum or transtracheal aspirate: &gt;10 lancet-shaped Gram-positive&#xD;
             diplococci/oil-immersion field (1000x); &lt;10 squamous epithelial cells/low-power field&#xD;
             (100x); &gt;25 leukocytes/low-power field (100x).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. An elevated total peripheral white blood cell count (WBC &gt;10,000/mm3); or &gt;15%&#xD;
             immature neutrophils (bands), regardless of total peripheral white count; or&#xD;
             leukopenia with total WBC &lt;4500/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to participate in this study and to complete all follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Grade I pneumonia risk classification, or Grade II with O2 saturation &gt;90% on room air&#xD;
             and/or PaO2 &gt;60 mmHg on room air (based on Fine Score; Attachment 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with Grade V pneumonia (based on Fine Score; Attachment 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Respiratory failure without mechanical ventilatory support (i.e., PaO2 / FiO2 &lt;200),&#xD;
             or underlying lung disease precluding interpretation of study results (e.g., cystic&#xD;
             fibrosis, lung cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Loculated empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Severe shock (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg for &gt;30 minutes not corrected by fluid&#xD;
             bolus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinical evidence of bacterial meningitis (based on lumbar puncture results).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min); hepatic dysfunction&#xD;
             (ALT/AST more than 3 times the upper limit of normal or bilirubin &gt;=2.0 mg/dL); or&#xD;
             clinical or histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis or another form of chronic liver&#xD;
             disease, such as chronic active hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Moribund clinical condition: high likelihood of death during the first 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who are severely immunocompromised due to underlying disease or exogenous&#xD;
             therapies, CD4 counts &lt;100/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Inability to tolerate ceftriaxone or history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics&#xD;
             (history of rash alone will not exclude a patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any individual previously treated with a potentially effective anti-infective agent&#xD;
             for &gt;=24 hours immediately prior to enrollment, or prior treatment with any&#xD;
             investigational drug (including experimental biologic agents) in previous 30 days or&#xD;
             prior therapy with daptomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who must continue HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy (e.g., simvastatin,&#xD;
             lovastatin, etc) during the study treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of &gt;0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for &gt;1 week preceding enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Anticipation that a second systemic antibiotic will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Induction chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment (or exogenous therapies&#xD;
             which are anticipated to result in PMN counts of &lt;200 mm3 during Treatment Phase), or&#xD;
             patients with severe neutropenia (&lt;200 PMN cells/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients considered unreliable to return for visits or to comply with study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Functionally or surgically asplenic (e.g., sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Neoplastic disease, except basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin that was&#xD;
             active at the time of enrollment or within 1 year prior to enrollment.&#xD;
