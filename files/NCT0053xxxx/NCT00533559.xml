  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increase of plasma free fatty acids impairs insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      thereby playing an important role in causing type 2 diabetes. Lipotoxicity plays an important&#xD;
      role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to fasting hyperglycemia and coversion&#xD;
      to frank type 2 diabetes. A recent publication in the journal Science showed that buphenyl,&#xD;
      when given to obese diabetic mice, resulted in normalization of hyperglycemia, restoration of&#xD;
      systemic insulin sensitivity, resolution of fatty liver disease and inhancement of insulin&#xD;
      action in liver, muscle and adipose tissue. the mechanism of action is believed to be due to&#xD;
      reduction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Buphenyl is currently approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of rare inherited disorders of the urea cycle. We plan to administer Buphenyl&#xD;
      orally to humans at a dose far lower than that used for the treatment of urea cycle disorders&#xD;
      for 2 weeks prior to the testing of pancreatic function. One potential mechanism whereby&#xD;
      chromically elevated plasma FFAs and glucose impairment beta cell function and insuln&#xD;
      sensitivity is by ER stress and this can be prevented by administeration of buphenyl.&#xD;

      Each subject will undergo 4 studies, 4 weeks apart. Each study will consist of a 2 week&#xD;
      treatment period with either Buphenyl or placebo, followed by 48 hour hospital stay to test&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. The four studies are as follows: 1. 2-week placebo&#xD;
      tablets followed by in hospital 48-hour infusion of normal saline prior to testing of insulin&#xD;
      secretion and insulin sensitivity (CONTROL study), 2. 2-week placebo treatment followed by 48&#xD;
      hour infusion of intralipid and heparin to raise plasma free fatty acids 2-fold prior to&#xD;
      testing of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (PLACEBO-INTRALIPID+HEPARIN study), 3.&#xD;
      2-week Buphenyl treatment followed by 48-hr infusion of intralipid and heparin to raise&#xD;
      plasma free fatty acids 2-fold prior to testing of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (BUPOHENYL+INTRALIPID+HEPARIN study), 4. 2-week Buphenyl treatment followed by 48-hr infusion&#xD;
      of normal saline prior to testing of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (BUPHENYL+SALINE study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For two weeks prior to each admission to hospital and during each hospital admission subjects&#xD;
      will ingest 5 tablets 3 times per day with meals (total of 15 tablets per day). For two of&#xD;
      the 4 studies the tablet will contain Buphenyl (total of 15 tablets per day, each tablet of&#xD;
      Buphenyl contains 500mg, total 7.5grams per day), whereas for the other two studies the&#xD;
      tablet will be a placebo, containing no active ingredient. The study will be conducted as a&#xD;
      single blind study, with the subject not knowing whether they are receiving a placebo or&#xD;
      biphenyl. For safety reasons and since it will not influence the results of this study it&#xD;
      will not be conducted as a double blind study. On each of four occasions, 4 weeks apart,&#xD;
      after taking the tablets for 2 weeks, the subject will fast overnight for 12-hours prior to&#xD;
      their admission to the Toronto General Hospital metabolic research ward for 48 hours to&#xD;
      undergo testing as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning they are admitted an intravenous (iv) line will be placed in a superficial&#xD;
      vein (under the skin) of each forearm (2 iv's, one iv in each arm). These intravenous lines&#xD;
      will be used for blood sampling at regular intervals throughout the study and to infuse&#xD;
      solutions. Blood samples will be drawn painlessly through the IV at timed intervals for the&#xD;
      first two days. The total amount of blood to be taken for each of the three study periods&#xD;
      will be less than 250 ml per visit i.e. less than the amount given when donating blood (a&#xD;
      total amount of 1,000 ml over the entire study, which usually takes about 4 months to&#xD;
      complete). During two of the four admissions to hospital they will receive a 48-hour infusion&#xD;
      of intralipid (40 ml/hr of a 20% fat solution) and Heparin (250U/hr)) to raise plasma FFAs&#xD;
      approximately 2-fold as we have previously described (8;54) whereas on the two other&#xD;
      occasions they will receive an infusion of saline (salt water) for 48 hours in hospital.&#xD;
      Heparin is stimulates an important enzyme involved in the breakdown of fat particles&#xD;
      (lipoprotein lipase) and is used for this purpose in this study. Intralipid is a fat&#xD;
      emulsions that supplies the synthetic triglycerides as substrate for LPL in order to raise&#xD;
      plasma FFAs. Subjects will be permitted to eat and drink and will be provided with regular&#xD;
      low fat meals during the 48 hours of the study.&#xD;
