    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess a novel approach to immunosuppression in allogenic&#xD;
      pancreatic islet cell transplant recipients. In addition, the study aims to assess remote&#xD;
      site islet processing with culture for pancreatic islet cell transplantation in human&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) type I is a disease that has significant social and economical impact.&#xD;
      The prevalence of the disease in the United States is about 120,000 in individuals aged 19 or&#xD;
      less and 300,000 to 500,000 at all ages and 150 million worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far there are no mechanical devices able to effectively adjust the dose of insulin&#xD;
      injected according to the serum glucose in patients with DM. This leads to less than perfect&#xD;
      sugar control, with episodes of hypoglycemia. Successful pancreas transplantation averts the&#xD;
      need of insulin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emerging alternative to whole organ pancreas transplantation is pancreatic islet cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ICT). The process is based on the enzymatic isolation of the pancreatic&#xD;
      islets from an organ procured from a cadaver donor. The islets obtained are injected into the&#xD;
      liver in the recipient via percutaneous catheterization of the portal venous system. This&#xD;
      procedure allows the selective transplantation of the insulin-producing cell population&#xD;
      avoiding open surgery as well as the transplantation of the duodenum and the exocrine&#xD;
      pancreas and their related morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial efforts with ICT had only modest results. The immunosuppression regimen was&#xD;
      similar to the one used in solid organ transplantation, based on high dose steroids and&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors - both agents with diabetogenic effects. The results improved markedly&#xD;
      with the changes in the manipulations of the islets, and the change in immunosuppression thus&#xD;
      avoiding the higher doses of steroids and using sirolimus, tacrolimus and daclizumab&#xD;
      initiated by the investigators group at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. Their&#xD;
      protocol requires in general two islet cell infusions in order to attain the critical cell&#xD;
      mass necessary to achieve insulin-independency. The changes in treatment were adopted as the&#xD;
      Edmonton Protocol, which is used in several transplant centers, worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation of the islets from donor pancreata will occur in the Baylor University Medical&#xD;
      Center Islet Cell Processing Laboratory (ICPL). The islet cell infusion is performed in the&#xD;
      Interventional Radiology Suite at Baylor University Medical Center or Baylor All Saints&#xD;
      Medical Center by an interventional radiologist. The procedure takes place in a suite&#xD;
      designed for invasive procedures using sterile technique with access to general anesthesia if&#xD;
      necessary. Following the procedure the patient is observed in the Interventional Radiology&#xD;
      recovery area for as long as necessary as determined by a Physician and then transferred to&#xD;
      the Transplant Service for an overnight stay. After recovery, the patient is admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital on the Transplant Service for a 1-2 day observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of the research in the ICT is centered on the development of a safe and effective&#xD;
      procedure that will eventually replace surgical pancreas transplantation together with an&#xD;
      ideal immunosuppressive regimen that provides safe and effective prevention against&#xD;
      rejection, while minimizing the adverse events associated that negatively impact transplant&#xD;
      recipient's quality of life.&#xD;
