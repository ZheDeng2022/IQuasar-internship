  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabotropic glutamate subtype five (mGluR5) receptor is a protein found in the brain and&#xD;
      is the target for the excitatory chemical messenger glutimate. The purpose of this protocol&#xD;
      is to measure mGluR5 receptors in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) and a&#xD;
      research drug called [18F]SP203.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabotropic glutamate receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that respond to glutamate by&#xD;
      activating proteins inside nerve cells that affect cell metabolism, thereby fine-tuning the&#xD;
      signals sent between cells to maintain balance in neuronal activity. Metabotropic Glutamate&#xD;
      receptors (mGluR5) are Group I receptors localized post-synaptically and found in several&#xD;
      regions of the brain including the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. Activation of&#xD;
      mGluR5 stimulates phospholipase C, resulting in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increase of&#xD;
      intracellular Ca2+ levels. Several potent antagonists for mGluR5 have been developed,&#xD;
      including 6 methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) and 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4yl)ethynyl]&#xD;
      pyridine (MTEP) however, no simple derivatives of MPEP or MTEP had proven to be useful for in&#xD;
      vivo imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present protocol, we will use a new PET ligand [(18)F]SP203 for two reasons: Part 1.)&#xD;
      we will perform kinetic brain imaging to quantify mGluR5 binding parameters in brain and&#xD;
      determine the reliability and reproducibility of these measures in 15 healthy controls Part&#xD;
      2.) if the tracer is proved successful in the part 1, we plan to estimate radiation-absorbed&#xD;
      doses of [(18)F]SP203 in healthy human subjects by performing whole body imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also use another new ligand, [11C]SP203, which has the same structure as [(18)F]SP203&#xD;
      but labeled with (11)C instead of (18)F. Part 3) the same purpose as part 1 but with&#xD;
      [(11)C]SP203 instead of [(18)F]SP203. Part 4) if [(11)C]SP203 is proved successful in the&#xD;
      part 3, we plan to estimate radiation absorbed doses of [(11)C]SP203 in healthy human&#xD;
      subjects. At this moment, we do not plan to perform additional scans of [(18)F]SP203 under&#xD;
      the current protocol. All future subjects will participate in scans of [(11)C]SP203.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, Part 5) we will measure the difference in [(18)F]SP203 concentration between&#xD;
      the artery and the vein without PET scanning to assess whether the venous blood is a valid&#xD;
      and less invasive substitute of arterial blood. In some of [(18)F]SP203 scans performed in&#xD;
      the current protocol, we compared [(18)F]SP203 levels between radial artery and antecubital&#xD;
      vein and observed 30% - 60% lower levels in vein. We plan to test whether sampling from a&#xD;
      vein in the hand and / or warming up makes [(18)F]SP203 levels in vein similar to artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful development of a PET ligand to image mGluR5 will have a strong impact on clinical&#xD;
      management of brain disorders with disruptions in glutamatergic transmission such as&#xD;
      schizophrenia, anxiety, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer s and Parkinson s&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
