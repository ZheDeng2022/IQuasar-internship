  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if DNA vaccination of chronic HBV patients under&#xD;
      treatment with NRTI can restore T-cell responsiveness and delay virologic reactivation after&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of effective vaccines against hepatitis B, over 370 million people&#xD;
      worldwide remain persistently infected with HBV. Persistent infection is associated with&#xD;
      chronic liver disease that can lead to the developement of cirrhosis and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma in two-third of persons. Treatment of chronic hepatitis B relies on the use of&#xD;
      analogs such as lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir or immunostimulators such as interferons.&#xD;
      Although analogs are efficient, genotypic resistance occurs after one year of treatment and&#xD;
      the rate of virologic relapse is high after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBV is a non cytopathic virus and liver damage is caused by immune response against infected&#xD;
      hepatocytes and to a non specific inflammatory response. Immune response contributes to the&#xD;
      virus clearance. In acute hepatitis B infection, T cell response is polyclonal, specific and&#xD;
      vigorous, whereas in patients with chronic infection, responses remain weak, less specific&#xD;
      and hardly detectable in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cell responses could be induced or restored by antigenic stimulation such as vaccination.&#xD;
      In a previous phase I clinical trial, we showed that DNA vaccination with plasmid pCMVS2.S is&#xD;
      safe and can specifically, but transiently activate T-cell responses in chronic HBV-carriers&#xD;
      not responding to current antiviral therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analogs such as lamivudine and adefovir were shown to enhance T cell responses concomitantly&#xD;
      with viral load decrease. In this phase I/II clinical trial, we would like to determine if&#xD;
      DNA vaccination of chronic HBV patients under treatment with NRTI can restore T-cell&#xD;
      responsiveness and delay virologic reactivation after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
