  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who previously took part in the FT500-101 study and received allogeneic NK cell&#xD;
      immunotherapy will take part in this long term follow-up study. Subjects will automatically&#xD;
      enroll into study FT-003 once they have withdrawn or complete the parent interventional&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide long-term safety and survival data for subjects who&#xD;
      have participated in the parent study. No additional study drug will be given, but subjects&#xD;
      can receive other therapies for their cancer while they are being followed for long term&#xD;
      safety in this study.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, observation study designed to provide long-term&#xD;
      safety and efficacy data on subjects who have participated in a prior Fate Therapeutics&#xD;
      interventional study of FT500 cellular immunotherapy. Subjects will be contacted every six&#xD;
      months (Â± one month), beginning six months after subject completion or withdrawal from the&#xD;
      FT500-101 study.&#xD;
