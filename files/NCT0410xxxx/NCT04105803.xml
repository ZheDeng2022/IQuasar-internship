    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that cardiac function is affected immediately after heart transplantation&#xD;
      (HTx), but seems to recover to some extent over the first year. This immediate effect is&#xD;
      associated with lack of oxygen in the tissue and reperfusion injury causing cellular energy&#xD;
      depletion, mitochondrial failure and cellular damage. This condition may progress into full&#xD;
      blown primary graft failure (PGF), characterized as deterioration of the transplanted heart,&#xD;
      which is seen in 3-30 % of HTx patients. In addition to PGF, chronic rejection owing to&#xD;
      cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) may develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGF and CAV remain the major heart related mortality causes, and additional assessment and&#xD;
      treatments are therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is diagnosed based on endomyocardial biopsies (EMB), which are&#xD;
      routinely performed to ensure prober immunosuppression in HTx patients. ACR occur in&#xD;
      approximately 25% of HTx patients, and is associated with PGF and CAV. However, mitochondrial&#xD;
      function and integrity may prove to be a more sensitive marker of allograft rejection than&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsies. Therefore, assessment of mitochondrial function may allow for&#xD;
      earlier detection of allograft rejection and dysfunction. This may be of particular&#xD;
      importance as emerging treatments are targeting both energy substrate supply for&#xD;
      adenosine-triphosphate generation produced by the mitochondria and mitochondrial function in&#xD;
      the failing heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the association between graft rejection and mitochondrial function, it remains&#xD;
      unsettled whether mitochondrial function associate with PGF, ACR and CAV. Such findings may&#xD;
      be of prognostic importance and even elucidate new treatment targets. Hence, we evaluate the&#xD;
      mitochondrial status in HTx patients through four studies designed to assess different&#xD;
      aspects of the interplay between cardiac function and mitochondrial integrity and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Primary graft pump function is correlated to mitochondrial function in the first&#xD;
      myocardial biopsy taken from the donor heart during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Cardiac mitochondrial function improves over the first 3 months after a heart&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: Heart transplant patients with moderate to severe coronary graft vasculopathy has&#xD;
      impaired mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4: Myocardial external energy efficiency by positron-emission tomography can be used as&#xD;
      a marker of mitochondrial function and chronic rejection in HTx patients.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis after heart transplantation (HTx) has improved considerably since the first HTx&#xD;
      was performed in 1967. Studies from our group have shown both left and right ventricular&#xD;
      function is affected immediately after heart transplantation, but this seems to recover to&#xD;
      some extent over the first year. This immediate effect on the graft organ following HTx is&#xD;
      associated with tissue ischemia and reperfusion injury causing cellular energy depletion,&#xD;
      mitochondrial failure and subsequent apoptosis. The condition may progress into full blown&#xD;
      primary graft failure (PGF) with a need for mechanical cardiovascular support or inotropes&#xD;
      which is seen in 3-30 % of HTx patients. The cardiac injury will consequently increase the&#xD;
      risk of morbidity as well as mortality. In addition to acute PGF, a chronic rejection owing&#xD;
      to coronary arterial vasculopathy (CAV) may develop. Hence, despite advances in&#xD;
      peritransplantation treatment and immunosuppression, PGF and CAV remain the major heart&#xD;
      related mortality causes following HTx and additional assessment and treatments are therefore&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft rejection is diagnosed, and the severity graded based on endomyocardial biopsies (EMB)&#xD;
      taken percutaneously through the jugular or femoral veins. These biopsies are routinely&#xD;
      performed at our institution to ensure prober immunosuppression following HTx.1 Acute&#xD;
      cellular rejection (ACR) may occur in approximately 25% of the patients which is associated&#xD;
      with PGF, CAV and later chronic rejection. However, mitochondrial function and integrity may&#xD;
      prove to be a more sensitive marker of allograft rejection. In heart failure, mitochondria&#xD;
      density changes while function and integrity is impaired linking the failing heart to energy&#xD;
      deprivation. Animal studies demonstrate that deterioration in total mitochondrial function&#xD;
      precedes histopathological changes during cardiac graft rejection following HTx. Therefore,&#xD;
      assessment of mitochondrial function following HTx may allow for earlier detection of&#xD;
      rejection and allograft dysfunction. This may be of particular importance as emerging&#xD;
      treatments are targeting both energy substrate supply for adenosine-triphosphate (ATP)&#xD;
      generation produced by the mitochondria as well as mitochondrial function in the failing&#xD;
      heart. At our institution, we have established methods to evaluate mitochondrial function in&#xD;
      myocardial tissue, and pilot studies have demonstrated feasibility with the use of EMB. In&#xD;
      addition, by use of non-invasive 11C-acetate positron-emission tomography (PET), we can&#xD;
      assess myocardial external energy efficiency (MEE) calculated by the ratio of myocardial&#xD;
      external work (EW) and oxidative metabolism (MVO2). Thus, enabling quantification of coupling&#xD;
      between mitochondrial energy production and mechanical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the overt association between graft dysfunction/rejection and mitochondrial function,&#xD;
      it remains unsettled whether mitochondrial content and function associate with PGF, ACR and&#xD;
      CAV. Such findings may be of prognostic importance and even elucidate a new treatment target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary graft pump function is correlated to mitochondrial function in the first&#xD;
           myocardial biopsy taken from the donor heart during the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac mitochondrial function improves over the first 3 months after a heart&#xD;
           transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart transplant patients with moderate to severe coronary graft vasculopathy has&#xD;
           impaired mitochondrial function&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MEE can be used as a marker of mitochondrial function and chronic rejection in HTx&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: To examine whether primary myocardial function is related to cardiac mitochondrial&#xD;
      function in de novo HTx patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: To investigate whether cardiac mitochondrial function improves over time after HTx&#xD;
      along with improvement of cardiac function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: To examine whether heart transplanted patients with chronic rejection and graft&#xD;
      vasculopathy have impaired mitochondrial function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4: To evaluate whether MEE can be used as marker of mitochondrial function and chronic&#xD;
      rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: The association between cardiac and mitochondrial function following HTx&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Myocardial mitochondrial function analyzed from 15 HTx patients taken from the donor&#xD;
      heart during the transplantation will be compared to EMB from 15 HTx patients at scheduled&#xD;
      biopsies (1 or 2 years after implantation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Development in cardiac and mitochondrial function following HTx Design:&#xD;
      Mitochondrial function measured at scheduled EBM follow-up (1,2,3,4,8,12 weeks and 6 months&#xD;
      after HTx) from 24 HTx patients. These results are compared to 15 patients with biopsies&#xD;
      performed at 1 and 2 years after HTx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: The impact of coronary arterial vasculopathy on mitochondrial function Design:&#xD;
      Mitochondrial function assessed at scheduled EMB follow-up visits of patients with CAV as&#xD;
      determined by coronary angiography (scheduled procedure) 15 HTx patients CAV are compared to&#xD;
      15 HTx patients with without CAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4: MEE as a non-invasive marker of mitochondrial function and allograft rejection&#xD;
      Design: 24 HTX patients scheduled for EMB will be examined twice with 11C-acetate-PET. It is&#xD;
      intended that we consecutively recruit patients enrolled in study 2. The first examination is&#xD;
      performed within 3 weeks following HTx and the second examination after 6 months. Up to 4&#xD;
      weeks between EMB and the second 11C-acetate PET examination is accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (The HTx patient cohort which is subjected to biopsies 1 and 2 years after HTx in study 3&#xD;
      (n=15) is reused in study 1 and 2 as a comparable cohort. Hence, a total of 69 patients are&#xD;
      enrolled. However, it is anticipated that several patients from study 1 and are enrolled in&#xD;
      study 2 which will decrease the total number of participants.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial function will be assessed in myocardial biopsies by High-resolution&#xD;
      respirometry and Electron microscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac functions is assessed by transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary Angiography is performed to assess the degree of CAV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study 4, MEE will be assessed by positron emission tomography using validated kinetic&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration&#xD;
      II. The protocol, including the written participant information and consent forms must be&#xD;
      finally approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Central Denmark Region and .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication and study plan All results, whether positive, negative or inconclusive will be&#xD;
      published in an international peer-reviewed scientific journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives Cellular rejection (ACR) shortly after HTx is strongly associated with the&#xD;
      long-term development of CAV and subsequent myocardial dysfunction. As graft failure and CAV&#xD;
      are the major long-term heart-related late mortality causes following HTx, it seems paramount&#xD;
      to modify long-term hazards such as ACR, CAV, and graft failure to significantly improve&#xD;
      post-transplant outcome.5 In this context mitochondrial function seems to be pivotal, hence,&#xD;
      approaches to assess mitochondrial function in HTx patient may prove to pave the way for new&#xD;
      follow-up algorithms and even treatment targets.&#xD;
