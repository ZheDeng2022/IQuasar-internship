  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proximal humerus fracture (PHFs) is the third most common fracture type in the elderly,&#xD;
      and represents 5% of the overall fractures. The incidence is increasing. The purpose of the&#xD;
      project is to compare surgical and conservative management of two- part PHFs in light of&#xD;
      radiological, economical and clinical outcome. Do the participants between 60 and 85 years of&#xD;
      age with displaced two-part PHFs fare better or worse after surgery compared to non-operative&#xD;
      treatment?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study-design is a single center single blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 2&#xD;
      arms. Patients admitted to Akershus University Hospital (Ahus) with a displaced two-part&#xD;
      proximal humeral fracture of OTA/ AO group 11A2 or 11A3 in need of surgical treatment will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to two groups; conservative/ non-operative treatment or open reduction and&#xD;
      internal fixation (ORIF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All following aims evaluated at controls at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. The 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
      controls will additionally be conducted by independent physiotherapists. The other controls&#xD;
      are conducted by the treating surgeons. The physiotherapists will be blinded of chosen&#xD;
      treatment, the patients wearing a t-shirt covering the shoulder at the consultations, hence&#xD;
      single blinded RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: Functional outcome as evaluated by the Quick DASH (Disability of the arm,&#xD;
      shoulder and hand) score at controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project participants will supervise and evaluate the data. General history, including;&#xD;
      mechanism of injury, occupation, pre-existing medical conditions and medication, smoking&#xD;
      history, American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification (ASA classification), BMI, hand&#xD;
      dominance. At inclusion, the patient will be asked to fill out quick-Dash, Visual Analog&#xD;
      scale (VAS), EQ-5D to determine the baseline-characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of postoperative radiographs for reduction of fracture and possible errors of the&#xD;
      operative technique by the project participants and a radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial radiographic examination with standardized radiograph projections; true&#xD;
           anterio-posterior projection and scapula projection pre- and post-operative.&#xD;
           Registration of radiological complications defined by a reduction of Head-Shaft-Angle&#xD;
           (HSA) of ≥10⁰ in frontal plane, screw penetration/cut-out, screw failure or failure of&#xD;
           the osteosynthesis on radiographs. Evaluation of fracture healing/ non-union.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of postoperative reduction: Reduction of tubercles, rotation of caput,&#xD;
           re-establishment of medial support, position of calcar screws and distance from screws&#xD;
           to cartilage in x-rays. Computer-tomographic scans are standard pre-operative practice&#xD;
           at our institution. The problem of intra- and inter-observer reproducibility is a&#xD;
           well-known confounder of fracture classification in proximal humeral fractures and CT&#xD;
           scans will help clarify classification (19, 20) and fracture configuration. CT scan&#xD;
           postoperatively will be taken within few days after surgery (Only in Stratum 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Qualitative Computed Tomography (QCT) is an alternative method to measure Bone Marrow&#xD;
           Density (BMD) using a Hydroxyapatite plate/ a phantom. This is a flat plate placed under&#xD;
           the shoulder during ordinary CT scanning. Several studies have demonstrated an&#xD;
           association between the QCT measurements and risk of fragility fractures, so BMD will be&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functional outcome of surgical treatment as evaluated by Constant score by independent&#xD;
           physiotherapists during follow-up. Measurement of strength according to recommendations&#xD;
           given by the European Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons ESSSE (http://secec.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Functional outcome evaluated by Oxford Shoulder score, which is a validated&#xD;
           patient-reported outcome measure. A shoulder-specific instrument designed to assess the&#xD;
           outcome of all shoulder surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. EQ-5D, a generic measure of health status that provide a simple descriptive profile used&#xD;
           in clinical evaluation of health care. EQ-5D is recommended for use in&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine and by the Washington panel of&#xD;
           Pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research (ISPOR) task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Health economic registration; length of hospital-stay, sick leaves, use of&#xD;
           physiotherapy, appointments at general practitioners, extra controls at in-patient&#xD;
           orthopedic clinic, removal of plate or nail, extra surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Monitoring complications such as deep or superficial infection, reoperations, avascular&#xD;
           necrosis, non-union, nerve or vessel-damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, the following risk factors for failure of the osteosynthesis, Avascular&#xD;
      necrosis (AVN) or chance of poor functional outcome are outlined; the factors will be&#xD;
      examined as subgroups to see whether they are representative also for our population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A non-adequately reduced fracture. Evaluated in postoperative radiographs. Malalignment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not adequately positioning of implant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of medial comminution and medial hinge (the amount of metaphyseal bone attached&#xD;
           to the anatomic head fragment at trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is sufficient medial support achieved in our patients, and if not, does the construction&#xD;
           fail?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varus subsidence, measured as reduced Head shaft angle (HSA) (&gt;10 degrees) during follow&#xD;
           up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fixation in varus, HSA &lt;120 or HSA &lt;110 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enough contact between head and shaft for healing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: Increasing age predisposes osteosynthesis failure and reduced function, probably&#xD;
           because of decreasing bone density in proximal humerus in older age. The examiners want&#xD;
           to examine whether there is a cut-off in age, in example 60, 65, 75, 80 or 85 years of&#xD;
           age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Valgus &gt;45 or Varus &lt;30, which fracture is the worst?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to the conservative group may be offered surgical treatment if the&#xD;
      fracture changes/ dislocates, in example no contact between the fracture ends if the patients&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL) is greatly affected or pain is disproportionately&#xD;
