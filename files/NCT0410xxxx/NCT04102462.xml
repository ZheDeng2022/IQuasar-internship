    <textblock>
      To investigate safety and tolerability of BI 764198 in healthy male subjects following oral&#xD;
      administration of multiple rising doses per day over 14 days and to explore the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 764198 after single and multiple oral dosing. In addition, the&#xD;
      effect of BI 764198 on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, given as an oral microdose, will be&#xD;
      explored after multiple oral dosing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a&#xD;

             accordance with GCP and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who meet any of the following criteria from administration of trial&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects who are not vasectomised or sexually abstinent have to ensure that an&#xD;
