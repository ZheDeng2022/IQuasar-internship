    <textblock>
      Tranperineal prostate biopsy(TPB) and Transrectal prostate biopsy(TRUSB) are now both routine&#xD;
      diagnosis methods of prostate cancer in Queen Mary Hospital. The TRUSB has been the most&#xD;
      common way to sample prostate tissue for decades. The TPB has been employed as one of our&#xD;
      routine diagnosis methods in early 2018. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      Tranperineal prostate biopsy using a noval transperineal access system under local&#xD;
      anaesthesia is non-inferior to standard 12-cores Transrectal prostate biopsy in detecting&#xD;
      prostate cancer (PCa), in patients with clinical suspicion of PCa with no prior prostate&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) has increased considerably in recent years [1, 2]. The&#xD;
      reported lifetime risk for men in Hong Kong to be diagnosed with PCa is 1 in 31 before the&#xD;
      age of 75, and is currently the third commonest cancer Hong Kong men according to the Hong&#xD;
      Kong Cancer Registry [3]. This highlights the importance of thorough and fundamentally a safe&#xD;
      investigation technique to correctly identify patients with PCa. Such test should be able to&#xD;
      sensitively detect PCa, and provide early diagnosis. Critically, such test is required to&#xD;
      provide accurate disease risk stratification, which is absolutely crucial in guiding level of&#xD;
      appropriate treatment is necessary in patients diagnosed with PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#xD;
      (NICE) guidelines, current standard clinical practice considers histological diagnosis of PCa&#xD;
      a necessity in majority of patients presented with localized disease who are eligible for&#xD;
      treatment [4]. This, alongside with prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, digital rectal&#xD;
      examination (DRE) findings, and increasingly the use of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) imaging,&#xD;
      collectively allows risk stratification of PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pathway to obtain prostate tissue for histological diagnosis of CaP is by&#xD;
      transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy (TRUSB) of the prostate, usually following&#xD;
      the detection of a raised serum PSA level and/or suspicious rectal examination findings.&#xD;
      TRUSB has been the standard prostate tissue sampling technique for men suspected with PCa for&#xD;
      over 30 years. It is an office-based procedure carried out under local anaesthesia (LA), with&#xD;
      10 to 12 biopsy cores directed towards the lateral peripheral zones of the prostate thought&#xD;
      to harbour majority of cancers [7]. However, there are still various well-known cancer&#xD;
      detection limitations and patient safety problems associated with TRUSB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, a very significant portion of tumours are being missed with the TRUSB technique [8].&#xD;
      It has been well- known that over 30% of patients with low risk PCa on TRUSB have been found&#xD;
      to harbour clinically significant PCa [9]. Many of these tumours missed on TRUSB are located&#xD;
      in the anterior and apical regions of the prostate, which TRUSB is difficult to access, in&#xD;
      particular in patients with a large prostate volume&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, TRUSB requires the biopsy needle to penetrate through the bowel (rectum). This&#xD;
      results in high risk of developing sepsis following biopsy, despite all patients undergoing&#xD;
      the procedure being started on antibiotics prophylactically. This is a serious complication&#xD;
      which can potentially be life-threatening. Our previous study has already demonstrated a high&#xD;
      prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing rectal flora in our local&#xD;
      population in Hong Kong [10]. The risk of developing post-biopsy sepsis in Hong Kong is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transperineal prostate biopsy (TPB) has been developed to provide a more comprehensive biopsy&#xD;
      method to improve cancer detection rate by directing biopsy cores through the perineal skin.&#xD;
      Theoretically, TPB enables access to sample the entire prostate, in particular the anterior&#xD;
      and apical regions which are not easily accessible through the standard TRUSB method. By&#xD;
      sampling the prostate using biopsy needles directly inserted through the perineal skin rather&#xD;
      than bowel, the risk of sepsis is reduced. However, this technique requires multiple needles&#xD;
      traversing through the perineum, and requires to be carried out under general anaesthesia&#xD;
      (GA). Another disadvantage is a stabilising stepping unit is required to provide a consistent&#xD;
      alignment of the ultrasound probe against the prostate in order to carry out the biopsies.&#xD;
      Such stabilising stepping units are costly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel but simple transperineal access system device known as PrecisionPoint (Perineologic,&#xD;
      Cumberland, MD, USA) has been developed to tackle the aforementioned limitations of TPB. This&#xD;
      revolutionary device utilises a single access needle cannula mounted directly on to the&#xD;
      ultrasound probe, which acts as an access point traversing through the perineal skin. This&#xD;
      design minimises the number of needle punctures through the skin, enabling TPB to be carried&#xD;
      out under LA. A stabilising stepping unit is not required with this technique. The device has&#xD;
      gained the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval [11], and results from&#xD;
      small contemporary series have already been published with very promising results in terms of&#xD;
      cancer detection rate and safety [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRUSB has a poor cancer detection rate and is associated with potentially fatal septic risk.&#xD;
      TPB, if able to be carried out under LA as an office-based procedure, can potentially provide&#xD;
      a better cancer detection rate with significantly reduced sepsis risk. It has fundamentally a&#xD;
      very high potential to become the new gold standard in obtaining prostate tissue for&#xD;
      histological diagnosis of PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an increasing number of men in Hong Kong with elevated serum PSA suspicion of PCa&#xD;
      needing prostate biopsy, it is fundamental to carry out a study to determine the most&#xD;
      effective, safe and tolerable prostate biopsy technique which fits with the clinical practice&#xD;
      in Hong Kong.&#xD;
