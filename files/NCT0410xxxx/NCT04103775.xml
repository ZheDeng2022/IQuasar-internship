  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether targeted cognitive training, a low-cost and low-risk&#xD;
      commercial cognitive remediation therapy, directly impacts therapeutic targets as well as&#xD;
      secondary outcomes in college undergraduates. The active intervention will be compared to an&#xD;
      active control condition (computer games). Participants will also attend CSU TILT (The&#xD;
      Institute for Teaching and Learning) Academic Workshops.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to investigate whether commercial cognitive remediation&#xD;
      therapy improves cognitive functioning in college undergraduates. The secondary goal is to&#xD;
      investigate neurophysiological, cognitive, and psychosocial mechanisms of change. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare cognitive remediation therapy to computer games. The active&#xD;
      control condition will allow the investigators to determine whether targeted cognitive&#xD;
      training, as an adjunct to academic skills training provided by CSU TILT, provides&#xD;
      significant improvement over computer games alone (which is also thought to provide some&#xD;
      value as &quot;brain training&quot;). Participants who agree to enroll in the study will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of two intervention arms: cognitive remediation (CR) or active control (AC). In the CR&#xD;
      arm, participants will complete 20 hours of targeted cognitive training, in 30-min session, 5&#xD;
      days per week, over 8 weeks. The AC Arm will follow the same schedule, except that&#xD;
      participants will complete video games (e.g., pong). All participants will repeat assessments&#xD;
      at randomly determined midpoint, as well as after the 8 weeks of training have been&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive Remediation comprises of six exercises supplied by BrainHQ by Posit Science Corporation: Sound Sweeps (targets auditory processing speed): Two successive frequency-modulated tone sweeps are presented and participants indicate whether the frequency increased or decreased within each tone: Fine Tuning (targets auditory perception and processing speed): Participants indicate which one of two confusable syllables were presented; Syllable Stacks (targets auditory memory); Users report the order of presented syllables in a serial memory span task; Memory Grid (targets auditory memory); Participants match identical cards representing syllables; To do List Training (targets auditory memory): Participants see a g rid of everyday items (e.g., plant, carrots, shovel) and select the items in accordance with spoken instructions; Rhythm Recall (target auditory memory): Participants recreate auditory melodies</description>
