  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The muscles of the leg require a regular supply of oxygen and nutrients. This is supplied by&#xD;
      blood carried by a network of large blood vessels known as arteries. Gradually, these&#xD;
      arteries can become narrowed or blocked by a build-up of fatty deposits. This process is&#xD;
      known as atherosclerosis and leads to a condition called peripheral arterial disease. The&#xD;
      restriction of blood flow caused by the blockage prevents exercising muscles getting enough&#xD;
      oxygen and nutrients. In some people, this may lead to a painful ache in their legs when they&#xD;
      walk, known as intermittent claudication. If the leg pain is severe, surgeons may decide to&#xD;
      bypass this blockage using a vein taken from another part of the body, thereby improving&#xD;
      blood flow to the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a narrowing or blockage anywhere in the main artery that runs from the groin to&#xD;
      the back of the knee may be treated with a particular type of bypass graft known as a&#xD;
      femoral-popliteal bypass graft. However, this graft may collapse if not enough blood is&#xD;
      flowing through it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is looking to see whether a circulation booster machine, known as the REVITIVE®&#xD;
      device, can improve the amount of blood flowing through femoral-popliteal bypass grafts.&#xD;
      Patients with these grafts attending their usual clinic appointment in the Vascular&#xD;
      Outpatients department at Charing Cross Hospital, London will be asked to have their leg&#xD;
      scanned using an ultrasound machine to measure the amount of blood flowing through the graft.&#xD;
      They will then use the REVITIVE® device for 30 minutes, before being re-scanned to see&#xD;
      whether the device has improved blood flow. Improvements in blood flow may suggest a&#xD;
      promising role for the device in keeping these grafts open, therefore helping them last&#xD;
      longer and potentially reducing the leg pain associated with peripheral arterial disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the vascular department at Charing Cross Hospital, there is an on-going NIHR-funded&#xD;
      trial looking at the haemodynamics and clinical outcomes of patients with intermittent&#xD;
      claudication. The aim of the study is to find out whether the neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (NMES) device, REVITIVE®, can improve the time-averaged mean velocity (TAMV) and&#xD;
      volume flow rate (VFR) through femoral-popliteal bypass grafts. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that NMES can enhance arterial TAMV and VFR and have suggested the utility of NMES in the&#xD;
      management of intermittent claudication, critical limb ischaemia and limb salvage. By&#xD;
      enhancing arterial TAMV and VFR, NMES has been said to mimic the effect of exercise in the&#xD;
      redistribution of arterial circulation. This is achieved through activation of the calf&#xD;
      muscle pump, which empties the venous bed, thus increasing the pressure difference between&#xD;
      the venous and arterial system. This creates a hyperaemic response in which there is faster&#xD;
      arterial inflow against a lower venous back pressure. NMES could also enhance TAMV and VFR in&#xD;
      femoral-popliteal bypass grafts which could, in turn, improve graft inflow and thus prolong&#xD;
      patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If TAMV and VFR are enhanced, this may suggest that the REVITIVE® device could help prolong&#xD;
      the patency of femoral-popliteal bypass grafts and be given to patients with these grafts to&#xD;
      be used for 30 minutes daily as part of their management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phillips (Guildford, UK) EPIQ 7 ultrasound machine and L12-5 transducer will be used to&#xD;
      measure graft flow parameters using a pre-set optimised vascular protocol. A Phillips&#xD;
      (Guildford, UK) EPIQ 7 ultrasound machine will be used as these are used frequently by&#xD;
      Clinical Vascular Scientists in the Vascular Outpatients department to scan patients. An&#xD;
      L12-5 transducer will be used as the proximal section of the femoral-popliteal graft will be&#xD;
      scanned, which is a superficial structure and therefore a probe that is designed for imaging&#xD;
      superficial structures should be used to obtain the best possible image resolution. Real-time&#xD;
      gated Doppler superimposed on B-mode imaging will be used in the evaluation of flow and&#xD;
      processed using automated waveform enveloping duplex software, as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First ultrasound scan: Patients will be called into a vascular ultrasound scanning room where&#xD;
      a Clinical Vascular Scientist will ask the patient to rest for 10 minutes on an examination&#xD;
      couch. A region of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft 3-5 cm from the saphenofemoral&#xD;
      junction, or as proximal as possible depending on the patient's body habitus, will be&#xD;
      identified and the position of the probe marked on the skin for consistency of repeat&#xD;
      measurements. This method for maintaining consistency was chosen as it proved successful in&#xD;
      similar studies. When obtaining measurements, the patient will be positioned semi-recumbent&#xD;
      with the leg externally rotated at the hip to 35-40 degrees and flexed at the knee according&#xD;
      to their comfort. Baseline measurements of TAMV and VFR (calculated using built-in software)&#xD;
      will be taken and recorded via a 15-second electronic screenshot. All diameter measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained by placing electronic callipers on the inner edge to inner edge of the graft&#xD;
      to obtain the luminal diameter and to improve reliability of this measurement. Where&#xD;
      indicated by reliability measurements (see below), a predetermined number of consecutive&#xD;
      measurements of TAMV and VFR will be taken and an average calculated later. PV of the&#xD;
      greatest waveform amplitude of each screenshot will be analysed at a later date using&#xD;
      standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device activation: The REVITIVE® device will then be applied and activated for 30-minutes as&#xD;
      per the instructions for use (IFU) of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second ultrasound scan: The Clinical Vascular Scientist will ask the patient to rest for&#xD;
      another 10 minutes on the examination couch before performing a second ultrasound scan to&#xD;
      obtain post-device TAMV and VFR measurements. The 10-minute equilibration periods were used&#xD;
      in the study protocol as these were used in a similar study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the accuracy of measurements per subject (intrasubject reliability), 10&#xD;
      measurements each of TAMV, VFR and PSV will be performed the first five participants by the&#xD;
      student (a trainee Clinical Vascular Scientist) on a marked region of the femoral-popliteal&#xD;
      bypass graft. Data will be analysed to derive coefficient of variation, and Bland-Altman&#xD;
      analysis will be performed (significance will be 0.05). To determine inter-user reliability,&#xD;
      two different Clinical Vascular Scientists will each obtain 10 additional measurements of&#xD;
      TAMV, VFR and PSV and Bland-Altman analysis performed again. Depending on the extent of&#xD;
      variability of results, it may be decided to average at least three consecutive measurements&#xD;
      of each variable. This will be applied to every patient in the study. These methods to assess&#xD;
      reliability were chosen as these were used in similar studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The student, who is a member of the direct care team, will identify eligible patients and&#xD;
      find their appointment information using Cerner, the health information system used by&#xD;
      Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Potential participants will be contacted in writing by&#xD;
      the student before their next usual clinic appointment. The student will send out the patient&#xD;
      information sheet along with the invitation letter, enabling the potential participant to&#xD;
      read the about the study and discuss it with others. The student will also contact the&#xD;
      potential participants by telephone to discuss the patient information sheet, explain the&#xD;
      study further and allow the potential participant to ask questions if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the patient's clinic appointment, the patient will have the opportunity to discuss the&#xD;
      patient information sheet and the study further with a vascular physician. Female&#xD;
      participants of child-bearing age will be asked whether or not they are pregnant - if they&#xD;
      are, they will not be included in the study. If the patient is happy to take part in the&#xD;
      study, they will be given a consent form to sign and the study intervention will be commenced&#xD;
      and completed the same day. The patient will be given a copy of the consent form for their&#xD;
      reference and reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study requires a sample size of 34 participants to achieve a power of 80% and a level of&#xD;
      significance of 5% (two sided), for detecting an effect size of 0.5 between pairs [6]. An&#xD;
      effect size of 0.5 was chosen as a previous study assessing VFR in arteries before and after&#xD;
      NMES reported a 66% relative reduction with the test intervention (approximately 50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining valid consent enables healthcare professionals to act with beneficence towards&#xD;
      their patients and to respect patient autonomy. The vascular physician will be seeking&#xD;
      consent during the patient's clinic appointment. For consent to take part in the study to be&#xD;
      valid, the patient must receive adequate information about the study, including risks and&#xD;
      benefits, and have the capacity to decide for themselves. Through the patient information&#xD;
      sheet and discussions with the patient, it will be ensured that the patient fully understands&#xD;
      the purpose of the study and what it will involve for them. It will be ensured that any&#xD;
      queries the patient may have are answered fully. The vascular physician will ask the patient&#xD;
      if they have had the patient information sheet and study explained to them, and if their&#xD;
      queries have been answered fully, before proceeding to take informed consent on the patient's&#xD;
      decision. In keeping with the Mental Capacity Act 2005, all patients will be assumed to have&#xD;
      capacity unless it is established otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When obtaining consent, the vascular physician will give the patient a personal anonymous&#xD;
      identification number. This will be written on the patient's consent form and used throughout&#xD;
      the study to anonymise the patient's personal and study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REVITIVE® device is a commercially available, CE marked device which is intended to&#xD;
      improve circulation. Therefore, it is expected that this study poses minimum safety risks&#xD;
      provided that patients do not meet any of the exclusion criteria. Furthermore, extra&#xD;
      precautions should be taken when using the device in certain individuals, for example those&#xD;
      with a history of heart problems (the device may cause lethal rhythm disturbances to the&#xD;
      heart in susceptible individuals) and with metallic implants. The long-term effects of&#xD;
      chronic electrical stimulation are unknown; however the patients will be using the device for&#xD;
      one 30-minute session only, which is well within the limit for the duration of use stated in&#xD;
      the IFU (6 sessions of 30 minutes per day). Therefore, risks of muscle fatigue will be&#xD;
      minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Philips EPIQ 7 ultrasound machine is used for the regular scanning of patients attending&#xD;
      the Vascular Outpatients department at Charing Cross Hospital, London, therefore risks&#xD;
      associated with use of the ultrasound machine are expected to be minimal. It will be ensured&#xD;
      that the acoustic output intensity and mechanical index (MI) of the ultrasound machine is&#xD;
      kept to within normal limits, thus minimising acoustic cavitation risk. The thermal index&#xD;
      (TI) will also be kept to within normal limits, thus minimising tissue heating risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There could be benefits to the participants and other patients with femoral-popliteal grafts&#xD;
      in the future because if the results show an improvement in blood flow through the&#xD;
      femoral-popliteal grafts after use of the REVITIVE® device, the device may prolong graft&#xD;
      patency if used in the longer-term. These patients could be offered the device to use daily.&#xD;
      This study may inform future studies looking at the potential benefit of NMES on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with PAD, including symptom relief and rehabilitation, which require&#xD;
      some haemodynamic component in their analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the Caldicott Principles, person-identifiable information will only be used&#xD;
      unless it is absolutely necessary. A document containing the participant's contact details&#xD;
      such as their name, address and any medical information will be stored in a secure place,&#xD;
      separate from any study data using the personal identification number. Contact details will&#xD;
      be retained so that the participant can be contacted with a summary of the results once the&#xD;
      study has ended, after which these documents will be disposed of in a confidential manner.&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned a personal anonymous identification number which will be&#xD;
      written on the signed consent forms. Personal data will only be identified using the&#xD;
      patient's anonymous identification number. Data obtained throughout the study (ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements) will be stored on a password-protected electronic database. Only members of the&#xD;
      study team will be able to access this and all data on the database will be identified using&#xD;
      the patient's anonymous identification number only. Patients will not be identified from any&#xD;
      study report or publication.&#xD;
