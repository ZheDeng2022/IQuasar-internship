  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context and hypothesis: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus keeps going to increase, due to&#xD;
      the ageing of the population and the high prevalence of overweight and obesity. Thus about 5%&#xD;
      of the French population is said to have diabetes according to the national health insurance&#xD;
      reimbursement data estimations. 15 to 20% of diabetic patients will have a foot chronic ulcer&#xD;
      in their lifetime. Nowadays, diabetes is still the leading cause of non-traumatic amputation&#xD;
      in France, amputation being very often preceded by a trophic disorder. Thus, the person with&#xD;
      diabetes has a 7-fold risk of amputation. For the year 2013, in France, incidence rates of&#xD;
      hospitalizations for lower limb amputations and foot wounds in the diabetic population were&#xD;
      252/100000 and 668/100000 respectively. In an attempt to prevent the risk of foot wounds in&#xD;
      people with diabetes, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has&#xD;
      established foot grades associated with an increased risk of foot wounds. These grades are&#xD;
      now used by health authorities to calibrate their care offer such as reimbursements for&#xD;
      podiatry care. Chronic kidney disease is one of the major complications of diabetes. In 2013,&#xD;
      according to data from the French registry (REIN), 4,856 diabetics started renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy in 2016, representing 46% of the newly dialyzed population. This represents a&#xD;
      relative risk 9.2 times higher than in the general population. The Investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that beyond the risk of wound, there is a link between the stage of chronic renal disease and&#xD;
      the risk of foot ulcer grade as defined by the IWGDF. The link between chronic renal disease&#xD;
      and this common marker of foot risk has never been studied to our knowledge. The long-term&#xD;
      objective, beyond this study, is to improve patient pathways and thus improve the prevention&#xD;
      of foot wounds in diabetics with renal insufficiency. This is all the more true since&#xD;
      prevention actions in the dialysis population have already shown their effectiveness on a&#xD;
      large scale on the risk of amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol : All patients with a diabetes mellitus who consult diabetology and nephrology&#xD;
      services at the Montpellier University Hospital will be included in this study. The&#xD;
      consultation wil be the same as usual. The Investigators will ask for the history of&#xD;
      diabetes, the history of complications, the current treatments and the Investigators will&#xD;
      make a standardized clinical examination of feet with a foot risk gradation according to the&#xD;
      IWGDF.The investigators will report the standard biologicals values.&#xD;

      A simple standardization of the clinical examination (Foot Risk Grading), history collection&#xD;
      and biological data will be organized by the study sponsors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      List of collected data, origin and circuit of the data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry of patient data (clinical, biological and additional examinations) on a database&#xD;
      registered at the University Hospital of Montpellier on a secure server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computerized medical records and consultation letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The question form completed by the physician- The results of biological examinations&#xD;
           carried out outside or inside the university hospital vested with a standardized&#xD;
           standard prescription form&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data corresponds to the current annual or infra-annual follow-up of patients&#xD;
      consulting for the pathologies studied: Diabetes and renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be anonymized by a chronic search entry number and 1st letter of the surname&#xD;
      and first name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis of the data will be carried out internally at the Montpellier&#xD;
      University Hospital, in collaboration with the Medical Information Department, in accordance&#xD;
      with the partnerships already in place between our teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple demographic characteristics: Age, gender Clinical history: Longstanding diabetes,&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy, diabetic maculopathy, ischemic heart disease, history of stroke, lower&#xD;
      limb arteriopathy, known gastroparesis, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      microalbuminuria or known proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical features: BMI, lower limb neuropathy - monofilament test error, pulse abolition&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Treatments: diabetes, type of kidney substitution, other treatments Toxic: Tobacco, Alcohol&#xD;
      Quality of patient follow-up: date of last ophthalmic consultation (For each diabetic person:&#xD;
      one consultation per year is recommended - this criterion is monitored by health insurance as&#xD;
      a quality criterion for follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological assessment: Creatinemia, Calcaemia, Phosphatemia, Magnesemia, 1.25OHVitD,&#xD;
      25OHVitD, 25OHVitD, Natremia, Kalemia, Albuminaemia, PTH, CRP, Uric acid, HbA1C,&#xD;
      Hemoglobinaemia, HDL, LDL, Triglyceridaemia, Cholesterol, Albuminuria/Creatinuria ratio,&#xD;
      Proteinuria/Creatinuria ratio&#xD;
