  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: The impact of extended antral resection (AR) after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)&#xD;
      on weight loss changes and metabolic response is still not clearly elucidated with&#xD;
      conflicting results. The investigator's retrospective cohort study aimed to determine whether&#xD;
      AR is superior to antral preservation (AP) regarding weight loss and resolution of&#xD;
      co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients were divided into two groups according to the distance of gastric division&#xD;
      as AR group (2cm from pylorus) and AP group (6cm from pylorus). Postoperative excess weight&#xD;
      loss percentile (%EWL) and total body weight loss percentiles (%TBWL) at the end of first,&#xD;
      6th and 12 months were compared. Secondly, metabolic parameters and complications were&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;

      Following approval of the ethical committee patients who underwent LSG between January 2016&#xD;
      and June 2018 are retrospectively analyzed. Patients with BMI &gt; 40 were included. Patients&#xD;
      with a history of previous bariatric surgery and patients who did not attend regular&#xD;
      follow-up visits (first, 6th and 12 months) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were grouped according to the distance of gastric division as AP group (6cm from&#xD;
      pylorus) and AR group (2cm prom pylorus). The first 68 patients underwent AP, and the&#xD;
      following 43 patients underwent AR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics and demographic data, including age, gender, BMI, co-morbid diseases&#xD;
      (hypertension (HT), Type II diabetes, dyslipidemia), biochemical parameters (glucose, HbA1c,&#xD;
      C-peptide, insulin, , cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, and VLDL was extracted from a&#xD;
      prospectively prepared patient's chart. The 30-day outcomes including postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality are taken from patient's folder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss alteration at the end of first, 6th and 12 months are calculated as %EWL and&#xD;
      %TBWL. The %EWL is calculated as [(preoperative weight - follow up weight) / (preoperative&#xD;
      weight-ideal weight)] x100, with ideal weight based on a BMI of 25kg/m2. The total body&#xD;
      weight loss percentile (%TBWL) is calculated as [(preoperative weight - follow up weight) /&#xD;
      (preoperative body weight)] x100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resolution of co-morbidities was defined as reduction of co-morbidity related symptom and&#xD;
      signs with change of specific biochemical blood tests to normal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clavien-Dindo classification scale was used to define the severity of complications:&#xD;
      Grade I; no requirement of specific intervention, Grade II; antibiotic treatment, total&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition, and/or blood transfusion is mandatory, Grade III; invasive&#xD;
      interventions such as endoscopy, percutaneous drainage, or surgery is needed, Grade IV;&#xD;
      intensive care management for organ dysfunction, and Grade V; as death, respectively [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Surgical Technique The LSGs were performed by two surgeons. Patients were placed in&#xD;
      supine position. Antibiotic prophylaxis was started before anesthesia induction by using 2g&#xD;
      first-generation cephalosporin for patients &lt;120kg, and 3g for patients ≥120 kg. The liver is&#xD;
      retracted by using Nathanson Hook. The greater omentum is carefully dissected from the&#xD;
      stomach at a distance of 2cm for the patients with AR, and 6cm for patients with AP. The&#xD;
      omental dissection was performed using 5mm-abdominal ligature (Ligasure®, Metronic-Covidien,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, USA), from the antrum towards the angle of His. Transection from the omentum is&#xD;
      continued until the left crus has been identified. All sleeves are transected using 36 French&#xD;
      orogastric tubes. Green cartridges (4.8 mm staple height) are used for the first firing and&#xD;
      blue cartridges (3.5 mm) for the rest. Neither oversewing sutures to the staple line nor&#xD;
      staple line reinforcement products are used. Homeostatic metallic clips are used for bleeding&#xD;
      at the staple line. If bleeding persists and cannot be controlled, an interrupted suture is&#xD;
      performed at the point of bleeding. A leak test with methylene blue is performed to the&#xD;
      gastric remnant to assess the integrity of the suture line. The gastric specimen is removed&#xD;
      through the 12mm trocar. The procedure is completed by placing an abdominal drain just next&#xD;
      to the staple line.&#xD;
