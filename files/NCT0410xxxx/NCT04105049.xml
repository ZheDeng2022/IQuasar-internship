      Reported studies on individual differences related to academic performance based on&#xD;
      personality aspects describe self-efficiency, motivation and self-control as the main&#xD;
      indicators of academic performance. Students who are motivated tend to have a better academic&#xD;
      performance (AP) than peers with less motivation. On the other hand, differences in the&#xD;
      environment related to academic performance have been linked to social aspects, among which&#xD;
      are: family environment, family socioeconomic status and academic socialization. A constant&#xD;
      factor in aspects of the environment that seems to permeate and impose itself on others is&#xD;
      the socioeconomic one. About the personal factors of medical students, it has been found that&#xD;
      university students who report stress caused by socioeconomic factors are more likely to have&#xD;
      some psychological morbidity. There are certain ways to deal with stress that are related to&#xD;
      better performance. Due to the complexity of the study of AP, it is necessary to develop&#xD;
      holistic models that allow a better approach to reality. The educational research work&#xD;
      related to academic disillusionment has been aimed at determining the factors involved in it.&#xD;
      However, the methodological approach that has been used to document these works focuses on&#xD;
      reductionism, where each variable that is studied and correlated independently with the AP.&#xD;
      Although, this approach has provided valuable information, it is necessary to postulate&#xD;
      holistic models that allow a better approach to reality. Although, there are published works&#xD;
      on the correlation of the factors that can influence the academic performance of medical&#xD;
      students of the Faculty of Medicine of the UNAM, no multivariate predictive models have been&#xD;
      developed that include the main psychosocial factors and the resilience of students and how&#xD;
      they impact academic performance; and also, study their behavior throughout a school year of&#xD;
      the career, using stochastic models that allow characterizing a succession of random&#xD;
      variables that evolve as a function of time. Therefore, the present work has as main purpose&#xD;
      to establish a predictive model that allows predictions of expected academic performance and&#xD;
      timely detection of students in situations of academic risk; and in turn tutorials,&#xD;
      educational guidance, psychological support and / or specialized advice.&#xD;

      The medical career demands of its students a great dedication and dedication, which for some&#xD;
      can become a problem that leads to an alteration of the state of physical and mental health.&#xD;
      Those who have dedicated themselves to studying academic performance and its impact on mental&#xD;
      health point out that the stress, anxiety and depression experienced by students throughout&#xD;
      the school year are factors that cause poor academic performance (AP). The AP is defined as&#xD;
      the degree to which a student has achieved educational goals satisfactorily. It is usually&#xD;
      measured through tests or continuous evaluations. Individual differences related to academic&#xD;
      performance have been linked to cognitive and personality aspects (non-cognitive skills). In&#xD;
      cognitive aspects, it has been reported that students with a higher IQ and those who have&#xD;
      greater awareness of effort and achievement tend to have high performance in academic&#xD;
      settings. In addition, it has also been suggested that mental curiosity (measured by&#xD;
      intellectual commitment) has an important influence on academic achievement. In relation to&#xD;
      personality aspects, understood as a set of &quot;attitudes, behaviors and strategies&quot; that&#xD;
      promote academic and professional success. It has been reported that academic&#xD;
      self-efficiency, self-control, motivation, expectation and goal-setting theories, emotional&#xD;
      intelligence and determination are non-cognitive skills that provide a better explanation of&#xD;
      AP. Reported studies on individual differences related to academic performance based on&#xD;
      personality aspects describe self-efficiency, motivation and self-control as the main&#xD;
      indicators of academic performance. Self-efficacy is understood as an individual's belief&#xD;
      that he can do something. Stajković and collaborators demonstrated that self-efficacy is one&#xD;
      of the best predictors of academic success. In addition, they reported that emotional&#xD;
      awareness and stability were predictors of self-efficacy; Students who are motivated tend to&#xD;
      have better academic performance than peers with less motivation; and self-control, in the&#xD;
      academic environment, is related to self-discipline, self-regulation, delay of&#xD;
      self-gratification and impulse control. That is, self-control is the ability to prioritize&#xD;
      long-term objectives over the temptation of short-term impulses. On the other hand,&#xD;
      differences in the environment related to academic performance have been linked to social&#xD;
      aspects, among which the following stand out: family environment, family socioeconomic status&#xD;
      and academic socialization. In the family environment it has been described that the quality&#xD;
      of the relationship between parents and students influences the development of academic&#xD;
      self-efficacy, which in turn will contribute to their AP; With regard to family socioeconomic&#xD;
      status it has been reported that students of parents with lower economic incomes lack an&#xD;
      academic environment at home, which influences their academic success. In particular, books&#xD;
      at home have been associated as one of the most influential factors in student performance,&#xD;
      in addition, highly educated parents (who have improved their family income) tend to have&#xD;
      learning environments more stimulants; Academic socialization is understood as the&#xD;
      interaction that the student establishes with classmates and academic-administrative staff,&#xD;
      studies have linked it to the development of extracurricular activities, which have resulted&#xD;
      in positive relationships between students and high performance. academic which includes the&#xD;
      increase of the rates of attendance to classes, greater school commitment, as well as a&#xD;
      decrease in the rates of abandonment and depression or student frustration. Among the most&#xD;
      studied extracurricular activities is physical exercise that has been shown to improve&#xD;
      academic performance in university students, in addition to increasing neuronal activity in&#xD;
      the brain, especially the increase in executive brain functions, such as attention span and&#xD;
      working memory. A constant factor in aspects of the environment and that seems to permeate&#xD;
      and impose itself on others is the socioeconomic one, where it has been described that&#xD;
      academic socialization can be influenced by family socioeconomic status. The socioeconomic&#xD;
      level also impacts education institutions, in the report Coleman concluded that students who&#xD;
      attend a school in which the average socioeconomic level is high enjoy better educational&#xD;
      results compared to one where, the students have a low socioeconomic level. From the&#xD;
      beginning, parents with a higher socioeconomic status can provide students with financial&#xD;
      support and household resources for individual learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the personal factors of medical students, it has been found that university&#xD;
      students who report stress caused by socioeconomic factors are more likely to have some&#xD;
      psychological morbidity. One possible explanation is that the entrance to the university and&#xD;
      the academic difficulties represent a set of stressful situations that can generate a&#xD;
      temporary emotional lack of control in the students. A diagnostic test is applied at the&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine of the UNAM; in which several areas of conceptual auscultation are&#xD;
      evaluated, it has been shown that the academic background of the baccalaureate play a very&#xD;
      important role in the level of accreditation that is reached in the different subjects of the&#xD;
      medical career. On the other hand, there are certain ways to deal with stress that are&#xD;
      related to better performance. Due to the complexity of the study of AP, it is necessary to&#xD;
      develop holistic models that allow a better approach to reality. Therefore, this work has as&#xD;
      main purpose to establish predictive models that allow predictions of expected academic&#xD;
      performance and timely detection of students in situations of academic risk; and in turn&#xD;
      tutorials, educational guidance, psychological support and / or specialized counseling. In&#xD;
      addition, due to the complex nature of the phenomenon, a qualitative study will be carried&#xD;
      out using phenomenological methodology, which will explore specific social aspects that could&#xD;
      be imperceptible in quantitative tests.&#xD;
