      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Benson relaxation technique on perceived&#xD;
      stress and pain among hemodialysis patients at governmental hospitals in Amman, Jordan at&#xD;
      baseline, post-test, one and two months' follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two large governmental hospitals in Amman, Jordan will be randomly assigned in to&#xD;
      experimental hospital (n=1) and control hospital (n=1). One hundred hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to experimental group (n = 50) and control group (n = 50).&#xD;
      Intervention group will receive the Benson relaxation technique and the control group will&#xD;
      receive a nutrition session. Measures of Perceived stress and pain using the Perceived stress&#xD;
      scale (PSS) and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) will be administered at&#xD;
      pre-test, post-test, one and 2-months follow-up assessment. Data collection will be performed&#xD;
      by two research assistance who are blind to treatment conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study will be calculated to achieve a power of 0.80 with an alpha&#xD;
      significance of 0.05 (2-tailed). The sample size for hemodialysis patients is based on a&#xD;
      previous intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is sample size calculation formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = (Z1-α/2+Z1-β)2 ×2×σ2 (µ1- µ2)2 σ² = (n1 -1) σ 12+ (n2-1) σ 22 (n1+n2)-2 Where, n1 = 44,&#xD;
      σ1= 2.75, and the µ1= 11.52 before the intervention, and n2= 44, σ2 = 2.13 and the µ2 = 10.22&#xD;
      after the intervention (Davanloo &amp; Heidarigorji, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      σ² = (44 -1) 4.02+ (44-1) 4.222 (44+44)-2 σ² = 688+ 765.7612 86 σ² = 1453.7612 86 σ² =&#xD;
      16.9042 n= (1.96+0.84)2 ×2×16.9042 (16.10-13.11)2 n= 7.851204 ×2×16.0497 8.9401&#xD;
&#xD;
      n= 265.4366453 8.9401&#xD;
&#xD;
      n= 29.6902344 n= 30 for each group The study will use cluster randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      design to achieve power of the study (DEFF) estimated to be 1.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 1.3 x 30= 39 n=39 With considering 20% attrition rate= 39/0.8= 48.75. The total sample&#xD;
      size is n= 100. Each group will have 50 participants. Each cluster will have 50 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group will be instructed to perform the Benson relaxation technique two times a&#xD;
      day for 10 minutes during the study period as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interventionist who is qualified in stress management and relaxation will perform the&#xD;
      Benson relaxation technique to the intervention group. The training sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted before dialysis session in a warm quite room with efficient light, temperature, and&#xD;
      ventilation in the hemodialysis department. The interventionist will first teach the&#xD;
      participants how to perform deep breathing, the interventionist will teach the participants&#xD;
      the 334 deep breathing technique for 5 minutes. Then the interventionist will verbally&#xD;
      describe the Benson's relaxation technique for the eligible participants. Patient will also&#xD;
      be instructed to perform the Bensons Relaxation Technique according to the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sit quietly in a comfortable position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Close your eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Deeply relax all your muscles, beginning at your feet, progressing up to your face, and&#xD;
           keep them deeply relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Breathe through your nose. Become aware of your breathing. As you breathe out, say the&#xD;
           word 'one' silently to yourself. For example, breath in . . . out, 'one'; in . . . out,&#xD;
           'one'; etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Continue for 10 min. You may open your eyes to check the time, but do not use an alarm.&#xD;
           When you ﬁnish, sit quietly for several minutes at ﬁrst with closed eyes and later with&#xD;
           opened eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Do not worry about whether you are successful in achieving a deep level of relaxation.&#xD;
           Maintain a passive attitude and permit relaxation to occur at its own pace. When&#xD;
           distracting thoughts occur, ignore them and continue repeating 'one'. With practice, the&#xD;
           response should come with little effort. Practice the technique twice a day, but not&#xD;
           within 2 h after any meal as the digestive processes seem to interfere with the&#xD;
           elicitation of anticipated changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the participants will watch a video of Benson relaxation technique and perform it in&#xD;
      the presence of the interventionist who will provide a feedback by evaluating the&#xD;
      participants' skills in performing the technique. After the training session, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to practice it twice a day for the next two days. Then, the&#xD;
      participant will perform the technique in the presence of the interventionist in order to&#xD;
      ensure that they have acquired sufficient skills. The technique will be repeated if necessary&#xD;
      over one or two sessions until the interventionist confirm that the participants acquired&#xD;
      sufficient skills. A total of two hours will be scheduled for each session and will be&#xD;
      coordinated with the nursing manager of the hemodialysis department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Compact disc (CD) on the relaxation technique will be given to the patients enable to&#xD;
      ensure their effective learning. They will be asked to listen to the Compact disc (CD) only&#xD;
      twice a day at home and simultaneously perform the technique for 10 min for eight weeks. If&#xD;
      performing the technique for the participants should be done twice a day at two specific&#xD;
      times with 7-8-hour interval between each episode. The participants will be emphasized not to&#xD;
      forget to perform the technique. However, if it happened, they will be asked to do it as soon&#xD;
      as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the participants compliance with Benson relaxation technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video of Benson relaxation technique will be displayed in hemodialysis sessions during&#xD;
      the study period to remind the participants to perform Benson relaxation technique. Whenever&#xD;
      the participants have hemodialysis session, they will be performing the first time during the&#xD;
      session and the second time will be at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, a self-reporting &quot;performance record from&quot; will be daily filled out by the participants&#xD;
      to ensure their compliance with Benson's relaxation technique. Every week, the&#xD;
      interventionist will be referring to the hemodialysis unit and will be encouraging the&#xD;
      participants to perform the technique and at the same time, their &quot;performance record forms&quot;&#xD;
      will be collected. Moreover, to ensure that the participants underwent the intervention&#xD;
      appropriately, the participants will perform the technique again in the presence of the&#xD;
      interventionist. Additionally, the interventionist will do a recall sheet and ask the family&#xD;
      member who accompany the participants during hemodialysis sessions to ensure the participants&#xD;
      compliance with Benson relaxation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventionist will take the contact information and number of the participants and the&#xD;
      family member that accompany the participant and keep it in a coding book separately. Then&#xD;
      interventionist will make a group on Whats App for all the participants and send them the&#xD;
      Benson relaxation technique video twice a day in specific times to remind the participants to&#xD;
      perform the technique. Also, the interventionist will make a group on Whats App for the&#xD;
      family member who accompany the participant during the hemodialysis session and send them a&#xD;
      kind reminder as they can remind the participant to perform Benson relaxation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the identification card of the interventionist will be given to the participants&#xD;
      and they will be asked to contact the interventionist if they have any questions during the&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician will be available during the study period in the hemodialysis unite. In case of&#xD;
      emergency cases during intervention period, the physician will perform assessment to the&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be offered the appropriate treatment and medications&#xD;
      according to the physician order and hospital strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualified nutritionist will run out a nutrition package session for hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      in the control group. This nutrition package session will be for one session for one hour.&#xD;
      This session will be conducted before dialysis session in a warm quite room with efficient&#xD;
      light, temperature, and ventilation in the hemodialysis department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the control group will be receiving the routine care at the hemodialysis unite&#xD;
      during the study period. The patients will be receiving the routine care as follows: checking&#xD;
      their vital signs, monitoring dialysis, reaction to the dialysis treatment and medication&#xD;
      from the beginning to the end of the dialysis, and reviewing their medication and lab data.&#xD;
      Furthermore, their medications and conditions will be evaluated and changed based on the&#xD;
      physician's recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent bias, the control group will not be offered any information about Benson&#xD;
      relaxation technique during the study period. However, they are put on a waiting-list to&#xD;
      receive the intervention after the active treatment group does. After the study period, the&#xD;
      interventionist will perform the Benson relaxation technique to the control group. The&#xD;
      training sessions will be conducted before dialysis session in a warm quite room with&#xD;
      efficient light, temperature, and ventilation in the hemodialysis department. The&#xD;
      interventionist will explain the technique verbally and a video of Benson relaxation&#xD;
      technique will be displayed to participants. The technique will be repeated if necessary over&#xD;
      one or two training sessions until the interventionist confirm that the participants in the&#xD;
      control group acquired sufficient skills. Also, a Compact disc (CD) of Benson relaxation&#xD;
      technique and handouts copies on how to elect Benson relaxation technique will be offered to&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician will be available during the study period in the hemodialysis unite. In case of&#xD;
      emergency cases during intervention period, the physician will perform assessment to the&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be offered the appropriate treatment and medications&#xD;
      according to the physician order and hospital strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning for Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to answer the research questions of this&#xD;
      study. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be carried out to determine the normality of&#xD;
      data. The raw data will be checked for normality distribution by using the Skewness and&#xD;
      Kurtosis as well as Smirnov-Kolmogrov tests. Equality of variances will be checked for all&#xD;
      variables using Levine's test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be conducted with presenting frequencies, percentages, median,&#xD;
      range, means and standard deviations for the socio demographic variables among hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients in Amman governmental Jordanian hospitals. Frequencies and percentages will be used&#xD;
      to present the categorical variables. Moreover, Continuous variables will be described using&#xD;
      the central tendency measures (means, and medians), the dispersion measures (standard&#xD;
      deviation), and inter-percentile measures (P25, P50, and P75).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential statistics as well as measures of central and dispersion the paired t test,&#xD;
      analysis of variance for repeated measures, post hoc tests of S-N-K, Duncan, Scheffe and&#xD;
      Tukey will be used to analyze data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of the study's participants will be compared between groups using the&#xD;
      chi-square test for categorical variables and the t-test for continuous variables analysis to&#xD;
      compare groups on demographic variables. After assessing the basic assumptions of the&#xD;
      parametric tests; linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality an Independent-t&#xD;
      test will be used to compare the study's variables at baseline between two groups.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Paired-sample t-test and repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be&#xD;
      used to assess the effectiveness of the Benson relaxation technique intervention on the main&#xD;
      outcome measure over time for both within and between study groups.&#xD;

    <description>Pain is the feeling of unpleasant sensory and discomfort which is experienced by hemodialysis patients. Pain will be measured by scores on the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). The short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) consists of three parts:&#xD;
The first part: consists of 15 descriptive adjectives, 11 sensory and four affective, which are rated on a four point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), yielding three scores.&#xD;
The second part: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which is a 10-centimeter horizontal line from 0 to 10 ranging from &quot;no pain&quot; to the &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.&#xD;
The third part: Present Pain Intensity (PPI), which is a six-point verbal rating scale on rating scale from 0 to 5, the words are: no pain (0), mild pain (1), discomforting (2), distressing (3), horrible (4), and excruciating (5).</description>

    <description>Perceived stress refers to an undesired state of feeling frustrated, anger and nervous of anxious, which is experienced by hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
The level of stress for the hemodialysis patients will be assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. The perceived stress scale (PSS-10) has 10 items on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, 4 = very often). Four positively stated items (item 4, 5, 7, and 8) are reversely scored (0 = very often, 1 = fairy often, 2 = sometimes, 3 = almost never, 4 = never). The sum of the 10 items represents the total score, with higher scores representing higher levels of perceived stress. Individual scores on the Perceived stress score (PSS-10) can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Hemodialysis patients who agree to participate in the study (by consent form).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodialysis patients begin alert, conscious, and oriented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodialysis patients able to read and write in Arabic.&#xD;

          -  Haemodialysis patients being on haemodialysis for at least six months and currently&#xD;
             receiving haemodialysis at a minimum of two times per week. By 6 months, the routine&#xD;
             for the hemodialysis procedure is established, and two times per week is the minimum&#xD;
             number for dialysis sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodialysis patients with physical disability and physical limitation for learning&#xD;
             and performing the Benson relaxation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peritoneal dialysis or a kidney transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are taking antidepressants medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haemodialysis patients with cognitive impairment or mental health issues.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hemodialysis patients with emotional upheaval, such as death of a relative or a family&#xD;
             member and divorce in their family, and those with any problems which had a negative&#xD;
             impact on their mood during the previous month were excluded, The reason for these&#xD;
             exclusions was that these complications might affect the concentration which is&#xD;
             important in the relaxation technique and these patients might have difficulty in&#xD;
             performing this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No co-morbidity with other chronic disease like cancer, heart disease, etc. Diabetes&#xD;
             and hypertension are included, because usually these co-morbidities are a part of&#xD;
             renal failure; excluding them leads to limitation in generalization.&#xD;
