      This study will assess whether it is feasible to remove small breast cancers completely using&#xD;
      the Vacuum Assisted Biopsy (VAB) system System under Ultrasound guidance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In the Netherlands, ≥7000 women undergo surgery for small breast cancers (T1)&#xD;
      every year. In this study, the investigators will evaluate under which conditions it is&#xD;
      possible to excise small breast cancers using the vacuum assisted biopsy (VAB) system under&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) guidance. When successful, this can allow outpatient treatment of a selection&#xD;
      of women with small breast cancers, improving the cosmetic outcome and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Our study aim is to assess whether it is feasible to remove small breast cancers&#xD;
      completely using the VAB system under US guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multi-centre, translational clinical phase II study in 170 women with&#xD;
      cancers ≤15 mm based upon US and MRI measurements, and without mammographic or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of more extensive disease (e.g. microcalcifications or&#xD;
      non-mass enhancement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Women with non-lobular invasive carcinomas, ≤15 mm based upon US and MRI&#xD;
      measurements, no mammographic evidence of more extensive disease (e.g. microcalcifications or&#xD;
      extensive architectural distortion), and sufficient space (roughly ≥6 mm, present or&#xD;
      creatable by injection of saline) between the tumor and the dermis, nipple or pectoral&#xD;
      muscle, are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In 170 women with cancers ≤15 mm based upon US and MRI measurements, and&#xD;
      without mammographic evidence of more extensive disease (e.g. microcalcifications), after&#xD;
      informed consent has been obtained, patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire for&#xD;
      assessment of breast cancer risk, using the Tyrer-Cuzick (or IBIS) model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the tumor will be removed under local anesthesia using the VAB system with US&#xD;
      guidance, through a small skin incision (&lt;0.5 cm). A localization marker will be placed in&#xD;
      the biopsy cavity, to help determine the cavity location. After 3 weeks, the breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery is performed, excising the VAB excision cavity and a ≥1 cm of surrounding&#xD;
      tissue, as deemed appropriate by the attending breast surgeon. A sentinel node biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed in the same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main endpoint of the study is the incidence of successful&#xD;
      complete tumor excision by the VAB system, where successful is defined as having no tumor&#xD;
      foci beyond 1 cm from the edge of the VAB cavity in the surgical re-excision specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Our approach allows testing the feasibility of an innovating approach to remove&#xD;
      breast cancer, with minimal negative effects or possible complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden from this study to the participating patients is the fact that two procedures are&#xD;
      mandatory. This will result in prolonged time from initial diagnosis to end of surgical&#xD;
      treatment. Positive study outcomes can pave the way to minimal invasive treatment in a&#xD;
      selection of women, presenting with small breast tumors.&#xD;

Patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire for assessment of breast cancer risk, using the Tyrer-Cuzick (or IBIS) model.</description>

    <measure>Analyze the difference in quality-of-life and pain experience between VAB excision and surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>In order to analyze the quality-of-life and differences in pain experience after VAE and surgery, patients will be asked to indicate a quality-of-life and pain experience score on the following time points:&#xD;
1 week after the VAB procedure.&#xD;
1 week following the surgical procedure.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be used to measure quality-of-life. All of the scales range from 1 to 4 or 1 to 7. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for the quality-of-life represents a high quality-of-life.</description>
