      There are currently no pharmacological treatments approved to treat borderline personality&#xD;
      disorder (BPD). This trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      brexpiprazole for the treatment of subjects diagnosed with BPD to provide a pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment for BPD.&#xD;
