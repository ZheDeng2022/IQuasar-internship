&#xD;
         12. Subject has previously implanted pacemaker, IVC filter, PFO closure device, ASD&#xD;
             closure device, left atrial appendage closure device OR any cardiac surgical or&#xD;

             study participation.&#xD;

             evidence of arrhythmia control failure (e.g., supraventricular tachycardia while under&#xD;
             rate control or atrial fibrillation while under rhythm control).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             implanting physician, precludes safe defect closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has uncontrolled systemic hypertension at the time of screening, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. In the opinion of the Investigator, patient has anatomic criteria identified during&#xD;
             the screening evaluation and/or the screening echocardiogram that are unfavorable for&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Subject has active infection at the time of screening that cannot be treated.&#xD;
