  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hallux rigidus and hallux valgus are chronic forefoot conditions associated with pain,&#xD;
      inflammation and functional impairment. Topical cannabidiol (CBD) cream has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease inflammation, swelling, and pain response in arthritis models with minimal side&#xD;
      effects, although the intervention has never been studied in hallux valgus or hallux rigidus.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if topical CBD cream is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      pain secondary to hallux rigidus and hallux valgus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hallux rigidus and hallux valgus are chronic forefoot conditions associated with pain,&#xD;
      inflammation and functional impairment. While operative interventions exist, nonoperative&#xD;
      modalities are the mainstay of treatment for most patients. Options include shoe wear&#xD;
      modification, manual and physical therapy, intraarticular injection of corticosteroids or&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and foot orthoses. Oral&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories are the most effective non-operative strategy, but unfortunately, are&#xD;
      associated with major adverse side effects and are contraindicated in many patients. Topical&#xD;
      cannabidiol (CBD) cream has been shown to decrease inflammation, swelling, and pain response&#xD;
      in arthritis models with minimal side effects, although the intervention has never been&#xD;
      studied in hallux valgus or hallux rigidus. This prospective randomized trial will compare&#xD;
      topical CBD cream vs placebo cream for the treatment of pain secondary to hallux valgus and&#xD;
      hallux rigidus. The primary outcome of interest in the change in pre and post-treatment&#xD;
      Visual Analog System (VAS) pain scores. VAS pain score is a measurement on a continuum of&#xD;
      values of pain intensity. The purpose of this study is to determine if topical CBD cream is&#xD;
      an effective treatment for pain secondary to hallux rigidus and hallux valgus.&#xD;

    <description>Weekly visual analog system (VAS) pain scores will be measured daily for four weeks. The VAS pain score is a measure of pain severity. It is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain the patient has experienced.</description>

    <description>The foot function index (FFI) is a questionnaire that measures foot pain and disability. It is self-administered and consists of 23 items divided into 3 subscales (pain, disability, and activity limitation). The pain subcategory consists of 9 questions (scored out of 90) and is a measure of pain in different situations, such as walking with shoes versus barefoot. The disability subcategory consists of 9 questions (scored out of 90) and measures functional activities, such as difficulty walking upstairs. The activity limitation subcategory consists of 5 questions (scored out of 50) and measures limitations caused by the foot problem. All three subcategories are summed together to get a final number, with higher numbers indicating worse pain.</description>
