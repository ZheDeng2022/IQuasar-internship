  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in humans, but low mortality, around 10 / 100,000&#xD;
      patients / year. It differs from other cancers by its high rate of cure, as well as a long&#xD;
      term survival. Numerous treatment techniques are available and of comparable effectiveness:&#xD;
      as a result it must be given importance to the short and long term side effects of these&#xD;
      different treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate brachytherapy with permanent implants is thus one of the standard techniques for the&#xD;
      treatment of localized prostate cancers of favorable grades (WHO grade 1-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison with prostatectomy and RTE, brachytherapy allows low rates of long-term urinary&#xD;
      toxicities, and comparable rates of erectile function preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to erectile dysfunction, their pathophysiology after irradiation is complex and&#xD;
      poorly understood, including damage to the erector apparatus, innervation, vascularization,&#xD;
      and of course the level of libido.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an example, the radiotherapy team of the Lyon Sud hospital showed that the delivering a&#xD;
      the lowest dose of radiation to the pudendal arteries and to the penile bulb during RTE,&#xD;
      leads to erectile preservation rates comparable with those from the literature with nearly&#xD;
      85% of patients with erectile function retained at 2 years . They were also able to&#xD;
      retrospectively show that a lower dose to the pudendal arteries correlated with better&#xD;
      erectile function during brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brachytherapy procedure requires general anesthesia and endorectal ultrasound, which are&#xD;
      optimal conditions for injecting hyaluronic acid between the prostate, rectum, and pudendal&#xD;
      arteries. This gesture has shown to induce very few morbidity. They want to demonstrate that&#xD;
      the injection of hyaluronic acid during prostate brachytherapy will reduce the radiation dose&#xD;
      to the pudendal arteries and penile bulb, and thus improve the rate of preservation of&#xD;
      erectile function in selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized phase III study comparing dyserection rates after CT performed with (Arm A)&#xD;
      and without (Arm B) injection of HA, in a patient population without erectile dysfunction&#xD;
      before treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in humans with an incidence of about 100 / 100,000&#xD;
      cases / year in Europe, but low mortality, around 10 / 100,000 patients / year. It differs&#xD;
      from other cancers by its high rate of cure, as well as a long term survival. Numerous&#xD;
      treatment techniques are available and of comparable effectiveness: as a result it must be&#xD;
      given importance to the short and long term side effects of these different treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate brachytherapy with permanent implants is thus one of the standard techniques for the&#xD;
      treatment of localized prostate cancers of favorable grades (WHO grade 1-2). The overall&#xD;
      survival and survival rates without biochemical recurrence at 5 and 10 years are comparable&#xD;
      to those of other techniques such as prostatectomy or external radiotherapy (RTE), exceeding&#xD;
      95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison with prostatectomy and RTE, brachytherapy allows low rates of long-term urinary&#xD;
      toxicities, and comparable rates of erectile function preservation.&#xD;

      leads to erectile preservation rates comparable with those from the literature with nearly&#xD;
      85% of patients with erectile function retained at 2 years (18.5% moderate erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction at 2 years, for moderate to severe degradation rates usually seen between 30 and&#xD;
      70% after external beam radiotherapy. They were also able to retrospectively show that a&#xD;
      lower dose to the pudendal arteries correlated with better erectile function during&#xD;
      brachytherapy.&#xD;
