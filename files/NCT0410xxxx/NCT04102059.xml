      The term work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) is defined according to the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO), as a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative diseases and&#xD;
      disorders that result in pain and functional impairment. They arise when individuals are&#xD;
      exposed to work activities and conditions that significantly contribute to their development&#xD;
      or exacerbation, but which may not be their sole cause (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another definition The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health defined WRMDs as&#xD;
      &quot;an injury of the muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, joints, cartilage, bones, or blood&#xD;
      vessels in the arms, legs, head, neck, or back that is caused or aggravated by work tasks&#xD;
      such as lifting, pushing, and pulling(3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They represent the second largest cause of short-term or temporary work disability after the&#xD;
      common cold (6).Apart from lowering the quality of workers' life and reducing the&#xD;
      productivity, WRMDs are the most expensive form of work disability, attributing to about 40%&#xD;
      of all costs toward the treatment of work-related injuries(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that almost one-third of all cases of sick leave among health care workers&#xD;
      are related to musculoskeletal disorders(8).According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)&#xD;
      in 2013, WRMDs cases accounted for 33% of all worker injury and illness cases(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most WRMSDs develop over time with usually, no single cause but various factors work in&#xD;
      combination. According to the European Occupational Safety and Health Agency (EU-OSHA), the&#xD;
      most common physical causes and organizational risk factors of musculoskeletal disorders&#xD;
      (MSDs) include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prolonged sitting or standing in the same position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performing the same task over and over&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuing work while injured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Awkward and static postures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Load handling, especially when bending and twisting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repetitive or forceful movements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insufficient work breaks(7,10-12).&#xD;

      Nurses have to perform many physically demanding tasks such as transferring patients in and&#xD;
      out of bed, lifting patients onto a bed, and continually maintaining bent-forward or twisted&#xD;
      postures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of WRMDs :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Muscle strain: Overstretching or overexertion of a muscle or tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tendonitis and tenosynovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nerve injury: Carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rotator cuff injuries (affects the shoulder)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Epicondylitis (affects the elbow)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Trigger finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Low back injuries (16,17). A previous cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary&#xD;
           care hospital in Chennai (India)2013 among dentists, laboratory technicians, nurses,&#xD;
           physicians, and physiotherapists of various clinical departments. It showed that&#xD;
           irrespective of regions, musculoskeletal problems during last 12 months was reported by&#xD;
           56% of nurses 55% of physiotherapists, 54% of dentists, 39% of laboratory technicians&#xD;
           and 38% of physicians. About half (50.7%) of the participants reported symptoms&#xD;
           involving at least one part of their bodies. Among all the symptoms, low back pain (LBP)&#xD;
           was the highest (45.7%), followed by neck pain (28.5%) and shoulder pain (23.5%),&#xD;
           whereas hip/thigh pain (7.1%) and elbow pain (5%) was the least reported(7). A&#xD;
           descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers in Lahore,&#xD;
           Pakistan, Muscle aches/ muscle strains were mostly reported among nurses (38.6%) (19).A&#xD;
           cross sectional study was conducted among nurses working in Mansoura Children University&#xD;
           Hospital during the period from January to May 2017. The prevalence of musculoskeletal&#xD;
           complaints among nurses was 85.9 % .The most common sites were elbow (85.2%) followed by&#xD;
           pelvis/ thigh (74.9%) and wrist (64.6%). Surprisingly the least site for pain was low&#xD;
           back pain (37%)(20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross sectional study is implemented on 135 female nurses in Suez Canal University Hospital&#xD;
      and Ismailia About 113(83.7%) of the participants reported musculoskeletal symptoms(21).&#xD;
