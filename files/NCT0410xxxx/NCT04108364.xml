  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rising life expectancy is leading to a rising incidence of strokes worldwide. Approximately&#xD;
      one third of people who had a stroke live with a communication disorder, aphasia, which is&#xD;
      associated with the largest negative relationship to quality of life. In chronic stages,&#xD;
      people with aphasia (PwA) often do not receive any rehabilitation, despite treatment being&#xD;
      shown to significantly reduce impairment. In contrast to existing computerized aphasia&#xD;
      treatment, VoiceAdapt is an innovative and motivating application for PwA that provides&#xD;
      adaptive and context-aware training lessons via speech interaction on the mobile device. A&#xD;
      user-centred design process and motivational gamification ensure long-term engagement in&#xD;
      training. Through providing an autonomously usable and low-cost tool, VoiceAdapt will&#xD;
      positively affect PwA's self-esteem and social inclusion, leading to higher quality of life.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study proposed in this ethics application is to examine the impact of an&#xD;
      adaptive speech-language treatment app, created using principles of user-centred design, on&#xD;
      language and communication outcomes of people with aphasia (PwA) within a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly one third of individuals who have a stroke will present with aphasia, a communication&#xD;
      impairment that affects the ability to speak, understand, read and write. People with aphasia&#xD;
      (PwA) have been shown to demonstrate more limitations in their participation in daily&#xD;
      activities, lower quality of life and a higher incidence of depression relative to&#xD;
      post-stroke individuals without aphasia, even when other factors such as physical ability,&#xD;
      social support and well-being were similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goals of the VoiceAdapt research project are to: 1) conduct a needs survey with&#xD;
      PwA and speech-language pathologists (SLPs); 2) develop an app employing a user-centred&#xD;
      design process; and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial. Using user-centred design, end&#xD;
      users and stakeholders (PwA, therapists and formal/informal caregivers) will be engage din a&#xD;
      needs survey during the technology development process. Outcomes will be analyzed to&#xD;
      elaborate implications for decision makers as to how to implement such adaptive training&#xD;
      environments in stroke rehabilitation. This aspect of the research (i.e., Goals 1 &amp; 2) will&#xD;
      be carried out by consortium members in Austria and Germany. Only the randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (Goal 3), which is the subject of the present application, will be conducted at the&#xD;
      University of Alberta and the University of Toronto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PwA will be provided with a personalized speech-language treatment app (i.e., on a tablet),&#xD;
      which automatically adapts the exercises to the users' actual skill level. Individual&#xD;
      learning progress of PwA will be supported by personalized and gamified training elements to&#xD;
      achieve higher compliance and adherence to the exercises. As a primary outcome, the adaptive&#xD;
      assistive technology will examine language performance related to the specific intervention&#xD;
      of the personalized speech-language treatment app. Additional objectives will examine the&#xD;
      change in the overall language and communication functioning of PwA; the well-being and&#xD;
      quality of life of PwA and their caregiver's perception of communication effectiveness after&#xD;
      intervention with the treatment app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be carried out by the VoiceAdapt Consortium, which brings together the&#xD;
      resources of five participating international institutions. Research partners have expertise&#xD;
      in the fields of technology/e-health and graphical design skills (Nurogames, NG),&#xD;
      personalization and adaptvitiy (Technical University of Berlin, TUB), user-centred design and&#xD;
      gamification/persuasion (Austrian Institute of Technology, AIT), and clinical research and&#xD;
      intervention studies (University of Toronto, UoT; University of Alberta, UoA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at the University of Alberta and University of Toronto will be the primary&#xD;
      investigators of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) portion of the VoiceAdapt Project. The&#xD;
      RCT will involve 80 PwA in total across University of Alberta and University of Toronto&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the RCT: The RCT will be a two arm, randomized, waitlist-controlled, crossover&#xD;
      group design. In Phase 1, PWA randomized to the intervention group will train with&#xD;
      VoiceAdapt. The control group will be a waitlist treatment-deferred group. In Phase 2, the&#xD;
      control group will train with VoiceAdapt. The randomization of participants will be achieved&#xD;
      by computer-generated assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: All participants will have suffered a left hemisphere stroke, be at least 6&#xD;
      months post-onset, and will have aphasia as defined by performance on the Western Aphasia&#xD;
      Battery - Rev. (Aphasia Quotient greater than or equal to 30, with a prominent verbal&#xD;
      expression impairment), but type of aphasia will not be an inclusion criterion. Participants&#xD;
      will speak English as their primary language, pass screenings of visual perception, hearing&#xD;
      and basic cognitive functioning and be willing to commit to participation for the study&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Each intervention phase will last for 5 weeks. During this period, participants&#xD;
      in the experimental condition will be asked to do speech language tasks 5 days a week for 60&#xD;
      minutes via the VoiceAdapt app (intervention group). The control group will not be engaged in&#xD;
      any one on one speech therapy during the first intervention phase (Phase 1). During the&#xD;
      second intervention phase (Phase 2), the control group will participate in training with the&#xD;
      VoiceAdapt app (60 minutes/day x 5 days/week) and the intervention group from Phase 1 will&#xD;
      crossover into receiving no treatment. Research staff will check in with individuals in the&#xD;
      intervention group on a weekly basis to monitor and adjust treatment exercises. Research&#xD;
      staff will check in with participants in the control group twice during their respective&#xD;
      control phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: In line with the recommended core outcome measures for aphasia research&#xD;
      (Wallace et al., 2019), participants in both groups will be tested before and after each&#xD;
      condition on the following measures: the primary outcome measure will be the Boston Naming&#xD;
      Test (BNT) to measure naming; secondary outcome measures will be: Western Aphasia&#xD;
      Battery-Revised (WAB-R); Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale (SAQOL-39) to measure&#xD;
      quality of life; and Communication Effectiveness Index (CETI) to measure the person with&#xD;
      aphasia and the partners' perception of the participant's communication. In addition to these&#xD;
      measures, the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) and an end of study questionnaire will be&#xD;
      provided to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be a one-sided hypothesis test of the null hypothesis of the change&#xD;
      in naming on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) from baseline to week 6, tested at the 0.1 level of&#xD;
      significance. The observed change on the BNT as well as the baseline, 6 week and follow up&#xD;
      values will be summarized for each group as means and standard deviations. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be summarized using means (SD), medians (IQR) or proportions (CI), and analyzed using t&#xD;
      tests, as appropriate. All analyses will be presented in aggregate.&#xD;
