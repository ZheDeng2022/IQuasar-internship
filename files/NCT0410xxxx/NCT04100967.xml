    <textblock>
      This two-year prospective, observational study examines the relationship between habitual&#xD;
      short sleep and weight gain, as well as the association between habitual short sleep and&#xD;
      behaviors that put people at risk of weight gain. Habitual short sleep is defined as sleeping&#xD;
      &lt;6 hours per night on average. Participants will be healthy freshmen college students who are&#xD;
      normal weight or overweight. Exclusion criteria include pregnancy, an inability to be&#xD;
      ambulatory, currently taking a medication that could influence or interfere with sleep, or&#xD;
      reporting a past/current neurological problem, past/current head injury, past/current sleep&#xD;
      disorder, current mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder, current psychosis, or current&#xD;
      suicidal ideation/plans. Recruitment will be during new student orientations that occur prior&#xD;
      to fall semester. Eligibility will be determined using a screening interview, the DSM-5&#xD;
      Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure - Adult, and DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 2&#xD;
      measures. Eligible participants will be assessed at baseline (time 1), and 8, 16, and 24&#xD;
      months after Time 1. Sleep, physical activity, food/beverages, substance use, and technology&#xD;
      use will be collected daily during each eight day recording period. Sleep will be measured&#xD;
      with a sleep monitor, activity will be assessed using an accelerometer, food/beverages will&#xD;
      be obtained using the National Cancer Institute's Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary&#xD;
      Assessment Tool, and substance use and technology use will be measured via self-report.&#xD;
      Participants will attend a session after each recording period to have weight and height&#xD;
      measured, be scanned via Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and complete a packet of&#xD;
      questionnaires about demographics, health, sleep quality and beliefs, life events, food&#xD;
      cravings, and physical development. It is hypothesized that participants will have different&#xD;
      habitual sleep trajectories over time. It is also hypothesized that two particular sleep&#xD;
      trajectories (stable habitual short sleep and increasingly shorter habitual sleep across&#xD;
      time) will be significantly related to weight gain, increased body fat percent, and weight&#xD;
      gain risk behaviors (i.e., increased caloric intake and decreased physical activity).&#xD;
      Finally, it is hypothesized that the two sleep trajectories will be significantly associated&#xD;
      with higher rates of media and technology use and higher rates of problematic sleep-related&#xD;
      beliefs/behaviors.&#xD;
