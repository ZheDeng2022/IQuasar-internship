  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have significantly higher levels of&#xD;
      unemployment and underemployment compared to their typically developing peers and all other&#xD;
      groups with neurodevelopmental disorders, even though major companies that have employed and&#xD;
      trained young people with ASD acclaim their significant innovations in their companies. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to examine the effects of specialized employment support programs, over&#xD;
      current traditional vocational rehabilitation approaches, for adults with ASD on their&#xD;
      ability to maintain steady employment and overall benefit to the organizations at which they&#xD;
      will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that Stanford University's Neurodiversity at Work (NaW) Program&#xD;
      will improve employment outcomes and positively impact the overall quality of life of&#xD;
      individuals with ASD in this program. The investigators hope that the findings of the study&#xD;
      will lead to the advancement of programs aimed to support individuals with ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, there has been limited research examining effects of specialized employment support&#xD;
      programs (such as Stanford's Neurodiversity at Work) for adults with ASD. Results from this&#xD;
      study will have substantial positive impact on the field because they will significantly&#xD;
      elevate the investigators' understanding of the factors involved in successful employment and&#xD;
      QoL outcomes in individuals with ASD. Furthermore, understanding the trajectories of&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms, employment outcomes and QoL will facilitate the development of&#xD;
      educational tools, training materials and intervention tools to help in improving overall&#xD;
      outcomes of individuals with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four specific aims that the investigators hope will contribute towards the&#xD;
      advancement and proliferation of programs, such as Stanford's Neurodiversity at Work (NaW)&#xD;
      aimed to support individuals with ASD, both in in the workplace and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' first aim is to compare job retention rates resulting from NaW starting&#xD;
      before onboarding and NaW starting 6 months after onboarding (NaW-DS) for adults with ASD, as&#xD;
      well as compare duration of sustained employment for NaW and NaW-DS (NaW-delayed start).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to compare the change in QoL between NaW and NaW-DS for adults with ASD at&#xD;
      month 15 past onboarding. The investigators predict that NaW will result in a higher QoL, as&#xD;
      measured by the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-100), in adults&#xD;
      with ASD, compared to NaW-DS. The investigators also have an exploratory aim of determining&#xD;
      costs of employee turnover achieved from the NaW and NaW-DS, as well as comparing rates of&#xD;
      job offers between specialized internship programs (IP) and specialized pre-employment&#xD;
      training programs (PT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, behavioral assessments will be administered to participants throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the study as additional exploratory measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide an evidence base for the understanding of trajectories&#xD;
      of psychiatric symptoms, employment outcomes and QoL will facilitate the development of&#xD;
      education tools, training materials and intervention tools to help improving overall outcomes&#xD;
      of individuals with ASD.&#xD;

This scale consists of four domains: physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment. A higher score indicates a better quality of life, while a lower score indicates a lower quality of life. There is a total of 100 items in this scale. The minimum score is 100, with the highest score being 500. The five point scale ranges from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot; Extremely&quot; (or &quot;Completely&quot; or &quot;Very satisfied&quot;). Subscales are combined to produce a total score.</description>

    <description>The Affective Commitment Scale's items were written to assess affective orientation towards the organization. Some responses are reverse-coded, so higher and lower scores do not necessarily point to similar results across the board. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly agree.&quot; Scores range from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 56.</description>

    <description>This scale measures perceived job satisfaction. It consists of 8 individual questions with various response options, including a scale ranging from &quot;Strongly agree&quot; to &quot;Strongly disagree&quot;, a &quot;Yes/No&quot; option, a second scale ranging from &quot;Very dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;Very satisfied,&quot; and an item in which participants are asked to score their satisfaction by way of percentage allocation.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months after onboarding, 12 months after onboarding, and 18 months after onboarding.</time_frame>
    <description>A 17-item scale aimed at measuring one's work engagement within a current job. Each item is rated using either one the following 6-point scales: specific (1 = a few times a year or less; 6 = every day) or broad (0 = never; 1 = almost never; 6 = always). Both scales include an option for 'never' (0). The minimum score is 0, with the maximum score being 102. A higher score indicates greater levels of engagement and motivation, with a lower score indicating lower levels of the aforementioned qualities.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months after onboarding, 12 months after onboarding, and 18 months after onboarding.</time_frame>
    <description>An 11-item scale which measures relative financial comfort and well-being. Items are scored in multiple-choice form as well as three Likert-scale items. Multiple-choice items vary in language but generally aim to measure the degree to which the participant is able to cover necessary expenses and their feelings regarding their financial situation. Some items are reverse-scored, thus making a higher/lower score not necessarily indicative of financial well-being or lack thereof.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months after onboarding, 12 months after onboarding, and 18 months after onboarding.</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Spectrum Quotient was developed by the Autism Research Centre to test if adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome are just an extreme on a dimension of autistic traits that runs right through the general population. This scale is comprised of 50 items and the four point scale ranges from &quot;Definitely agree&quot; to &quot;Definitely disagree.&quot; Higher and lower scores are irrelevant, as the scales are often reversed within this instrument.</description>
