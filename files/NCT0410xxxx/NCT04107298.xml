These responses are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4, (0=unable to do, 4=no difficulty). Subscale scores are determined by dividing the weighted answers by the maximum possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Each score ranges from 0-100 with lower scores indicating lower performance. The overall score is the average of all 3 subscores.</description>

             estimate. A maximum of two lesions may be treated. The two lesions may be in one&#xD;
             infrapopliteal vessel or in two distinct infrapopliteal vessels. Note: Tandem lesions&#xD;
             may be considered a single lesion if they are separated by ≤30 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After pre-dilatation, the target lesion has ≤70% residual stenosis, absence of a flow&#xD;
             limiting dissection (Grade D or greater) and treatable with available device matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patent inflow artery free from significant stenosis (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by&#xD;

          -  Target lesion requires treatment with alternative therapy such as stenting, laser,&#xD;
             atherectomy, cryoplasty, brachytherapy, or re-entry devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant target vessel tortuosity or other parameters prohibiting access to the&#xD;
