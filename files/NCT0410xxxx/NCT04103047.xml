      The aim of this study is to assess how the use of a breathing tube (Supraglottic Airway&#xD;
      Device) can affect the function of the jaw joint (Temporomandibular joint) movement. This&#xD;
      type of breathing tube is used for nearly 60% of general anaesthetics. To facilitate&#xD;
      insertion of this breathing tube, assisted mouth opening and forward movement of the jaw are&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These movements occur at the jaw joint (temporomandibular joint). In addition, for the&#xD;
      duration of the operation the mouth is kept slightly open by a breathing tube. There are a&#xD;
      few case reports in the literature suggesting minor effect on the jaw joint. Therefore, we&#xD;
      wish to study this further by evaluating the function of the jaw joint, 4 to 24 hours after&#xD;
      the operation.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) are part of the mainstay&#xD;
           of anaesthetic practice, being the primary airway management device in 56% of general&#xD;
           anaesthetics. SADs are used by both novice and experienced anaesthetists, in addition to&#xD;
           anaesthetic practitioners, non-anaesthetic clinicians and other health care&#xD;
           professionals. They are routinely used to deliver anaesthetic gases and oxygen to the&#xD;
           patient during general anaesthesia. In an airway emergency, for example in the case of&#xD;
           failed intubation, a second-generation SAD has been recommended as a rescue device to&#xD;
           maintain oxygenation. This can also then be used as a conduit to intubate the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although insertion of SADs considered to be relatively easy, it requires certain&#xD;
           manoeuvres. These include extension of the head and neck flexion, use of a jaw thrust&#xD;
           with adequate mouth opening, and then introduction of the device with a firm and gentle&#xD;
           motion down and backwards along the hard palate. These methods are thought to improve&#xD;
           the time to successful insertion of the SAD. Whilst movements such as these can be&#xD;
           viewed as simple and 'benign', investigators are concerned that these can cause&#xD;
           dysfunction of temporomandibular joint dysfunction in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Most published research has been focused on insertion success and time taken to insert&#xD;
           the device. There has been limited research and literature about complications following&#xD;
           SAD insertion, such as gastric aspiration, trauma to or loss of the airway, and about&#xD;
           best insertion techniques, as mentioned above, including use of thermally softened SADs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, there are few reports of TMJ dysfunction and dislocation following SAD&#xD;
           insertion under general anaesthesia. This may be due in part to general anaesthesia&#xD;
           causing reduced muscle tone and greater joint mobility, but investigators assume a&#xD;
           degree of dysfunction is due to passive manipulation of the TMJ with forward movement of&#xD;
           the jaw and widened mouth opening for a prolonged period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some TMJ dysfunction may also be attributed to use of the SAD itself being in situ for a&#xD;
           prolonged period, where the cuff of the device occupies the oropharynx causing forward&#xD;
           displacement of the jaw. The recommended duration of SAD insertion ranges from one to&#xD;
           four hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Proposed study This study aims to evaluate the degree of TMJ dysfunction in the&#xD;
           postoperative period, in patients where a SAD has been used a primary airway device. The&#xD;
           study will be conducted at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire National&#xD;
           Health Service (NHS) Trust and Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, part of the University&#xD;
           Hospital of Birmingham NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A member of the research team will approach eligible patients preoperatively to explain&#xD;
           the study, provide written information and obtain written consent. Consenting&#xD;
           participants will then be asked to complete a questionnaire and the member of the&#xD;
           research team will measure and record an airway assessment including jaw movements. Post&#xD;
           anaesthesia, participants will again be approached to complete a questionnaire and the&#xD;
           research team member will re-measure jaw movements. The preoperative responses and&#xD;
           measurements will be compared with those of postoperative responses and measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Study population Those patients who undergo general anaesthesia for surgery, in whom&#xD;
           the SAD will be used as the primary airway device.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Treatment / Intervention (if applicable) The decision regarding the method of airway&#xD;
           management is decided by the patient's responsible anaesthetist, according to the&#xD;
           clinical indication. There is no additional treatment or intervention as a result of&#xD;
           this study, it is purely observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RATIONALE 2.1 Aims and hypothesis The aim of this study is to assess for an objective&#xD;
           difference between pre- and post-operative jaw movements following the use of SADs, and&#xD;
           to identify any subjective discomfort or perceived difference in TMJ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      SADs are commonly used in anaesthetic and non-anaesthetic practice. SADs are placed by&#xD;
      clinicians of varying expertise, frequently using simple airway manoeuvres or the triple&#xD;
      airway manoeuvre to aid correct placement. Historically research has been carried out&#xD;
      regarding methods to aid correct SAD positioning and time to correct positioning, and also&#xD;
      regarding complications following the use of SADs as reported in 4th national audit project&#xD;
      of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society. In recent years case&#xD;
      reports have been published concerning TMJ dislocation and dysfunction after the use of the&#xD;
      SAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      are unaware of any studies investigating TMJ function after routine use of SAD under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia. If there is a significant deterioration in the function of TMJ during&#xD;
      postoperative period further guidance need to be devised on safe use of SADs. If there are no&#xD;
      differences, this will reassure the common and routine practice of use of SADs. If a&#xD;
      difference is found, it could lead to a change in education and improved clinical practice,&#xD;
      ultimately enhancing patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Assessment and management of risk This study is of patients' pre- and post-operative TMJ&#xD;
      function. Investigators will be approaching the patients in these periods to take part in&#xD;
      completing a short questionnaire, and also taking measurements of jaw movements. Patient&#xD;
      management will not be affected by the study. Investigators do not anticipate any additional&#xD;
      risks or benefits to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY DESIGN This is a semi-qualitative questionnaire study of patients to assess TMJ&#xD;
      function after the airway has been secured with a SAD during general anaesthesia. The study&#xD;
      protocol will be discussed with the local research and development department and appropriate&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee (REC) approval will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult surgical patients who are due to undergo general anaesthesia and requiring SAD&#xD;
      insertion will be identified on the day of surgery. These patients will then be approached&#xD;
      and given patient information sheet. They will be given adequate time to read the information&#xD;
      sheet and any questions will be answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be asked to complete a pre-operative questionnaire and jaw movements&#xD;
      (mouth opening = inter-incisor distance, jaw protrusion= the distance between the upper and&#xD;
      lower incisors when the lower jaw is fully protruded) and lateral jaw movements = right and&#xD;
      left lateral sliding of lower jaw = distance between upper and lower molars) will be measured&#xD;
      by one of the research team member. The above procedure will be repeated 4 to 24 hours in the&#xD;
      post-operative period using post-operative patient questionnaire and measurements of jaw&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size From our previous research on evaluating the correlation between airway&#xD;
      assessment parameters and depth of cricothyroid membrane, the observed mean for inter-incisor&#xD;
      distance (IID) was 45.5 mm with standard deviation 8.1. Investigators considered a reduction&#xD;
      in IID following used of SAD is clinically significant. Assuming a mean baseline IID of 35-&#xD;
      45 mm, with a pow-er of 90% power to detect a 10% reduction in IID with p&lt;0.05, in total 120&#xD;
      patients were needed. Using G*Power 3.1.9.4 confirmed that a sample size of 120 using a&#xD;
      paired t-test with 2 tails will allow detection of significant. In total, 130 patients will&#xD;
      be recruited to overcome dropouts and incomplete data. Once screened, eligible patients will&#xD;
      be given information leaflets explaining the reason for the study, and any questions&#xD;
      answered. Following written consent, patients will be given a questionnaire to be completed&#xD;
      and jaw movements as described above will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. TRIAL PROCEDURES The suitable patients for the study will be screened from the operating&#xD;
      theatre list. During the preoperative assessment one of the investigator or co-investigator&#xD;
      will provide patient information sheet. Patients will be given adequate time to read the&#xD;
      information and any questions will be answered. If they are satisfied and willing to take&#xD;
      part in the study, written consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Recruitment Both Chief investigator and co-investigators identify the suitable operating&#xD;
      list. Then the suitable patients will be identified based on the scheduled surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Only those patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.1 Patient identification&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients undergoing surgery that requires tracheal intubation are suitable to be included&#xD;
      in the study. Based on the scheduled surgery on the operating list, the suitable patients&#xD;
      will be identified. During the preoperative assessment one of the investigator or&#xD;
      co-investigator will provide patient information sheet. Patients will be given adequate time&#xD;
      to read the information and any questions will be answered. If they are satisfied and willing&#xD;
      to take part in the study, written consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.2 Payment There are no associated payments for participation in this study as no extra&#xD;
      expenses are expected to be incurred by the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Consent Participants will be given enough time to read the patient information leaflet&#xD;
      (minimum of 2 hours). Once they have read the information, any questions will be answered. If&#xD;
      they agree for the study, they will be asked to complete the consent form. The consent will&#xD;
      be obtained by chief investigator, coinvestigator or one of the research team member,&#xD;
      supervised by one of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Baseline data Base line data includes gender, age, weight, height, BMI &amp; American Society&#xD;
      Anesthesiologist (ASA) score Airway assessment includes Mallampati score, thyromental&#xD;
      distance, mouth opening and neck movement&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Using the patient questionnaire, the following will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient mouth opening and pain at the temporomandibular joint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yes and no answers to questions regarding TMJ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will then record:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mouth opening = inter-incisor distance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jaw protrusion= the distance between the upper and lower incisors when the lower jaw is&#xD;
           fully protruded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lateral jaw movements = right and left lateral sliding of lower jaw = distance between&#xD;
           upper and lower molars on lateral sliding&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.5 Long term follow-up assessments There is no long term follow-up for this study. The&#xD;
      participant will only be approached twice as described as above. Once pre-operatively and&#xD;
      once postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Sample size calculation From our previous research on evaluating the correlation between&#xD;
      airway assessment parameters and depth of cricothyroid membrane, the observed mean for&#xD;
      inter-incisor distance (IID) was 45.5 mm with standard deviation 8.1. A 10% reduction in IID&#xD;
      following use of SAD was considered to be clinically significant. Assuming a mean baseline&#xD;
      IID of 35- 45 mm, with a power of 90% power to detect a 10% reduction in IID with p&lt;0.05, a&#xD;
      total of 120 patients are needed. Using G*Power 3.1.9.4 confirmed that a sample size of 120&#xD;
      using a paired t-test with 2 tails will allow detection of significant. Investigators aim to&#xD;
      recruit 130 patients to overcome drop outs and incomplete data. Once screened, eligible&#xD;
      patients will be given information leaflets explaining the reason for the study, and any&#xD;
      questions answered. Following written consent, patients will be given a questionnaire to be&#xD;
      completed and jaw movements as described above will be measured.&#xD;
