      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the impact of art therapy within this specific perinatal client group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attempt to establish a quality evidence base for the intervention within this setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capture the participants lived experience of Art Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure participant interaction with art materials during Art Therapy intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure any changes in mental wellbeing of the participants during Art Therapy&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor patient reported quality of life during Art Therapy intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record changes in mother-infant interaction during Art Therapy intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The measures will show an improvement in mental wellbeing, quality of life and&#xD;
           mother-infant interaction in participants who receive the Art Therapy intervention&#xD;
           compared to the baseline measurements taken at the start of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The wait-list control group who have not yet received the intervention will display&#xD;
           lower scores on the above measures, prior to receiving the Art Therapy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to measure the impact of art therapy within this specific perinatal&#xD;
      client group in order to attempt to establish an evidence base for the intervention within&#xD;
      this setting; while following a primarily quantitative approach with complimentary&#xD;
      qualitative elements. Art Therapy is a form of psychotherapy, based upon the premise of&#xD;
      utilising art materials as a form of expression and communication; the roots of the&#xD;
      theoretical approach lie in a psychodynamic approach to working with the unconscious.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I intend to use a wait-list control group, whereby following admission to the unit a patient&#xD;
      will follow the recruitment process detailed below, only after the recruitment process has&#xD;
      been completed in full would consenting patients be randomised to an intervention group which&#xD;
      will begin Art Therapy sessions in due course, or to a wait-list control group for a minimum&#xD;
      of two weeks and a maximum of six weeks. The intervention group members will receive the Art&#xD;
      Therapy intervention, while the waitlist control group are fully aware of the research and&#xD;
      are waiting to receive it at a later date. The waitlist participants will be made fully aware&#xD;
      that if they are discharged before therapy has become available to them, or if they reach the&#xD;
      maximum term of 6 weeks on the waiting list, then they may not receive the intervention.&#xD;
      Participants who reach the maximum term of 6 weeks on the waiting list while waiting for&#xD;
      therapy availability will be withdrawn from the research and offered a debrief meeting in&#xD;
      order to answer any remaining questions about the research. This maximum six week term is&#xD;
      based upon the six week average duration of patient stay within the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I am a qualified Art Psychotherapist and will be using a non-directive approach in order that&#xD;
      the clients will lead their interactions with the art materials and with the therapy process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Art Therapists are governed by the British Association of Art Therapists and the Health and&#xD;
      Care Professions council who each set standards of professional therapy delivery. I will&#xD;
      establish and facilitate a safe therapeutic provision of weekly individual Art Therapy&#xD;
      sessions for patients of the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I will work closely with the unit staff team in order to introduce and create a shared&#xD;
      understanding about the therapeutic intentions of the art therapy provision. The additional&#xD;
      benefit of employing a non-directive, client centred approach to Art Therapy sessions is that&#xD;
      this will ensure that the clients themselves have key influence over the theme and artistic&#xD;
      content of therapy sessions. The client presentation will then be analysed using a series of&#xD;
      recognised quantitative scales to monitor client progress, therefore minimising the influence&#xD;
      of the multiple therapists on the research data and increasing the quality of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an initial assessment period within the intervention. This will consist of one&#xD;
      session of 50 minute duration, during which an assessment will be made about the clients&#xD;
      interaction with art materials. This will be conducted by utilising the Hyland Moon approach&#xD;
      of categorising art materials as high or low structure based on their properties. High&#xD;
      structure materials being easy to control versus low structure materials being more fluid in&#xD;
      nature and therefore more challenging to work with. The differing art making experiences and&#xD;
      client interactions that these varying art materials can produce will be valuable in gaining&#xD;
      an insight into the clients functioning, in order to facilitate an assessment of the&#xD;
      appropriateness of the intervention within the context of each individuals presentation and&#xD;
      diagnoses. Following assessment, both the client and the therapist will have the opportunity&#xD;
      to either withdraw or consent to continuation of the intervention. Should the therapist&#xD;
      determine following assessment that Art Therapy is not appropriate for the patient, for&#xD;
      example in the instance that the patients presentation is so severe that an offering of Art&#xD;
      Therapy may pose a risk to the therapist or the patient, or that the level of willingness to&#xD;
      engage in the assessment phase (in spite of consent previously given) is so lacking that a&#xD;
      continued offering is not sustainable, then the patient will be withdrawn from the research.&#xD;
      In this instance, a letter will be provided to the patient, inviting them to return for a&#xD;
      re-assessment for Art Therapy sessions, at such point as they feel ready to do so in future&#xD;
      after a minimum period of two weeks have elapsed since prior assessment. The length of each&#xD;
      clients engagement with the Art Therapy sessions, i.e. number of sessions provided, will vary&#xD;
      due to the nature of the population. However, the average stay for a client within the unit&#xD;
      is 42 days and they would be eligible for inclusion in the research from the point of&#xD;
      admission, subject to consent and recruitment procedures. The intention will be to offer a&#xD;
      series of five sessions of therapy following assessment. Should the patient be discharged&#xD;
      prior to the end of therapy, the option will be offered of returning to the unit for the&#xD;
      remaining sessions as an outpatient. The use of qualitative and quantitative data collection&#xD;
      methods will account for capturing the complexity of the intervention. The provision of this&#xD;
      intervention within the unit is over and above what the unit's &quot;care as usual&quot; plan is,&#xD;
      because an Art therapy service does not currently exist in the setting. The following&#xD;
      measurement scales are already in use as standard practice within the perinatal unit,&#xD;
      therefore staff are comfortable with their application and credibility within the NHS&#xD;
      setting. In order to honour the multidisciplinary approach to working with the patients, I&#xD;
      therefore intend to have continuity in measures and will employ all of these scales at&#xD;
      intervals throughout the participants engagement in therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of quantitative measures within the research will mitigate against bias and the&#xD;
      influencer of the researcher on the research findings, by presenting statistical data which&#xD;
      will then be analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics software and reviewed by my supervisors. In&#xD;
      addition to this, an element of influence will be eliminated via the fact that student&#xD;
      therapists will also be delivering the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weekly questionnaires (ReQol10 and Bethlem Mother-Infant Interaction Scale) will be&#xD;
      administered by the unit care team as part of their standard care plan, the researcher has&#xD;
      requested permission from the patient (within the patient consent form) to access the&#xD;
      patients medical records to withdraw the weekly scores from these questionnaires, for&#xD;
      anonymous inclusion within the research data. This will avoid patients being asked to&#xD;
      complete weekly duplicates of these questionnaires that they will already be completing with&#xD;
      the unit care team. The researcher and therapists will already be authorised to have access&#xD;
      to patient medical records under the terms of the honorary contract as provided by the unit,&#xD;
      in order to record brief therapy notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the quantitative data collected will be conducted by the researcher,&#xD;
      via IBM SPSS Statistics software, using Repeated Measures One-Way ANOVA to analyse the data&#xD;
      collected from weekly questionnaires, alongside t-test and One-Way ANOVA analyses which will&#xD;
      be applied to the questionnaires used during the assessment phase and at the end of therapy&#xD;
      engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please see the Participant Timeline diagram and Table of Measures attached for additional&#xD;
      clarity regarding administration of measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this, I intend to employ the qualitative measure of an end of therapy Reflect&#xD;
      Interview which will be recreated with each consenting participant, using the same set of&#xD;
      semi-structured interview questions as written by the researcher and AIR (Audio Image&#xD;
      Recording - as developed by N. Springham) piece as a way of commemorating and bringing an end&#xD;
      point to the work done during Art Therapy sessions. As this is a qualitative measure and has&#xD;
      been tested for feasibility as such, the interview questions are semi-structured in order to&#xD;
      allow for the client to fully express their lived experience of therapy. I will undertake&#xD;
      collaborative editing with client of the AIR recording, in order to demonstrate that I am&#xD;
      working to reduce the bias / outside influence on the final piece, this will be achieved by&#xD;
      giving the client an opportunity to state at the end of the interview whether they wish me to&#xD;
      remove any sections of audio or add anything in. Data will be collected from the AIR's via&#xD;
      transcription and analysis (by the researcher) of the transcripts for recurring words and&#xD;
      themes within each patients interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the cohort being relatively small and the research undertaken over a relatively&#xD;
      short timescale, a large amount of pre and post intervention data may be produced. This will&#xD;
      require statistical analysis in order to attempt to determine statistically significant&#xD;
      change in the clients presentation. I intend to code all qualitative data gathered using a&#xD;
      6-step framework of thematic analysis devised by Braun &amp; Clarke, during which I will code&#xD;
      interview transcripts and then identify both semantic and latent themes within the coding.&#xD;
      Due to the volume of qualitative data in the form of AIR transcripts that I anticipate being&#xD;
      generated during the research, I intend to use professional and encrypted Nvivo software,&#xD;
      provided by the University to aid the data analysis process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of trial date will be signified by the completion of the minimum term of one full&#xD;
      year of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order that the population of participants are randomly, yet evenly allocated into&#xD;
      wait-list and treatment groups, a blocked randomisation process will be applied. This will be&#xD;
      conducted via Sealed Envelope, a website facility which can be customised to produce a list&#xD;
      of participants and their randomly allocated group. In addition, the website will allocate&#xD;
      each participant with a randomly generated code consisting of two letters and one number, it&#xD;
      is ensured that no participant code within the list can ever be repeated. Participant codes&#xD;
      will be used in place of names on all questionnaires, the AIR audio file and all data records&#xD;
      in order to preserve anonymity. The allocation concealment mechanism within the randomisation&#xD;
      process will be that the randomisation list will be produced and held by the Director of&#xD;
      Studies and Supervisor, Jamie Bird.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time a participant has completed the introduction and recruitment process and given&#xD;
      their consent to be involved in the research, the clinician-researcher will then obtain from&#xD;
      the Director of Studies the next available participant code for that individual and establish&#xD;
      whether they will be allocated to the wait-list or treatment group. Throughout the study, all&#xD;
      participants shall remain anonymous to the Director of Studies and shall not be given any&#xD;
      identifying information about participants. A record of participant names and the&#xD;
      randomisation log of codes will be recorded in the site file which will be stored in an&#xD;
      encrypted electronic format and will only be accessed by the lead clinician-researcher. In&#xD;
      addition to this, including the varying size blocked element within the randomisation process&#xD;
      adds another layer of allocation concealment as the clinician-researcher will be unable to&#xD;
      predict the next allocation outcome. The benefit of this would be that the participants would&#xD;
      be randomised and their clinical presentation could be measured in comparison as a control&#xD;
      group to isolate the effect of the Art Therapy intervention as the independent variable.&#xD;
      Additionally, this approach is considered to be ethically preferable to a control group which&#xD;
      denies participants access to an intervention for the entirety of a research study.&#xD;
