  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inoperable metastatic or localized solid tumors who have an indication for&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition will be enrolled and receive standard parenteral nutrition according to&#xD;
      randomization using either 2/3-chamber bags or Eurotubes®, the latter either with or without&#xD;
      reduced glucose. The main goal of the trial is to compare the incidence of catheter-related&#xD;
      infections as well as the frequency of self-administered parenteral nutrition at home&#xD;
      (autonomy rate).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, investigator-initiated, phase IV trial. A&#xD;
      total number of 350 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified according to ECOG (0-1 vs. 2 vs. 3), the modified Glasgow&#xD;
      Prognostic Score (mGPS) (0-1 vs. 2) and whether the patient receives concurrent systemic&#xD;
      anti-tumor treatment or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first step, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A (Standard Parenteral&#xD;
      Nutrition using Eurotubes®) or Arm B (Standard Parenteral Nutrition using 2/3-chamber bags).&#xD;
      Patients in Arm A will be stratified again by the same criteria as listed above and&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A-1 (Standard Low Glucose Parenteral Nutrition using&#xD;
      Eurotubes®) or Arm A-2 (Standard Parenteral Nutrition using Eurotubes®). Within the study,&#xD;
      the patient can receive PN for a maximum of 12 months after randomization as long as the PN&#xD;
      is still indicated and deemed necessary by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-Primary objectives are to compare the incidence of catheter related infections and to&#xD;
      compare the frequency of self-administered parenteral nutrition at home (HPN). Main secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to compare the efficacy of parenteral nutrition (PN) in terms of body weight,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin levels, and overall survival (OS), to compare the&#xD;
      Quality of life (QoL) by use of a modified HPN-PROQ questionnaire, to determine the frequency&#xD;
      and duration of visits by the nursing service and to compare specified safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPN therapy plan determined at screening and any modifications and adjustments to this&#xD;
      plan during the course of HPN treatment will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-cancer treatment at the time of screening and any changes during the course of the HPN&#xD;
      treatment period (e.g. type of treatment) will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of Adverse Events and medical device deficiencies will be performed at every&#xD;
      visit. AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study the patient will maintain a study diary to document details of the&#xD;
      administration of the HPN. A QoL questionnaire will be completed during regular study visits&#xD;
      until EOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients will enter the follow-up period. During this&#xD;
      period, they will be followed approximately every 3 months for survival.&#xD;

The second scale measures 10 cm. The patients will have to put a cross on the line at the place which corresponds best to their state of the past week. 0 indicates &quot;never&quot; or &quot;false&quot; and 10 &quot;daily&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;.</description>
