  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to see how safe the study drug AX-8 is and how well it is&#xD;
      tolerated when administered at different dose levels in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also investigate pharmacokinetics (PK), i.e how the study drug is taken up,&#xD;
      metabolized (broken down) and eliminated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of ascending&#xD;
      AX-8 oral doses, i.e. orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs), administrated twice for one day&#xD;
      (Day 1) in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and the&#xD;
      subjective sensory attributes (e.g. basic tastes, palatability, cooling) of ascending AX-8&#xD;
      oral doses (ODTs), administered twice for one day in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study (Part 1) is an ascending dose, open-label, single center study in&#xD;
      healthy participants. Part 1 will consist of a Screening Period (Days -28 to -1) to assess&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in the study, 4 Treatment Periods (Day 1 to Day 2; one overnight&#xD;
      stay for each treatment period) with a minimum washout period of 48 hours between doses&#xD;
      (however a longer period will be required for dose escalation / safety review decisions, as&#xD;
      required) and a Follow-Up Visit 7 to 14 days post last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each treatment period, participants will be admitted to the study center on the&#xD;
      morning of Day 1 and discharged from the study center on the morning of Day 2 (i.e. after the&#xD;
      pre-discharge procedures have been performed). Participants will attend a Follow-Up Visit (or&#xD;
      Early Withdrawal Visit as applicable) to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study will be the date of the last study visit for the last participant in the&#xD;
      study (LPLV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 10 eligible participants into Part 1 of the study to receive AX-8&#xD;
      ODTs administered orally which will be dissolved on the tongue (oromucosal route of&#xD;
      administration). Participants will receive doses of AX-8 ODTs up to 80 mg/day, administered&#xD;
      split over 2 dosing time points (i.e. 0 hour and + 8 hours), as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period 1: 2 x 5 mg tablets, 10 mg total;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period 2: 2 x 10 mg tablets, 20 mg total;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period 3: 2 x 20 mg tablets, 40 mg total;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period 4: 2 x 40 mg tablets, 80 mg total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing in each sequential treatment period will be staggered; after the first 2 participants&#xD;
      (i.e. sentinel group) are dosed there will be at least a 24-hour observation period from the&#xD;
      morning dose (0 hour) before the remaining 8 participants are dosed. The remaining&#xD;
      participants will be dosed if the sentinel group shows no clinically significant safety or&#xD;
      tolerability concerns (including available safety electrocardiograms [ECGs], vital signs&#xD;
      measurements, physical examinations and review of any adverse events [AEs]) at the discretion&#xD;
      of the PI. Any clinically significant findings from the sentinel group in the opinion of the&#xD;
      PI will be discussed with the Sponsor prior to dosing of the remaining 8 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be based on safety and tolerability data from each treatment period. In&#xD;
      addition, available PK data from Treatment Period 1 (5 mg; twice daily) and Treatment Period&#xD;
      2 (10 mg; twice daily) will be used to support dose escalation decisions for Treatment Period&#xD;
      3 (20 mg; twice daily) and Treatment Period 4 (40 mg; twice daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation to the next higher dose level (i.e. next sequential treatment period) will not&#xD;
      take place until the site's PI and the Sponsor have determined that adequate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability data from the previous treatment period has been demonstrated to permit&#xD;
      proceeding to the next sequential treatment period (i.e. higher dose level). The minimum data&#xD;
      package required for dose escalation decisions will include safety and tolerability data&#xD;
      through Day 2 in a minimum of 6 participants (including available safety ECGs, vital signs&#xD;
      measurements, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests and review of any adverse&#xD;
      events). Safety reports will be produced summarizing the safety data of the participants. The&#xD;
      justification for selection of the dose will be prepared by the investigator for the proposed&#xD;
      dose escalation and documented in the dose escalation meeting minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional participants may be enrolled if it is deemed appropriate by the site's PI and the&#xD;
      Sponsor to repeat a dose level or to study an intermediate dose level (lower than those&#xD;
      planned). Repetition of a dose level will not be permitted for dose levels that met any of&#xD;
      the stopping rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study (Part 1) has been completed, i.e. 10 participants were recruited&#xD;
      and received AX-8 (10 mg to 80 mg/day) over 4 treatment periods (in a dose escalation&#xD;
      regimen) and have attended their follow-up visits. The interim analysis of the study data&#xD;
      from Part 1 has concluded that tablet dissolution time was too long, affecting systemic&#xD;
      exposure to AX-8, probably due to the instructions for administration. Consequently, it was&#xD;
      decided to re-evaluate the 5 mg and 40 mg AX-8 tablets with other administration&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that 10 participants will be enrolled into Part 2 of the study to receive a&#xD;
      total dose of 45 mg split into two doses on Day 1 (Dose 1 (5 mg): +0 h, Dose 2 (40 mg): + 8&#xD;
      h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will consist of a Screening Period (Days -28 to -1) to assess eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the study, 1 Treatment Period (Day 1 to Day 2; one overnight stay) and a&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit 7 to 14 days post last dose. There will be no dose escalation decisions nor&#xD;
      dose staggering of participants as the doses to be administered in Part 2 are lower than the&#xD;
      highest dose level administered in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 1 and Part 2; blood samples will be taken pre and post each dose to measure plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of AX-8, despropyl AX-8 (metabolite C, MetC) and potentially other AX-8&#xD;
      metabolites and compounds. Subjective assessments to characterise the sensory attributes of&#xD;
      the AX-8 ODTs (e.g. feeling factors and taste) will be performed pre and post each dose.&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study and will include monitoring adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be approximately 65 days for subjects enrolled in Part 1 and&#xD;
      approximately 44 days for subjects enrolled in Part 2; however, the actual duration will&#xD;
      depend on the length of the screening period and the washout periods (as appropriate).&#xD;
