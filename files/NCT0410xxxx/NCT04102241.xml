  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemay005 is a novel phosphodiesterase type 4(PDE4) inhibitor being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of psoriasis.After single asending dose and mutiple asending dose in health&#xD;
      subjects. And the patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be randomized into 4&#xD;
      cohorts(15mg, 30mg, 60mg and placebo) approximately 216 subjects will be enrolled (52 for&#xD;
      each cohort ). This study includes an 16-week treatment Period, then a 36-week Treatment&#xD;
      Period without placebo.&#xD;

    <description>The static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) rated the investigator's overall clinical assessment of a participants plaque thickness, erythema, and scaling on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scale). To assign a sPGA score, the investigator examined all psoriatic lesions and assigned a severity score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema, and scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema, and scaling are summed and the mean of these 3 scores equals the overall sPGA score. Decreases in sPGA correspond to clinical improvement.</description>
