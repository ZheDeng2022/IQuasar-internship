  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to determine whether the application of near-infrared radiation via standard heat lamp&#xD;
      to non-melanoma skin lesions (such as basal cell carcinomas) before surgical excision is able&#xD;
      to better delineate the lesion and surgical margins. If found to do so, pre-heating of skin&#xD;
      lesions could lead to more specimens with negative margins. Patients presenting to the&#xD;
      tertiary care centre skin cancer clinic for excision of skin cancer will be approached and&#xD;
      offered to participate in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer diagnosis in Canada, and its&#xD;
      incidence is still increasing. Visual examination followed by biopsies of suspicious lesions&#xD;
      are the gold standard for skin cancer diagnosis. The mainstays of treatment include&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy, radiation therapy, and surgical excision. The margins of NMSC lesions&#xD;
      are typically determined via visual inspection, and excised based on delineating normal from&#xD;
      abnormal tissue. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, low-risk basal cell&#xD;
      cancers should be excised with a 4mm margin; squamous cell skin cancers and high-risk basal&#xD;
      cell cancers should be excised with 4-6mm margins, as per the National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Network. These lesions frequently occur on cosmetically sensitive areas of the head and neck,&#xD;
      therefore accurate margins and excision can help to preserve the overall appearance. Accurate&#xD;
      lesion delineation with proper margins can also reduce the need for further treatment if the&#xD;
      margins are positive. In approximately 2-3% of cases at our centre, the margins are positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared radiation (NIR) represents the light spectrum from 0.7 to 1.5 micrometers. At&#xD;
      the shorter wavelengths, it merges with the red spectrum of visible light. These forms of&#xD;
      light have the ability to heat the skin up to a 5 mm depth. Previous studies have examined&#xD;
      the relationship between skin blood flow and temperature when heating skin, where dermal&#xD;
      temperature can reach a certain peak in a defined time. Other studies have investigated the&#xD;
      application of NIR when combined with photo immunotherapy, as a means of treating other&#xD;
      cancers. More elaborate multispectral analysis devices have been studied for their&#xD;
      effectiveness in diagnosing cutaneous malignancies. NIR application is well tolerated, in&#xD;
      past studies.The objective of this study is to determine if the vasculature of normal skin&#xD;
      and NMSC skin appears differently following heating with NIR light, and if this difference&#xD;
      corresponds to better margin delineation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The excisions and reconstructions are all within the standard of care. The only added testing&#xD;
      will be application of near-infrared heat via a heating lamp to the lesional skin, for a&#xD;
      total of ten minutes. Each patient will have their skin cancer lesion photographed, and&#xD;
      traced onto acetate film. The NIR heating will then occur under a lamp for a total of ten&#xD;
      minutes at a distance of 20cm. At the end of the ten minutes, the lesion and its borders will&#xD;
      again be traced onto a separate acetate film. Using Excel for block randomization, patients&#xD;
      will then be randomized to excision with the non-heated versus heated margins. The allocation&#xD;
      will not be known until the moment of assignment. The excisions will then occur in the same&#xD;
      fashion between the two groups, and all specimens will be submitted for pathology, as is&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded for various patient and lesions factors that may potentially influence&#xD;
      the outcome of NIR heating therapy. These include age and gender, lesion size and location,&#xD;
      and history of skin disorders. The lesion size and final pathology, with quantitative margin&#xD;
      distances, will be recorded. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine if there is&#xD;
      an overall difference in qualitative (negative or positive) and quantitative margin status&#xD;
      between those lesions excised under standard procedure vs. NIR heating.&#xD;
