      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cryptosporidiosis among the top 10 causes of diarrhea in the 1st year of life in low and&#xD;
           middle-income countries (LMICs), with an estimated total of 48,000 annual deaths and&#xD;
           accounting for 4.2 million disability-adjusted life years lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only approved drug for the treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium infection is&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide (NTZ) but NTZ has a higher failure rate in malnourished children. The lack of&#xD;
      effective therapy for cryptosporidiosis remains an immense knowledge gap in the efforts to&#xD;
      improve childhood health worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTZ treatment failure in malnourished infants is due to a secondary immune deficiency that&#xD;
      can be reversed by the appropriate therapeutic treatment. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 can&#xD;
      have a potential immune modulating effect by altering gut microbiome promoting NTZ action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To develop new approaches to treat and prevent cryptosporidiosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the treatment outcome of NTZ against cryptosporidiosis in Bangladeshi&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the change in effectiveness of NTZ treatment in conjunction with the&#xD;
           administration of probiotics in malnourished Bangladeshi children with cryptosporidiosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospectively conducted randomized pilot study with 2 arms in children in the&#xD;
      Mirpur (Dhaka, Bangladesh) slum area, where cryptosporidium infected children will receive&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide treatment with or without the probiotic, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of the work lies in the ability of the study to provide new approaches to&#xD;
      treat and prevent Cryptosporidiosis. The goal of this work is to assess the efficacy of NTZ&#xD;
      drug in a low socioeconomic Bangladeshi population and establish new supportive therapeutic&#xD;
      measures to the already established treatment with NTZ against in cryptosporidiosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Reports from longitudinal birth cohort study at Bangladesh show that 77% of&#xD;
      children experience at least one incidence of cryptosporidiosis in the first two years of&#xD;
      life. Cryptosporidiosis is also associated with the development of malnutrition leading to an&#xD;
      estimate of an additional 4.2 million disability adjusted life years lost. A number of&#xD;
      studies on cryptosporidiosis conducted at icddr,b showed that Cryptosporidium sp. was one of&#xD;
      the most important causative agents of diarrhea associated with morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Previous studies at icddr,b also made a number of other intriguing elucidations, which&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cryptosporidium sp. infected most children in the 1st year of life in a cohort at&#xD;
           Mirpur, Dhaka. Investigators observed that up to 64% of infants were diagnosed with&#xD;
           cryptosporidiosis in the 1st year of life while 26% of these cases had accompanying&#xD;
           co-infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cryptosporidium sp. was established as a top 10 diarrheal pathogen, with infections&#xD;
           occurring with multiple other enteropathogens. Investigators discovered that infection&#xD;
           and diarrhea with multiple entero-pathogens in infants in an LMIC setting was the norm,&#xD;
           without any exception. On average each infant in Mirpur, Bangladesh had 3-5 enteric&#xD;
           pathogens present in their stool at any a single time point.The importance of&#xD;
           Cryptosporidium as a leading cause of infant diarrhea was validated by the MAL-ED study&#xD;
           conducted across 8 different low to middle income sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium in the first year of life was independently associated&#xD;
           with the future development of malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Impaired neurocognitive development at two years of age for infants with history of&#xD;
           cryptosporidiosis as measure using the Bayley's scales of infant development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no effective vaccine for cryptosporidiosis and the only approved drug for&#xD;
      the treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium infection is nitazoxanide (NTZ)(U.S.&#xD;
      DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 2003). NTZ is the only treatment but its efficacy in&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials has varied widely. While this drug has been generally shown to&#xD;
      have an efficacy of &gt;80%, in previous studies involving malnourished Zambian children it was&#xD;
      shown to have an efficacy of only 56%. An effective therapy would be appealing for&#xD;
      cryptosporidiosis in children in the developing world where the burden of infection is high&#xD;
      and where persistence of the enteropathogen in the absence of diarrhea is associated with&#xD;
      malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact reason for NTZ exhibiting a higher failure rate in malnourished children&#xD;
      is unclear, this drug has been shown to inhibit the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase of&#xD;
      parasites and anaerobic bacteria but its effectiveness in combating cryptosporidiosis is&#xD;
      dependent on the host immune competence. The gut micro-environment is a key component of the&#xD;
      host response to environmental challenge, with the gut microbiota being postulated to mediate&#xD;
      integral roles in promoting and calibrating all aspects of the immune system. Fermented&#xD;
      products (such as yogurt) have long been thought to promote health. However, in most&#xD;
      commercial food products the levels of the beneficial microorganisms or probiotics are not&#xD;
      consistent and at lower levels than required for the desired biological effect. Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri DSM 17938 has been one of the most extensively studied probiotic in children and&#xD;
      adults with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 in&#xD;
      particular would be effective against cryptosporidiosis due to the presence of both&#xD;
      microorganisms at duodenum of human. A recent study at icddr, b has shown this commonly used&#xD;
      probiotic appeared safe and well-accepted by Bangladeshi families. Lactobacillus reuteri has&#xD;
      been tested in clinical trials and has attained the &quot;GRAS (generally regarded as safe)&quot;&#xD;
      status for use in both children and adults and has additionally demonstrated immunomodulatory&#xD;
      activities. This probiotic is thus hypothesized to act as a beneficial supplement to the NTZ&#xD;
      treatment in cryptosporidiosis through a potential reduction in the gut inflammation&#xD;
      resulting from Cryptosporidium infection. Additionally, if the microbiota treatment promotes&#xD;
      parasite clearance and decrease the burden, it will be associated with faster disease&#xD;
      resolution and better clinical outcomes. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has been reported to&#xD;
      inhibit the RORa/y activity to suppress Th17 cells, thus promoting an appropriate immune&#xD;
      response in improving the efficacy of the drug treatment. The Probiotic VSL#3 which contains&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 as well as other bacteria with anti-inflammatory activities&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce the severity of inflammatory diarrhea in animal models and has been&#xD;
      included as one of the treatment options for pouchitis by the British Society of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology. Investigator's goal in this study is to undertake an iterative approach to&#xD;
      improve and optimize the currently used most effective treatment regime against&#xD;
      cryptosporidiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to investigate 1) Determine the incidence of&#xD;
      Cryptosporidiosis 2) Assessment of the acquired immune response to Cryptosporidiosis and 3)&#xD;
      Analyze the human genes influencing susceptibility to Cryptosporidiosis. The proposed study&#xD;
      will utilize the field setting of the parent study. This proposed pilot study will help to&#xD;
      elucidate the effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis which will not only help the study&#xD;
      participants of the parent study, but also help other individuals with cryptosporidiosis from&#xD;
      similar settings. Later on the parent study findings will provide information which will help&#xD;
      to investigate host immune mechanism and permit the design of new strategies incorporating&#xD;
      host-directed therapies that could optimize an appropriate immune response improving the&#xD;
      efficacy of the NTZ with probiotics treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study products: Nitazoxanide will be purchased from local commercial Square pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      Ltd. and probiotics will be purchased from Bio Gaia a Swedish health care company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details: This will be a randomized clinical trial to be conducted prospectively in a&#xD;
      pilot scale. The study will be conducted at Mirpur (Dhaka, Bangladesh) slum areas. The parent&#xD;
      organization maintains a field site for studies on cryptosporidiosis. This is an area with a&#xD;
      high incidence of both cryptosporidiosis and child malnutrition. Identified participants will&#xD;
      be screened by strict maintenance and following of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      study staff will take consent from the patient's legal guardian to enroll the child.&#xD;
      Investigators will screen 975 children presenting age 12 months to 36 months, of either sex&#xD;
      and having no history of antibiotic use in the last month before enrollment. The prevalence&#xD;
      of Cryptosporidium infection in the proposed age group in that community is approximately 8%.&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll 78 participants with cases of Cryptosporidiosis, diagnosed using&#xD;
      animmune assay from stool. Investigators will enroll both symptomatic and asymptomatic&#xD;
      children. Study physician will collect all the demographic, socioeconomic, anthropometric,&#xD;
      clinical and treatment information. A random number generator will be used to determine which&#xD;
      treatment group to which the child will be assigned. Stool and anthropometric information&#xD;
      will be collected from all groups onenrollment, on day 4 (day after NTZ treatment), on day 8&#xD;
      (day after Probiotics treatment), on day 90 (follow-up on 3 months) and on day 180 (follow-up&#xD;
      on 6 months). Rate of decrease of oocyst load by qPCR in stools at Days 4 and day 8 will be&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Intervention:Child will be randomly selected to receive either the NTZ treatment for 3 days&#xD;
      with probiotics for 7days or the NTZ treatment for 3 days with placebo for 7days. The doses&#xD;
      of NTZ will be twice a day for 3 days and L reuteri DSM 17938 will be 2Ã—10^8 CFU will be&#xD;
      taken orally. Treatment group will receive 5 drops probiotic twice daily for a consecutive 7&#xD;
      days and placebo group will receive NTZ for 3 days without probiotic. The NTZ dosage will be&#xD;
      5 ml every 12 hours with food. The NTZ oral suspension contain 100mg/5ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This drug NTZ and probiotics usually has no side effects. Prior study suggests no adverse&#xD;
      event or serious adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected drop-out: From previous experience the drop-out rate is very low. Investigator&#xD;
      considered 10% drop out in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: This will be a pilot study with a total of 78 patients distributed equally&#xD;
      across the two above mentioned study arms. A sample size of N = 71 individuals (35 in each of&#xD;
      the groups) will be sufficient to detect a clinically important difference of the proportion&#xD;
      (at least) 24% between the groups, using a two-sided Z-test of the difference between&#xD;
      proportions with 80 % power and a 5 % level of significance and a precision of 0.10. This 24&#xD;
      % difference represents the difference between the prevalence of 56% in the NTZ+placebo group&#xD;
      and 80 % in the NTZ+probiotics group. With consideration of 10% attrition rate, the total&#xD;
      sample size is 78 individual (39 in each group). Since this is a pilot study and due to small&#xD;
      funding, the precision value considered 0.10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: Database will be created after getting the lab test values. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed using SPSS (version 16). Treatment efficacy will be measured in two groups. Nature&#xD;
      of data distribution will be checked whether it is normally distributed or not. Using two&#xD;
      sample mean test among group will be compared using parametric (t-test) or non-parametric&#xD;
      (Mann-Whitney test) where applicable. Investigator will be examined, if there is any&#xD;
      difference in cryptosporidium infection outcome of treatment with NTZ+placebo in comparison&#xD;
      NTZ+probiotics treatment in children and then paired parametric-test or paired non-parametric&#xD;
      test will be done depending on data distribution. Investigator will also examine the&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness in malnourished children. Multivariate logistic regression will be&#xD;
      performed to examine the effect of socioeconomic condition, nutrition and other clinical&#xD;
      conditions associated with different treatment on cryptosporidiosis.&#xD;
