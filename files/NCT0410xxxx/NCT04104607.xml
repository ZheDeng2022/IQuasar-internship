    <textblock>
      This trial is a first in human (FIH) study in patients with castration resistant metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer (CRPC) after failure of third-line therapy aiming to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of CC-1, a bispecific antibody (bsAb) with PSMAxCD3 specificity developed within&#xD;
      DKTK. CC-1 binds to human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cells&#xD;
      as well as to tumor vessels of CRPC, thereby allowing for a dual mode of anti-cancer action.&#xD;
      CC-1 was developed in a novel format which not only prolongs serum half-life but most&#xD;
      importantly reduces off-target T cell activation with expected fewer side effects. Together&#xD;
      with preemptive IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade using tocilizumab, this allows for application&#xD;
      of effective bsAb doses with expected high anticancer activity. The study comprises two&#xD;
      phases. The first phase is a doseescalation phase with concomitant prophylactic application&#xD;
      of tocilizumab to evaluate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-1. This is followed by a&#xD;
      dose-expansion phase (also with prophylactic IL-6R blockade using tocilizumab), as this&#xD;
      approach has been shown to be efficient and beneficial for patients. A translational research&#xD;
      program comprising, among others, analysis of CC-1 half-life and the induced immune response&#xD;
      as well as molecular profiling in liquid biopsies will serve to better define the mode of&#xD;
      action of CC-1 and to identify biomarkers for further clinical development.&#xD;

      Study rationale with regard to patient populations and test drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRCP is an aggressive malignant disease with poor prognosis after failure of established&#xD;
      therapies. Any drug employed after third-line treatment is associated with only limited&#xD;
      clinical benefit. Therefore, there is a high medical need for new therapeutic approaches in&#xD;
      this patient population. While progress has been made in the field of immunotherapeutics for&#xD;
      other tumor types, no relevant progress in immunotherapeutic options in CRPC has been&#xD;
      achieved over the last years. The rationale for the therapeutic use of CC-1 is based on its&#xD;
      proposed mode of action as a bsAb being specifically designed to direct T cells via its CD3&#xD;
      binding part towards tumor target cells via its PSMA binding part. Furthermore, CC-1 also&#xD;
      reacts with tumor vessels of CRPC thereby allowing for a dual mode of anti-cancer action by&#xD;
      also attacking tumor blood supply and allowing for improved influx of immune effector cells.&#xD;
      Due to its unique ability to redirect T cells via CD3 for PSMA-expressing tumor cell lysis,&#xD;
      CC-1 can elicit repeated target cell elimination by cytotoxic T cells and a polyclonal&#xD;
      response of previously primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Compared to other immunotherapeutics&#xD;
      presently being approved or in development (bsAbs with alternative formats like the&#xD;
      authorised bsAb blinatumomab or other antibodies or CART cells), CC-1 is expected to offer&#xD;
      the following major advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Reduction of off-target T cell activation and thus reduction of side effects due to its&#xD;
      optimized format (ii) The possibility to tightly steer anti-target activity via serum&#xD;
      level-controlled antibody application which, in contrast to CART cells, allows for&#xD;
      termination of activity if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the background of the poor prognosis of patients with CRPC after third-line therapy, the&#xD;
      bsAb CC-1 holds promise as a new treatment option of immunotherapy for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale with regard to objectives and further development of CC-1 In nonclinical&#xD;
      studies, in vitro and in vivo, proof of concept, preliminary PK and PK/PD effects as well as&#xD;
      toxicology have been evaluated as described in detail in the IB, section 5. However, due to&#xD;
      differences between animal models and the human situation, some aspects have to be assessed&#xD;
      and further characterised in humans. For example, the target mediated drug disposition&#xD;
      (TMDD), an effect that largely influences the serum half-life of antibody molecules&#xD;
      particularly at low concentrations, cannot be properly addressed in mice. Furthermore,&#xD;
      nonhuman primates (NHP) and rodents have several limitations as predictive models for&#xD;
      toxicity and immunogenicity evaluation of CC-1. The CD3 binding part of CC-1 does not&#xD;
      cross-react with CD3 of macaques and thus it is not possible to evaluate in these NHPs dose&#xD;
      limiting side effects. Likewise, although CC-1 is cross-reactive with macaque-PSMA, PSMA&#xD;
      distribution in macaques significantly differs from that in humans. The same holds true for&#xD;
      rodents. Therefore, a First in Human study is planned for CC-1 to overcome these limitations&#xD;
      and to characterise the effects of CC-1 in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned phase I trial is designed to confirm and further explore the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the PSMAxCD3 bsAb CC-1 in adult patients with CRPC after third-line therapy.&#xD;
      The primary objective is incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) under therapy with&#xD;
      CC-1. Furthermore, the trial aims to expand experience on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      and toxicology of CC-1 from nonclinical studies to the human situation in relation to the PK,&#xD;
      expected efficacy and safety. A focus will be on the following specific aspects/parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CC-1 in humans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunogenicity of CC-1 in humans based on both absolute (number and percentage of&#xD;
           subjects who develop human anti-human antibody (HAHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute changes from baseline in the tumor marker (PSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute changes from baseline in laboratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in cytokines from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of response rate by ReCist on routine imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall and progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for preemptive IL-6R blockade by Tocilizumab prevent development of CRS in the&#xD;
      first place than to treat CRS once it has arisen. This strategy holds promise to increase the&#xD;
      safety of study patients and timely study conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By starting the study treatment with CC-1 directly with prophylactic tocilizumab, all study&#xD;
      patients will benefit from the expected advantage of this combination with regard to safety&#xD;
      and can be treated with sufficiently high doses of CC-1 to achieve dose levels high enough to&#xD;
      hopefully result in efficacy effects.The rationale for preemptive IL-6R blockade by&#xD;
      tocilizumab treatment is based on i. The firmly established efficiency and safety of&#xD;
      tocilizumab for the treatment of CRS ii. Lack of clear evidence for increased tumor growth as&#xD;
      potential drawback of IL-6R blockage iii. Observations that IL-6 activity, while being&#xD;
      responsible for the undesirable sequelae of CRS, appears not to be required for the&#xD;
      therapeutic activity of CC-1 CRS that was induced by therapy with the approved bsAb&#xD;
      blinatumomab was reported to be successfully treated by tocilizumab. Most importantly,&#xD;
      despite rapid disappearance of clinical CRS symptoms, the therapeutic activity of the bsAb&#xD;
      blinatumomab was maintained. Furthermore, tocilizumab was also used in the very recent FIH&#xD;
      study with the REGN1917 (CD20xCD3) antibody (Bannerji et al., 2018). Our own nonclinical&#xD;
      studies demonstrate that tocilizumab does not impair the therapeutic activity of CC-1,&#xD;
      neither in vitro nor in vivo. This is in contrast to steroids which are currently recommended&#xD;
      and used as pre- and concomitant treatment to prevent CRS upon blinatumomab therapy. Due to&#xD;
      the mechanism of action of tocilizumab, there is a theoretical risk of tumor development or&#xD;
      tumor progression due to immune modulation. On the basis of the current literature derived&#xD;
      from large studies conducted in Japan, the USA and Europe, however, there is no evidence for&#xD;
      an increased tumor risk upon application of tocilizumab. Only one Japanese study described a&#xD;
      minimally increased risk of de novo lymphoma development. However, this could not be&#xD;
      confirmed in any other study. Especially for prostate cancer, there is no evidence for an&#xD;
      increased incidence rate. Furthermore, tocilizumab is currently being investigated in several&#xD;
      Phase I/II studies for the treatment of solid and hematological neoplasias without available&#xD;
      evidence for an influence on tumor pathophysiology. Based on these findings, no relevant&#xD;
      negative effects of tocilizumab on the efficacy and safety of CC-1are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Duration and Schedule A treatment cycle consists of 21 days, comprising 7 days (d1-7)&#xD;
      of CC-1 application as continuous infusion, followed by a treatment free period with further&#xD;
      close monitoring for safety. The duration of the trial for each patient is expected to be at&#xD;
      least 3 months including the first treatment cycle of 21 days and a safety follow-up on day&#xD;
      90 (end of study, EOSf). Thereafter, a continuous survival follow-up every three months is&#xD;
      conducted for one year after EOSf. In case of clinical benefit, treatment period can be&#xD;
      longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period, enrollment and baseline The screening period is part of the study and&#xD;
      begins 14 days prior to first treatment. The patient is informed about the study by the&#xD;
      investigator and has to sign informed consent. In the following, further measures and&#xD;
      analyses are performed to check whether the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      If a patient meets all criteria, he is enrolled in the study. If he does not meet all&#xD;
      criteria, he is not enrolled but documented as a screening failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline values are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine imagingimaging and analysis of HAHA are both assessed in the screening period&#xD;
           (up to day -14).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline values for Quality of Life are assessed in the screening period (up to day -14)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline values for PSA, cytokines, pharmacokinetics and liquid biopsy are taken&#xD;
           directly before start of CC-1 infusion (on day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline values for hematology and blood chemistry as well as coagulation parameters are&#xD;
           taken directly before start of CC-1 infusion (on day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline for signs and symptoms of disease as well as vital signs (for evaluation of&#xD;
           CRS) are documented directly before start of CC-1 infusion (on day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Cycle Each treatment cycle of an individual patient is 21 (±2) days. Every cycle&#xD;
      comprises a treatment period (d1-7) with a continuous infusion (daily) of CC-1 after&#xD;
      preemptive tocilizumab application and an infusion free period (d8-21). While for d1-9 the&#xD;
      patients are hospitalized and closely monitored, day 10-21 is planned as outpatient period&#xD;
      with outpatient self-monitoring and visits at the hospital at d15 and d21 (EOT). Discharge of&#xD;
      the patient is planned at day 9 but depending on the patient´s condition. At the discretion&#xD;
      of the physician, the patient can be also discharged at day 10 (or later). Justification of&#xD;
      continuous infusion Continuous infusion has been utilized in several phase I/II studies with&#xD;
      the bsAb blinatumomab: In a phase I/II study in children with refractory ALL, blinatumomab&#xD;
      was applied as 24 continuous infusion over 4 weeks. A 24h continuous infusion of blinatumomab&#xD;
      was also applied in first investigations in adults (NCT00274742) as well as in a phase II&#xD;
      study in adults with refractory B-ALL. Overall, continuous infusion is expected to provide&#xD;
      reasonable safety due to avoidance of peak serum levels with subsequent rapid decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of length of treatment (infusion) with CC-1: A treatment duration of 7 days was&#xD;
      chosen for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified in the dose expansion&#xD;
      phase and that patients will receive the maximum tested dose. At higher dose levels, for&#xD;
      reasons of safety we implemented step dosing on day 1 and day 2 of each cycle followed by&#xD;
      application of the target dose (to be determined, possible maximum tested dose) over 5 days.&#xD;
      This is based on our published observations that CD3-mediated activation of T cells within&#xD;
      PBMC populations in vitro requires 3 days until full activation is achieved. Notably, in&#xD;
      these in vitro analyses high antibody concentrations (3μg/ml and thus several orders of&#xD;
      magnitude more than those that will be achieved in our study patients) were utilized. It was&#xD;
      also observed in a previous study that the presence of human serum reduces CD3-mediated T&#xD;
      cell activation. For these reasons, we conclude that exposure to active drug levels for&#xD;
      additional 2 days (and thus 5 days in total after day 2) may ascertain optimal T cell&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of length of cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cycle length of 21 days was chosen for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculated half-life in mice of about 48h is based on the simplified assumption of an&#xD;
      exponential decline within the first 24h. Thereafter serum concentration declined at a slower&#xD;
      rate indicating a biphasic elimination. For calculation of the cycle interval we therefore&#xD;
      assumed a half-life of 48h. Considering that CC-1 application is completed on day 8, a margin&#xD;
      of 5 half-lifes (equaling to 10 days) results in an overall interval of 18 days.&#xD;
      Additionally, based on our reported findings that after achieving maximal T cell activation a&#xD;
      decline of activity over 3 further days is observed, for reasons of safety we plan to allow&#xD;
      for 3 additional days until the end of treatment (EOT) visit is conducted (18 plus 3 days)&#xD;
      and treatment can potentially be repeated. Notably, in the dose escalation cohort, approval&#xD;
      of the DSMB is required before a new patient can be treated with the next dose level, for&#xD;
      which we calculate an additional 7 days. Thus, a second cycle of treatment can be applied at&#xD;
      day 21 to the same patient, but treatment of new patients, for reasons of uniformity, is&#xD;
      generally conducted at day 28 of the antecedent patient at the earliest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Cycles It is assumed that additional treatment cycles do not increase the risk but&#xD;
      would rather benefit patients. Therefore, in case of positive response, the patient is&#xD;
      allowed to continue treatment with up to 5 further treatment cycles. This is intended to&#xD;
      allow patients to benefit better from therapy in case it is effective. Positive response to&#xD;
      CC-1 treatment in previous cycle comprises (but is not limited to) a substantial PSA drop&#xD;
      (&gt;20% reduction compared to day 1 pretreatment as determined on day 15). To obtain additional&#xD;
      cycles, patients must still meet the initial key eligibility criteria assessed between 6-8&#xD;
      days prior to the next cycle (excluding cardiac ultrasound, lung function, virology,&#xD;
      tuberculosis testing, CT/MRI imaging). Patients are required to sign the informed consent&#xD;
      form for additional CC-1 cycles. Study visits and investigations are performed as described&#xD;
      for the first cycle of CC-1 treatment. This includes all obligations for safety-reporting and&#xD;
      documentation. The dose of CC-1 in additional cycles is the same as in the patient´s first&#xD;
      cycle. In case of additional cycles, the end of safety follow-up (EOSf) visit is prolonged to&#xD;
      90 days after start of the last CC-1 cycle. Routine imaging is planned every 90 days (+/- 7&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Follow-Up until End of safety follow-up (EOSf)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment cycle (s), follow-up of patients is planned as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last visit of the last treatment cycle at d21 (EOT), a follow-up visit is planned&#xD;
      at d 90 (± 7) (69 days after EOT). In case of only one treatment cycle, this visit is the&#xD;
      EOSf for this patient. This time point was chosen based on clinical practice and assessment&#xD;
      according to RECIST criteria (see secondary endpoints). A comprehensive workup is planned on&#xD;
      this visit. In case of additional cycles, the EOSf visit is prolonged to 90 days after start&#xD;
      of the last CC-1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after EOSf until EOS After EOSf, each patient is followed every 90 days (± 7) for&#xD;
      up to one 1 year. EOS will be the last visit one year after EOSf, unless study treatment is&#xD;
      terminated earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the patient is reported to have progressive disease on routine imaging, the&#xD;
      investigator may decide to perform an additional visit 28-42 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient care after last follow-up After finishing all study-relevant procedures, therapy and&#xD;
      follow-up period as described above, the patient are followed in terms of routine care and&#xD;
      treated if necessary, by the primary responsible oncology center. Any attempt should be made&#xD;
      by the investigator to follow the patient in particular with regard to any safety issues even&#xD;
      after the last assessment at EOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated timelines The recruitment period may vary substantially based on observed&#xD;
      toxicities, but is expected to be 2 years, and an overall study duration of 3.25 years is&#xD;
      anticipated. Recruitment of patients starts in the fourth quarter of 2019&#xD;
