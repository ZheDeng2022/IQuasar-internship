  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient is received with the context of acute stroke, they undergo a fast neurological&#xD;
      evaluation and obtain a basic appraisal composed of a non-contrast endovascular cerebral scan&#xD;
      and an angiography scan of intracranial blood vessels and the neck. Once the structural&#xD;
      lesion (hemorrhage, tumor, etc.) is absent, signs of early infracts and confirmed acute&#xD;
      intracranial arterial occlusion, the possibility of a pseudo-stroke dwells in the&#xD;
      differential diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain characteristics of history and clinical evaluation create sufficient doubt to evoke&#xD;
      the possibility of a pseudo-stroke. In fact, this population is mostly female and the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors are less prevalent in this group than for the group of stroke&#xD;
      victims. It is on average the youngest and presents a less severe deficit. For the rest,&#xD;
      medical antecedents often help to evoke a diagnosis of pseudo-stroke.&#xD;

      With this study, the investigators wish to evaluate the diagnostic value of two additional&#xD;
      radiological examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging to evaluate blood flow in the brain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging by magnetic resonance (MRI) of the brain to detect lesions from a cerebral&#xD;
           vascular accident (stroke) not visible on standard imaging of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed additional examinations (CTP and MRI) are tests that are currently used at the&#xD;
      CHUM. Those are not experimental tests. These tests are commonly used when doctors wants a&#xD;
      further investigation to clarify the cause of the neurological symptoms. These tests are&#xD;
      usually done in a semi-urgent or non-urgent situations. In the present study they will be&#xD;
      done urgently. The investigators wish to determine if obtaining these additional tests in&#xD;
      emergency will change the decision of whether to administer the drug (thrombolysis). The&#xD;
      investigators want to determine whether one imaging test is sufficient or if both exams are&#xD;
      needed to help clinical decision-making. Please note that urgent access to perfusion CT and&#xD;
      brain MRI is not considered routine care, since the value of these additional tests has yet&#xD;
      to be demonstrated.&#xD;
