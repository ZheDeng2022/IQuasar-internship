  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than half of type 1 diabetes (DT1) children are under CSII (Continuous Subcutaneous&#xD;
      Insulin Infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies showed that despite a patients' follow-up mostly by hospital-based&#xD;
      paediatricians, there are still some concerns on long-term glycaemic control with inconstant&#xD;
      results on glycaemic control either due to CSII adherence or nutrition management issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, this real life study aims to compare two monitoring methods (standard versus&#xD;
      intensive) in children initiating a CSII treatment and assess the impact on glycaemic control&#xD;
      after one year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As CSII becomes more and more the gold standard therapy in children with type 1 diabetes,&#xD;
      there have been some questions regarding the long-term effect of these treatments with some&#xD;
      concerns on the inconstant results on glycaemic control either due to CSII adherence or&#xD;
      nutrition management issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) study has already shown in diabetic&#xD;
      adults that intensification of treatment and follow-up could result in significative&#xD;
      improvement of glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test this hypothesis of significant improvement after one year following&#xD;
      CSII initiation on glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two parallel arms will be compared in real life conditions; one with standard&#xD;
      recommendations-based follow-up by both diabetologists/pediatricians and service provider and&#xD;
      the other with intensive follow-up with higher frequency of provider's nurses visits and&#xD;
      personalization of patient status transferred to the physician for each&#xD;
      diabetologists/pediatricians visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigators could determine after one year if the glycaemic control is better with&#xD;
      one or the other of these follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycaemic control will be assessed both by the evolution of HbA1c during the study period and&#xD;
      its last level at the end of the study. Its evaluation will be completed by counting of all&#xD;
      symptomatic hypoglycemia occurence during the study.&#xD;
