    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an innovative behavioral HIV prevention&#xD;
      videogame intervention to bolster motivation and provide skill-building opportunities to&#xD;
      improve Black adolescent girls' ability to negotiate around risk including advocating for&#xD;
      partner HIV/STI testing, increasing their knowledge and awareness of HIV/STIs, and for&#xD;
      reducing sexual risk-taking behaviors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will develop and evaluate a multiplayer videogame aimed at Black adolescent girls&#xD;
      with the intent of teaching the ability to negotiate around risk including advocating for&#xD;
      partner HIV/STI testing, increasing their knowledge and awareness of HIV/STIs, and for&#xD;
      reducing sexual risk-taking behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be developed and delivered as a social, multiplayer videogame, a&#xD;
      compelling context for Black adolescent girls who constantly interact and seek counsel from&#xD;
      their peers. To this end, the Specific Aims, focusing on Black adolescent girls aged 14-18&#xD;
      years, are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. (Phase 1) Translate the culturally and socially-tailored card game One Night Stan to a&#xD;
           multiplayer videogame called InvestiDate using game design and content experts and focus&#xD;
           group input from 30 Black adolescent girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. (Phase 2) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the multiplayer&#xD;
           videogame InvestiDate (the new adaptation of the One Night Stan intervention) vs. an&#xD;
           attention/control non-health-related multiplayer videogame with 80 participants&#xD;
           collecting assessment data at baseline, one, and four months to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Determine the intervention's acceptability and feasibility by collecting&#xD;
                quantitative and qualitative data on Black adolescent girls' satisfaction and&#xD;
                gameplay experience of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Determine the preliminary impact of the intervention on knowledge (information),&#xD;
                intentions/attitudes (motivation), social norms, and behavioral skills as related&#xD;
                to: i) HIV/STI testing and partner testing and ii) condom use, and iii) sexual risk&#xD;
                behavior reduction, such as alcohol and drug use.&#xD;

    <description>HIV/STI Testing- self will be used to test the hypothesis that individuals who play InvestiDate will report more HIV/STI testing and partner testing in comparison to the control condition. We will conduct a longitudinal analysis using a hierarchical linear mixed models approach to compare participants in the intervention group to participants in the control group on reported participant and partner HIV/STI testing from baseline across all follow-up assessments (i.e., baseline, one month and four months).</description>
