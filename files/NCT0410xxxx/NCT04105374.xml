    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial studies how well vocimagene amiretrorepvec (Toca 511) and extended&#xD;
      release flucytosine (Toca FC) work when added to the usual treatment (temozolomide and&#xD;
      radiation therapy) in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Toca 511 is a live&#xD;
      virus that has been built to carry a gene into tumor cells. This gene carries instructions&#xD;
      that cause the tumor cells to turn Toca FC, typically used to treat fungal infections, into a&#xD;
      drug that may kill the tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving Toca 511 and Toca FC in addition to the&#xD;
      usual treatment (temozolomide and radiation therapy) may help shrink or stabilize cancer or&#xD;
      extend the life of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma treated with Toca 511 at the time of tumor resection followed by Toca FC in&#xD;
      combination with standard of care (SOC) treatment to patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma treated with SOC after tumor resection. (Phase II) II. To compare the overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) from time of randomization of all patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      treated with Toca 511 at the time of tumor resection followed by Toca FC in combination with&#xD;
      SOC treatment to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with SOC after tumor&#xD;
      resection. (Phase III)&#xD;
&#xD;

      between arms (only for phase II part of the study). III. To compare the PFS between arms&#xD;
      using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) (only for phase III part of the study).&#xD;

&#xD;
      IV. To determine if there is a tumor-microenvironment signature based on ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA) sequencing that is associated with a selective increase in benefit from the addition of&#xD;
      Toca 511 and Toca FC.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      VII. To compare health utilities, as measured by the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L),&#xD;
      between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Beginning on week 5 following standard of care surgery, patients undergo radiation&#xD;
      therapy over 30 fractions 5 days per week for up to 6 weeks, and receive temozolomide orally&#xD;
      (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 49 days. At the discretion of treating physician, patients may&#xD;
      also receive novoTTF-100A (Optune) device 0-7 weeks following radiation and temozolomide&#xD;
      treatment. One month following completion of radiation therapy, patients continue to receive&#xD;
      temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive vocimagene amiretrorepvec via intracranial injection during surgery&#xD;
      on day 1. Beginning on week 5 following surgery, patients receive extended release&#xD;
      flucytosine PO three times daily (TID) for 7 consecutive days every 7 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo radiation therapy and receive temozolomide as in arm I. After completion of radiation&#xD;
      therapy and at the discretion of the treating physician, patients may continue to receive&#xD;
      extended release flucytosine PO TID for 7 consecutive days every 8 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until progression then, every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>Analysis of the treatment comparison between the experimental and standard of care arms will be performed once the required number of deaths is reached. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to calculate the OS rates for each of the two arms. The primary endpoint will be assessed using a one-sided stratified log-rank test, incorporating only stratification factors, to test the difference in OS between the two arms. Hazard ratio (HR) on the treatment effect will be calculated using the stratified Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for stratification factors. In addition to assessing the effect of treatment arm, IDH mutation status, MGMT status, the interaction between MGMT status and treatment arm, extent of resection, and use of Optune (in only the standard-of-care arm) will be assessed using a log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models.</description>

    <time_frame>Until death, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Counts of all adverse events (AEs) by grade will be provided by treatment arm. Frequencies and percentages will be provided for the worst grade AE experienced by the patient by treatment arm. The number of patients with at least 1 grade 3 or higher AE will be compared between the treatment arms. A comparison between treatment arms of grade 3 and higher AEs related to any aspect of protocol treatment will be tested. A comparison between arms of the following events will also be conducted: any new solid tumor, hematologic malignancy or myelodysplastic syndrome and any neurologic decline not attributed to tumor progression, and any toxicity that is possibly, probably or definitely related to protocol treatment. All comparisons will be tested using a chi-square test with a two-sided significance level of 0.05.</description>
