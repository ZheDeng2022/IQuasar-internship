  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron is a vital substrate for hemoglobin production and sufficient iron stores are necessary&#xD;
      to achieve and maintain adequate levels of hemoglobin. Unfortunately, more than one third of&#xD;
      patients with cyanotic heart disease are iron-deficient (1),(2). In 1990, West et al, have&#xD;
      demonstrated that more than one-third of patients with congenital cyanotic heart diseases&#xD;
      (CCHD) had iron deficiency(3) In another study done by Olcay et al, the prevalence of iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia (IDA) was found to be 52.2%(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible causes of iron deficiency include increased iron consumption through increased&#xD;
      erythropoiesis, inappropriate venesections, hemoptysis, bleeding from arteriovenous&#xD;
      malformations or collateral vessels, abnormal hemostasis, limited dietary intake or&#xD;
      absorption, and use of anticoagulants and antiplatelets (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also congenital cyanotic heart lesions are associated with a state of constant hypoxia This&#xD;
      hypoxia triggers a physiological increase in erythropoietin release leading to stimulation of&#xD;
      the bone marrow to produce more red cells in an effort to increase the body's oxygen carrying&#xD;
      capacity, so as to improve oxygen delivery to the tissues. With persisting right to left&#xD;
      shunt, the arterial oxygen tensions remain perpetually low and so the production of more and&#xD;
      more red cells goes unabated leading to polycythemia. This seemingly noble physiological&#xD;
      response eventually leads to depletion of iron stores (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these patients, the total haemoglobin is normal, high or slightly reduced compared to&#xD;
      aged-matched normal individuals without cyanosis. However, the MCV, MCH and serum ferritin&#xD;
      are usually comparatively lower than their peers as shown by Cemile et al - a phenomenon&#xD;
      known as relative anemia (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, traditional diagnostic criteria for anemia do not apply to these patients, where&#xD;
      &quot;appropriate&quot; levels of hemoglobin may vary according to their oxygen saturations (8). Also,&#xD;
      other erythrocyte indices such as MCV and MCH are not sensitive indicators of iron deficiency&#xD;
      in cyanotic patients (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDA aggravates hyperviscosity symptoms due to the presence of microcytic erythrocytes not&#xD;
      amenable to deformation in the microcirculation. Thus, presence of IDA in these children&#xD;
      further increases their chances of morbidity in the form of cerebrovascular events and&#xD;
      cyanotic spells (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high incidence of iron deficiency among children with CCHD draws attention to the&#xD;
      importance of evaluating iron deficiency in this population.&#xD;
