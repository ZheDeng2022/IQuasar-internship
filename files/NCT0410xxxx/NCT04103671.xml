  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that there are about 600 million diabetes mellitus (DM) patients all over the&#xD;
      world until 2040，and almost 50% of whom have some degree of diabetic retinopathy (DR) at any&#xD;
      given time. About 5% to 10% diabetic retinopathy would develop vision-threatening&#xD;
      complications, including proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), capillary non-perfusion,&#xD;
      or macular edema. Data from the DRS suggest that given long enough duration of diabetes,&#xD;
      approximately 60% of patients with DR will develop PDR, and without intervention, 75%&#xD;
      nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) will development PDR within 1 year follow up,&#xD;
      45% will develop high-risk PDR, nearly half of PDR will experience profound visual loss.&#xD;
      panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) only reduced 50% risk of sever visual loss and about 25% of&#xD;
      the sNPDR patients who finished PRP need Pars-plana vitrectomy (PPV) in a 5 year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitreous have been proven to play an important role in the development of NPDR to PDR, which&#xD;
      were the collection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) factors and the major&#xD;
      component of proliferative lesion in the later stage of PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro-invasive Pars-plana vitrectomy has been shown as a safe and effective method in the&#xD;
      treatment of PDR, through removing the pathological vitreous, proliferative membrane and also&#xD;
      the VEGF factors. However, whether or not Micro-invasive Pars-plana vitrectomy will be more&#xD;
      effective than PRP to control the progression of NDPR remained unknown.&#xD;
