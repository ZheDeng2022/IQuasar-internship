      The purpose of this study is to learn about possible changes in cognitive (mental) abilities,&#xD;
      such as memory skills and concentration, and in brain anatomy (structure) and function, in&#xD;
      people with lymphoma receiving CAR-T therapy.&#xD;

    <description>correlations of neurocognitive scores with the FACIT-FS (fatigue) scale score The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Subscale, Version 4 (FACITFS V-4 56, is a 13-item questionnaire designed to assess symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with fatigue [66]. The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over &quot;the past 7 days&quot; using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from &quot;0 - Not at all&quot; to &quot;4 - Very much&quot;. The 13 items produce the Fatigue Subscale (FS) score (range 0 - 52).</description>
