  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a clinical trial, designed to pilot test a Distress&#xD;
      Tolerance-Benzodiazepine Discontinuation (DT-BD) intervention for patients on opioid agonist&#xD;
      therapy who currently use benzodiazepines. The DT-BD intervention is an adjunctive&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention in people seeking to discontinue (BZD) use. The goal of the study&#xD;
      is to assess the applicability and feasibility of this intervention through treatment&#xD;
      retention and qualitative interviews with four participants who are receiving opioid agonist&#xD;
      treatment and who regularly use BZDs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study pilots a 12-week psychosocial intervention paired with a benzodiazepine taper with&#xD;
      the aim of assisting individuals receiving OAT discontinue benzodiazepine use. All&#xD;
      participants will receive the same benzodiazepine (BZD) discontinuation protocol. The&#xD;
      Distress Tolerance-Benzodiazepine Discontinuation (DT-BD) intervention consists of 12 weeks&#xD;
      with 3 weekly therapy sessions prior to an 8-week BZD taper. Some participants may be&#xD;
      prescribed non-benzodiazepine medications to treat the underlying conditions for which they&#xD;
      were using BZDs [e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) for anxiety or hypnotics&#xD;
      for insomnia]. Data collection will occur at baseline, then weekly for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>BZD withdrawal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BZD withdrawal symptoms will be measured using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B). The CIWA-B is a 20 item instrument, to assess severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal, including nausea and vomiting, anxiety, tremor, sweating, auditory disturbances, visual disturbances, tactile disturbances, headache, agitation, and clouding of sensorium.

    <description>Anxiety symptoms will be measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a 21 item self report inventory for measuring severity of anxiety. The items probe about common symptoms of anxiety that the participant may have experienced in the past week, including numbness, tingling, sweating, and fear. Each item is scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The standardized cutoffs are: 0-7: minimal anxiety, 8-15: mild anxiety, 16-25: moderate anxiety, and 26-63: severe anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II will be used to measure inflexibility or experiential avoidance. It is a 7 item self-report measure of psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance. Each of the 7 items can be rated on a scale of 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) so scores can range from 7 to 49. Higher scores equal greater levels of psychological inflexibility.</description>

    <description>This psychosocial treatment intervention uses a combination of interoceptive exposure therapy and elements of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and psychoeducation about benzodiazepine use in OAT.&#xD;

    <description>Distress Tolerance - Benzodiazepine Discontinuation (DT-BD) is a psychosocial intervention. It is paired with a benzodiazepine taper. The aim of the psychosocial intervention is to improve individuals' ability to tolerate distress in order to assist benzodiazepine discontinuation in patients treated with OAT. There will be 3 sessions between therapist and participant prior to the start of the benzodiazepine taper. The taper for both the intervention and control conditions occurs over 9 weeks and involves weekly meetings with a benzodiazepine prescriber during which a gradual benzodiazepine dose reduction will take place. The DT-BD intervention combines elements of existing psychosocial interventions. Specifically, interoceptive exposure techniques will be paired with elements of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and relapse prevention (RP).</description>

    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>BZD discontinuation protocol</intervention_name>
    <description>All participants will undergo BZD discontinuation. Once the starting BZD dose is determined by prescription monitoring and/or self-report, we will maintain participants on this dose until the start of the BZD taper. Participants will see a study physician weekly to receive their BZD medication for the week until the taper is completed. BZD discontinuation in this study will consist of a gradual BZD taper in dose over 8 weeks. The taper will be flexible in that the study physician will utilize clinical judgement to lengthen the taper if necessary, depending on the severity of the participant's withdrawal symptoms. Anchor points will be set (33% reduction in dose after 2 weeks, 50% mid-treatment, 100% by week 8) to emphasize the time-limited nature of the taper.</description>
