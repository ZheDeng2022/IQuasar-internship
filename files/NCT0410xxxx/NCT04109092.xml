  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter, phase 1/1b study to assess safety/tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary clinical activity of E7766 as a single agent administered intravesically in&#xD;
      participants with NMIBC. Both intermediate risk and BCG-unresponsive NMIBC participants will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1/1b study consist of two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. In the Dose&#xD;
      Escalation Part, E7766 will be administered intravesically to participants with intermediate&#xD;
      risk NMIBC or participants with BCG unresponsive NMIBC with increased dose levels to assess&#xD;
      safety/tolerability profile of E7766 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7766. In the Dose Expansion Part, E7766 at RP2D will be&#xD;
      administered to participants with NMIBC with or without carcinoma in situ (CIS) to confirm&#xD;
      safety and assess preliminary clinical activity of E7766 as a single agent. Clinical activity&#xD;
      will be evaluated by complete response (CR) rates at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18&#xD;
      months, 24 months, and by duration of complete response (DOCR) in all participants who have&#xD;
      achieved CR on treatment with E7766.&#xD;
