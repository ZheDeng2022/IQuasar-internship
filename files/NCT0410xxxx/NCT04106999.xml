      Inflammation is associated with an increased risk of cancer recurrence. Various methods have&#xD;
      been used to decrease the inflammatory response induced by the cancer and surgery. In this&#xD;
      study the investigators would like determine if a commonly used sedative drug&#xD;
      (dexmedtomidine) has an impact on this inflammatory state when used as part of the&#xD;
      anesthetic. The investigators will conduct a pilot study with 20 patients undergoing a&#xD;
      Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedure as part of their cancer&#xD;
      treatment. 10 patients will receive the standard of care for anesthesia during the cancer&#xD;
      surgery and a placebo infusion of normal saline at a rate consistent to that of the study&#xD;
      drug. 10 additional patients will receive the same standard of care anesthetic plan with the&#xD;
      addition of an infusion of dexmeditomidine during the procedure. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure the degree of inflammation before, during and after the surgical procedure by looking&#xD;
      at the levels of inflammatory markers in blood samples. The goal is to determine if the&#xD;
      addition of dexmodtomidine affects the inflammatory state of patients undergoing a HIPEC&#xD;
      procedure. This information will be used to guide future studies aiming at decreasing cancer&#xD;
      recurrence and improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

      Purpose: To investigate the use of intra-operative dexmedetomidine infusions to reduce the&#xD;
      inflammatory and stress response of cytoreductive treatment and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy (HIPEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: HIPEC surgery patients who receive an intra-operative infusion of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      in addition to the current standard of care, consisting of parenteral and enteral opioids and&#xD;
      thoracic epidural will have a reduction in their inflammatory markers intra-operatively, in&#xD;
      PACU, POD1 and POD5 and a reduction in oral morphine equivalent opioid consumption in PACU&#xD;
      and POD1, in comparison to those who receive a placebo infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Surgical tumor excision is a cornerstone of primary cancer treatment, but is&#xD;
      also recognized as one of the greatest risk factors for metastatic spread. The perioperative&#xD;
      period, characterized by the surgical stress response and pharmacologic-induced angiogenesis&#xD;
      and immunomodulation, results in a physiologic environment that supports tumor spread and&#xD;
      distant reimplantation. There is potential for anesthesiologists to modulate the unwanted&#xD;
      consequences of the stress response on the immune system and minimize residual disease by&#xD;
      altering their anesthetic plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedtomidine is a commonly used sedative that can be used as part of an anesthetic during&#xD;
      surgery. In vitro and animal studies have shown that dexmedtomidine decreases the&#xD;
      inflammatory response but no research has been conducted with cancer-related conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine if dexmedtomidine, when used intraoperatively, can decrease the&#xD;
      levels of inflammation in patients a Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC)&#xD;
      procedure as part of their cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction in inflammatory markers: CRP, ESR, NLR, PLR, plasma viscosity, lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Reduction in Cancer markers: CEA (carcinoembyronic antigen] and CA19-9&#xD;
      Reduction in opioid use Reduction in volatile usage (average sevoflurane end-tidal level)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: In this pilot study, 20 patients undergoing a HIPEC procedure as part of&#xD;
      their cancer treatment will be randomized into 2 groups. One group (controls) will receive&#xD;
      the current anesthetic standard of care. The second group (experimental) will also receive&#xD;
      the current anesthetic standard of care with the addition of an infusion of dexmedtomidine&#xD;
      during the surgical procedure. Biomarkers of inflammation (Lactate, CRP, ESR, plasma&#xD;
      viscosity, NLR, PLR, and procalcitonin) and cancer markers (CEA and CA19-9) will be measured&#xD;
      at 5 time points: pre-operatively, intra-opertatively prior to chemotherapy, post-operatively&#xD;
      in the post-anaesthetic care unit, post-operative day 1, and post-operative day 5.&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis of the inflammatory markers will be used to compare the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Data will be summarized and t-tests will be used to compare the data&#xD;
      from the 2 groups.&#xD;
