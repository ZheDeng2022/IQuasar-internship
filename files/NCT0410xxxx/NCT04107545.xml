  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many elite athletes are submitted to frequent rapid weight loss periods to meet their&#xD;
      competition weight category and then experience weight cycling (lowing and gaining weight&#xD;
      regularly). This weight cycling induce severe temporary energetic and metabolic changes and&#xD;
      when repeated over time can lead to permanent metabolic adaptations that might favor&#xD;
      metabolic disorders, body weight gain and body composition changes (favoring fat mass). The&#xD;
      exact effects of this weight cycling are not clear yet, especially in terms of metabolic,&#xD;
      energetics, nutritional functional and psychological impacts. Better understand these&#xD;
      adaptations and their variations during weight loss and weight gain in regular weight cycler&#xD;
      is of main importance to prevent these athletes for future health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present project if to assess these metabolic, functional, energetic and&#xD;
      nutritional adaptations during weight loss, weight stable and weight gain periods in athletes&#xD;
      experiencing regular weight cycling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After an inclusion visit to ensure the eligibility of athletes to complete the entire study,&#xD;
      each subject will perform 3 experimental sessions of 2 visits each : i) two visits during a&#xD;
      period of maintenance of body weight (CON); ii) two visits during weight loss (WL); iii) two&#xD;
      visits during a weight regain (WG). The order of the periods (maintenance, loss or weight&#xD;
      gain) will depend on the dynamics of the weight variations of each athlete (endurance sport&#xD;
      and weight class) during the season and will therefore be individualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experiments will be conducted in the same way for the CON, WL or WG session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival, each subject will perform a resting metabolism with continuous measurement of&#xD;
      heart rate variability (≈ 30 min). Then, from 8:30, blood and saliva samples will be taken (≈&#xD;
      10 min). Then (≈ 8:45), they will perform anthropometric and body composition measurements&#xD;
      (waist circumference, hip circumference, bioimpedance, DXA) (≈ 30 min). Following these&#xD;
      measurements (≈ 9:15), the subjects will eat a standardized breakfast and the report to food&#xD;
      will be evaluated thanks to the Leeds Foods Preference Questionnaire before and after the&#xD;
      meal. They will then be asked (≈ 10h) to complete the Profile of Mood State Questionnaire to&#xD;
      measure the athlete's psychological state. Participants will then perform a measurement of&#xD;
      muscle function (≈ 10:30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit, carried out between 1 and 5 days after the first visit, the maximum&#xD;
      aerobic capacity of the athletes will be evaluated by mid-morning stress test.&#xD;
