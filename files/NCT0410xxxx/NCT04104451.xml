&#xD;
               1. present for at least 4 weeks at the time of Screening Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. located below the malleoli of the foot&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. extends to the dermis or subcutaneous tissue, surrounded by healthy skin, without&#xD;
                  evidence of exposed muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. area measures 1 to 10 cm2 inclusive, at Screening Visit 1, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. non-healing (defined as ≤50% reduction in ulcer size by the Baseline Visit, as&#xD;
                  compared to Screening Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Negative for antibodies to HLA Class I molecules expressed on Corlicyte MSCs, as&#xD;
             measured by Luminex HLA single antigen beads, within 3 months prior to start of&#xD;
             Treatment Phase without interval sensitizing events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For an index ulcer on the plantar surface of the foot, willingness to offload the foot&#xD;
             per study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. In women of childbearing potential, willingness to use effective means of birth&#xD;
             control during the course of the study; if using systemic birth control, this must&#xD;
             have been used for 6 months or longer prior to Screening Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Planned DFU treatment to the index ulcer that includes enzymatic agents, cytotoxic&#xD;
             agents or any substance(s) that would affect MSC survival during the study period.&#xD;

             proliferative retinopathy, bleeding diathesis, schizophrenia, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude enrollment&#xD;
             because of unacceptable risk.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Planned participation in another therapeutic study for any indication prior to&#xD;
             completion of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unwillingness or inability to comply with study visits and study procedures for the&#xD;
             entire duration of study participation.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Known Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to Screening Visit 1.&#xD;
