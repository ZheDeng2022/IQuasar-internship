&#xD;
          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have provided archival tumour tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional&#xD;
             biopsy of a tumour lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded&#xD;
             (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ function as defined in the following table. Specimens must be&#xD;
             collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a microsatellite instable tumour (MSI-High).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,&#xD;
             OX 40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received for the same disease prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including&#xD;
             investigational agents prior to starting pembrolizumab. Note: If participant received&#xD;
             major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or&#xD;
             complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior radiotherapy for the same disease. If treated with radiotherapy for&#xD;
             another disease, participants must have recovered from all radiation-related&#xD;
             toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an&#xD;
             investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last&#xD;
             dose of the previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;

          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             [HBsAg] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA &gt; 1.5E1 is&#xD;
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required&#xD;
             unless mandated by local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
