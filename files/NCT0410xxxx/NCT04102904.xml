      A multi-site study to evaluate the potential use of the ChEC test of seminal fluid as an&#xD;
      additional triage test in stratifying patients for further tests.&#xD;

      A biomarker is a molecular substance that is an indicator of a biological condition.&#xD;
      Cambridge Oncometrix believe that a semen biomarker may be able to predict the presence of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. This study will allow work to be carried out on semen samples donated by men&#xD;
      who have been identified by their GPs as having a risk of prostate cancer. Normally, GPs&#xD;
      refer men with symptoms or a raised PSA to hospital to have an MRI scan and a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PLiS research team at the hospital will contact potential patients, who have been&#xD;
      referred by their GPs, before they have an MRI or a biopsy, ask them if they are willing to&#xD;
      take part in the study, consent them and ask them to provide a semen sample. Semen samples&#xD;
      will be produced by the potential participants at home into a seminal fluid collection&#xD;
      container, they will also have to complete a study questionnaire. Both the sample and the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be returned to the central laboratory in Cambridge using the stamped&#xD;
      addressed envelope provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing a semen sample and completing a questionnaire, each participant will&#xD;
      have two blood tests to measure male hormones. Participants then exit the trial and their&#xD;
      usual care carries on from this point. The PLiS study will register 400 men and of those it&#xD;
      is hoped that 300 of them will be able to provide semen.&#xD;
