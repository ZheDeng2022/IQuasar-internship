  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common disease in Canada, leading to significant&#xD;
      morbidity as a result of remitting and relapsing intestinal inflammation. Currently, tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists such as infliximab, make up 30% of the biologic agents&#xD;
      available to individuals with IBD. There is a high risk of losing response or having a&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab, necessitating treatment discontinuation. This is&#xD;
      due, in part, to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). ADA formation can result in&#xD;
      loss of response to therapy which may eliminate an intestine-saving therapy and increases&#xD;
      their risk of progressing to surgical resection. There are few tools clinicians can implement&#xD;
      to minimize the risk of ADA formation. The current approach is to add a second drug (known as&#xD;
      combination therapy), specifically an immunomodulator (methotrexate or azathioprine),&#xD;
      exposing the patient to additional medication-related risks, intensive monitoring with&#xD;
      bi-weekly blood work and potential side effects including infection and malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from our group as well as others suggests that individuals who carry a&#xD;
      variant in the class 2 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene (HLADQA1*05A&gt;G, rs2097432) are more&#xD;
      likely to form ADAs to infliximab. Pre-emptive screening for this variant may allow&#xD;
      clinicians to more selectively use combination therapy, recommending it only in IBD patients&#xD;
      at high risk of developing ADAs to infliximab. Additionally, this may result in fewer&#xD;
      drug-associated adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, we aim to explore the value of prospective HLADQA1*05 screening&#xD;
      (pharmacogenomic screening) in IBD patients being considered for treatment with infliximab&#xD;
      and using the result to guide the application of combination therapy compared to IBD patients&#xD;
      treated with infliximab (with or without a second agent) as per current practice. We will&#xD;
      assess the incidence of infliximab ADA formation, as well as the incidence of infliximab loss&#xD;
      of response, treatment discontinuation, and adverse drug events. Additionally, we will assess&#xD;
      the time to each of these events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects over 250,000 individuals in Canada. It is comprised&#xD;
      of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The dysregulated inflammatory response&#xD;
      targeting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the hallmark of IBD and can lead to significant&#xD;
      physical and psychological morbidity amongst affected individuals. Hallmarks of the disease&#xD;
      include hematochezia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Individuals with IBD are committed to&#xD;
      long-term immunosuppressive therapy to drive disease into remission; however, such treatments&#xD;
      are associated with significant cost, as well as, a risk for significant drug-related&#xD;
      toxicities. Individuals who are resistant or lose response to traditional therapies may&#xD;
      require hospitalization and intestinal resection or colectomy. This is also associated with&#xD;
      significant costs to the health care system and to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last decade has seen an expansion in the number of therapies, specifically monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (biologics), available for the treatment of IBD, targeting and inhibiting&#xD;
      different proteins involved in perpetuating the inappropriate inflammatory response. There is&#xD;
      growing evidence to support the use of biologics early in the disease course, bypassing other&#xD;
      less effective and older treatments. In Canada there are currently five biologic agents&#xD;
      approved for the management of IBD: infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and&#xD;
      ustekinumab. Infliximab, the first biologic approved for the management of IBD in Canada and&#xD;
      the most widely used, is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody directed against the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-Î± (TNF). The efficacy of infliximab in CD&#xD;
      and UC has been demonstrated in landmark trials; ACCENT and ACT respectively. It is&#xD;
      considered a standard of care for moderate to severe IBD in treatment algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, up to 40% of patients who initially respond to a TNF antagonist such as&#xD;
      infliximab will lose response by the one-year mark. Additionally, up to 23% of individuals&#xD;
      with IBD exposed to infliximab will have an immediate infusion reaction with flushing,&#xD;
      urticaria, presyncope and dyspnea necessitating treatment cessation. A leading contributor to&#xD;
      both loss of response and infusion reactions is the development of anti-drug antibodies&#xD;
      (ADAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAs are a consequence of the &quot;immunogenicity&quot; of TNF antagonists. Immunogenicity refers to&#xD;
      the immune response of the exposed individual against large molecule therapeutic proteins&#xD;
      such as infliximab. The underlying mechanisms of immunogenicity in TNF antagonist-exposed IBD&#xD;
      patients are poorly defined. Clinically, ADAs are very relevant to IBD treatment as some ADAs&#xD;
      can inhibit drug function or induce hypersensitivity in exposed patients. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that the presence of ADAs correlates with a loss of response to infliximab as well as with a&#xD;
      high risk of infusion reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic drug monitoring, the ability to measure ADAs, in addition to serum drug&#xD;
      concentrations, has revolutionized IBD treatment algorithms by providing objective evidence&#xD;
      to inform clinical decision-making. Unfortunately, the current tools are only able to&#xD;
      identify ADAs once they have developed and thus, treatment adjustments are reactive as&#xD;
      opposed to preemptive. Patients are often only screened for ADAs once loss of response or a&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction have occured. One way clinicians attempt to reduce the risk of ADA&#xD;
      formation is to empirically combine a second immune-suppressing agent such as methotrexate or&#xD;
      azathioprine (immunomodulators) with infliximab. The addition of an immunomodulator to&#xD;
      infliximab-based therapy (combination therapy) is associated with reduced ADA formation. The&#xD;
      downside is that combination therapy may be associated with an increased risk of infection,&#xD;
      malignancy and other side effects related to the immunomodulator (pancreatitis,&#xD;
      myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity). There is also concern over the use of dual immunosuppression&#xD;
      in certain patient populations, including frail elderly or patients at high risk of infection&#xD;
      or malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no clinical tools that predict who will develop ADAs, lose response to&#xD;
      or have a hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab. Additionally, there are few ways to&#xD;
      predict the risk of adverse events in IBD patients treated with combination therapy.&#xD;
      Recently, in an peer-reviewed dataset, a group demonstrated that variation in the class 2&#xD;
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene region (HLADQA1*05A&gt;G, rs2097432) is linked to an&#xD;
      increased risk of ADA formation against infliximab and to a lesser extent, its sister&#xD;
      TNF-antagonist, adalimumab18. In a separate, retrospective study, we have confirmed that&#xD;
      variation in HLADQA1*05A&gt;G (rs2097432) is independently-associated with a significantly&#xD;
      higher incidence of and faster progression to infliximab ADA formation. Moreover, we&#xD;
      demonstrated that variant carriers had a higher risk of infliximab loss of response,&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation as well as a faster progression to these outcomes (Wilson et.al.&#xD;
      2019 unpublished/Gastro, submitted). Interestingly, the addition of co-immunosuppression&#xD;
      (methotrexate or azathioprine) to infliximab therapy reduced the risk of antibody formation&#xD;
      in variant carriers compared to that of an individual with a wild type genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having the capacity to identify individuals at high risk of ADA formation and apply targeted&#xD;
      combination therapy to those individuals and avoid combination therapy in others would be&#xD;
      exceedingly valuable in clinical practice. Thus, we propose to assess the utility of&#xD;
      preemptively screening patients with IBD who are being considered for infliximab therapy for&#xD;
      HLADQA1*05A&gt;G and applying co-immunosuppression with an immunomodulator (methotrexate or&#xD;
      azathioprine) to the variant carriers (AG or GG) compared to those received the current&#xD;
      standard of care. We will assess the resultant impact on infliximab ADA formation in addition&#xD;
      to highly relevant clinical outcomes such as infliximab loss of response, treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation, and adverse drug events.&#xD;
