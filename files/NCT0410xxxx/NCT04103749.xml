    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center case series of per standard of care ERCP procedures&#xD;
      using a nonsignificant risk single-use duodenoscope. Up to 1000 cases will be included at up&#xD;
      to 40 clinical sites. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be included and will&#xD;
      have a clinically indicated ERCP procedure performed using the study device. Enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will be followed for 30 days after their procedure.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Procedure success is assessed at the end of the procedure (within 24 hours on study day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to complete the ERCP procedure for the intended indication(s); outcome reported as &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot;.&#xD;
Examples include but are not limited to: biliary stent placement, pancreatic stent placement, sphincterotomy, and clearance of bile duct stones.</description>

    <description>Endoscopist rating of the Exalt single-use duodenoscope compared to their past experience with marketed reusable duodenoscopes as it pertains to various design and performance related attributes, recorded on two Likert scales of different ranges. The maneuverability and performance related attributes will be rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).</description>
