    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study, the focus of which is to understand the nature of asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations that occur despite open label benralizumab therapy in severe eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase IV, open-label, prospective, multi-centre cohort study in patients with severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] steps 4 and 5 classification of&#xD;
      asthma severity) who will be treated with benralizumab injections. The study is exploratory&#xD;
      and will assess deteriorations in asthma control (exacerbations) to characterise the clinical&#xD;
      severity of each exacerbation and the airway and systemic inflammatory phenotype associated&#xD;
      with these events. Clinical assessment and management of each exacerbation will be in line&#xD;
      with standard clinical guidelines. 150 participants will be recruited and receive treatment&#xD;
      for either 56 or 80 weeks.&#xD;
