  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study experimentally investigates whether reducing highly processed (HP) foods&#xD;
      (defined in this study as foods high in added sugars) leads to, psychological and / or&#xD;
      behavioral indicators of withdrawal. The following hypotheses are tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that reducing highly processed food intake will result in higher&#xD;
           daily reports of physical (e.g. headaches), cognitive (e.g. difficulty concentrating),&#xD;
           and affective (e.g., irritability) withdrawal symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that reducing highly processed food intake will result in&#xD;
           increased negative affect (e.g., irritability, depression) as indicated by and&#xD;
           psychological (self - reported distress ratings; daily emotion / mood reports) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the hypothesis that reducing highly processed food intake will result in&#xD;
           increased food craving as indicated by psychological (self - report craving ratings;&#xD;
           daily craving report) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All activities are completed remotely. Participants complete 4 phone appointments with a&#xD;
      trained member of the research team. Daily questionnaires and ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessments are completed at home between phone appointments. The initial call signs&#xD;
      electronic consent and gets baseline measurements (questionnaires). After the initial call,&#xD;
      participants start an active assessment period (pre / post dietary change assessments).&#xD;
      Pre-dietary change includes at home questionnaires and ecological momentary assessments while&#xD;
      eating a typical diet. It also includes the second phone appointment. Post-dietary change&#xD;
      includes at home questionnaires and ecological momentary assessments while consuming 3 days&#xD;
      of food portions lower in highly processed foods. Participants will complete a food journal&#xD;
      on the remaining 2 days of post - dietary change assessment to report what food they ate.&#xD;
      Post - dietary change also includes the third phone appointment. The second and third phone&#xD;
      appointments each include computer tasks and questionnaires. The final phone appointment is a&#xD;
      debriefing interview. Participants planning to continue eating a healthier diet may also be&#xD;
      invited to complete a follow-up period, which involves answering a short questionnaire at&#xD;
      home every other day for two weeks. 7 individuals had in-person data collected prior to the&#xD;
      pandemic requiring a shift to virtual data collection.&#xD;

    <measure>Increase in affective withdrawal symptoms during post-dietary change assessment using the Highly Processed Food Withdrawal Scale (PRoWS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The PRoWS is a validated self-report measure of indicators of withdrawal. Affective withdrawal symptoms are measured by asking participants to complete the Highly Processed Food Withdrawal Scale (PRoWS), which is a validated self-report measure of withdrawal. PRoWS questions ask about current feelings / emotions. Response options are &quot;strongly disagree&quot; &quot;disagree&quot; &quot;feel neutral&quot; &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Participants are asked to complete these measures every day of the pre and post dietary change. Change in self - report responses on the PRoWS at pre dietary change compared to post dietary change will be used for analyses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Increase in negative affect during post-dietary change assessment using ecological momentary assessments (EMA).</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Negative Affect is measured by asking participants to self-report affect (e.g., irritability, depression) on their smart phones throughout the day during pre and post dietary change. Participants are asked to give ratings of their current feelings / emotions and to provide contextual information (location, environment, etc.). Response options are a 5 points scale with extreme ends of scale marked as &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Changes in ratings from pre dietary change to post dietary change within subjects will be used for analyses</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Increase in negative affect during post-dietary change assessment using Profile of Mood Scale (POMS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Profile of Moods Scale - Abbreviated (POMS) is a well validated, self - report scale of affect. The POMS is used to measure daily global affect. The POMS asks about current feelings / emotions. Response options are &quot;not at all&quot; &quot;a little&quot; &quot;moderate&quot; &quot;quite a bit&quot; and &quot;extremely.&quot; Participants are asked to complete these measures daily during pre and post dietary change. Change in self-report responses on the POMS at pre dietary change compared to post dietary change will be used for analyses.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a stress task during pre and post dietary change. Food cue reactivity symptoms are measured by asking participants to complete the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) which asked about current feeling / emotions. Response options are &quot;very slightly / not at all&quot; &quot;a little&quot; &quot;moderately&quot; &quot;quite a bit&quot; or &quot;extremely.&quot; Participants are asked to complete these measures before and after completing a stress exposure task during the pre and post dietary change. The magnitude of change in self - report responses in negative affect in response to the stress task on the PANAS at pre dietary change compared to post dietary change will be used for analyses.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Food cravings are measured by asking participants to self-report food cravings and to provide contextual information (location, environment, etc.) on their smart phones throughout the day. Response options are a 5 points scale with extreme ends of scale marked as &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The magnitude of change in cravings ratings from pre dietary change to post dietary change within subjects will be used for analyses.</description>

    <description>Participants do an initial call for baseline data. Then the active assessment period (pre / post dietary change) begins. Pre - dietary change procedure is 5 days of standard high HP diet while completing daily electronic assessments of withdrawal, ecological momentary assessments, and a phone appointment. Post - dietary change is 5 days of lower HP diet (food provided for 3 of 5 days) while completing daily electronic assessments of withdrawal, ecological momentary assessments, and a phone appointment. Daily assessments of affect, craving, and withdrawal are all virtual. On day 4-5 of post assessment, participants complete a food journal to report foods they ate to ensure compliance to low HP food diet. The pre / post-dietary change phone appointments include 1) psychosocial stress task, 2) cue reactivity task, 3) questionnaires 4) self-reported weight. Participants may also complete a follow up period of questionnaires every other day and self-report weight at the end of follow up.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dietary Change (low in highly processed foods)</intervention_name>
    <description>For post-dietary change, food is provided for 3 days (participants provide own food and do food journals the other 2 days to confirm adherence). University of Michigan's Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC)'s Metabolic Kitchen prepares the food. Low HP food diet is based on prior methods where participants are placed on an isocaloric diet composed of 5% or less of calories from added sugar and 10% or less of overall calories from total sugar. No foods that meet the criteria for a HP food (defined by Kant and colleagues) that corresponds to: sweeteners (sugar, candy, etc); carbonated and non-carbonated beverages (fruit drinks, sweetened / diet beverages, etc.); baked / dairy desserts (cookies, ice cream, etc.); salted snacks (potato chips, etc.) and fast foods (pizza, cheeseburgers, etc.) are included in diet portions. The overall macro nutrient composition of the diet will be approximately 20-25% of kcal from protein, 30-35% of kcal from fat, and 40-50% of kcal from carbohydrates.</description>
