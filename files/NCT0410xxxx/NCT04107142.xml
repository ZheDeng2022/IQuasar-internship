  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open-label, single-centre, dose escalation, phase I study designed&#xD;
      to investigate the safety and tolerability of Haploidentical / Allogeneic NKG2DL-targeting&#xD;
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor-grafted Gamma Delta (γδ) T Cells (CTM-N2D) in Subjects with&#xD;
      Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumour. The study objectives of this phase I study are to&#xD;
      determine the safety, activity and the safe dose of haploidentical or allogeneic&#xD;
      NKG2DL-targeting chimeric antigen receptor-grafted γδ T cells given four times weekly in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors of different types.&#xD;

      CTM-N2D-101 is a phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of CTM-N2D and the&#xD;
      feasibility to produce CTM-N2D for three target dose levels between 3x10^8 - 3x10^9 per&#xD;
      infusion will be tested. Four doses will be given at an interval of a week into subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical 3+3 design will be used to determine the safe regimen basing on the incidence of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The identified safe regimen will be used for further phase II&#xD;
      studies for selected indications.&#xD;
