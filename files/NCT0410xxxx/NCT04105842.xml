  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to refit habitual wearers of daily disposable contact lenses who&#xD;
      currently experience symptoms of dry eye and discomfort during lens wear with a different&#xD;
      type of daily disposable contact lens. Ocular signs and symptoms of dry eye will be assessed&#xD;
      following the guidelines outlined by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society (TFOS) in the&#xD;
      Dry Eye Workshop II (DEWS II). The performance of the habitual contact lenses and the study&#xD;
      lenses will be determined using different optometric assessments. Study lenses will be worn&#xD;
      for one month following a daily disposable wear schedule.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or&#xD;
                  inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered&#xD;
                  clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction,&#xD;
                  papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered&#xD;
                  active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of&#xD;
                  previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.&#xD;
