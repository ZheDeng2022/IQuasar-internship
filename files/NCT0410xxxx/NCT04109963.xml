    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel disease is a common cause of cognitive impairment. Remote ischemic&#xD;
      pre-conditioning (RIC) is a technique to induce brief periods of limb ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      that is hypothesized to increase tolerance of the brain to hypoperfusion and increase&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow. Patients with cognitive impairment, preserved basic activities of daily&#xD;
      living, and brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of&#xD;
      confluent white matter hyperintensities or multiple brain infarcts will be randomized to&#xD;
      either RIC performed once a day on one arm, or twice per day on one arm, for 30 days, to test&#xD;
      tolerability and effects on MRI markers of blood flow.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) accounts for 20-25% of all strokes and is the most&#xD;
      common cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) as well as a major contributor to mixed&#xD;
      dementia, potentially interacting with Alzheimer's disease. Remote ischemic pre-conditioning&#xD;
      (RIC) is a technique to induce brief periods of limb ischemia-reperfusion that is&#xD;
      hypothesized to increase tolerance of the brain to hypoperfusion. This is a prospective,&#xD;
      open-label randomized controlled clinical trial with blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE).&#xD;
      Participants that complete a 14-day run-in period will be randomized to 30 days of either: a)&#xD;
      RIC performed once per day on one arm, or b) RIC performed twice per day on one arm. Each RIC&#xD;
      session will consist of 4 cycles of unilateral upper arm ischemia for 5 minutes followed by&#xD;
      reperfusion for another 5 minutes, administered by modified blood pressure monitor (under an&#xD;
      Investigational Trail Authorization from Health Canada). The primary outcome is tolerability,&#xD;
      defined as the proportion in each trial arm that complete 80% or more of the assigned RIC&#xD;
      sessions. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores, cognition, and MRI markers of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow and white matter integrity.&#xD;
