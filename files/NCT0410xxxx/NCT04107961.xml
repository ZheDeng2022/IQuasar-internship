    <textblock>
      The LEISH3 trial is a randomised, controlled, double blind Phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccination with ChAd63-KH in the prevention of post-kala&#xD;
      azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in Sudanese visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients previously&#xD;
      treated with sodium stibogluconate / paromomycin (SSG / PM).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The leishmaniases are poverty-related neglected diseases with a major impact on health&#xD;
      worldwide. They affect the poorest of the poor and present a severe barrier to socio-economic&#xD;
      development. Caused by infection with one of several species of Leishmania parasite, these&#xD;
      diseases occur in 98 countries worldwide and can be broadly classified as tegumentary&#xD;
      leishmaniases (TL; affecting the skin and mucosa) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL; affecting&#xD;
      internal organs). Worldwide, over 1 million reported cases of TL and 0.5 million reported&#xD;
      cases of VL occur each year. Whereas TL are chronic and non-life-threatening, VL is&#xD;
      responsible for over 20,000 deaths per year, second only to malaria amongst parasites with&#xD;
      regard to mortality. Collectively, approximately 2.4 million disability-adjusted life years&#xD;
      are lost to the leishmaniases. No vaccines are currently licensed for any form of human&#xD;
      leishmaniasis and the drug arsenal is limited and increasingly compromised by drug&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The format of the LEISH3 trial is randomised, controlled, double blind Phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccination with ChAd63-KH in&#xD;
      the prevention of post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in 262 Sudanese visceral&#xD;
      leishmaniasis (VL) patients aged between 12 and 50 years who have been previously treated&#xD;
      with sodium stibogluconate / paromomycin (SSG / PM). Follow up is 12 months from vaccination.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare systemic immune responses in vaccine vs placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In all subjects, after treatment of VL, to measure skin Leishmania parasite load and&#xD;
           multi-parameter immune phenotypes as predictors of PKDL development and in relation to&#xD;
           receipt of vaccine or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In subjects developing PKDL within the trial, to delineate the pathogenesis of PKDL by&#xD;
           comparing skin Leishmania parasite load and multi-parameter immune phenotypes&#xD;
           pre-vaccination and at PKDL onset, and in relation to receipt of vaccine or placebo.&#xD;
