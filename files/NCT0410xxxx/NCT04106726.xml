             treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the facial treatment area&#xD;
             including those present on the nose. Lesions involving the eyes, and scalp will be&#xD;
             excluded from the count.&#xD;

             severity grade 3 or 4 as per the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) (per Table 1&#xD;
             below) at screening and baseline visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have persistent erythema on the face with moderate (2) score or higher&#xD;
             (per table 2 below) at screening and baseline visits.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subjects must be willing to refrain from using all other topical medications for&#xD;
             rosacea during the 12-week treatment period, other than the investigational product.&#xD;
