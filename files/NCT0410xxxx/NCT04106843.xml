  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well 177Lu-DOTATATE works in treating patients with rare&#xD;
      endocrine cancers that have spread from where they started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes&#xD;
      (locally advanced), spread to other places in the body (metastatic), or cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery (unresectable). Radioactive drugs, such as 177Lu-DOTATATE, may carry radiation&#xD;
      directly to cancer cells and not harm normal cells. 177Lu-DOTATATE may help to control&#xD;
      endocrine cancers compared to standard treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
      determined by Ia. Computed tomography (CT) or Ib. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression-free survival at 1-year. II. To correlate blood pressure control&#xD;
      and change/discontinuation of antihypertensive medications with tumor responses in patients&#xD;
      with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PHPGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate plasma metanephrines and chromogranin A with tumor responses in patients&#xD;
      with PHPGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and chromogranin A with tumor&#xD;
      responses in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate pituitary hormones (depending on particular tumor, e.g. prolactin for&#xD;
      prolactinomas, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) for acromegaly, adrenocorticotropic hormone&#xD;
      (ACTH) and 24-hour urine free cortisol for Cushing disease, and chromogranin A with tumor&#xD;
      responses in patients with functional pituitary carcinomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To correlate calcium, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and chromogranin A with tumor&#xD;
      responses in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Toxicity assessment by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0&#xD;
      (CTCAE 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To correlate tumor responses with tumor uptake score in somatostatin receptor&#xD;
      scintigraphy, overall prognosis and responsiveness to lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
      (177Lu-DOTATATE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine the percentage of tumors that demonstrate uptake on diagnostic&#xD;
      68Gallium-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/CT that would make treatment with&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTATATE feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate pituitary function in all patients to look for possible radiation late effects&#xD;
      on the pituitary gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate best biochemical response for specific tumor markers in patients with&#xD;
      non-measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate biochemical response in patients with non-measurable disease with RECIST&#xD;
      1.1 tumor response criteria for patients with non-measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 177Lu-DOTATATE intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 8-16 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment continues for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 72 and then every 24&#xD;
      weeks for up to 5 years.&#xD;
