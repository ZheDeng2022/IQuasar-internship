  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a text-message delivered approach for improving&#xD;
      college adjustment and experience and reducing risky alcohol use in young adult college&#xD;
      students. The study compares a text-message delivered brief motivational intervention for&#xD;
      reducing alcohol use and increasing engagement in alcohol-free activities, to text-message&#xD;
      delivered alcohol and nutrition education sessions. The investigators predict that&#xD;
      individuals who receive the brief motivational intervention will report less alcohol use and&#xD;
      fewer related problems 3 months following the intervention compared to those who receive the&#xD;
      education sessions. The investigators also expect that these individuals will report greater&#xD;
      engagement in alcohol-free activities compared to those who receive the education sessions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will develop and empirically evaluate a mobile-based alcohol brief&#xD;
      intervention and substance-free activity session. To do this, study personnel will develop&#xD;
      and systematically evaluate an intervention that includes efficacious elements of brief&#xD;
      alcohol interventions along with personalized feedback. Intervention elements will be&#xD;
      delivered remotely via personalized web-based feedback and text-messages. The proposed&#xD;
      project will evaluate the efficacy of the mobile-based brief alcohol intervention compared to&#xD;
      mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education in the context of a randomized pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be divided into two stages: Stage 1, the screening stage, and Stage 2, the&#xD;
      randomized pilot trial stage. During the screening stage, participants will be recruited and&#xD;
      screened for eligibility to participate in Stage 2. The randomized controlled trial stage&#xD;
      (stage 2) will test the feasibility and efficacy of a mobile-based BMI + SFAS in the context&#xD;
      of a two-group experimental design. All students (N = 100) will complete a baseline&#xD;
      assessment and will then be randomly assigned to either receive a mobile-based BMI + SFAS, or&#xD;
      mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education. Each group will receive 4 weeks of booster&#xD;
      contact (1 booster session per week) on material from their respective study condition.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed after the fourth booster session and at a 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a brief screening survey via the SONA system or through a secure&#xD;
      web-link sent via email or posted in flyers to identify those students who might be eligible&#xD;
      to participate in the study. In order to be contacted about the clinical trial, respondents&#xD;
      will be asked to provide contact information. Ads and flyers will also include study contact&#xD;
      information for interested respondents/participants to contact study staff directly and&#xD;
      screen for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant meets eligibility criteria, the researcher will speak with the participant&#xD;
      via phone call to explain the project procedures and confidentiality in more detail, and&#xD;
      allow the participant the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about the study.&#xD;
      Text messaging and email may also be used as methods to communicate with participants who&#xD;
      meet the eligibility criteria and will be used as the primary method of communication if the&#xD;
      student prefers. Participants will be informed that the study is designed to learn more about&#xD;
      college students' lifestyle and health behaviors and that the study will involve random&#xD;
      assignment to one of two treatment conditions, along with 4 booster sessions by text-message,&#xD;
      a post-intervention survey immediately following the 4th booster session, and a survey&#xD;
      follow-up three months after their last booster session. If the participant expresses&#xD;
      interest in the study, the study administrator will invite them to participate in further&#xD;
      phases of the study. If students do not meet the eligibility criteria at the time of&#xD;
      screening, but indicate drinking in the past 6-months, they may be contacted later and&#xD;
      re-screened via phone, text message or email and then enrolled if interested in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible and interested individuals will remotely read and e-sign the consent form, provide&#xD;
      contact information, and complete the initial baseline assessment via a secure web-link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All self-report measures will be completed by the participant via a secure, web-based survey.&#xD;
      Prior to completing baseline measures, participants will be provided with a consent form and&#xD;
      will be informed of the study's purpose, risks, benefits, compensation, and all other&#xD;
      pertinent study details. Participants will be provided with a phone number and email address&#xD;
      should they have questions and will also be informed in the consent that they can discontinue&#xD;
      the study at any time. If participants choose not to e-sign the consent form or decide not to&#xD;
      participate in the study at any time, they will be provided with information about college&#xD;
      student alcohol misuse on websites, hotlines, and local resources to learn more about their&#xD;
      drinking if they are interested. The remote web-based assessment will last approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes. After completing the assessment, participants will be randomized to either a) the&#xD;
      mobile-based BMI+SFAS (mBMI+SFAS); or b) mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education (mA+NE)&#xD;
      (both described below). Immediately following the baseline assessment and random assignment,&#xD;
      participants will take part in a 60-minute session of either the mobile BMI or mobile Alcohol&#xD;
      Education. Later the same week, participants will take part in either one 60-minute session&#xD;
      of the mobile SFAS or mobile Nutrition Education. The interventionist conducting the mobile&#xD;
      BMI or Alcohol Education earlier in the week will also conduct the mobile SFAS or Nutrition&#xD;
      Education, respectively, as well as all booster contact. A brief 3-item survey will be&#xD;
      administered immediately following the mobile SFAS or Nutrition Education session that will&#xD;
      solicit initial impressions and feedback on these respective sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booster contact will take place once a week for four weeks for approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
      Booster contact for the mBMI+SFAS group will also collect information on past week time&#xD;
      allocation, level of discounting of future monetary rewards (delay discounting), and the&#xD;
      subjective reward value of alcohol, which are associated with problematic alcohol use. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the booster contact, participants will complete a 5-week assessment survey via&#xD;
      secure web link. The post-intervention survey will collect information on the participants'&#xD;
      experiences with the mobile-based interventions and will solicit feedback about the&#xD;
      interventions. They will then be thanked for their participation and reminded of their&#xD;
      3-month follow-up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to download on to their smartphone or personal computer a&#xD;
      secure messaging web app called Babelnet (https://www.babelnet.com/en/). Babelnet is free to&#xD;
      download and use, and study personnel will assist participants in the download and use of the&#xD;
      app. Participants will be assigned a username that will be similar to their study&#xD;
      identification number and a password that will be saved in a secure, password protected file&#xD;
      only accessible to study personnel. In the event a participant has forgotten or lost their&#xD;
      Babelnet login information, they may contact study personnel to retrieve it and log in&#xD;
      securely. Messages sent through Babelnet are heavily encrypted by the app. However, study&#xD;
      personnel will record (via screenshot or copy-and-paste) the text conversations to facilitate&#xD;
      later communication and for intervention supervisory, as well as fidelity, purposes. These&#xD;
      recordings will be saved on a secure server in a password protected shared drive that is&#xD;
      accessible only to study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months post-booster completion, participants will be asked to remotely complete a&#xD;
      web-based follow-up self-report assessment battery. The follow-up will assess the impact of&#xD;
      the interventions on attitudes and behaviors toward alcohol use, as well as patterns of&#xD;
      alcohol-related problems and drinking levels, and will last approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 3-month assessment, participants will be given the option to complete any of the&#xD;
      intervention sessions that they did not complete as a part of the study or to complete a&#xD;
      session for a second time.&#xD;
