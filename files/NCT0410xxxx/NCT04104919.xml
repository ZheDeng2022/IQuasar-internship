  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of brivoligide injection administered intrathecally before surgery in&#xD;
      patients with high Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) scores undergoing mastectomy with&#xD;
      immediate tissue expander or implant placement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be prescreened for PCS score; pre-qualified patients will be invited&#xD;
      to the investigative site for informed consent and full screening within 30 days of&#xD;
      randomization. Patients providing informed consent and meeting all study eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study on the day of surgery (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive study drug just prior to anesthesia induction. Study assessments will&#xD;
      be entered by subjects in the electronic diary from Day 1 through Day 21. Follow-up visits&#xD;
      will occur on Days 7 and 21 (± 2 days).&#xD;
