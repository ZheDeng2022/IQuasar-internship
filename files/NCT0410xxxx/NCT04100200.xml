  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to characterize changes in indices of systemic and gut&#xD;
      inflammation, assess host- and microbial-derived metabolite pools, and describe and link&#xD;
      functional metagenomics and metatranscriptomic alterations in the gut microbiome with&#xD;
      metabolite and inflammatory outcomes after acute (24hr) and chronic (4 week) intake of&#xD;
      anthocyanins and ellagitannins from strawberry and red raspberries compared to a control diet&#xD;
      (negative control), FOS (positive control, non-polyphenol, carbohydrate-based fermentable&#xD;
      fiber/pre-biotic), or combination diet (berry composite + FOS) in human participants with&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be conducted in humans according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      guidelines. All subjects will review and sign an Informed Consent Form approved by the&#xD;
      Illinois Institute of Technology's Institutional Review Boards (IRB) prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blinded, 4-arm, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. It features an acute single exposure 24-h protocol and a chronic 4-week daily intake&#xD;
      protocol to evaluate the effects of anthocyanins and ellagitannins from strawberry and red&#xD;
      raspberry intake compared to a control diet, FOS, or FOS and berries combined on gut&#xD;
      inflammation, in adults with chronic low-grade inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 88 will be enrolled in the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit, a pre-study visit, and 5 study visits. This study will take 5 weeks&#xD;
      per subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject with their site-specific, IRB-approved&#xD;
      informed consent document prior to the start of any study-related procedures. Subject&#xD;
      eligibility will be determined through a high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) marker&#xD;
      value, anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood glucose test (finger prick),&#xD;
      and completion of a survey related to general eating, health, mood and exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will follow a limited polyphenolic diet throughout the duration of their&#xD;
      participation, although stricter guidelines will be imposed during the 3 days prior to a&#xD;
      study visit that involved blood/urine/fecal collection. Shopping lists and meal plans will be&#xD;
      provided to subjects, along with counseling by the investigator's study investigators, to&#xD;
      help subjects adhere to the limited polyphenolic diet. The trial will initiate with a 3-day&#xD;
      food diary to assess background (pre-study) dietary intake followed by counseling to follow a&#xD;
      diet relatively low in (poly)phenolic rich-beverages/foods, which will be maintained for the&#xD;
      duration of the experiment. After an initial 7-day wash-in period on the limited polyphenolic&#xD;
      diet, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences in the form of a drink: a&#xD;
      mixed berries diet (raspberries and strawberries), a FOS diet (non-polyphenol,&#xD;
      carbohydrate-based fermentable fiber/pre-biotic), a combination diet (mixed berries + FOS),&#xD;
      or a control diet (negative control). Subjects will receive the same treatment for the&#xD;
      duration of the study. Treatment codes will be maintained by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will last ~2 hours and subjects will be required to remain at the Clinical&#xD;
      Nutrition Research Center for the duration of the visit. Fasting blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at the 0 and 24h time points via a butterfly needle placed by a certified&#xD;
      phlebotomist.&#xD;
