  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) compose approximately 20% of soft tissue sarcomas with&#xD;
      an annual incidence of approximately 7 per million population. GISTs occur throughout the GI&#xD;
      tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. The main treatment for localised GIST&#xD;
      is surgical resection. At least 40% of these patients will develop recurrence or metastasis&#xD;
      following complete resection. Local recurrence, liver metastases and/or dissemination within&#xD;
      the abdominal cavity are the most common clinical manifestations. Although imatinib and&#xD;
      sunitinib has greatly improved the quality of life and survival of patients with advanced&#xD;
      GIST. Analysis of clinical trials revealed that patients with tumours with KIT exon 17 or 18&#xD;
      mutations, with a second mutation in KIT exon 17 or 18, had worse responses to imatinib and&#xD;
      sunitinib. Some patients with PDGFRA D842V mutation do not respond to the present standard&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anlotinib (1-[[[4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-1H-indol-5-yloxy)-6-methoxyquinolin-7-Yl] oxy]&#xD;
      methyl]cyclopropanamine dihydrochloride) , a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI),&#xD;
      characterized as a highly selective and potent c-KIT, VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR inhibitor. In vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo, Anlotinib has a broad spectrum of inhibitory action on tumor angiogenesis and&#xD;
      growth, which showed broad activity against soft tissue sarcoma and GIST with D842V, D816H,&#xD;
      V560G and V654A mutations. In 2015, the US FDA granted orphan drug treatment for ovarian&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
