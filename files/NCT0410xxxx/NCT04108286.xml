    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, 4-visit, contralateral, dispensing, open-label, randomized study. Each&#xD;
      eligible subject will be randomized into one of two sequence groups to wear two lens types&#xD;
      contralaterally (Test on the right eye and Control on left eye or vice versa).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and&#xD;
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical&#xD;
                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Between 18 and 45 (inclusive) years of age at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Be a current spherical soft contact lens wearer in both eyes with a minimum of 6&#xD;
                  hours/day and 5 days/week wear time over the last 30 days by self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Have a pair of spectacles with corrected vision of 20/40 or better in each eye or&#xD;
                  uncorrected vision is 20/40 or better in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. The subject's vertex-corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be&#xD;
                  in the range of -1.00 through -6.00 D in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. The subject has a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens&#xD;
                  wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Any autoimmune disease or use of medication, which may interfere with contact&#xD;
                  lens wear. Habitual medications used by successful soft contact lens wearers are&#xD;
                  considered acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Any ocular abnormalities such as entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia,&#xD;
                  recurrent styes, history of recurrent corneal erosions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,&#xD;
                  PRK, LASIK, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Multifocal, toric or extended wear contact lens correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14&#xD;
                  days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or contagious&#xD;
                  immunosuppressive diseases (e.g., HIV) by self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Employee or immediate family member of an employee of clinical site (e.g.,&#xD;
                  Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Any ocular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Any Grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal&#xD;
                  neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival&#xD;
                  injection) on the EFRON scale (Appendix G), any previous history or signs of a&#xD;
                  contact lens-related corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or&#xD;
                  round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate&#xD;
                  contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable&#xD;
                  contact lens wear.&#xD;
