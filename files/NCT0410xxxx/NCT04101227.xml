  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive either 0.33 mg AD04 or placebo orally twice-daily for&#xD;
      24 weeks in conjunction with brief psychological counseling. Randomization will be stratified&#xD;
      by gender and level of alcohol consumption prior to enrollment in the study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Target enrollment of subjects with AUD who regularly engage in risk alcohol consumption (i.e.&#xD;
      &gt;6/day or more heavy alcohol consumption in the 4 weeks preceding the screening visit), and&#xD;
      have selected genotypes (LL/TT genotype and/or 1, 2 or 3 of the SNPs on the genes for the&#xD;
      5-HT3 receptor subunits: rs1150226-AG or rs1176713-GG in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3A&#xD;
      receptor subunit, and rs17614942-AC in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3B receptor subunit),&#xD;
      and who are eligible to participate in the study based on meeting the remaining study&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either 0.33 mg&#xD;
      AD04 or placebo BID for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will have a 16-week grace period to enable medication effects to be optimal for&#xD;
      comparison with placebo. The grace period starts immediately after beginning of study drug&#xD;
      treatment, in which consumption of alcohol is not counted as a failure. All primary and&#xD;
      secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed during the last 8 weeks of treatment (i.e.&#xD;
      weeks 17-24). The primary measure of efficacy, incidence risk alcohol consumption, will be&#xD;
      assessed over the last 8 weeks of treatment. To enhance study feasibility, subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated every week during the first 8 weeks of treatment and every other week for the&#xD;
      remaining 16 weeks of the treatment period.&#xD;
