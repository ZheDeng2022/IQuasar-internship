      To compare short-term clinical outcomes of primary PCI between the ostial LAD-AMI and the&#xD;
      non-ostial LAD-AMI. The primary endpoint was the major cardiovascular events (MACE) defined&#xD;
      as being the composite of cardiac death, AMI, stent thrombosis&#xD;

      Current guidelines recommend percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for most patients with&#xD;
      ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) or with non ST segment elevation&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) (1), (2). In STEMI patients, PCI is advised in all patients&#xD;
      in the first 12 hours after onset of symptoms, the earlier the better (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary revascularization does not always lead to coronary reperfusion. The development of&#xD;
      devices and procedure has improved clinical outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) to the culprit of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD)-AMI has still been associated with&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality because of the broad ischemic area (6, 7). In fact, clinical&#xD;
      outcomes were significantly worse in the proximal LAD-AMI as compared with the mid LAD-AMI.5)&#xD;
      Moreover, the proximal LAD disease in stable angina was closely associated with early&#xD;
      revascularization following optimal medical therapy (8). Therefore, clinical guidelines&#xD;
      regarding coronary revascularization have discriminated the proximal LAD disease from other&#xD;
      LAD diseases (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of coronary revascularization, the ostial LAD disease requires special attention in&#xD;
      the proximal LAD disease, because percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) can be more&#xD;
      complex in the ostial LAD disease than in the non-ostial proximal LAD disease (10) even in&#xD;
      the setting of AMI, left-main-trunk (LMT)-to-LAD crossover stenting was frequently required&#xD;
      in the ostial LAD disease (11).&#xD;
