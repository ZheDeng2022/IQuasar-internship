  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of treatment with nivolumab alone versus those of&#xD;
      nivolumab plus the experimental drug BMS-986205. Adding BMS-986208 to nivolumab could shrink&#xD;
      the cancer or prevent it from returning, but it could also cause side effects.&#xD;

             (version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each&#xD;
             lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical&#xD;
             exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short&#xD;
             axis when measured by CT or MRI.&#xD;

             protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1 (Section 12.0). Tumors within a previously&#xD;
             irradiated field will be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is&#xD;
