    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) QLQ-C 30 Version 3.0 is an integrated, modular approach for evaluating the quality of life of patients participating in international clinical trials. The questionnaire is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of 5 multi-item scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning) and 9 single items (pain, fatigue, financial impact, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbance and quality of life).&#xD;
It utilizes a four-point scales for the first 28 questions which are coded with response categories as &quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;A little&quot;, &quot;Quite a bit&quot; and &quot;Very much.&quot;. the final two question consist of an overall physical condition questions which have employed a 7-point response scale where the higher number indicates a better overall health.</description>
