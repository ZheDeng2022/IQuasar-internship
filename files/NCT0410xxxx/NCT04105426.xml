  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of antioxidant supplementation in&#xD;
      idiopathic tinnitus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this, a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was&#xD;
      conducted to assess the impact of a multivitamin-multimineral supplement with phytochemicals&#xD;
      combined with a-lipoic acid supplements on serum oxidative stress, serum antioxidant capacity&#xD;
      and tinnitus parameters in patients with idiopathic tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective, idiopathic, non-pulsatile tinnitus (&quot;tinnitus&quot;) is perception of sound without&#xD;
      the presence of an external acoustic stimulus. Causes of idiopathic tinnitus remain unknown&#xD;
      and the pathological mechanisms are not fully understood. Currently, effective therapies for&#xD;
      tinnitus remain limited. Previous research has demonstrated that oxidative stress is possibly&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic tinnitus and some studies have shown beneficial&#xD;
      effects of antioxidant therapy in tinnitus patients. Moreover, many studies have shown the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of antioxidant supplementation on the reduction of oxidative stress and the&#xD;
      increase of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy patients with idiopathic tinnitus were enrolled based on certain inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Subsequently, they were informed regarding the aims, methods, anticipated&#xD;
      benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and were provided with the information leaflet&#xD;
      of the study. Each patient who agreed to take part in the study, signed an informed consent&#xD;
      form, a copy of which was given to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were allocated to either antioxidant or placebo group. Randomisation was&#xD;
      conducted by someone who was not involved in the study and blinding was strictly maintained&#xD;
      to researchers and participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antioxidant group received one multivitamin and multimineral tablet with grape seed&#xD;
      extract once a day together with one tablet of alpha-lipoic acid twice a day, whereas the&#xD;
      placebo group received identical placebo tablets. Supplements were kindly donated by&#xD;
      Lamberts. The intervention lasted 3 months. Both groups kept their usual medical treatment&#xD;
      and their diet and exercise habits stable during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were assessed after randomisation according to the following tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Audiometric and Tinnitus assessment: Basic audiometric tests, pitch match, loudness&#xD;
           match, minimum masking level (MML)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tinnitus questionnaires: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Functional Index&#xD;
           (TFI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropometrics: body weight , height, Body Mass Index, waist and hip circumferences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition and physical activity evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MedDietScore)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical measurements: Complete blood count, lipid profile, glucose, electrolytes,&#xD;
           liver enzymes, thyroid hormones&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxidative stress assessment in serum samples: Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC),&#xD;
           Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity and Oxidized LDL are quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and any side effects were checked with a weekly telephone contact with the&#xD;
      patients. The consumption of tablets was checked with a diary completed by patients. At the&#xD;
      end of the intervention, all baseline parameters were assessed.&#xD;
