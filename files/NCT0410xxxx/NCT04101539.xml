  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation is an established cornerstone of therapy for patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF) who wish to avoid anti-arrhythmic drug therapy or for whom&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmics have proven ineffective. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), in which&#xD;
      circumferential ablation is performed around the ostia of the pulmonary vein - left atrial&#xD;
      junctions, is the standard ablation approach internationally. Single-procedure success rates&#xD;
      (1y, freedom from AF, off anti-arrhythmics) for patients with paroxysmal AF is roughly 70%,&#xD;
      and even worse (roughly 50%) for patients with persistent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of strategies have been developed to improve outcomes in patients undergoing AF&#xD;
      ablation, particularly in patients with persistent AF. Unfortunately, large prospective&#xD;
      randomized trials (including STAR-AF II, published in NEJM in 2015) have demonstrated a&#xD;
      failure of ancillary ablation techniques to improve AF ablation outcomes relative to PVI&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a collaborative effort between the Cardiology electrophysiology group and the Trayanova&#xD;
      laboratory (Biomechanical Engineering), investigators have developed a strategy of&#xD;
      patient-specific modeling to identify pro-arrhythmic sites in AF patients that may be&#xD;
      amenable to ablation. In this approach, patients undergo a pre-ablation cardiac MRI with late&#xD;
      gadolinium enhancement, to delineate regions of healthy atrial tissue and regions of scar&#xD;
      (this scan is clinically indicated, and performed currently in patients undergoing PVI for&#xD;
      AF). A novel in silico modeling to determine regions supporting electrical reentry in the&#xD;
      atrium, driving ongoing AF, has been developed by the Trayanova lab. In preliminary studies,&#xD;
      investigators have demonstrated the ability to identify and target these regions with&#xD;
      catheter ablation in patients undergoing PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators would like to conduct a prospective, randomized clinical trial in patients&#xD;
      undergoing ablation for symptomatic persistent AF. All patients enrolled would undergo&#xD;
      standard pre-procedure imaging (LGE-MRI) prior to the day of procedure. Investigators have&#xD;
      developed methodology termed OPTIMA (OPtimal Target Identification via Modeling of&#xD;
      Arrhythmogenesis) to determine, based on non-invasive patient-specific anatomic and tissue&#xD;
      data from late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI (LGE-CMR) and simulation of cardiac&#xD;
      electrical function, personalized ablation targets for persistent AF in patients with&#xD;
      fibrotic remodeling.. Patients would be randomized to receiving PVI only versus PVI + OPTIMA&#xD;
      ablation at the time of ablation. Patients would then be followed in standard clinical&#xD;
      fashion at 3m, 6m, and 12m to assess for ablation efficacy and for procedural complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators postulate a 20% improvement in freedom from AF with PVI + OPTIMA ablation form&#xD;
      50% to 70% (compared to PVI alone), investigators anticipate that in 1:1 randomization, a&#xD;
      sample size of 80 patients in each arm will yield a power calculation of 80% with an alpha of&#xD;
      0.05. Investigators anticipate that enrollment and 1y clinical follow-up for 160 patients&#xD;
      (total) undergoing AF ablation will require a 4y timeline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered clinical arrhythmia.&#xD;
      Symptoms arising from AF are common, and may include palpitations, fatigue, exertional&#xD;
      intolerance, and angina. Relief of symptoms is achieved by rhythm control strategies&#xD;
      including drug therapy and catheter ablation for AF. Catheter ablation is more effective than&#xD;
      drug therapy, is the preferred method of rhythm control for patients in whom drug therapy has&#xD;
      been ineffective or intolerable, and is increasingly used as first-line therapy. However,&#xD;
      success rates for AF control after catheter ablation are imperfect, with AF recurrence rates&#xD;
      between 30 - 50% at 1 year. Currently, catheter ablation focuses almost exclusively on&#xD;
      electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein (PV) ostia (PV isolation; PVI), to eliminate&#xD;
      triggering activity from ectopic foci in the PVs that, in the vast majority of patients,&#xD;
      initiate AF. A number of strategies have been developed to improve outcomes in patients&#xD;
      undergoing AF ablation, particularly in patients with persistent AF. Unfortunately, large&#xD;
      prospective randomized trials (including STAR-AF II, NEJM 2015) have demonstrated a failure&#xD;
      of ancillary ablation techniques to improve AF ablation outcomes relative to PVI alone. The&#xD;
      failure of PVI and ancillary ablation techniques to deliver reasonable outcomes is&#xD;
      exacerbated in patients with persistent AF (PsAF), who develop fibrosis in the atria. These&#xD;
      patients have AF ablation outcomes that are demonstrably worse than those seen in patients&#xD;
      with persistent AF. Investigators have recently developed methodology (termed OPTIMA, OPtimal&#xD;
      Target Identification via Modeling of Arrhythmogenesis) to determine, based on non-invasive&#xD;
      patient-specific anatomic and tissue data from late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI&#xD;
      (LGE-CMR) and simulation of cardiac electrical function, personalized ablation targets for&#xD;
      persistent AF in patients with fibrotic remodeling. These targets, which are determined off&#xD;
      line pre-procedure, are then used to steer patient treatment. This technology is intended to&#xD;
      make the procedure accurate and efficacious in persistent AF patients with fibrosis, and to&#xD;
      eliminate the need for repeat ablations, offering long-term freedom from AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In patients undergoing ablation for the treatment of persistent AF, using the&#xD;
      OPTIMA approach and performing PV isolation during ablation for AF will improve outcomes&#xD;
      compared to performing PV isolation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: In United States, Center for disease control estimates that 2.7-6.1 million&#xD;
      people suffer with AF and expects this number to increase with the aging population. Ablation&#xD;
      for AF is performed at increasing rates, and in certain population (eg patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF) is moderately effective. Even in optimal patients, however, the rate of AF&#xD;
      recurrence following apparently successful PV isolation is high (2017 Heart Rhythm Society&#xD;
      (HRS) Consensus statement on AF ablation). Strategies to improve AF ablation outcomes should&#xD;
      result in improved patient health (symptom elimination), lower patient risk (reduction of the&#xD;
      number of patients undergoing redo ablation procedures), and reduced economic burden from&#xD;
      healthcare costs (reducing post-ablation treatment for AF, including redo ablation&#xD;
      procedures). Furthermore, demonstration of the arrhythmogenic propensity of fibrotic&#xD;
      remodeling in patients with persistent AF will add to investigators' collective understanding&#xD;
      of the fundamental mechanisms underlying AF initiation and perpetuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of the OPTIMA approach for&#xD;
      determining the optimal ablation targets in patients with persistent AF and fibrosis, and to&#xD;
      demonstrate that elimination of AF-perpetuating sources in the fibrotic substrate, in&#xD;
      conjunction with PVI, during AF ablation improves rate of AF-free survival at 1 year compared&#xD;
      to patients undergoing standard PVI alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blind study of patients undergoing either&#xD;
      standard PV isolation or PVI+OPTIMA ablation for the treatment of symptomatic persistent AF.&#xD;
      Patients referred for ablation for symptomatic persistent AF will be considered for&#xD;
      enrollment. Patients will have cardiac function and anatomy assessed by echocardiography in&#xD;
      the six-month window prior to ablation (routine care). Patients will have a baseline rhythm&#xD;
      assessment with Ziopatch to quantify pre-ablation AF burden. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      pre-procedure LGE-CMR to delineate atrial anatomy (routine care). MRI scan will be obtained&#xD;
      in sinus rhythm; patients will be cardiovertered before MRI if the patients are in atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. All patients will be anticoagulated according to standard clinical guidelines.&#xD;
      Patients with a CHADS VASc score of 2 or greater will be systemically anticoagulated in the&#xD;
      pre-, peri-, and post-procedural periods. Patients not otherwise requiring long-term systemic&#xD;
      anticoagulation will be anticoagulated during the peri- and post-procedural intervals&#xD;
      (minimum of 2 months systemic anticoagulation following ablation). Finally, any patient&#xD;
      undergoing cardioversion to facilitate MRI acquisition will receive systemic anticoagulation&#xD;
      for a minimum of three weeks prior to cardioversion and/or have a Transesophageal&#xD;
      Echocardiography (TEE) performed prior to cardioversion. After CMR acquisition, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to PVI versus PVI+OPTIMA ablation. Pre-procedural TEE is not required for&#xD;
      patients presenting in Sinus rhythm and on uninterrupted anticoagulation for at least 3&#xD;
      weeks, regardless of CHADS VASC score. Patients presenting either in atrial fibrillation or&#xD;
      not on uninterrupted anticoagulation will undergo a pre-procedural TEE, again independent of&#xD;
      CHADS VASC score. All patients will undergo AF ablation with PVI (routine care). At the&#xD;
      outset of the procedure, electroanatomical mapping of the Left Atrium (LA) will be performed&#xD;
      to facilitate clinical ablation, with typically 1000 datapoints captured in the LA. PVI will&#xD;
      be performed in all patients. In the PVI+OPTIMA arm, sites identified as targets by&#xD;
      pre-procedure modeling will subsequently be targeted for ablation (research procedure, during&#xD;
      routine ablation procedure). Additional ablation of other atrial targets (lines, complex&#xD;
      fractionated electrograms) will be discouraged in both arms, but ultimately targeting such&#xD;
      areas will be left to the discretion of the operator. In both arms, PV isolation will be&#xD;
      assessed by entrance block. OPTIMA lesions will be assessed by both minimum of 50 percentage&#xD;
      reduction in all local Electrograms (EGM), as well as non-capture by high output pacing at&#xD;
      the site of target ablation. Operator will have the discretion not to ablate certain OPTIMA&#xD;
      targets for safety reasons including but not limited to avoid critical structures and patient&#xD;
      hemodynamic status. Operator will document the reason for not ablating all OPTIMA targets in&#xD;
      the case report forms. Patients will be maintained on anti-arrhythmic drugs during the&#xD;
      healing phase (3m) following ablation, with medication changes (cessation, up-titration, or&#xD;
      drug changes) made at the discretion of the treating physician. All patients will be followed&#xD;
      clinically after ablation in the standard fashion (routine care), including visits at 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months, with AF burden assessment with Zio patch at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate that this study will take 3 years for enrollment and 1 year clinical&#xD;
      follow-up. Patient encounters include a pre-procedure clinical assessment and rhythm&#xD;
      assessment(zio patch) in outpatient Electrophysiology (EP) Clinic; cardiac MRI in the week&#xD;
      prior to ablation; the ablation procedure itself; overnight monitoring in the hospital&#xD;
      following ablation; clinical assessment at 3, 6 and 12 months after ablation, including&#xD;
      rhythm assessment with Ziopatch at each visit. Additional rhythm assessment with Ziopatch&#xD;
      will be performed for patients with clinical symptoms of atrial fibrillation. Of note, these&#xD;
      encounters are all part of current clinical practice in patients undergoing AF ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be blinded to the ablation strategy (PVI only versus PVI+OPTIMA ablation).&#xD;
      Operators by necessity cannot be blinded to the ablation strategy, as patients are performing&#xD;
      the ablations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the study will undergo standard PVI, with its attendant risks. These risks&#xD;
      include those related to general anesthesia, risk of stroke, risk of cardiac puncture, risk&#xD;
      of esophageal injury, risk of other cardiac damage, and risk related to vascular access.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Re-entrant Driver (RD) ablation will undergo standard PVI (with risks&#xD;
      listed above). During ablation, operators will target additional sites for lesion delivery.&#xD;
      This is anticipated to lead to increases in procedure time, left atrial dwell time, number of&#xD;
      lesions delivered, and increased radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate that the additional risk to patients undergoing OPTIMA ablation (in&#xD;
      addition to PVI) will be minimal. Typical PVI involves lesion delivery at 50-60 sites. In&#xD;
      investigators early experience, patients have between 2-5 AF sources in the fibrotic&#xD;
      substrate that OPTIMA targets. Thus, the additional ablation in each patient is likely to be&#xD;
      a small component of the total ablation lesion set; additional risks are a function largely&#xD;
      of time manipulating catheters and ablating in the left atrium. This added time will be&#xD;
      minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation exposure Patients undergoing standard ablation procedure is estimated to be&#xD;
      estimated to have 0.700 rems of radiation exposure due to fluoroscopy. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      optima ablation are estimated to be exposed to additional 0.14 rems of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of ECG patch monitor Clinical trials have so far shown the Zio XT is well-tolerated in&#xD;
      the overall population. The risks associated with Zio patch include mild discomfort and/or&#xD;
      allergic reaction to sticky pads used to attach the Zio patch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a possibility that while reviewing one's patch monitor results investigators may&#xD;
      detect a heart rhythm abnormality that investigators did not expect to find. Investigators&#xD;
      will contact the patient and inform the patient and his/her clinical cardiac&#xD;
      electrophysiologist regarding the result. The costs for any care that may arise in reaction&#xD;
      to this incidental finding will not be covered by this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps taken to minimize the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently investigators employ a number of risk mitigation strategies, including the use of&#xD;
      electroanatomical mapping systems to minimize radiation exposure, the use of systemic&#xD;
      anticoagulation to minimize Cardiovascular Accident (CVA) risk, the use of ultrasound guided&#xD;
      vascular access to minimize vascular complication rates. All of these strategies will be&#xD;
      employed for all study participants. In addition following monitoring procedures will be&#xD;
      followed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data quality will be monitored routinely and reviewed monthly for missing data,&#xD;
           inconsistent data, data outliers, and potential protocol deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All adverse events and protocol deviations will be notified to PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to minimize risks to patients enrolled in the study all adverse events will be&#xD;
           discussed in the monthly cardiac electrophysiology complications conference. This&#xD;
           conference will serve as the Global safety monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All Attending physicians participating in this study including David Spragg MD, Ronal&#xD;
           Berger MD, Hugh Calkins, MD, Joseph Marine, MD and Hiroshi Ashikaga MD, PhD attend this&#xD;
           conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All adverse events will be assessed in terms of relationship to device, relationship to&#xD;
           procedure, severity, subsequent intervention required, and resolution status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to improve AF ablation outcomes should result in improved patient health (symptom&#xD;
      elimination), lower patient risk (reduction of the number of patients undergoing redo&#xD;
      ablation procedures), and reduced economic burden from healthcare costs (reducing&#xD;
      post-ablation treatment for AF, including redo ablation procedures). Furthermore,&#xD;
      demonstration of the importance of elimination of the arrhythmogenic propensity of the&#xD;
      fibrotic substrate in patients with PsAF will add to investigators collective understanding&#xD;
      of the fundamental mechanisms underlying AF initiation and perpetuation.&#xD;
