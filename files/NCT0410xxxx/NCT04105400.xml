    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the systemic response to infection by microbial organisms and is considered the&#xD;
      leading cause of mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Audits of ICU&#xD;
      worldwide showed that 29.5% patients had sepsis on admission or during the ICU stay The signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of sepsis are highly variable and are influenced by many factors, including the&#xD;
      virulence and bioburden of the pathogen, the portal of entry, and the host susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis of sepsis is often difficult in clinical practice, whilst it can be vital for&#xD;
      positive patient outcomes in sepsis management. Any delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead&#xD;
      to significant organ failure and can be associated with elevated mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid effective management of sepsis not only allows for prompt antibiotic therapy and a&#xD;
      potential reduction in mortality, it can also minimize the unnecessary use of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, blood cultures have been the gold standard for diagnosing sepsis, however the&#xD;
      lenthy time to generate results is a limitation. Additionally, many patients may have already&#xD;
      been prescribed antibiotics prior to arrival to the hospital, which may mask the presentation&#xD;
      of sepsis in the blood culture. Despite an emphasis on isolating a specific micro organism,&#xD;
      on average, only 34% of blood cultures are found to be positive in septic patients Therefore,&#xD;
      while it can be useful, relying on the bacteriological diagnosis can be misleading or too&#xD;
      late. A number of the inflammatory markers, such as leukocyte cell count, C reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, or IL-6), have been applied in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      inflammation and infection, but their lack of specificity has generated a continued interest&#xD;
      to develop more specific clinical laboratory tests One promising marker has been&#xD;
      procalcitonin (PCT), whose concentration has been found to be elevated in sepsis. Owing its&#xD;
      specificity to bacterial infections, PCT has been proposed as a pertinent marker in the rapid&#xD;
      diagnosis of bacterial infection, especially for use in hospital emergency departments and&#xD;
      intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCT has been used as marker of sepsis with sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 62%&#xD;
      respectively with significantly high levels in the patients having sepsis and positive blood&#xD;
      culture results than with culture negative results PCT is a glycoprotein present in C cells&#xD;
      of thyroid gland. It belongs to the group of related peptide (C-GRP) encoded by the CALC-1&#xD;
      gene and is formed from the common precursor pre-calcitonin. In healthy subjects, CALC-1&#xD;
      genes synthesize calcitonin, but presence of microbial infection through endotoxin or&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines increases calcitonin gene expression and PCT mRNA is mostly&#xD;
      synthesized. This lead to release of PCT from all parenchymal tissue, exclusively in response&#xD;
      to bacterial infection only and not viral or inflammatory disease Previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that procalcitonin levels are correlated with the severity of sepsis and could&#xD;
      potentially be used as a prognostic marker in patients with sepsis and severe sepsis In this&#xD;
      study we evaluated the usefulness of procalcitonin as a diagnostic predictive marker of&#xD;
      bacteremia and sepsis in critically ill patients. Serum PCT levels area useful diagnostic&#xD;
      tool available to physicians that can help as a marker of sepsis, as well as other bacterial&#xD;
      infections. Combination of emerging new biomarkers with PCT could be used in terms of good&#xD;
      clinical judgement based on which antimicrobial therapy may suggested, thus reducing the&#xD;
      prescription and duration of antibiotic treatment .&#xD;
