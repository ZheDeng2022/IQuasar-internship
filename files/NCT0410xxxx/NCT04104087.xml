  <brief_summary>

      Complete coverage of the recession complemented with pleasing esthetics and minimal probing&#xD;
      measures are the main goals of root coverage procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a consensus report from the AAP regeneration workshop on the periodontal soft&#xD;
      tissue root coverage procedures; most studies have been directed on RT-1 (Miller Class I and&#xD;
      II) defects and that further research on results in RT-2, RT-3 ( Miller Class III and IV)&#xD;
      defects is needed. Consequently, it was planned to conduct this research on RT-2 (Miller&#xD;
      Class III) recessions to overcome this gap of knowledge, de-epithelialized free gingival&#xD;
      graft is proposed aiming to enhance the papillary height, esthetic, with less pain and&#xD;
      postoperative trauma. Equally, it is considered a more conservative approach with fewer&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession has high prevalence among both individuals with periodontal disease and&#xD;
      those with high standers of oral hygiene. The management of RT-2 ( Miller Class III) gingival&#xD;
      recessions is very challenging and there is controversy in the literature concerning the most&#xD;
      predictable approach to treat these defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of gingival recession is performed to enhance esthetics, reduce dentinal&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, eliminate caries risk, stop the progression of gingival recession and&#xD;
      periodontal attachment loss and keratinized tissue augmentation to enable the patient to&#xD;
      maintain adequate plaque control.Gingival recession or &quot;Marginal tissue recession&quot; is&#xD;
      recognized as the apical migration of the marginal gingiva to its normal position on the root&#xD;
      surface. Connective tissue graft (CTG) is considered to be the best root coverage techniques&#xD;
      for the treatment of gingival recession defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is challenging sometimes to harvest the largest volume of tissue especially in&#xD;
      thin palatal tissue as recently it was recommended to keep 2mm of soft tissue thickness&#xD;
      covering the palate to minimize the postoperative pain. Otherwise, necrosis/dehiscence of the&#xD;
      flap may happen which was reported to occur frequently for the trap-door approach. Moreover,&#xD;
      it is necessary to extend the dissection deeper into the palatal tissues to leave adequate&#xD;
      thickness of connective tissue to maintain the vitality of the primary flap which may cause&#xD;
      more painful post-operative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations, CTG harvesting with de-epithelialized gingival grafts (DGG)&#xD;
      can be executed even in the presence of thin palatal tissues. CTG preparation can be&#xD;
      performed more superficially by this approach to obtain collagen-rich connective tissue from&#xD;
      Lamina pro- pria of the palatal mucosa. The findings of Zucchelli et al. study support the&#xD;
      observation that CTGs which are presumed to have denser connective tissue are comparatively&#xD;
      less prone to post-operative shrinkage . According to this assumption, DGG technique may&#xD;
      enable to harvest an adequate amount of dense and stable tissue&#xD;
