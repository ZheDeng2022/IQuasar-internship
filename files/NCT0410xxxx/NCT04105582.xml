    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators propose the first clinical study in Colombia of&#xD;
      vaccination of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using synthetic peptides&#xD;
      that contain mutations of the tumor itself that will be presented to the immune system by&#xD;
      autologous dendritic cells to assess immunogenicity and safety of this type of personalized&#xD;
      vaccine. Achieving the specific objectives set out in this project will mean that the&#xD;
      investigators can validate in Colombia the experimental design necessary to identify&#xD;
      exclusive epitopes in the tumors of the participants in this study, and also that have been&#xD;
      able to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines.&#xD;

      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The achievements of personalized medicine in cancer research in developed countries make&#xD;
      envision that various types of cancer in an advanced stage, will be in the medium term&#xD;
      treatable diseases. The discovery of new therapies is the product of the achieved development&#xD;
      of Translational Medicine (the laboratory findings translated in short term to the patient&#xD;
      benefits), a new approach to applied medicine led by researchers in the universities in&#xD;
      alliance with the private sector who carry out clinical studies. Despite the advances of&#xD;
      Personalized and Translational Medicine in the developed world in Colombia, this discipline&#xD;
      has an incipient development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its genetic instability, triple-negative breast cancer - (CMTN) (ER-, PR-, Her2 /&#xD;
      neu-) among other tumors with a high number of mutations makes it resistant to&#xD;
      chemotherapy/radiotherapy regimens generating high morbidity and mortality. Furthermore,&#xD;
      genetic instability contributes not only to the immuno-editing of these tumors [5] but to the&#xD;
      generation of a suppressive tumor microenvironment [6], which are factors that contribute to&#xD;
      the escape of these tumors to their immunosurveillance [7, 8]. However, recent achievements&#xD;
      suggest that these factors are controllable using personalized medicine. While&#xD;
      immunosuppression is modulated with the use of anti-checkpoint antibodies (&quot;anti-check&#xD;
      points&quot; such as anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1, and anti-PDL-1) [9], genetic instability that generates&#xD;
      tumor neoantigens, may become the Achilles' heel of these tumors. Phase I clinical studies of&#xD;
      patients with melanoma and lung cancer metastatic treated with Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4 of&#xD;
      anti-PD1) - to decrease immunosuppression - using together with vaccines peptides&#xD;
      corresponding to tumor mutations that are presented in MHCI and MHCII molecules and are&#xD;
      recognized by LT-CD8 as foreign antigens, led these cells to destroy the tumor efficiently&#xD;
      when used as a vaccine [10-13]. For this reason, the identification of non-synonymous&#xD;
      mutations of single amino acid and vaccination with 25 amino acid peptides incorporating&#xD;
      these mutations (synthetic vaccines), is emerging as an alternative for cancer immunotherapy&#xD;
      [10-13] in what is called neoantigen based synthetic cancer vaccines. In an approach that&#xD;
      takes 16 weeks, today it is possible to go from the analysis of the tumor transcriptome to&#xD;
      identify the universe of tumor mutations up to the vaccination of the patient with peptides&#xD;
      containing tumor mutations, with the important clinical response to the tumor not achieved so&#xD;
      far in patients with melanoma and non-small cell carcinoma of the metastatic lung [10-13].&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to carry out the first clinical study in Colombia of vaccination of&#xD;
      patients with CMTN using synthetic peptides that contain mutations of the tumor itself that&#xD;
      will be presented by autologous dendritic cells in order to evaluate the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of this type of personalized vaccine. Achieving the specific objectives set out in&#xD;
      this project will mean that we have validated in Colombia the experimental design necessary&#xD;
      to identify unique epitopes in each tumor of the participants in the study in addition to&#xD;
      demonstrating the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines. Once this has been achieved,&#xD;
      we consider having taken an important step towards implementation in our country of the use&#xD;
      of this type of vaccine for immunotherapy not only of CMTN but of other highly fatal tumors&#xD;
      such as glioblastoma, gastric, esophagus, and pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is carried out by the National University, the Hospital El Tunal de Bogotá, and&#xD;
      the Fundación Salud de los Andes, has the collaboration of Professor Luis Fernando Niño and&#xD;
      Andrés Pinzón, experts in bioinformatics in the Universidad Nacional; Dr. Chris Miller at&#xD;
      Washington University at the McDonnell Genomic Institute at Washington University, School of&#xD;
      Medicine in Saint Louis; has the advice of Dr. Pedro Romero from the University of Lausanne&#xD;
      (Switzerland) who has extensive experience in immunotherapy clinical trials of melanoma&#xD;
      patients with synthetic peptides as a vaccine and with researchers from the Research Group in&#xD;
      Immunology and Clinical Oncology (GIIOC) of the Fundación Salud de los Andes.&#xD;
