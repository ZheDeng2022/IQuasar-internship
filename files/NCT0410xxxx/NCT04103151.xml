    <textblock>
      Febrile infants younger than 3 months old present a diagnostic dilemma to the emergency&#xD;
      physician. Tension remains between the need for early aggressive intervention among patients&#xD;
      with suspected sepsis and the global phenomena of increasing antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to: (1) To study the association between heart rate variability (HRV)&#xD;
      and the presence of a serious infection (SI) among infants younger than 3 months old. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a reduced HRV is associated with the presence of SI. (2) To&#xD;
      compare HRV between febrile infants &lt; 3 months with non-febrile infants. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the variability will be reduced in febrile infants with SIs when compared to&#xD;
      non-febrile well infants, but not among febrile infants without SIs when compared to&#xD;
      non-febrile well infants. (3) To study if HRV will provide incremental diagnostic information&#xD;
      over current triage tools.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Febrile young infants younger than 3 months old present a diagnostic dilemma to the pediatric&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) physician. The potential for a missed serious infection (SI) poses&#xD;
      the threat of premature death and long-term disability among these infants. Despite&#xD;
      decreasing early-onset neonatal sepsis rates due to obstetric prevention strategies, high&#xD;
      rates of hospitalization and administration of parenteral antibiotics occur in this age&#xD;
      group. Continual tension remains between the need for early and aggressive intervention among&#xD;
      patients suspected with sepsis and the global phenomena of increasing antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
      Research networks have attempted to build diagnostic algorithms to guide the identification&#xD;
      of these ill infants. These are often useful as adjuncts to the clinician's gestalt, but&#xD;
      generalizability remains questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs are of paramount importance in recognizing ill children and have been used in&#xD;
      pediatric early warning system scores (PEWS) and various triage systems. Vital signs have&#xD;
      resurfaced as the focus of research in recent years, with various groups purposing to update&#xD;
      evidence-based normal heart rate ranges among children. Normative heart rate ranges are&#xD;
      infamously difficult to define due to the hemodynamic lability in these young infants,&#xD;
      multiple confounders for abnormal heart rate, and the variable physiological response during&#xD;
      acute stress states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous pilot data showed that the Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS) and Fleming&#xD;
      (&lt;10th or &gt;90th centile) guidelines performed with the highest sensitivity (66.0% and 62.6%,&#xD;
      respectively) and the highest Negative Predictive Value (NPV) (73.3% and 71.4%,&#xD;
      respectively). No single guideline reached a sensitivity of greater than 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the association between heart rate variability (HRV) and the presence of a&#xD;
           serious infection (SI) among infants younger than 3 months old. The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that a reduced HRV is associated with the presence of SI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare HRV between febrile infants &lt; 3 months with non-febrile infants. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that the variability will be reduced in febrile infants with&#xD;
           SIs when compared to non-febrile well infants, but not among febrile infants without SIs&#xD;
           when compared to non-febrile well infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study if HRV will provide incremental diagnostic information over current triage&#xD;
           tools.&#xD;
