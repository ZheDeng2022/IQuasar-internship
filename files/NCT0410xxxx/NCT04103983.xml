  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      86-87% of people who have had an amputation still feel pain in the limb that has been&#xD;
      amputated - Phantom limb pain (PLP). Sensory retraining is a form of treatment for PLP where&#xD;
      a special form of electrical stimulation is delivered to the residual limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theory is that this stimulation changes activity in the brain that helps to reduce the&#xD;
      person's pain. Two new types of sensory retraining device for the treatment of phantom limb&#xD;
      pain have been developed. One type requires the user to interact with the device while the&#xD;
      other is a non-interactive device. Both devices are new so it is unknown as to how well they&#xD;
      may work, or which is best, therefore both will be tested in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be undertaken remotely, using video call, telephone and email for&#xD;
      communication. The study will compare the effect of both devices for efficacy. Ninety-four&#xD;
      people with PLP will be recruited from the NHS and the general public and randomised to&#xD;
      receive either the interactive or non-interactive device or their placebo equivalents. A&#xD;
      physiotherapist will train the research participants how to use their device. Participants&#xD;
      will then use their device at home for 3 weeks. To ensure that they are using their devices&#xD;
      as required, the researcher will keep in contact throughout the three week treatment period,&#xD;
      using a schedule of video calls, weekly phone calls and daily texts. Pain and function will&#xD;
      be measured before treatment, after treatment and at a 3 month follow-up. Twelve participants&#xD;
      will also be invited to a one-to-one interview to give their experience of the acceptability&#xD;
      and usability of their device.&#xD;

    <measure>The short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) (Dworkin et al, 2009):&#xD;
The short from McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) is a commonly used questionnaire to assess pain levels in a range of pain conditions. Twenty words which describe pain across the sensory, affective, evaluative and miscellaneous domains are presented to the participant who is asked to choose which word best describes their pain in the last week and to rate how intense that descriptor of pain was on a 0-10 scale.</description>

    <measure>Overall Pain: Visual Analogue Scale (100mm):</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their phantom limb pain over the last week using a pain visual analogue scale consisting of a 100mm line with anchor statements of 0 representing no pain and 100 the worst pain imaginable. The participant will be asked to place a mark through the line to represent their pain. Participants will be asked to record the number of phantom limb pain episodes they have experienced over the past week.</description>

    <measure>Trinity Amputation and prosthetic evaluation scale (modified) (TAPES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>TAPES (modified): Participants will be asked to complete a modified version of the Trinity Amputation and prosthetics evaluation scale (TAPES scale).&#xD;
This questionnaire records information about the participant's amputation history, their levels of pain and their level of functioning. The TAPES has been modified in that it only asks about issues specific to phantom limb pain, residual limb (or stump) pain, and phantom sensations. Additional questions will be asked upon completion of the TAPES questionnaire. These yes/no questions will identify if the patient experiences telescoping, which is a phenomenon where the phantom limb is perceived as shrunken so that the foot/hand feels like it is attached directly to the end of the residual limb, and further questions to exclude PLP caused by Neuroma (Ortiz-Catalan, 2018) and establish if the participant feels that they have active control of the phantom limb or if it is frozen. There are 26 questions in total.</description>

    <measure>Study Diary (medication use/device use/pain levels)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report on their daily medication usage over the duration of the trial in a study diary. The participant will be sent a daily notification by the SMART-TRIAL platform to remind them to complete the study diary for the three week treatment period. The diary will ask for the frequency, dosage and class of medication taken each day. In addition, patients will be asked to rate their phantom limb pain on a scale from 0-10 each day, the frequency of those pain episodes, and to record how many minutes they used the device each day.</description>

    <measure>Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After treatment, to investigate usability, all participants will be asked to rate how easy do you think the SensTrain was to use on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (100mm) with 0 representing not at all easy to use and 100 representing extremely easy to use.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the appropriateness of the participant blinding procedures the participants will be asked to make a judgement, after completing the second set of outcome measures and before the blinding is broken. Participants will be asked Which of the following four devices do you think you received? 1. A real interactive device, 2. A sham/placebo interactive device, 3. A real non-interactive device or 4. A sham/placebo non-interactive device? And then How confident are you that your device was (form inserts answer 1,2,3 or 4) on a 0-100 scale with 0 being not at all confident and 100 being completely confident?</description>

    <description>The interactive device is a sensory retraining device. A pad consisting of twelve equally spaced electrodes is placed over the residual limb. This pad is connected to a handheld device which delivers an electrical current to the electrodes. The type of electrical current is similar to a TENS device. The device stimulates the skin via one of the electrodes, with either a single, or a rapid burst of pulse(s). The device touch screen then presents the questions, Which electrode (location) was stimulated? Was a single continuous or a rapid burst of pulses given (stimulation type)? The user responds via the screen and is told if they are correct. If correct, a new stimulus is delivered (different location and type) and the process repeated. If incorrect, the user is informed of the correct response, the same stimulation (location and type) is repeated once before moving onto to a new stimulus.</description>
