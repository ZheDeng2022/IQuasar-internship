  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many techniques have been proposed to prevent or rather minimize the labial bone resorption&#xD;
      following extraction including guided bone regeneration techniques that has been attempted&#xD;
      for many years now to preserve the alveolar ridge dimensions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate implant placement, flapless implant placement, palataly positioned implants and&#xD;
      even platform switching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However none of these methods were able to completely preserve the coronal part of the facial&#xD;
      bone wall, and since the main reason of bone loss following extraction is the loss of the&#xD;
      periodontal ligament, it seemed logical that root retention may affect the resorption&#xD;
      process,The reason the root retention technique works in its different applications is due to&#xD;
      the maintenance of the periodontal attachment including cementum, periodontal ligaments and&#xD;
      bundle bone, this principle was used by Hurzeler in 2010 in a technique called socket shied&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

      -  The selected patients will be informed of the nature of the research work and informed&#xD;
           consent will be obtained then randomized in equal proportions between control group&#xD;
           conventional immediate implant placement with immediate temporization and study group&#xD;
           socket shield technique with immediate temporization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients of both groups will be subjected to CBCT (diagnostic for upper arch).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra operative procedures (for both groups) followed by CBCT will be taken for every&#xD;
           patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infiltration local anesthesia will be given to the patient (Articaine 4% 1:100 000&#xD;
           epinephrine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scrubbing and draping of the patient will be carried out in a standard fashion for intra&#xD;
           oral procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the study group: along surgical fissure bur will be used for hemisectioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The palatal portion will be carefully separated and extracted by a periotome and&#xD;
           forceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The osteomy site will be inspected and cleaned from any granulation tissue and the&#xD;
           implant will be placed palatal to the tooth fragment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The jump gap was grafted with a xenogeneic bone particulate (De-proteinized bovine bone&#xD;
           mineral Small granules (0.25-1 mm), the implant gained primary stability from bone&#xD;
           apical and palatal sufficient to immediately restore with provisional restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the control group: the root was hemisected using a fissure bur in a mesio-distal&#xD;
           direction, and a traumatic removal of the palatal fragment of the root was achieved (no&#xD;
           pressure was applied on it), then the buccal fragment was reduced using surgical bur&#xD;
           leaving a thin layer of the root aspect intact to the buccal plate of the bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The implant is placed in the socket in a way leaving space away from the remaining&#xD;
           buccal plate without grafting this jumping gap&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The provisional restorations were relieved of occlusal contacts in centric occlusion and&#xD;
           excursive movements. These restorations remained in situ for at least 6 to 12 weeks&#xD;
           prior to any modifications or commencement of definitive restorative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A soft diet was recommended for the duration of the implant-healing phase. The patient&#xD;
           was advised against functioning or activities to the implant site.&#xD;
