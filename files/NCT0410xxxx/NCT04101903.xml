  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common inborn diseases. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis of this condition is very important and it can be harmful both to miss DDH and&#xD;
      label normal infants as having DDH. Why DDH can be missed or labelled to normal children is&#xD;
      not well understood but can be related to the doctor's knowledge, skill and the way the hip&#xD;
      consultation is conducted. This research aims to help overcome these issues and proposes the&#xD;
      use of a diagnostic aid (checklist) for DDH in general (GP) practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will divide general practices (GP) in England into two groups. One group&#xD;
      will use our checklist for all hip checks they carry out. The other group will work as they&#xD;
      usually do, without the aid. The study wishes to compare if GPs who use the checklist will do&#xD;
      better in identifying babies with DDH than those who do not use our checklist. The&#xD;
      Investigator will also evaluate whether using the checklist reduces costs for families around&#xD;
      trips to doctors or hospitals, and costs to the NHS. In addition The Investigators will&#xD;
      interview general practitioners, health visitors and carers of infants to elicit their&#xD;
      perceptions about the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include GPs registered in England who carry out the 6-week hip check and agree&#xD;
      to being randomised and to hospitals releasing data on infants they had examined during the&#xD;
      study period. Practices planning to close within 12 months of the start of the study are not&#xD;
      eligible. Eligible infants will be identified by general practice patient registers and&#xD;
      infants will be invited to attend a 6-week check at their local practices, the research&#xD;
      sites. The study plans to include a total of 152 practices in this study and will collaborate&#xD;
      with 15 NIHR CRNs to recruit GP practices with efficient and existing infrastructure.&#xD;

      1. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine whether the use of a check list for the 6-week hip check can (i)&#xD;
                reduce the number of clinically insignificant referrals from primary to secondary&#xD;
                care, and (ii) reduce the number of Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)&#xD;
                diagnosed beyond the age of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the cost-effectiveness of this intervention considering a life time&#xD;
                horizon.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To conduct an integrated qualitative and quantitative process evaluation in order&#xD;
                to: understand the participants' experience with the intervention; identify how the&#xD;
                intervention affects general practitioners' capability, opportunity and motivation&#xD;
                in relation to the 6-week check; study how the intervention is implemented; and&#xD;
                investigate how contextual factors affect uptake of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type of trial: Phase III, cluster randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial design and methods: This trial incorporates (i) 4-months internal pilot in order&#xD;
           to confirm realistic recruitment targets; (ii) process evaluation encompassing&#xD;
           qualitative research on changing physician referral behaviour and on normalising the&#xD;
           intervention in practice; and (iii) health economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Trial duration per participant: 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Planned trial sites: 152 GP practices in England. Half will be randomised to the&#xD;
           experimental arm (using the diagnostic aid) and half to the control arm (standard of&#xD;
           care 6 week hip check)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Total number of participants planned: 152 GP practices will be randomised (in which 110&#xD;
           infants each year are anticipated to be assessed within the 6-week hip check across the&#xD;
           practices).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Main inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion: GP practices registered in England and who carry out the 6-week hip&#xD;
                check as part of their routine work - these practices must be using either EMIS,&#xD;
                VISION or System One clinical computer systems&#xD;
