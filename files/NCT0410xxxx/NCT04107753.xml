  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoke is still a significant Public Health problem. The Emergency Departments (EDs) could be&#xD;
      the ideal setting to set up smoke cessation interventions (high prevalence of smoking patient&#xD;
      compared to the general population). The structured brief counseling 5As based (ask, advice,&#xD;
      asses, assist, arrange) is an effective Public Health intervention when performed by the&#xD;
      General Practitioners. Still not clear is its feasibility and effectiveness in the ED&#xD;
      setting. Aim of the study. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the 5As based&#xD;
      counselling in the University ED of Novara compared to the &quot;usual care&quot;.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Randomized Controlled Trial performed in Novara (Piedmont, Italy) in the ED of&#xD;
      the &quot;Maggiore della Carità&quot; University Hospital and involving the Treatment Center for&#xD;
      Tobacco use (CTT) of the Addiction Department of the Local Health Unit of Novara (ASL NO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT has two parallel groups (allocation 1:1): the intervention group and the controll&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult smokers attending ED of the &quot;Maggiore della Carità&quot; University Hospital of the city of&#xD;
      Novara are invited to participate to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists in the &quot;5As&quot; smoke cessation brief structured counselling performed&#xD;
      by the ED nurses. The 5As counselling is composed by 5 main steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ask: every patient is asked whether he/she is or is not a smoker in order to identify&#xD;
           those who could benefit from the counseling;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Advice: the patient is advised to quit in a strong, clear and personalized way;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess: the patient is asked if he/she would like to quit and it is assessed the&#xD;
           strength of his/her dependence in order to tailor the following step on the patient's&#xD;
           situation and readiness to quit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assist: all the patients receive the counseling by the nurse and those interested in&#xD;
           quitting are assisted in their attempts. Furthermore patients are asked whether they&#xD;
           want to be contacted by the CTT in order to start an intensive treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Arrange: for the patients willing to make a quit attempt, it is aimed to arrange for&#xD;
           follow up contact by the CTT and to start a treatment in the CTT. It is expected also to&#xD;
           prevent or treat eventual relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The controll group received no intervention (&quot;usual care&quot; that could range between not&#xD;
      mentioning the subject at all, to a general advice to quit without bringing any structured&#xD;
      counselling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the nurses involved in the project as &quot;intervention providers&quot; will receive a proper&#xD;
      training carried out by the CTT staff. The training will be focused on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the description and application of the 5As intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the importance of the relationship with patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the acquisition of specific skills through role playing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size needed is 1200 patients (600 for each arm of the study). This sample size has&#xD;
      been calculated assuming that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in Italy the annual cessation rate in the general population is 8.4% (Istituto Superiore&#xD;
           di Sanità, 2015);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that the relative risk of 12-month point-estimated tobacco abstinence in the&#xD;
           intervention group compared to the general population is 1.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation was based on desired significance level of 5% (two-tailed) and power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the feasibility and sustainability of the intervention is descriptive and&#xD;
      the investigators did not include it in the power calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Data about patients are collected as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  through the ED software; the ED software records all the clinically relevant information&#xD;
           (triage, visit, observation and monitoring, if needed, or discharge);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from the baseline questionnaire. Patients from both groups will be given a questionnaire&#xD;
           about their smoking habits in order to collect data about their health status,&#xD;
           socio-demographic characteristics, their degree of addiction by using the Fagerström&#xD;
           test and their orientation with respect to the possibility of quitting. The&#xD;
           questionnaire is the adaptation of the already validated questionnaire of the FRITT&#xD;
           project, implemented in Sweden from the Karolinska Institutet, with the addition of the&#xD;
           Fageström test for nicotine dependence. It also takes inspiration from the questionnaire&#xD;
           SPRINT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from the nurse checklist. The check list is filled by the nurses involved in the study&#xD;
           at the moment of the contact with the patients of the intervention group. The check list&#xD;
           is aimed to investigate if the intervention has been carried out and in detail which&#xD;
           steps have been performed. In the event that the intervention had not been carried out,&#xD;
           the reason for this is collected in the check list;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from the follow up- questionnaire. The follow-up questionnaire is administered by&#xD;
           telephone at 6 and 12 month in order to collect the informations about the outcomes.&#xD;
           Participants in the follow-up phase will be contacted by telephone at least 3 times at&#xD;
           different hours of the day, in order to maximize the possibilities to get an answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from the CTT software for those who decided to proceed with the intensive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data collected are recorded in the Research Electronic Data Capture (RedCap). RedCap&#xD;
      is a secure web application that ensures the confidentiality of the data and high privacy&#xD;
      levels, according to the Italian law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be analyzed with &quot;intention-to treat&quot; principle: each patient will be considered&#xD;
      under original randomization no matter what counseling he/she actually received. In secondary&#xD;
      analyzes, the investigators will perform both &quot;per protocol&quot; and &quot;as treated&quot; analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring. Due to the short duration of the trial and to the lack of recognized&#xD;
      collateral effects, there is no need of a data monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project does not implicate any physical intrusion or risk for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent or assent is obtained first orally by the triage nurse than written by a designated&#xD;
      person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to data. The only actors who will have access to the final trial dataset are the&#xD;
      researchers of Eastern Piedmont University involved in the study and the CTT physicians who&#xD;
      collaborated at the study.&#xD;
