    <textblock>
      This phase 1b trial studies the side effects and best dose of TAS-102 when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy in treating patients with stage II-III rectal cancer that has not been&#xD;
      treated and can be removed by surgery (resectable). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      TAS-102, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This study is being done to&#xD;
      find out the safest dose of TAS-102 that can be used with radiation treatment for rectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride&#xD;
      (TAS-102) per the proportion of grade 3 or higher adverse events during chemo-radiation&#xD;
      therapy (CRT) with concurrent TAS-102 at the maximum tolerated dose by allowing no more than&#xD;
      30% grade 3 or higher adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate safety of participants treated with TAS-102 during radiation therapy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) attributable to TAS-102 with RT during&#xD;
      fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminary assess the rates of complete clinical response (cCR) by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and by endoscopy after TAS-102 with concurrent CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To preliminary assess the rates of cCR by MRI and by endoscopy after treatment with&#xD;
      FOLFOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To preliminary assess the rates of pCR after standard total mesorectal excision (TME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of TAS-102.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive TAS-102 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) Monday-Friday on weeks 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 3-dimensional conformal&#xD;
      radiotherapy (3D-CRT) 5 days per week on weeks 1-5. Treatment continues in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care FOLFOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to a total of 16 weeks (3&#xD;
      months) from end of FOLFOX treatment until rectal cancer surgery or death, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;

             participation, provided they are on stable doses of anticoagulant therapy. Similarly,&#xD;
