  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large volume paracentesis (LVP) with albumin administration is the standard of care for&#xD;
      patients with refractory ascites complicating end-stage liver disease. However, the use of&#xD;
      albumin is frequently limited due to expense and occasional short supply. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if the administration of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) during large volume&#xD;
      paracentesis is effective in lowering plasma renin activity by 25% compared to baseline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There will be three periods of this study, one for each of three consecutive routine large&#xD;
      volume paracenteses. The length of the study will be 6 days post paracentesis for each&#xD;
      period, for a total of 3 periods. The interval between successive LVP's will be determined by&#xD;
      patients' need. In order to ensure follow up on Day 6, Day 1 will be restricted to a Tuesday,&#xD;
      Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be monitored for 3 consecutive routine large volume paracenteses. The 3&#xD;
      periods (LVP's) of this study will differ in administration of volume replacement solution.&#xD;
      First LVP will be with intravenous albumin (12.5gm 25% Human Albumin for every 2 liters&#xD;
      removed), 2nd LVP with administration 1 unit of FFP for every 2 liters removed for the first&#xD;
      4 liters followed by 12.5gm 25% albumin for every subsequent 2 liters removed, and 3rd LVP&#xD;
      again with administration of intravenous albumin. The first LVP serves as the study entry&#xD;
      time period and also as a control period for the same patient. The second LVP is to test the&#xD;
      new intervention with FFP. The third LVP is included so that we can monitor the patient's&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albumin or FFP administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albumin administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50ml of 25% albumin for every 2L removed&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFP administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 units of FFP for the first 4L removed followed by 50ml of 25% albumin for every additional&#xD;
      2L removed FFP will be supplied by the Blood Bank and albumin from the pharmacy at Montefiore&#xD;
      Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details for each study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st Period: Day 1: Enrollment, baseline pre-LVP laboratory testing and measurements, and&#xD;
           large volume paracentesis with administration of albumin Day 6: Laboratory testing and&#xD;
           measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd Period: Day 1: pre-LVP baseline labs and measurements, LVP with FFP administration&#xD;
           Day 6: Laboratory testing and measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd Period: Day 1: pre-LVP baseline labs and measurements, LVP with albumin&#xD;
           administration Day 6: Laboratory testing and measurements&#xD;

    <description>Efficacy of LVP with FFP will be measured as the change of plasma renin activity (PRA) from Day 1 to Day 6 during the 2nd LVP with FFP. We hypothesize that FFP will reduce the PRA by 25% from Day 1 to Day 6.</description>
