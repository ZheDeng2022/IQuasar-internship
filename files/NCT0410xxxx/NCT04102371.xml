  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this multicenter pragmatic clinical trial are to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      and relative safety of balanced fluid resuscitation versus 0.9% &quot;normal&quot; saline in children&#xD;
      with septic shock, including whether balanced fluid resuscitation can reduce progression of&#xD;
      kidney injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5,000 children die from septic shock each year in the United States (US);&#xD;
      thousands more die worldwide. Most children admitted with sepsis receive initial&#xD;
      resuscitation in an emergency department (ED), where septic shock remains one of the most&#xD;
      critical of illnesses treated by ED clinicians. Sepsis is also the most expensive hospital&#xD;
      condition in the US, and the most common cause of pediatric multiple organ dysfunction&#xD;
      syndrome (MODS). While all crystalloid fluids help to reverse shock, the most effective and&#xD;
      safest type of crystalloid fluid resuscitation is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crystalloid fluids can be categorized as non-buffered (most commonly 0.9% normal saline [NS])&#xD;
      or buffered/balanced fluids (BF). In the US, the most common BF is lactated Ringer's (LR),&#xD;
      but other example include PlasmaLyte. NS and BF are inexpensive, stable at room temperature,&#xD;
      and nearly universally available with identical storage volumes and dosing strategies.&#xD;
      Notably, both are also of proven clinical benefit in septic shock and have extensive clinical&#xD;
      experience for use in fluid resuscitation of critically ill patients. However, despite data&#xD;
      suggesting that BF resuscitation may have superior efficacy and safety, NS remains the most&#xD;
      commonly used fluid largely based on historical precedent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To definitively test the comparative effectiveness of NS and BF, a well-powered randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) is necessary. A large pragmatic randomized trial embedded within&#xD;
      everyday clinical practice provides a cost-efficient and generalizable approach to inform&#xD;
      clinicians about best comparative effectiveness of common therapies. Data from a prior&#xD;
      single-center feasibility study demonstrated that a pragmatic randomized clinical trial of NS&#xD;
      versus BF for children with septic shock presenting to an emergency department is feasible&#xD;
      and can be successfully carried out by embedding simple study procedures within routine&#xD;
      clinical practice. This multi-center study that will now test for differential clinical&#xD;
      effects, as part of a definitive comparative effectiveness trial, of NS versus BF for&#xD;
      crystalloid resuscitation of pediatric septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter phase trial will include enrollment and study procedures across 30+ US and&#xD;
      international sites to compare the effectiveness and relative safety of NS versus BF (LR and&#xD;
      PlasmaLyte) for crystalloid resuscitation of children with septic shock. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is major adverse kidney events within 30 days along with other secondary clinical, safety,&#xD;
      and kidney biomarker endpoints.&#xD;
