    <textblock>
      The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes the human skin and mucous membranes.&#xD;
      Longitudinal studies usually divide S. aureus carriers into either persistent or intermittent&#xD;
      carriers, but because the number of samplings, the follow-up periods and the study&#xD;
      populations differ between studies, the designation of carrier state is inconsistent. It has&#xD;
      been estimated that around 20 % of a population are persistent carriers, 60 % are&#xD;
      intermittent carriers and 20 % are non-carriers. S. aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that&#xD;
      can become invasive and cause a large spectrum of infections. S. aureus is frequently the&#xD;
      cause of skin and soft tissue infections e.g. wounds, furuncles and abscesses, and can also&#xD;
      cause urinary tract infections and pneumonia. If it enters the bloodstream, it can lead to&#xD;
      metastatic infections e.g. endocarditis, arthritis, osteomyelitis and meningitis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, S. aureus is a common pathogen in surgical site infections and in infections&#xD;
      related to foreign bodies, such as catheters and prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is an increasing challenge worldwide and is also seen in S.&#xD;
      aureus. The first methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were seen in 1961 just&#xD;
      one year after the antibiotic methicillin was introduced. For several decades MRSA was mainly&#xD;
      a hospital-associated bacterium, but since the mid 1990's it has become increasingly&#xD;
      prevalent in the community where it often affects children and younger adults. MRSA can cause&#xD;
      the same types of infections as the methicillin susceptible S. aureus, but often only&#xD;
      colonizes the mucosa. When colonization is confirmed, the person is called a carrier of MRSA&#xD;
      and there is a risk of both a wide spectrum of infections and spread of MRSA to others. The&#xD;
      Danish Health Authority has published a National guideline on how to prevent the spread of&#xD;
      MRSA and keep the prevalence of MRSA low in Denmark, especially in the health care setting.&#xD;
      The finding of MRSA both in samples from clinical infections and in screening samples for&#xD;
      MRSA carriage is notifiable and has to be reported to the Danish Patient Safety Authority and&#xD;
      Statens Serum Institut, in order to monitor the number of MRSA positive persons in Denmark,&#xD;
      potential outbreaks and risk factors for MRSA acquisition. Furthermore, the guideline&#xD;
      recommends that MRSA carriers and their household members undergo a five day topical&#xD;
      decolonization treatment consisting of nasal mupirocin ointment 2 % three times daily in the&#xD;
      nostrils (mupirocin is an antibiotic usually active against MRSA) and chlorhexidine body wash&#xD;
      4 % once daily. Unfortunately, many patients are still MRSA carriers after completing the&#xD;
      treatment and especially throat carriers are difficult to clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRSA carriers have routinely been treated since 2009. Our current guideline recommends adding&#xD;
      antibiotics to the standard regimen, clindamycin being our first line choice, on the second&#xD;
      or third eradication attempt if the patient is a throat carrier and the isolate is&#xD;
      clindamycin susceptible. To our knowledge, the only randomized, controlled trial including&#xD;
      clindamycin for treatment of MRSA carriage, is a Swedish study that showed a significant&#xD;
      effect of standard treatment plus the antibiotic rifampicin in combination with either&#xD;
      clindamycin or sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim compared to standard treatment alone in&#xD;
      long-term MRSA carriers. As most of our patients are healthy individuals without infections,&#xD;
      adding systemic antibiotics to the decolonization treatment must be considered thoroughly.&#xD;
      There is a risk of side effects in the individual patient and prudent use of antibiotics in&#xD;
      the era of a rising incidence of antimicrobial resistance is crucial to avoid selection of&#xD;
      further resistance. Our group has recently published a retrospective study describing the&#xD;
      MRSA treatment data of 164 patients treated in 2013. The study confirmed that throat carriers&#xD;
      had a higher treatment failure rate but adding clindamycin to the first eradication attempt&#xD;
      did not significantly increase the success rate. However, as there had been no randomization&#xD;
      of patients the scientific evidence is low and the fact that there are no published studies&#xD;
      using clindamycin as the only antibiotic for MRSA throat carriers, implies the need for a&#xD;
      randomized trial on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To investigate whether a significantly higher number of MRSA throat carriers become MRSA&#xD;
      free when adding the oral antibiotic clindamycin to the standard regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: MRSA negative swabs at 1 month Secondary endpoint: MRSA negative swabs&#xD;
      after 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is a randomized double blinded placebo-controlled study, including patients&#xD;
      â‰¥18 years old that have tested MRSA positive in their throat after completing one standard&#xD;
      topical decolonization treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of study subjects Patients are recruited from the Capital Region via MRSA&#xD;
      KnowledgeCenter Hvidovre Hospital or MRSA team Herlev Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have since their first positive MRSA result an active connection to the MRSA&#xD;
      KnowledgeCenter Hvidovre Hospital / MRSA team Herlev Hospital either through the hygiene&#xD;
      specialist nurses or doctors. Patients often call for support, guidance and treatment plans,&#xD;
      and routine letters are often sent out to patients regarding their treatment, control swap&#xD;
      results and more. When the department's nurses or doctors have written or oral contact with a&#xD;
      patient that could be a possible candidate for the trial, the possibility of participating in&#xD;
      the trial will be mentioned and investigator's contact details will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient can contact the investigator by phone or email. After first contact with the&#xD;
      investigator, and receiving information about the trial, the patient will have a minimum of&#xD;
      48 hours to decide whether he/she is interested in learning more about the project. Patients&#xD;
      that respond positively will be invited to a personal meeting at either Hvidovre Hospital or&#xD;
      Herlev Hospital, where oral information about the trial and possible side effects will be&#xD;
      given to the patient. The meeting will occur in a private and undisturbed room with the door&#xD;
      closed. The patient can bring a friend or relative at the meeting if desired. Patients will&#xD;
      be offered 24 hours to provide oral and written informed consent in order to secure&#xD;
      sufficient time for reflection on study participation. If a patient needs more time to&#xD;
      consider entering the trial, more time will be given. Before signing the informed consent&#xD;
      form, the investigator will secure that the patient has read and understood the written study&#xD;
      information. Every possible study subject that has a personal meeting with the investigator,&#xD;
      will be registered in REDcap, a secure web application for managing online databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When oral and written consent has been obtained, the subject will receive a randomized&#xD;
      eradication package as described below, as well as a diary to fill out during the study from&#xD;
      day 1 to 14, asking about compliance and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data Patient data will be pseudo-anonymized as each patient will receive a project&#xD;
      number. The investigator will on another file in a locked drawer (investigator site file), as&#xD;
      well as on a secured electronic file, only accessible for investigators, have access to the&#xD;
      real identification of the patient (the CPR number).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once included in the trial, one eCRF is created for each patient for collection of trial&#xD;
      data. This will include the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project number, date of birth, age, sex, height, weight, relevant medical history/current&#xD;
      medication, sites and dates of MRSA positive samples, prior MRSA decolonization treatments,&#xD;
      household composition and household members MRSA carrier state, typing and resistance data of&#xD;
      the MRSA strain, body mass index, laboratory and investigational results. For sexually active&#xD;
      female subjects in the reproductive age, we also record the use of contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRFs will be stored in the secure web application for managing online databases 'REDCap'&#xD;
      which is designed for non-commercial clinical research. Obtained data will be transferred&#xD;
      manually by investigators or appointed research nurses to the CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eCRF does not contain information on the specific treatment the patient is randomized to&#xD;
      as the randomization is done by the pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment The subject will receive a randomized eradication package, consisting of&#xD;
      mupirocin nasal ointment 2 %, Chlorhexidine Bodywash 4 % and either placebo capsules 2&#xD;
      capsules three times daily for 10 days or clindamycin 300 mg capsules 2 capsules three times&#xD;
      daily for 10 days. Placebo and clindamycin are manufactured to look exactly alike by Glostrup&#xD;
      pharmacy, who is also in charge of the randomization/blinding of the packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An emergency unblinding procedure will be established to allow investigators the option to&#xD;
      withdraw the subject from the trial at any given time, in case of an emergency. This could be&#xD;
      if a subject experiences serious adverse events, that could be caused by the active&#xD;
      treatment. The pharmacist has created individual sealed and securely closed envelopes for&#xD;
      each included subject ID available. The investigator can at any time, 24 hours a day, in case&#xD;
      of an emergency unblind a subject, to reveal which treatment has been given. The sponsor will&#xD;
      be notified within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the oral treatment, the patient follows the standard treatment guidelines for MRSA&#xD;
      decolonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment Thirty to sixty days after end of treatment, the subjects will routinely&#xD;
      have MRSA control swabs taken by their GP according to the National MRSA guidelines. Subjects&#xD;
      will be reminded about this screening test when entering the trial. If control swabs haven't&#xD;
      been received within 6 weeks after completing the treatment, an electronic reminder will be&#xD;
      send. The swabs are routine samples that will be handled as regular MRSA control samples in&#xD;
      the clinical microbiology laboratory at either Hvidovre hospital or Herlev hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swab results If the patient is MRSA positive one month after the treatment, no further&#xD;
      screening samples will be needed for this project. The patient will leave the trial, and if&#xD;
      additional treatment is considered by the doctors responsible for the treatment outside the&#xD;
      trial, the randomization will be unblinded in order to plan the most optimal treatment,&#xD;
      without revealing the investigator about the investigation medicine given prior to the drop&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MRSA negative at one month, no unblinding will take place as no new treatment will be&#xD;
      planned. The subject will have new control swabs taken at the GP six to eight months after&#xD;
      completing the treatment. If negative swabs at 6-8 months, the patient is declared MRSA free&#xD;
      according to the National MRSA Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation Anticipation is 30% better eradication success rate in the group receiving&#xD;
      standard treatment plus clindamycin compared to the group treated with standard treatment and&#xD;
      placebo. Power calculation shows that 31 patients are needed in each group, power being set&#xD;
      at 80 %, and significance level at 0.05 %. It is our goal to include 40 patients in each&#xD;
      group, as 9 patients in each group is expected to either drop out or be non-compliant to the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of consumed tablets will be reported in the eCFR, to monitor consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The returned capsules, if any, will be returned to the Glostrup pharmacy, for correct&#xD;
      destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of this trial is high. Hundreds of healthy MRSA carriers have been treated with&#xD;
      clindamycin in the last decade without a strong scientific evidence of a better effect than&#xD;
      standard treatment. It is very relevant to know, whether adding clindamycin to the treatment&#xD;
      of throat carriers is superior to the standard treatment. The outcome of this trial will help&#xD;
      us understand the most effective way to clear throat carriers of MRSA.&#xD;
