    <textblock>
      Numerous studies describing surgical treatments to preserve hip replacements has several&#xD;
      controversies and none of these procedures are universally accepted nor have compelling&#xD;
      evidence for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). With developing a newly approach&#xD;
      osteonecrotic device surgical procedure to support the regeneration of necrotic bone and&#xD;
      articular cartilage in vivo, this will be the first randomized-controlled feasibility study&#xD;
      to determine its safety in ONFH patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total of 20 patients were enrolled and randomized in this study. There are two groups, 10&#xD;
      patients in osteonecrotic device group; 10 incore decompression group. After their baseline&#xD;
      data has been collected and their surgical procedure has been completed, the following&#xD;
      postoperative data collection are then continued to 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, one year,&#xD;
      and two years' prior from the start of their surgery, in order to understand the new approach&#xD;
      of the osteonecrotic device's safety in comparison to the core decompression surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <description>A biphasic osteochrondral composite method to support the regeneration of articular cartilage in vivo. With its concept that could be securely installed by press-fit without additional fixation, this approach can present an alternative to perform graft harvest and implantation in a single surgery.</description>

    <description>Core decompression is a common surgical procedure that aims to improve vascular inflow by decreasing intraosseous pressure in the femoral head. It is performed that involves removing a cylindrical core of bone from the proximal femur.</description>
