    <textblock>
      The objective of our PILOT study is to evaluate the impact of a controlled (monitored)&#xD;
      randomized anesthesia during cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC to oxaliplatin in order to&#xD;
      treat adenocarcinomas of colorectal origin. The combination of NOL monitoring, BIS monitoring&#xD;
      and continuous hemodynamic monitoring (FloTrac EV1000 system) can improve patient safety by&#xD;
      reducing the length of hospital stay by decreasing total hypnotic doses and intraoperative&#xD;
      opioids and side effects following anesthesia.&#xD;

      Title: Evaluation of the combined intraoperative monitoring of depth of analgesia (NOL),&#xD;
      depth of anesthesia (BIS) and continuous hemodynamic data (Flotrac EV1000 system) on the&#xD;
      patients' recovery after cytoreduction surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy&#xD;
      (HIPEC). A pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Investigators hypothesize that the intraoperative combination of new monitors,&#xD;
      NOL index for depth of analgesia, BIS index for depth of anesthesia and Flotrac EV1000 system&#xD;
      as continuous hemodynamic monitoring, to guide the delivery of opioids, hypnotics, fluids and&#xD;
      inotropes, respectively, will improve the quality of recovery as well as the safety after&#xD;
      anesthesia in patients undergoing HIPEC (Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: so far, only vital signs (mostly, blood pressure and heart rate) helped the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist to administer hypnotics agents, analgesics, fluids and inotrope. Many&#xD;
      devices have offered pain monitoring for anesthetized patients. The NOL index, a nociception&#xD;
      monitor using a multiparametric approach, has shown an excellent sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      in detecting noxious stimuli under general anesthesia. More recently, it has been shown a&#xD;
      strong inverse correlation between NOL index response to nociceptive stimulus and the&#xD;
      increasing doses of opioid analgesia during surgery. Studies on post-operative outcomes when&#xD;
      using intraoperative NOL monitoring to adapt nociception/anti-nociception balance during&#xD;
      general anesthesia (GA) also reported in our center an improvement of the time to extubation&#xD;
      and of the postoperative recovery criteria in PACU after colorectal surgery in the monitored&#xD;
      group, leading to a quicker discharge from PACU (presented as an abstract at ASA 2018;&#xD;
      manuscript in preparation). Recent studies also showed that avoiding too deep anesthesia by&#xD;
      using the BIS index would improve patients' outcome in terms of morbi-mortality. It is also&#xD;
      accepted that intra-venous fluid and inotropic/vasopressor drugs have an important effect on&#xD;
      intra and postoperative patients' outcomes, in particular following major gastrointestinal&#xD;
      surgery. The use of hemodynamic therapy management algorithms has been recommended in a&#xD;
      report commissioned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the USA, and by the&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK as well as many groups&#xD;
      working in ERAS protocols in Canada (and especially Montreal, McGill University) and&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our recent systematic review (in preparation) and out of the 69 selected published&#xD;
      articles, there is no study so far evaluating precisely the impact of anesthesia on&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes, and no study combining the NOL, the BIS indexes and the Flotrac&#xD;
      EV1000 system to evaluate the impact of a more precise anesthesia management on the&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes after cytoreduction and HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis of&#xD;
      colorectal origin. Thus, the idea to propose the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives: primary objective: to compare the time to reach the readiness for&#xD;
      discharge from hospital and the total postoperative in-hospital length of stay between the&#xD;
      Monitored group &quot;M&quot; (optimized, personalized and controlled anesthesia) versus the control&#xD;
      group &quot;C&quot; (standard of care anesthesia). Secondary objectives: to evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      recovery from anesthesia in the PACU and on the wards and all the adverse events every day&#xD;
      and until patient's discharge from hospital. The emergence and extubation time of patients&#xD;
      after anesthesia, time spent in PACU (Aldrete score), intra- and postoperative opioid&#xD;
      requirements, pain scores (NRS) for several postoperative days, patients' postoperative&#xD;
      recovery and satisfaction (the Quality of Recovery: QOR-15, 6min walking test, MOCA, etc.)&#xD;
      will be also compared between the 2 groups. Finally, biological outcomes such as blood gas&#xD;
      analysis, serum electrolytes, creatinine, DFG, hemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet&#xD;
      counts, CRP, serum albumin, INR, PTT will be evaluated on a standard basis in both the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 80 patients scheduled for HIPEC surgery with oxaliplatin for bowel adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      surgery (without digestive resection) will be included. Randomisation will occur after the&#xD;
      participant has provided informed consent and shortly before the surgical procedure is due to&#xD;
      start. Patients in the Control group &quot;C&quot; will be managed by clinical staff according to usual&#xD;
      practice, desflurane will be administered to keep MAC at 1, and remifentanil infusion rate&#xD;
      will be adapted to the mean arterial blood pressure to keep it between 65 and 100. In the&#xD;
      Monitored group &quot;M&quot;, the NOL index will guide the administration of remifentanil to keep the&#xD;
      index between 5-25, and the desflurane will be titrated to keep a BIS index between 45 and&#xD;
      55. Cardiac output and stroke volume variation will be measured by the Flotrac EV1000 system.&#xD;
      Patients will receive 250ml fluid challenges with a recommended solution as required, in&#xD;
      order to achieve a maximal value of stroke volume. Intraoperative epidural analgesia will be&#xD;
      the same for all. Postoperative analgesia will be based on PCEA and hydromorphone for all.&#xD;
      All anesthesia related side effects and quality of analgesia and rehabilitation will be&#xD;
      evaluated daily and until patient's discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: all data collected will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach. Summary&#xD;
      statistics for each group, treatment effects, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values will be&#xD;
      presented for primary and secondary outcomes, and process measures. Intraoperative data in&#xD;
      the &quot;M&quot; and &quot;C&quot; groups will be compared using parametric (e.g. Student t-test) or&#xD;
      non-parametric tests (e.g. Mann-Withney U test, Chi-squared test) depending on type of&#xD;
      variables and distribution. General linear models will be used to carry out group comparisons&#xD;
      on data on length of hospital stay. Potential pitfalls: analyses for secondary objectives may&#xD;
      not be sufficiently powered but will nevertheless provide useful information for designing&#xD;
      and conducting a future multicentric study. Bonferroni corrections will be used to protect&#xD;
      against type I error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Importance: Adding the NOL, the BIS and continuous hemodynamic monitoring will&#xD;
      very likely reduce the total length of stay, and improve the postoperative speed and quality&#xD;
      of recovery as well as will likely reduce the incidence of complications after cytoreduction&#xD;
      + HIPEC procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Adult patients scheduled to undergo laparotomy for cytoreduction surgery&#xD;
      + HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin and under general anesthesia with&#xD;
      an active intraoperative epidural analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 80 patients will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
