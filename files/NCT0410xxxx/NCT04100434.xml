  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, multicenter, and randomized study(five hospitals).The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the differences in the effects of the evolocumab added to&#xD;
      moderate-intensity statin therapy and the moderate-intensity statin only therapy on the&#xD;
      regulation of LDL-C levels in patients with acute phase acute coronary syndrome after four&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. The primary outcome is the percentage change in LDL-C in weeks 4 and week&#xD;
      12 after treatment. The secondary outcome is the occurrence of MACE after 12 weeks and 1 year&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
