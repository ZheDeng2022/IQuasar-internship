  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel 2-cohort&#xD;
      study to evaluate the puffing patterns of individuals switching from a similar usual brand&#xD;
      (UB) Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) product to either a 2.4% or 5% nicotine level&#xD;
      ENDS product in healthy adult ENDS users. This study will be conducted for potential&#xD;
      submission to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) as&#xD;
      part of a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) for an Electronic Nicotine Delivery&#xD;
      System (ENDS), comprised of an electrical power unit and four flavor variants each with two&#xD;
      different levels of nicotine (2.4% and 5.0%).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will complete a pre-screening interview and a Screening Visit to assess&#xD;
      their eligibility and, based on meeting eligibility requirements, will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study on the same day of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, the subjects will be randomized to either the 5.0% nicotine ENDS products or&#xD;
      the 2.4% nicotine ENDS products. Once randomized to the nicotine level, subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of the four flavor variants based on alignment with their preferred UB&#xD;
      flavor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided an orientation to the product and the Product Use and Behavior&#xD;
      (PUB) instrument and provided with enough cartridges (sufficient for three weeks of product&#xD;
      use [125% their reported weekly use of their UB]) to last the 3-week period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will take the products home and use them ad libitum for a 1-week acclimation&#xD;
      period followed by a 2-week product use period. During this time product use will be captured&#xD;
      by the PUB instrument and their data uploaded to the cloud regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the 3-week ambulatory period, the subject will return to the clinic,&#xD;
      return the ENDS power unit, used and unused ENDS cartridges, and the PUB instrument (and all&#xD;
      cables/charger), have his/her health status reevaluated, complete the Product Evaluation&#xD;
      Scale (PES) questionnaire and will then be discharged from the study.&#xD;
