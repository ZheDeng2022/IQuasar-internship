  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with Chronic Hepatitis B are on nucleoside analogy (NA) long term, but this&#xD;
      leads to HBsAg loss (defined as functional cure) of only 2% at 6 years. Recently a number of&#xD;
      studies have shown significant HBsAg loss rates after stopping nucleoside analogues (NA).&#xD;
      However, no criteria to select such patients have been evaluated. Consequently, the objective&#xD;
      of the study is not only to determine the proportion of patients able to achieve HBsAg loss&#xD;
      in those with qHBsAg≤100IU/ml. The study is designed as a randomised control trial with 1:2&#xD;
      parallel arm randomisation to continuing NA or stopping therapy. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      after stopping therapy for Hepatitis B flares and also to document HBsAg loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) affects over 250 million persons and is considered one of the major&#xD;
      causes of mortality and morbidity globally. Standard treatment consists of nucleos(t)ide&#xD;
      analogues (NA) or peginterferon (PEG). There has been increasing interested in HBsAg loss,&#xD;
      defined as functional cure. However this has been difficult to achieve with NA, and although&#xD;
      rates of HBsAg loss are higher with PEG, they are still &lt;10%. However, a number of studies&#xD;
      have shown that HBsAg loss rates were significantly higher in those who stopped NA. A study&#xD;
      from Greece by Hadziyannis had a 39% HBsAg loss after patients stopped adefovir therapy.&#xD;
      Further studies have shown similar results, and those not able to clear HBsAg have had&#xD;
      quiescent disease, although some patients had to restart therapy usually due to hepatitis B&#xD;
      flares. No deaths have been reported. Consequently, while stopping therapy has led to HBsAg&#xD;
      loss in some patients, it is not clear which patients would benefit the most. The prior&#xD;
      studies have indicated that patients most likely to lose HBsAg had low qHBsAg levels and a&#xD;
      level ≤100 IU/ml had a high possibility of HBsAg loss. Consequently, we propose to test&#xD;
      whether patients with CHB on NA &gt;1year and without liver cirrhosis and with qHBsAg≤100 IU/ml&#xD;
      are able to lose HBsAg compared to those who continue NA. The study is designed as a parallel&#xD;
      arm RCT randomised 1:2 to continue NA versus stop NA. Patients will be monitored regularly&#xD;
      for clinical status, virological markers, and liver markers. The primary endpoint is HBsAg&#xD;
      loss at the end of the study in those who stop versus those who continue NA. Additional&#xD;
      outcomes will be hepatitis B flares, inactive hepatitis B status, virological relapse, and&#xD;
      restarting therapy.&#xD;
