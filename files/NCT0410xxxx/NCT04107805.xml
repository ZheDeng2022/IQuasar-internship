  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI&#xD;
      1323495 in healthy subjects following bid oral administration of multiple rising doses, each&#xD;
      over an 11 day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose&#xD;
      proportionality (only for Part 1) as well as attainment of steady state. This includes&#xD;
      exploration of a therapeutic exposure range, a range not adequately achieved in the&#xD;
      single-rising dose trial 1405-0001.&#xD;
