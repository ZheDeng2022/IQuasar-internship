  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is the golden standard in the treatment of hepatic malignancies. The size and&#xD;
      function of the remnant liver is a major concern. If the future liver remnant (FLR) is below&#xD;
      30 % of the initial liver volume, the risk of post hepatectomy liver insufficiency rises.&#xD;
      Several techniques have been developed to increase the size of FLR before liver resection. In&#xD;
      this study a new technique ARAPS (portal vein embolization with radio frequency ablation) is&#xD;
      compared to portal vein embolization alone for accelerated liver growth in the FLR. This is&#xD;
      done in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Curative intent liver resection is the gold standard for treatment of hepatic malignancies,&#xD;
      including metastases from colorectal cancer (CRLM), but liver resection can only be performed&#xD;
      if future liver remnant (FLR) volume is at least 25 %. Unfortunately, many cancer patients&#xD;
      have multiple liver lesions at the time of diagnosis, rendering radical resection impossible&#xD;
      due to a marginal FLR, thereby increasing the risk of posthepatectomy liver failure and&#xD;
      subsequent death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques have been designed to increase the size of the FLR, allowing more patients&#xD;
      to undergo surgery. These techniques include portal vein embolization (PVE), portal vein&#xD;
      ligation (PVL), two-stage partial hepatectomy, and the associating liver partition with PVL&#xD;
      for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS). The ALPPS procedure seems to be superior to the other&#xD;
      techniques for achieving increased size and accelerated growth of the FLR. Especially the&#xD;
      kinetic growth rate (KGR) is superior to what has been previously described. The major&#xD;
      drawback of ALPPS is, however, that the patient is subjected to two open procedures that are&#xD;
      associated with high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous experimental study on rats, The investigators have shown that PVE combined with&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA), hereafter called Associated Radiofrequency Ablation and Portal&#xD;
      Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ARAPS), can induce accelerated growth of the FLR as&#xD;
      potent as that seen after ALPPS. In humans, the ARAPS procedure can (the first step), in&#xD;
      contrast to the two-stage ALPPS procedure, be performed percutaneously, and the investigators&#xD;
      expect this to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with the ALPPS. In the&#xD;
      present study, the investigators want to examine the effect of ARAPS compared with PVE alone&#xD;
      on liver regeneration and function of the FLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale In order to allow more patients to undergo radical surgery for CRLM,&#xD;
      implementation of new methods to enhance liver regeneration is vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim In the present study, the investigators test the hypothesis that the ARAPS approach is&#xD;
      superior to PVE alone in achieving growth of the FLR in patients with CRLM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis the investigators expect to see higher growth of the FLR in the ARAPS arm compared&#xD;
      with the PVE arm one week after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study is an investigator-initiated prospective, randomized study. Any&#xD;
      patient eligible for this study will be offered enrollment. Patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will be randomized (1:1) to either the intervention (ARAPS) or control (PVE) as&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of study subjects Potential study subjects will be given the option to&#xD;
      participate after the study is presented during their first visit to the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
      The visit will take place in a consultation room, where the surgeon will provide verbal and&#xD;
      written information regarding the study prior to enrollment. Patients are allowed a companion&#xD;
      for this interview. At least 24 hours are given before an informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
      Patient consent can be withdrawn at any time, and all data collected for the project, will be&#xD;
      destroyed without any consequence for their subsequent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan Power calculations Total liver volume is ~1500 mL. Assuming that FLR is 20&#xD;
      % of the total liver volume, FLR comprises 300 mL. Based on previous literature, the&#xD;
      investigators expect a growth in the FLR of 10 % (30 mL, KGR ≈ 4.3 ml/day) in the PVE arm and&#xD;
      50 % (150 mL, KGR ≈ 21.4 ml/day) in the ARAPS arm. At alpha=0.05, power 80 %, and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 200 mL, 12 patients in each arm is needed to show a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between the two interventions. In order to be able to deal with potential dropout&#xD;
      of up to 20%, the investigators aim to include 15 patients in each arm; 30 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Liver regeneration will be measured as the increase in anatomical (CT)&#xD;
      and functional (PET) liver volume seven and thirteen days following intervention (quantified&#xD;
      in milliliters). Further, the KGR will be calculated as volume increase per day (ml/day).&#xD;
      Differences in the two arms will be expressed as means or medians with associated standard&#xD;
      deviations or interquartile ranges (depending on the distribution of data). Differences&#xD;
      between the two arms will be analyzed using a t-test or non-parametric test where&#xD;
      appropriate. P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on patients Data on age, diagnosis, comorbidity, and tumor imaging material will be&#xD;
      passed on from the medical records in order to assess if the patient is eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. Information on sex, tumor size, tumor histology, number and size of&#xD;
      metastases, medications, tobacco/alcohol exposure, and blood sample results will be retrieved&#xD;
      on from the patient's medical records. Radiological, biochemical, and pathological reports&#xD;
      will also be retrieved for use in the statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Intervention Portal vein embolization The standard-of-care procedure, which&#xD;
      would be offered to the patients regardless of this study, is PVE. PVE will be used to&#xD;
      redirect portal flow to segments of the FLR: The portal venous system is assessed through the&#xD;
      tumor-bearing part of the liver (i.e. the part that is later going to be removed). The portal&#xD;
      vein is assessed under guidance by ultrasonography, and a catheter is then advanced under&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance for subsequent embolization. In the case of a planned extended right&#xD;
      hepatectomy, the portal branches to segment 4 should be selectively embolized. As&#xD;
      embolization material plugs are preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radio-frequency ablation Under guidance of ultrasonography a single-electrode RFA-needle is&#xD;
      placed in the part of the liver that has just been deportalized. The needle is placed in&#xD;
      normal parenchyma, and within a period of ten minutes a necrosis of approx. 3 cm is created.&#xD;
      In literature, complication rates following RFA treatment are low, making it a feasible&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatments will be performed in general anesthesia. Patients will be equipped with two&#xD;
      bandages, which they have to wear until after the second PET/CT scan in order to blind them&#xD;
      to the treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT scanning Accurate liver volume estimation relies on precise segmentation of the liver&#xD;
      by multi-phase CT images according to the Couinaud classification. A thicknesses of ≥ 1 mm&#xD;
      will be used to ensure accurate results. Total liver volume, volume of the deportalized part&#xD;
      of the liver, and volume of the FLR will be estimated before and after intervention. Positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) with the radioactively labelled galactose analogue&#xD;
      2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-galactose (FDGal) can be used to quantify whole-liver and regional&#xD;
      hepatic metabolic function as well as to measure functional liver volume. The method is&#xD;
      validated, simple and with insignificant day-to-day variation. The PET scan is performed&#xD;
      after a 4h fast, but the patient is allowed to drink water. In Aarhus, the scanner is a&#xD;
      64-slice Siemens Biograph TruePoint PET/CT camera (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). FDGal (100&#xD;
      MBq) is injected intravenously and a low-dose CT scan (50 effective mAs with CAREDose4D, 120&#xD;
      kV, pitch 0.8, slice thickness 5 mm) is performed for attenuation correction of the PET data&#xD;
      and anatomical co-registration. A static PET scan of the mean tissue radioactivity&#xD;
      concentration is performed from 10-20 minutes after tracer injection (12). The PET data are&#xD;
      corrected for radioactive decay back to injection time and reconstructed with resolution&#xD;
      modeling (4 iterations, 21 subsets and 2 mm (18F-FDGal) or 3 mm (18F-FDG) Gaussian filter)&#xD;
      and 336 x 336 matrix. The standardized uptake value (SUV; unit-less) is calculated dividing&#xD;
      tissue radioactivity concentration (kBq/mL tissue) with the ratio between injected dose (kBq)&#xD;
      and body weight (mL tissue, assuming an average tissue density of 1 g/mL tissue). Whole-liver&#xD;
      and regional hepatic FDGal-SUVs as well as the functional liver volume are estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits, risks, and side-effects Potential benefits As the potential impact of&#xD;
      this study is extensive, including the possibility for more patients with CRLM to undergo&#xD;
      curative-intent resection, it is our opinion that the benefits by far outweigh the few&#xD;
      potential side effects. Only two PET and two CT scans with minimal radiation will be&#xD;
      conducted. The blood samples drawn is part of the standard work-up procedure. No additional&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn on the basis of participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dose from PET/CT scans Patients participating in the present study are not&#xD;
      sustained to more radiation from imaging modalities than patients not participating. From the&#xD;
      low-dose CT-scans, the patient receives an irradiation dose of up to 1 mSv. For FDGal the&#xD;
      effective radiation dose is 0.032 mSv/MBq, the administration of 100 MBq FDGal thus gives a&#xD;
      dose of 3.2 mSv. The total irradiation dose that each patient receives from two PET and two&#xD;
      CT scans is approximately 8.4 mSv which equals three times the average yearly background dose&#xD;
      in Denmark. This presents an estimated risk of 1:10.000 for cancer development due to&#xD;
      participation in the study. These doses should be seen in connection with the potential&#xD;
      benefit for the patient in participating in the study, as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Potential risks related to the RFA treatment are extremely sparse, and include&#xD;
      bleeding, hepatic abscesses, hepatic infarcts, and bile duct injuries. PVE is a safe&#xD;
      procedure that causes few adverse effects and can be performed in an outpatient setting. Most&#xD;
      large series report 0 % procedure related mortality. Risks include bleeding, infection and&#xD;
      displacement of the embolization material. Especially the latest is extremely rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further patient treatment Following calculation of KGR and increase in FLR, patients are&#xD;
      re-evaluated with regard to the timing of the second-stage partial hepatectomy. Some&#xD;
      patients, especially in the PVE arm, are expected to need further liver hypertrophy before&#xD;
      advancing to the partial hepatectomy. Further hypertrophy in a period of 1-3 weeks and a new&#xD;
      CT evaluation might be necessary. In some patients, the hypertrophy might be impaired or&#xD;
      absent. These patients will be evaluated with regard to other treatment options including&#xD;
      salvage ALPPS, which have previously been used in patients with impaired hypertrophy&#xD;
      following PVE. The resection rate in each arm will be reported as a secondary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule This study will commence on 1. November 2019. Total study duration is expected&#xD;
      to be 24 months for subject recruitment, and an additional six months for data analysis. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to finalize the data analysis and present our findings during 2021. The&#xD;
      project will begin at Aarhus University Hospital, while the other participating centers will&#xD;
      be enrolled as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications Both positive, negative, and inconclusive results will be published, and&#xD;
      presented at scientific meetings. Results will be presented at international scientific&#xD;
      congresses, and the investigators will aim for publications in high-impact journals with&#xD;
      focus on oncology, radiology, and liver surgery. The study will be registered at&#xD;
      www.clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
