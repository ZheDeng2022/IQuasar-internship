  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study in Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) participants currently treated with antidepressant therapy. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess CLE-100 for the treatment of MDD in participants&#xD;
      currently treated with standard antidepressant therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLEO study is performed in two parts (part A and Part B). The sponsor is currently recruiting&#xD;
      only for the Part B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will be an inpatient study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      CLE-100 in MDD participants currently treated with an antidepressant drug. It will include a&#xD;
      screening phase (up to 35 days), a 1 week inpatient double-blind treatment phase and an&#xD;
      outpatient post treatment safety follow-up phase of 1 week after last study drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will be a study to assess the safety and efficacy of CLE-100 in MDD participants&#xD;
      currently treated with an antidepressant drug with inadequate response to standard&#xD;
      antidepressant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will remain on their current antidepressant therapy with no dose change&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
