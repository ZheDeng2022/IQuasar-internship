    <textblock>
      This study will examine how various FDA-approved seasonal influenza vaccine types, used in a&#xD;
      manner consistent with their approved use, impact the characteristics of influenza specific&#xD;
      antibodies in humans, and how these responses differ based on age and prior immunization&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is particularly focused on studying antibodies, a protein in blood that react with&#xD;
      foreign substances (such as bacteria and viruses) to help eliminate them. This study will&#xD;
      examine antibodies and the cells that they are produced by, B cells that develop in response&#xD;
      to the influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of antibodies that develop following seasonal influenza vaccine are highly&#xD;
      specific for particular influenza strain that comprises the influenza vaccine, necessitating&#xD;
      the annual reformulation of the influenza vaccine to match strains expected to be in&#xD;
      circulation for the upcoming season. This is problematic, and strategies to develop an&#xD;
      influenza vaccine that can promote the robust and persistent development of antibodies that&#xD;
      are effective against a wide range of influenza strains are needed. One potential strategy is&#xD;
      to promote antibody responses targeting the neuraminidase (NA) protein of influenza. NA is&#xD;
      more highly conserved across influenza viruses as compared to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein&#xD;
      which is the major component of the influenza vaccine. Thus understanding how differences in&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccines may influence the quality and breadth of HA and NA specific&#xD;
      antibodies is of importance in the development of more effective influenza vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several FDA-approved seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) and it remains&#xD;
      unknown the extent to which they may induce HA and NA-specific B cells and antibodies, and&#xD;
      particularly those that may have broad protective activity against influenza. Differences in&#xD;
      the various seasonal IIVs, such as how they were produced, their dose, and the immune&#xD;
      stimulating components (adjuvant) they contain may influence the HA and NA-specific response.&#xD;
      The two major types of seasonal IIV approved for adults are IIV that is comprised of&#xD;
      inactivated influenza virus that was grown in chicken eggs (e.g. Sanofi Fluzone, IIV), and&#xD;
      the other comprised of inactivated influenza virus that was grown in cell culture (e.g.&#xD;
      Seqirus Flucelvax, cc-IIV). Additionally, for adults 65 years and older, High Dose Fluzone&#xD;
      (HD-IIV3), and Sequris Fluad IIV, which includes an adjuvant (a-IIV3). This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the relative induction of HA and NA-specific antibodies and B cells from adults&#xD;
      immunized with these various seasonal influenza vaccines, and how these responses may change&#xD;
      after each year, and differ in older adults who may have a different past exposure history to&#xD;
      influenza compared to younger adults. The seasonal influenza vaccines will be given as&#xD;
      standard of care, in populations they are approved for, and administered in approved dose and&#xD;
      route.&#xD;
