      There is strong consensus - based on robust randomized trial data - that routine&#xD;
      pre-operative (pre-op) testing for cataract surgery is inappropriate. Despite these widely&#xD;
      endorsed evidence-based recommendations, most seniors undergoing cataract surgery still&#xD;
      receive unnecessary blood testing, EKGs, and chest X-rays (CXRs); another substantial&#xD;
      percentage even undergo nonindicated cardiac stress tests. We will integrate three new best&#xD;
      practice alert (BPA) nudges into the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR). The nudges are informed by behavioral economic theory and are&#xD;
      designed to alter the choice architecture for physicians to decrease the rate of pre-op test&#xD;
      ordering while still preserving clinician autonomy. We will conduct a pragmatic trial to&#xD;
      evaluate whether these BPA nudges reduce low-value pre-op testing for cataract surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong consensus - based on robust randomized trial data - that routine&#xD;
      pre-operative (pre-op) testing for cataract surgery is inappropriate (Keay et al, 2009; Keay&#xD;
      et al, 2012; Schein et al, 2000; Chen et al, 2015). Because pre-op testing provides no&#xD;
      benefit to patients, the American Academy of Ophthalmology named reducing routine pre-op&#xD;
      testing for cataract surgery the #1 issue that patients and physicians should question as&#xD;
      part of the Choosing Wisely™ campaign (Schein et al, 2012). Despite these widely endorsed&#xD;
      evidence-based recommendations, most seniors undergoing cataract surgery still receive&#xD;
      unnecessary blood testing, EKGs, and chest X-rays (CXRs); another substantial percentage even&#xD;
      undergo non-indicated cardiac stress tests (Rumball-Smith et al, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With cataract surgery being the most common medical procedure among Medicare beneficiaries&#xD;
      (predicted 4.4 million per year by the year 2030) (Schein et al, 2012), widespread reduction&#xD;
      of routine pre-op testing for cataract surgery would reduce costs, reduce exposure to&#xD;
      unnecessary and potentially harmful tests, and allow millions of seniors to spend more time&#xD;
      enjoying life rather than wasting their time receiving inappropriate health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that an interdisciplinary electronic health record (EHR)-based&#xD;
      intervention that applies behavioral economics approaches (i.e., &quot;nudges&quot;) will dramatically&#xD;
      reduce pre-op testing for cataract surgery in a real-world clinical setting. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test this hypothesis by conducting a pragmatic randomized trial,&#xD;
      implementing this intervention at UCLA Health (Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center), where&#xD;
      ~3200 cataract surgeries are performed per year. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Integrate three new BPA nudges into the UCLA Health EHR. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
           a four-arm randomized pragmatic trial to compare the effectiveness of the nudges vs.&#xD;
           usual care. Three distinct nudges were tailored to highlight the safety aspects of&#xD;
           pre-op tests, the financial harms to the patient of experiencing pre-op tests, and the&#xD;
           potential psychological harms to the patient of experiencing preop tests. The pragmatic&#xD;
           trial will include three types of behavioral nudges to promote the desired reduction in&#xD;
           low value care:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nudge 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  UCLA Ophthalmologists and Anesthesiologists ADVISE AGAINST routine pre-op testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  UCLA Pre-op Eval and Planning Center (PEPC) will order any needed labs on the day&#xD;
                of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine pre-op tests are inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine pre-op tests do NOT increase patient safety and go AGAINST local and&#xD;
                national guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hard stop before allowing the ordering of a pre-op test where physicians must&#xD;
                provide accountable justification: &quot;EXPLAIN WHY GOING AGAINST GUIDELINES&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nudge 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  UCLA Ophthalmologists and Anesthesiologists ADVISE AGAINST routine pre-op testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  UCLA Pre-op Eval and Planning Center (PEPC) will order any needed labs on the day&#xD;
                of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine pre-op tests are inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine pre-operative tests can increase the patient's out-of-pocket costs without&#xD;
                improving the safety or medical outcomes of cataract surgery and go AGAINST local&#xD;
                and national guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hard stop before allowing the ordering of a pre-op test where physicians must&#xD;
                provide accountable justification: &quot;EXPLAIN WHY GOING AGAINST GUIDELINES&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nudge 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  UCLA Ophthalmologists and Anesthesiologists ADVISE AGAINST routine pre-op testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  UCLA Pre-op Eval and Planning Center (PEPC) will order any needed labs on the day&#xD;
                of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine pre-op tests are inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine pre-operative tests can cause aggravation and psychological stress for the&#xD;
                patient without improving the safety or medical outcomes of cataract surgery and go&#xD;
                AGAINST local and national guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hard stop before allowing the ordering of a pre-op test where physicians must&#xD;
                provide accountable justification: &quot;EXPLAIN WHY GOING AGAINST GUIDELINES&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomize providers who conducted a pre-op visit in 2019 and those who are expected to&#xD;
           conduct such a visit during the 12-month study period to one of 4 study arms (usual&#xD;
           pre-op care, Nudge #1, Nudge #2, or Nudge #3) and measure and compare the efficacy of&#xD;
           each intervention. The investigators will measure and compare rates of testing before&#xD;
           and after initiation of the randomization. Outcomes will be measured 12-months after the&#xD;
           intervention start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, we will assess the change in the percentage of cataract patients who&#xD;
      undergo one or more pre-op tests after 12 months, where the baseline comparison will be 2019.&#xD;
      While we intended to the 12-month pre-period as the baseline, the COVID-19 pandemic had a&#xD;
      substantial impact on cataract surgeries. We will compare the percentage of patients&#xD;
      receiving pre-op testing in the pooled nudge arms to the usual care arm (primary outcome) and&#xD;
      measure the efficacy of each individual nudge arm to determine whether certain behavioral&#xD;
      economic framing techniques are more effective than others at reducing pre-op testing&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes). Other secondary outcomes will include the change in the percentage of&#xD;
      patients who received pre-op labs, pre-op EKGs, and pre-op CXRs. We will also evaluate the&#xD;
      total number of pre-op tests patients received, same-day surgery cancellations, cost savings&#xD;
      to the health system, and cost savings to the patient. To elicit the views and experiences of&#xD;
      physicians, we will survey physicians randomized to all intervention arms to evaluate their&#xD;
      experience with the EHR alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing patient exposure to unnecessary care is central to improving patient outcomes and&#xD;
      value. This project is fully aligned with UCLA Health leadership's current priority of&#xD;
      supporting cross-departmental system change to improve quality of care, outcomes, and value&#xD;
      for UCLA patients. Because of the close partnership between our UCLA Informatics&#xD;
      co-Investigators and the EHR vendor (Epic), the low-cost intervention that we propose to&#xD;
      implement and test will be easily disseminatable to all Epic-based health systems, and will&#xD;
      have the potential to dramatically reduce inappropriate pre-op testing across the nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EHRs are in their infancy, and the scientific community is only beginning to learn how to use&#xD;
      them as tools to promote desired care processes (Meeker et al, 2016). This proposed pragmatic&#xD;
      trial would break new ground in our understanding of how behavioral economics approaches can&#xD;
      be used to tamp down on care that does not promote better patient outcomes.&#xD;
