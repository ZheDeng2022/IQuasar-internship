  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a common health problem among older adults and their informal caregivers.&#xD;
      Chronic pain has negative effects on physical and psychological health status and it is a&#xD;
      strong predictor of poor quality of life. In this study, a dyadic face-to-face pain&#xD;
      management program will be provided to older adults and informal caregivers to help the dyads&#xD;
      equip with pain-related knowledge and pain coping skills. The effectiveness of the dyadic&#xD;
      program will be assessed. Participants will be recruited follow snowball sampling and will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to experimental group and control group using 1: 1 radio. The dyadic pain&#xD;
      management program will last four weeks, including group discussion, pain-related knowledge&#xD;
      and physical exercises. Pain intensity, anxiety, depression, stress, pain self-efficacy and&#xD;
      quality of life will be measured in baseline, post-treatment and at one-month follow.&#xD;
      Acceptability and satisfaction to the program will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be held in Caritas District Elderly Centre-Yeun Long (Tin Chak Centre) and&#xD;
      Caritas Cheng Shing Fung District Elderly Center (Shamshuipo) in Hong Kong. For sample size,&#xD;
      no suitable standard deviation and effect size was found in previous similar study through&#xD;
      the literature review, so this study will be a pilot RCT study with a total 60 dyads of&#xD;
      sample size. 30 older adults and 30 informal caregivers will be in each group (experimental&#xD;
      group and control group). The dyadic pain management program will be held in the community&#xD;
      activity center at weekends and will involve three parts: demographic data, outcome measures&#xD;
      (baseline, post-treatment and one-month follow-up measures) and pain education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants' eligibility will be confirmed by a questionnaire designed according&#xD;
      to inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. An information sheet will be provided to the&#xD;
      eligible dyads and informed consent will be signed on the scene. Experimental group will&#xD;
      start pain management program when finish the baseline assessment and control group will be&#xD;
      given one page of pain management information download from Department of Health.&#xD;
      (http://www.elderly.gov.hk/english/common_health_problems/bones_and_joints/index.html). For&#xD;
      optimal communication, two WhatsApp groups will be created consisting of all the caregivers&#xD;
      in experimental group and control group respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at three times during the whole intervention, T0 baseline prior to&#xD;
      intervention, T1 in week four when the experimental group finish all the program and T2 in&#xD;
      week eight with one-month follow-up after the program. Dyads' demographic and&#xD;
      caregiving-related questions will be completed prior to beginning the program in T0. Pain&#xD;
      related situations, anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life, pain self-efficacy will be&#xD;
      measured from older adults and informal caregivers at T0, T1, T2, using a same battery of&#xD;
      questionnaires. Dyads' acceptability and satisfaction will be administered immediately after&#xD;
      the last session. Data will be collected by a research assistant blinded to the dyads' group&#xD;
      assignments.&#xD;

      Outcome measures It is a dyadic intervention so outcomes will be measured from older adults&#xD;
      and informal caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome The Brief Pain Inventory-Chinese Version It is a tool to evaluate the&#xD;
      intensity, site, quality, relief, interference and causes of pain in patients. Four items for&#xD;
      the degree of pain severity, one item for the degree of pain relief and seven items for&#xD;
      degree of pain interferes will assess, numbering the different pain sites from 0 to 10. For&#xD;
      BPI-C, the Cronbach's Î± for the pain severity and pain interference items are 0.83-0.89 and&#xD;
      0.90-0.91 and has good acceptable test-retest reliability .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief It is a self-report questionnaire which&#xD;
      assesses 4 domains of quality of life, including physical health, psychological health,&#xD;
      social relationships, and environment. Participants will express how much they have&#xD;
      experienced in the preceding two weeks on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all)&#xD;
      to 5 (completely). Previous studies showed that WHOQOL-BRIF has good internal consistency and&#xD;
      validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression Anxiety Stress Scale It is a self-administered psychological instrument to&#xD;
      evaluate the degree of depression, anxiety and stress involving 21 items. Every part has&#xD;
      seven items on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. The instrument was used in&#xD;
      previous studies and had good internal consistency and validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire It is a tool to measure the self-efficacy in coping with&#xD;
      daily activities with pain . A Chinese version of the PSEQ will be used in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will express participants' confidence in performing ten activities experiencing&#xD;
      pain on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all confident) to 6 (completely&#xD;
      cinfident). Previous studies illustrated the test-rest reliability coefficient of PSEQ was&#xD;
      0.75 and internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha was 0.95, which was reliable .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction and acceptability Participants' satisfaction and acceptability of the dyadic&#xD;
      intervention will be assessed at the end of the grogram. Some open-ended questions will be&#xD;
      asked, including &quot;What topics, content, or concepts could have been covered in more/less&#xD;
      detail?&quot; &quot;As a result of participating in dyadic pain management intervention, did you make&#xD;
      some positive changes in your life?&quot; &quot;Would you feel the group discussions interesting and&#xD;
      informative? Did the activities and exercises relieve your pain symptom?&quot; These questions&#xD;
      were used in previous studies to evaluate the satisfaction and acceptability of intervention&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

The DASS-21 is a set of three self-reported scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items and divided into subscales. The score of each item ranges feom 0 to 3 (o = do not apply to me at all, 3 = applied to me very much or most of the time). Total score is multiplied by 2 of the sum of each subscales. Higher score indicates the greater degree of the symptom.</description>

PSEQ is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the confidence people with ongoing pain have in performing activities while in pain. Score of each item ranges from 0 to 6 (0 = not at all confident, 6 = completely confident). A total score is calculated by adding the scores for each item which ranging from 0 to 60. Higher scores reflect stronger self-efficacy beliefs.</description>
