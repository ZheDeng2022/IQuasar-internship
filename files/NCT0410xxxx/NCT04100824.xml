      Aim of work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of stellate ganglion block in prevention of cerebrovascular spasm in&#xD;
      traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage Primary outcome: Asses changes of cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      velocity by Trans cranial Doppler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: Asses changes in clinical status&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a relatively uncommon type of stroke incidence and impact of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury hemorrhage (aSAH) has been extensively studied; less is (TBI) within&#xD;
      the general population have increased known regarding the epidemiology of posttraumatic&#xD;
      passover the past few years . It accounts for about 1 in 20 (5%) of all strokes. In contrast&#xD;
      to common types of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage often occurs at a relatively young age&#xD;
      half the patients are younger than 60 years. The outcome of patients after subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage is generally poor. One of the causes of poor outcome is due to spasm and lack of&#xD;
      blood supply to brain this occurs four to ten days after the hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium antagonists as nimodipine are a type of drug that block calcium channels in cells and&#xD;
      are often used for the treatment of high blood pressure. They have also been shown to&#xD;
      counteract the narrowing of blood vessels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine is a&#xD;
      dihydropyridine agent that blocks voltage-gated calcium channels and has a dilatory effect on&#xD;
      arterial smooth muscle. It is the only FDA-approved agent for vasospasm with a half-life of&#xD;
      about 9 h . Its beneficial effect on CVS derives most likely from its neuroprotective&#xD;
      properties compared to arterial smooth muscle cell relaxation . The investigators can give&#xD;
      nimodipine in several way as oral or IV and intrathecal .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has an established use in treating patients with disorders&#xD;
      mediated by the sympathetic nervous system in which pain and/or circulatory insufficiency are&#xD;
      predominant symptoms. These disorders include Atypical angina , post-herpetic neuralgia and&#xD;
      complex regional pain syndromes, such as reflex sympathetic dystrophy .In addition, SGB has&#xD;
      also been used, albeit somewhat controversially, in management of traumatic brain edema,&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and complicated cervical migraine. However, the use of cervical sympathetic&#xD;
      block has been described in reversing delayed ischemic neurologic deficit following&#xD;
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cerebral blood vessels, in particular the pia vessels, have a dense non-adrenergic&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve supply that originates mainly in the cervical ganglia and accompanies the&#xD;
      carotid artery to project into the ipsilateral hemisphere. There is controversy over the&#xD;
      physiological significance of sympathetic innervation of the cerebral vasculature and the&#xD;
      effect of SGB on it.The intracerebral vessels constrict in response to cervical sympathetic&#xD;
      stimulation and dilate when these fibers are interrupted. The release and re-uptake of&#xD;
      neurotransmitters, such as bradykinin, which is released during injury, can be prevented by&#xD;
      sympathectomy. A recent report has suggested that cervical sympathetic block may be&#xD;
      beneficial in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and that SGB may have therapeutic value&#xD;
      in relieving cerebral vasospasm in certain neurological conditions. Anecdotal mention of SGB&#xD;
      in some recent literature encourages the debate on its role as an adjunct to standard therapy&#xD;
      for cerebral vasospasm, albeit, with a strong need for further evaluation&#xD;
