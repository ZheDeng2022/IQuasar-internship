      Aim: To investigate the possible immune modulatory effects of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) on&#xD;
      respiratory immunity in patients with allergic asthma (AA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Allergic sensitization to aeroallergens is a common co-morbidity in asthma that&#xD;
      is associated with more frequent and severe asthma attacks. The investigators have recently&#xD;
      shown that patients with allergic asthma also have an increased risk of pneumonia, and hence&#xD;
      allergy in asthma may be associated with a relative respiratory immunodeficiency. However,&#xD;
      the increased risk was obliterated in patients treated with AIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with asthma sensitized to house-dust mite (HDM) is enrolled in a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of HDM-AIT. Patients will be scheduled for&#xD;
      9 visits through 8 months including, randomization to 6 months of treatment with either&#xD;
      HDM-AIT (Acarizax/Odactra) or placebo. Primary interferons (IFN) type I and III will be&#xD;
      investigated in human bronchial epithelial cells as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      such as: Inflammatory cytokines, immunologic phenotype and immunohistochemistry will be&#xD;
      investigated in bronchial biopsies, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum and HDM-patch&#xD;
      biopsies as well as a thorough respiratory and allergic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: The investigators expect that, patients with AA have 1) decreased&#xD;
      production of anti-viral type I and III IFN and that AIT increases these measures. 2)&#xD;
      Anti-bacterial response is reduced through IL12, ß-defensin and IFN-γ and that AIT increases&#xD;
      these measures. 3) Lastly, the investigators expect that T-cell response is dysregulated&#xD;
      (Th1↓1/Th2↑) in patients with AA and that these findings are modulated in an&#xD;
      immuno-protective direction after AIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: This project will expand our understanding of the clinical significance of&#xD;
      allergy in asthma in a completely novel direction and show how AIT may modulate the immune&#xD;
      response to prevent infections.&#xD;

      1.1 Background Respiratory viral infections are the major cause of acute worsening of asthma.&#xD;
      Importantly too, these infections may also predispose to bacterial infections. Patients with&#xD;
      allergic asthma suffer from more frequent lower respiratory tract infections, more severe and&#xD;
      longer lasting lower respiratory tract symptoms compared to healthy controls. Hence, the need&#xD;
      to use antibiotics may reflect in part the increased susceptibility to viral infection in&#xD;
      allergic asthma. The investigators have recently demonstrated that patients with allergic&#xD;
      asthma have an increased risk of being prescribed antibiotics for respiratory infections&#xD;
      compared to non-allergic patients with asthma. Other studies have identified allergic&#xD;
      sensitization and respiratory viral infections as synergetic risk factors in asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations. These findings suggest a possible link between the allergic sensitization,&#xD;
      asthma and an impaired immune response against respiratory infections. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators have found that allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) reduces the risk of being&#xD;
      prescribed antibiotics for respiratory infections in patients with allergic asthma. These&#xD;
      novel observations make it of interest to investigate mechanistic pathways in target cells&#xD;
      subjected to AIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, investigating potential mechanisms involved in the interaction between&#xD;
      allergen and viral infection the investigators found that house dust mite (HDM) impairs viral&#xD;
      stimulus (TLR3)-induced type I and type III interferons in bronchial epithelial cells from&#xD;
      asthmatic patients and similarly in an in vivo mouse model of asthma exacerbation. This novel&#xD;
      finding was accompanied with a direct effect of HDM on reducing TLR3 glycosylation. Hence,&#xD;
      HDM exposure in patients with allergic asthma may also contribute to a defect antiviral&#xD;
      response by interfering with components important for the anti-viral signalling such as TLR3.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators have observed that HDM has a capacity to induce&#xD;
      over-expression of upstream Th2 cytokines such as IL-33, which may contribute to asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations. In our studies HDM stands out amongst different allergens in causing both&#xD;
      release of inflammatory inducing damage-associated metabolic patterns and impaired interferon&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferentially, in this study the investigators will have the unique opportunity to examine&#xD;
      effects of human in vivo HDM-AIT on the bronchial epithelial cell production of type I and&#xD;
      type III interferons as well as the balance between Th1/and Th2 inflammation in response to&#xD;
      viral and bacterial triggers. The investigators speculate that exposure to HDM-allergen may&#xD;
      predispose to asthma exacerbations by causing dysregulation of the anti-viral interferon&#xD;
      system as well as Th1/and Th2 inflammation and then that desensitization of patients with&#xD;
      HDM-sensitive allergic asthma (AA) increases innate interferon response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Viral induced type I and type III IFN is increased in HBECS from patients with allergic&#xD;
           asthma sensitized to HDM, after 24 weeks of Acarizax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Viral induced type I and III IFN response is impaired in HBECs from patients with&#xD;
           allergic asthma sensitized to HDM, before 24 weeks of Acarizax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Investigational Medical Product (IMP): ACARIZAX Acarizax is sublingual allergen&#xD;
      immunotherapy (SLIT) for the treatment of HDM allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic asthma&#xD;
      (AA). Acarizax is composed of standardized allergen extract from the HDMs' Dermatophagoides&#xD;
      pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of Acarizax has been tested in randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials as add-on treatment for the best maintenance treatment for AR and AA. The clinical&#xD;
      effect of Acarizax has been demonstrated 8-14 weeks after initiation of treatment and data on&#xD;
      clinical effect is available for up to 18 months of treatment. Acarizax was found to reduce&#xD;
      time to first exacerbation (hazard-ratio 0.7) in patients with AA. Acarizax has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce daily mean inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) by 81 microgram/day (95% CI:&#xD;
      27-136microgram/day). In AR, Acarizax has been shown to reduce Total Combined Rhinitis Score&#xD;
      (TCRS). A meta-analysis on the efficacy of AIT on atopic dermatitis shows moderate level of&#xD;
      efficacy. Hence, we will be studying the potential change in the immunologic phenotype as an&#xD;
      exploratory outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIT has been known for more than 100 years as a potential curative and specific treatment for&#xD;
      allergic diseases. The mechanism by which AIT works is poorly understood but a key target is&#xD;
      likely modulation of immunopathology. Dysregulation of the immune system is thought to play&#xD;
      an essential role in atopic diseases and is influenced by multiple complex regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms. Well-established immune modulatory effects of AIT are classified into following&#xD;
      type of events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Mechanisms of AIT Order of events Events Change Time to initial change&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basophil- and Mast cell activity and degranulation of IgE mediated histamine release&#xD;
           Decrease Immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Induction of allergen-specific Treg- and Breg cells and suppression of allergen specific&#xD;
           Th1 and Th2 cells Increase Days to weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific IgE Early increase followed by chronic decrease to baseline Weeks to years&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Specific IgG4 Continuously increase throughout treatment duration Weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tissue resident eosinophils, basophils and mast cells and release of their mediators&#xD;
           Decrease Months&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Type 1 skin reactivity decrease Months&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-viral immunity Interferons (IFNs) are essential cytokines in the anti-viral defence.&#xD;
      IFN's are produced by many cell types in the lungs where human bronchial epithelial cells&#xD;
      (HBECs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the main producers. The major effects of&#xD;
      IFNs include blocking of viral invasion into neighbour cells by cleaving viral nucleic acid&#xD;
      and inhibiting viral replication and inducing apoptosis in affected cells. HBECs are critical&#xD;
      for the development of a sufficient innate immune response to viral infection. Increasing&#xD;
      evidence suggest that HBECS from patients with asthma and allergic asthma exhibit an impaired&#xD;
      ability to secrete type I (IFN-beta), and III (IFN-lambda) interferons at viral infection. In&#xD;
      addition, IFN-beta and IFN-lambda may inversely correlate with the level of Type 2&#xD;
      inflammation in the airway epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      pDCs are essential effectors of the primary innate immune defence against viral infections,&#xD;
      releasing large amounts of IFN-alpha, and driving Th1 polarisation of CD4 lymphocytes.&#xD;
      However, pDCs also play an important role as antigen-presenting cells, by which they may&#xD;
      drive a Th2 polarisation, increasing IgE-production in B-cells and potential cross-linking of&#xD;
      FcepsilonR1-alpha receptors. Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that viral&#xD;
      induced IFN-alpha release was diminished by activation of the FcepsilonR1-alpha receptor on&#xD;
      the pDC by allergen exposure, suggesting a potential link between allergy and a reduced viral&#xD;
      defence. In patients with allergic asthma viral induced IFN-alpha release was impaired in&#xD;
      PBMC's indicating a more systemic impact in response to bronchial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIT: Mechanisms leading to suppression of allergic inflammation In general, it is&#xD;
      acknowledged that Th2 / Treg cells tolerance is decisive for the development or suppression&#xD;
      of allergic inflammation. Treg cells secrete high amounts of essential suppressor cytokines&#xD;
      IL-10 and TGF-beta. These cytokines contribute to the control of Th2 mediated allergic&#xD;
      disease in various ways. Treg cells regulates B-cells by inducing a competitive IgG4 and IgA&#xD;
      response resulting in suppression of IgE. Furthermore, Treg cells may suppress activation and&#xD;
      degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. Lastly Treg cells, suppress Th2 cells&#xD;
      homing to tissue and epithelial cell activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
      Breg cells control excessive inflammatory responses through secretion of IL-10, supports&#xD;
      differentiation of Treg cells and induces synthesis of IgG4. These effects may be involved in&#xD;
      response to AIT and correlate with clinical improvement. Thus, AIT may result in a decrease&#xD;
      of bronchial, nasal and conjunctival hyperreactivity, which is a reflection of decrease in&#xD;
      underlying mucosal inflammation. Anti-IgE treatment ameliorates the seasonal variations in&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations associated with virus infections, which may be related to an increase in&#xD;
      the initial interferon response to viral infections. We thus speculate, that the potential&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects of AIT resulting in lowered risk of prescription antibiotics is the&#xD;
      net result of alteration in allergen-induced mucosal Th-2 inflammation, mediated by an&#xD;
      increase in primary IFN defence responses to viral infections.&#xD;

      8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES 8.1 Sample size estimate Sample size calculations have been carried&#xD;
      out using G-Power software (Behaviour Research Methods 2007 Faul et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1.1 Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge there is no preceding studies investigation the relationship between AIT&#xD;
      treatment and change in IFN-response in HBECS. The investigators have previously shown that&#xD;
      treating human airway epithelium in vitro with azithromycin increase the IFN-response to&#xD;
      viral infection mimics in a dose-dependent manner. Fold-change in INF-β was 1.55 (SD 0.555)&#xD;
      at the given concentration. Given a significant change in IFN-β from week 0 to week 24 is set&#xD;
      to be a 1.55-fold change with SD of 0.555, that alpha is set to 0.05, and the power to 0.80,&#xD;
      in a two-sided test design, the calculation would look like this:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean (fold change in INF-β) group 1 (placebo): 1 Mean (fold change in INF-β) group 2&#xD;
      (Acarizax): 1.55 SD: 0.55 16 subjects will be needed in each study arm. Assuming a drop-out&#xD;
      of 20%, a minimum of 40 subjects in total will need to be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Definitions of analysis sets 1) Populations for analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intention-to-treat population: All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of&#xD;
           Acarizax or placebo. A comparison of the treatment groups will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Population for analysis based on adherence ≥ 80% to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Intention-to-treat population: All randomized subjects with adherence ≥ 80% to Acarizax&#xD;
      therapy or placebo. A comparison of the treatment groups will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2.1 Efficacy analysis set Intention-to-treat population (as defined in 8.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2.2 Safety analysis set All patients who receive at least one dose of Acarizax/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3 Methods for statistical analyses All data limited to primary and key secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be analysed using SPSS v. 14 or later. all data are reported as median values with&#xD;
      interquartile ranges and were analysed using non-parametric tests. Data within each group&#xD;
      (Acarizax and placebo) will be analysed using linear mixed model or ANCOVA. Statistical&#xD;
      differences between the Acarizax and placebo groups will be determined using the Mann -&#xD;
      Whitney U test for unrelated samples. Skewed-data will be log-transformed before analysis and&#xD;
      reported using median and 25/75 % percentiles. Parametric data will be analysed using the&#xD;
      above-mentioned methods. Categorial data will be analysed using χ²-test. Statistical&#xD;
      significance is defined as p&lt;0.05. The data from the subject dropping out will still be used&#xD;
      in the analysis using methods for handling of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3.1 Analysis of the primary variable(s) The fold-change in IFN-β and IFN-λ are analysed&#xD;
      before and after RV infection and/or poly(I:C) stimulation from V3 to V12 and will be&#xD;
      compared between intervention and placebo treatment. The investigators expect parametric&#xD;
      distribution of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. deltaIFN-β: IFN-β V12 - IFN-βV3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean fold-change IFN-β: Sum of individual changes / N&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive primary objectives are calculated between intervention and placebo treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in expression of IFN-λ measured in ρg/ml (ELISA) and reported as fold change mean&#xD;
           ± SD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in viral load/TCID50 assay measure reported as fold change mean ± SD&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in IFN-responses will be analysed using same procedure as analysis of the&#xD;
           primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytokines will be analysed accordingly to the method described in 8.3.1 and reported as&#xD;
           ρm/ml (or similar quantitative method) and reported as fold change mean ± SEM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in IFN-β/TSLP ratio and reported in %.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change, expressed as a ratio, in number of airway submucosal, muscle and epithelium&#xD;
           mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, NK-cells, (MCT, MCTC and MCCPA3) per mm2&#xD;
           determined by microscopic evaluation of mucosa biopsies and epithelial brushings from V2&#xD;
           to V7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3.3 Interim analysis No interim analysis is planned.&#xD;
