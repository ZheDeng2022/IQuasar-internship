    <textblock>
      HIV prevalence among men with have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana is at least eight times higher&#xD;
      than that of the general population (2%). MSM in Ghana face high levels of stigma due to HIV&#xD;
      status (actual or perceived), same-sex behavior, and gender non-conformity. These stigmas are&#xD;
      documented barriers to HIV prevention and treatment. In our preliminary work in Ghana&#xD;
      (N=137), one-third of MSM had never been tested for HIV. This study is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and estimate effect size of a&#xD;
      multi-component, multi-level (organizational, interpersonal, and intrapersonal-level)&#xD;
      intersectional stigma-reduction intervention to increase HIV testing frequency among MSM in&#xD;
      Ghana where HIV, same-sex behavior and gender non-conformity are highly stigmatized. To date,&#xD;
      stigma-reduction interventions in Ghana have focused on uni-level targets (e.g., health care&#xD;
      facilities (HCFs)) and addressed one type of stigma (e.g., HIV), without engaging the&#xD;
      intersectional character of the multiple stigmas that MSM encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel multi-component, multi-level&#xD;
           intervention to address intersectional stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to estimate effect size of the intervention for scale up to a definitive efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary endpoint are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MSM: HIV testing, intervention feasibility and acceptability For HCFs: intervention&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSM: Intersectional stigma reduction HCF: Intersectional stigma reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will combine three theory-based interventions that were previously implemented&#xD;
      separately in Ghana for reducing stigma at HCF-level, increasing HIV testing at the peer&#xD;
      group-level, and increasing peer social support at the individual-level. Convergence&#xD;
      Framework will be used for combining interventions. The ADAPT-ITT framework guides our&#xD;
      approach to enhancing the interventions' content on intersectional stigma. To achieve these&#xD;
      aims a systematic adaptation that will be used to refine the individually developed HCF,&#xD;
      peer- and individual-level interventions to produce a comprehensive multi-level&#xD;
      intersectional stigma reduction intervention.&#xD;

      STUDY DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW. Our goal in this study is to determine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and preliminary estimate of effect size of a multi- level intersectional&#xD;
      stigma-reduction intervention on HIV testing among MSM in Ghana. This study has two phases: a&#xD;
      formative phase and a test phase. The eight-step ADAPT-ITT framework will guide our approach&#xD;
      to enhancing the interventions' content to address intersectional stigma and combine the&#xD;
      three separate interventions into one multi- level approach. Aim 1 will encompass steps 1-7,&#xD;
      leading to the combined multi-level intervention adapted to deepen intersectional stigma&#xD;
      content and step 8 in which the study team will conduct a waitlist-controlled RCT of the&#xD;
      adapted intervention for feasibility and acceptability. In Aim 2, data generated in the RCT&#xD;
      will be used to estimate the effect size of the multi-level intervention on HIV testing among&#xD;
      MSM (primary outcome) and intersectional stigma reduction (secondary outcome) among the MSM&#xD;
      and HCF staff. In deciding on the RCT with wait-list control was considered with other&#xD;
      designs such as factorial designs and a classic RCT design with time and attention-matched&#xD;
      controls. It was determined that the RCT with wait-list control was superior to the other&#xD;
      designs because our study is premised on the need for combined interventions. Since it is not&#xD;
      intended yet to seek to isolate which component of the intervention had the greatest effect&#xD;
      on our outcomes, a factorial design was not scientifically justified for our proposed study.&#xD;
      Additionally, ethical and budgetary considerations informed our decision to forgo using a&#xD;
      structurally equivalent control in favor of a wait-list control for the intervention given&#xD;
      the evidence of each interventions' efficacy for reducing stigma among HCF staff and&#xD;
      improving HIV testing among MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FORMATIVE PHASE STEP 1: ASSESS Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs)&#xD;
      will be conducted with MSM and HCF staff to inform the adaptation of the three existing&#xD;
      interventions to deepen intersectional stigma content and their integration with each other&#xD;
      to address intersectional stigma at multiple levels. FGDs were chosen because of their&#xD;
      demonstrated suitability in studies of sexual health and to capitalize on the spontaneous&#xD;
      conversational interaction that occurs in groups. This re-creation of the social dynamic with&#xD;
      the HCF staff and MSM is critical to the understanding of intersectional stigma from the&#xD;
      social organization of these two groups. There are also plans to conduct a limited set of&#xD;
      individual interviews to examine more in-depth, topics that elicit intimate personal accounts&#xD;
      that may not be suitable for sharing in groups. For example, MSM PLHIV are targeted for IDIs&#xD;
      to gain insight into whether and how intersectional stigma experiences influenced their pre-&#xD;
      diagnosis prevention behaviors, access to prevention services, timing of HIV testing and&#xD;
      linkage to care post-diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitatively, the following will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the drivers and manifestations of HIV, same-sex and gender non-conforming stigmas&#xD;
           (intersectional stigma) within HCFs and MSM peer groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. how these intersecting stigmas undermine HIV testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. perspectives on strategies for reducing intersectional stigma within HCFs and among MSM&#xD;
           peer groups. This information will guide to what degree and how these stigmas are&#xD;
           addressed within the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study city (Accra and Kumasi), 2-4 FGDs will take place in each with HCF staff and&#xD;
      MSM, as well as IDIs with HP+ trainers from the pilot phase (n=10) and MSM with HIV (n=8).&#xD;
      The purpose and expectations of involvement in the study will be explained to prospective&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 2: DECIDE Guided by the formative research results, the team will meet to discuss what&#xD;
      specific intervention activities should be modified to address intersectional stigma. An&#xD;
      updated scoping review of research literature to identify innovative evidence-based options&#xD;
      to enhance focus on intersecting stigmas, with special attention to technology and social&#xD;
      media options. This will include a review of the current intervention activities and&#xD;
      discussion of how they can be refined to address intersecting stigmas. In consultation with&#xD;
      our civil society partners, the team will then incorporate these changes into the curriculum,&#xD;
      identify gaps/errors in logic and make corrections in preparation to conduct a workshop of&#xD;
      the intervention with key reference groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 3: ADMINISTER After initial modifications, a facilitated simulation workshop of the&#xD;
      intervention activities with a combined group of HP+ HCF staff (n=4) and client trainers&#xD;
      (n=2) who delivered HP+ in other health facilities in Ghana and MSM (n=8) who received the&#xD;
      original 3MV and HIVE3 interventions will take place. Then, the team will conduct a joint&#xD;
      workshop session because it is consistent with the concept that the intervention must retain&#xD;
      relevance to MSM at all points along the HIV testing pathway, including in the HCF and among&#xD;
      their peer-groups. The next step will be produce a revised combined version of the original&#xD;
      intervention manuals before the workshop and conduct a series of facilitated simulation&#xD;
      exercises with role-play over a 4-day period. Participants will work through each of the&#xD;
      intervention levels, focusing on the intersectional stigma content and reviewing our approach&#xD;
      to linking the different levels and creating opportunities for safe contact between HCF staff&#xD;
      and MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 4: PRODUCE Based on the feedback from the simulation workshop participants and our&#xD;
      observations of their engagement with the activities, the study team will determine what&#xD;
      content and approaches to incorporate into the adapted intervention manual and which content&#xD;
      and processes to edit or forego. In our decision-making process, the study team will give&#xD;
      priority consideration to maintaining components that have the highest consistency with&#xD;
      scientific literature on intersectional stigma, local cultural relevance, and likelihood to&#xD;
      be fun/enjoyable-key requisites for successful intervention uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 5: TOPIC The study team will engage topic experts to review the adapted manual and&#xD;
      provide feedback on its congruence with the original intervention and local sociocultural&#xD;
      relevance. A copy of the adapted, combined multi-level intervention manual will be provided&#xD;
      to the principal investigators of the original separate level interventions. Ghanaian MSM who&#xD;
      lead PORSH and YAHR (our two civil-society organization partners that work with Ghanaian MSM)&#xD;
      will give feedback that is key to the local cultural relevance and intervention&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 6: INTEGRATE In this step, feedback provided by the topic experts will be taken and&#xD;
      summarized in a report that will be distributed to the entire investigative team, including&#xD;
      our key local partners. The feedback will be discussed to develop follow-up clarifying&#xD;
      questions to the topic experts, as necessary, before making final revisions to the&#xD;
      multi-level intervention manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 7: TRAIN The study team will also produce a training manual to standardize training and&#xD;
      permit future replication of the intervention in other settings. This will provide&#xD;
      comprehensive training to study staff whose roles are dedicated to delivering the&#xD;
      intervention. In addition, the development of multi-faceted training will take place to&#xD;
      facilitate comprehension and retention of training concepts, using strategies that Drs.&#xD;
      Nyblade and Nelson has successfully deployed in other HIV prevention research projects. This&#xD;
      will include conducting a joint (including teams from both cities) rehearsal of the protocol&#xD;
      prior to implementation in the RCT with HCF staff and MSM who are not part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES Matched pairing of study facilities: the study will assign four HCFs&#xD;
      in each study city to intervention and control groups by matching the size of HCF facility&#xD;
      staff censure. In every city, the plan is to first stratify four clinics into a pair of two&#xD;
      larger clinics and a pair of two smaller clinics, and then randomly assign one larger and one&#xD;
      smaller clinic to either arm. HCFs will be assigned using a randomization sequence created in&#xD;
      SAS 9.4 with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of four by an independent research&#xD;
      assistant. A separate research assistant will open the sealed envelopes to identify group&#xD;
      assignment immediately after completion of baseline data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment of MSM participants. Consented/eligible MSM will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to intervention versus control arm. A block-randomization approach using a random&#xD;
      numbers generator to assign participants to the study arms will be employed, which ensures&#xD;
      that the number of participants assigned to the intervention arm in each of the two study&#xD;
      cities (or blocks) is approximately equal to the control arm.&#xD;
