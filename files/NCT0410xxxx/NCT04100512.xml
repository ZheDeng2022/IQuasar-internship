  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) therapy on&#xD;
      patients admitted through the trauma service line for rib fractures, as compared to incentive&#xD;
      spirometry (IS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients identified through screening procedures to fit the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      approached, within 48 hours of floor admission, to participate in the study. Once written&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, participants will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, into either&#xD;
      the IS or OPEP study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be instructed on how to use the respiratory therapy device, either IS or&#xD;
      OPEP, by research personnel and respiratory therapists. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      record their compliance with the RT protocol in their respective patient diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Therapy will record FVC three times daily on all study participants until stable&#xD;
      (FVC &gt; 1.5L x 4), then daily for up to 7 days or until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted on day 30 from discharge, and administered a short&#xD;
      questionnaire. All participants will be followed and monitored per standard of care, under&#xD;
      the care and supervision of their treating provider teams.&#xD;

    <description>Aerobika® Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure (OPEP) device is a drug-free, easy to use, hand-held device with a proprietary pressure-oscillation dynamic that provides intermittent resistance and creates positive pressure and oscillations simultaneously. The Aerobika® OPEP device opens weak or collapsed airways to mobilize and assist mucociliary clearance to the upper airways where it can be coughed out.</description>

    <description>An incentive spirometer is a device that measures how deeply you can inhale (breathe in). It helps you take slow, deep breaths to expand and fill your lungs with air. The incentive spirometer is made up of a breathing tube, an air chamber, and an indicator.</description>
