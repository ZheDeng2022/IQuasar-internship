  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to exhaustively document the course and outcomes of&#xD;
      hospitalization, labor, delivery, and early postpartum course of 15,000 mother-newborn pairs&#xD;
      in settings where the occurrence of adverse outcomes is high. The Investigators will gather&#xD;
      detailed laboratory, physiologic, and clinical information, and precisely characterize major&#xD;
      adverse diagnoses and outcomes. The resulting high-quality, granular, and generalizable data&#xD;
      will be used to develop new algorithms to signal actionable intrapartum diagnoses and&#xD;
      prospectively stratify women according to their risk for adverse maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      This is a prospective multi-country cohort study of 15,000 women admitted to the hospital for&#xD;
      delivery or for management of respiratory infection. Women will be recruited and screened for&#xD;
      study participation at the time of presentation to the hospital. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed through hospitalization, labor, delivery, and discharge and at 1- and 6-week&#xD;
      postpartum contacts. Liveborn infants will be enrolled at birth and followed through 42 days&#xD;
      of life. The pilot phase of this protocol will enroll up to 500 women in labor and their&#xD;
      newborns and follow them through labor, delivery, and 42 days postpartum.&#xD;
