      The exposure to acute and\or chronic stress can produce an activation of sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system (SNS), leading to an increased level of cortisol and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The&#xD;
      mind-body techniques (MBT), such as diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness, and Yoga, have&#xD;
      demonstrated their validity in reducing mental stress and relieving inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to verify the efficacy of a single Functional Therapy (FT) session to&#xD;
      relieve inflammations, decreasing cortisol levels and activating the parasympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system in healthy subjects after the administration of an acute stress such as the Trier&#xD;
      Social Stress Test (TSST) protocol. After a psychiatric, psychological and anthropometric&#xD;
      assessment, participants are randomly assigned to FT or attention placebo control group. The&#xD;
      FT session lasting for 30 minutes and is conducted by therapists specialized in the MBT. The&#xD;
      treatment's efficacy in reducing inflammatory states is verified by measuring the variations&#xD;
      of the hearth rate, skin conductance, electromyography, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6,&#xD;
      TNFα, IL1β), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and salivary cortisol; furthermore, the&#xD;
      State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (state and trait) and Subjective Units of Distress Scale&#xD;
      (SUDS) questionnaires are used as psychometric measures of anxiety and stress. All the&#xD;
      participants are tested at baseline, at the end of TSST, at the end of the FT or audiobook&#xD;
      session, and at follow-up 30 minutes after the session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Life's dynamics in modern societies expose the individuals to high level of suffering and&#xD;
      stress, which can affect both psychological and physiological well-being. Numerous scientific&#xD;
      evidences showed the correlation between stress and immunity system dysregulation. The&#xD;
      exposure to acute and\or chronic mental stress conditions can alter the physiological&#xD;
      functions of the organism, through the activation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the&#xD;
      inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The activation of peripheral and&#xD;
      central immune-inflammatory pathways is indicated by increased levels of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, such as Interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumor necrosis factor-α&#xD;
      (TNFα). Furthermore, experiencing high stress levels may lead to a disruption of the&#xD;
      Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, with consequent increasing of cortisol's level,&#xD;
      low-grade systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. These results correlate with the&#xD;
      develop and progression of a wide range of pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, Type II diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. In&#xD;
      addition, inflammation is now considered as a risk factor for most cancers' disease,&#xD;
      promoting pathological mechanism such as proliferation, angiogenesis and metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last 20 years has seen an exponential growth of the mind-body techniques (MBT), an&#xD;
      heterogeneous group of exercises and techniques focusing the life-styles, which has&#xD;
      demonstrated validity in the reduction of psychological stress and inflammatory states. The&#xD;
      techniques adopted by the clinical trials available include Yoga, Mindfulness, Tai Chi Chih,&#xD;
      and Qigong; these protocols last usually from 4 to 12 weeks, and have been applied on&#xD;
      clinical samples ranging on heterogeneous pathological conditions. However, the techniques&#xD;
      used in the majority of these studies are derived from eastern meditative tradition and were&#xD;
      not primarily developed to carrying out anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the data&#xD;
      concerning the effects of a single session of MBT under controlled experimental conditions&#xD;
      are still lacking. In this regard, the Functional Therapy (FT) approach, an integrated&#xD;
      body-mind therapy developed around the knowledges of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), represents&#xD;
      a potentially effective and specific methodology to counteract the physiological and&#xD;
      psychological effects caused by prolonged exposure to stress conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these premises, the aim of this clinical trial is to verify the efficacy of a single&#xD;
      Functional Therapy (FT) session to relieve inflammations, decreasing cortisol levels and&#xD;
      activating the parasympathetic nervous system in healthy subjects after the administration of&#xD;
      an acute stress such as the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited starting in October 2019, via advertisement posted in university&#xD;
      classrooms and premises. Researchers planned to recruit a sample of 40 participants. For the&#xD;
      recruitment a structured telephone screening will help the researchers to investigate on some&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Then a consultation with a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist will&#xD;
      be programmed together with the administration of the psychological tests. Psychological&#xD;
      assessment includes an ad-hoc sociodemographic questionnaire; a shortened version of Wechsler&#xD;
      Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised (WAIS-R); Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III&#xD;
      (MCMI-III); and Stress-related Vulnerability Scale (SVS). All these assessments will take&#xD;
      place in the outpatient clinic of the policlinic &quot;P. Giaccone&quot;, Palermo. After the&#xD;
      assessment, eligible subjects will be randomized in the FT group or in the attention control&#xD;
      group (AC), and will be assigned to the next therapist on a time capacity list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the sessions will be taking place in the Neo-Functional Psychotherapy Centre of Palermo.&#xD;
      During the session, participants will be assessed for anthropometric, psychological,&#xD;
      biofeedback and salivary parameters. Anthropometric parameters include height, weight, and&#xD;
      BMI; Psychological assessment includes the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, in both trait and&#xD;
      state form; and Subjective Unit of Distress Scale. Biofeedback parameters include hearth&#xD;
      rate, skin conductance, and electromyography. Salivary measurements include pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, IL1β), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival, the anthropometric parameters will be assessed, thus biofeedback sensors will&#xD;
      be connected to participants and it will record, for 5 minutes, the physiological parameters&#xD;
      that will constitute the baseline; biofeedback sensors will remain online for the whole&#xD;
      duration of the clinical trial. During this phase the STAI (trait and state) and SUDS&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered, and the first salivary samples will be taken for&#xD;
      cortisol and cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, participants will be submitted to the TSST social stress, a protocol used by&#xD;
      researchers to induce stress under controlled condition. TSST is divided in 5 minutes&#xD;
      components and the whole procedure lasts approximately 15 minutes; at the end, the second&#xD;
      psychological and salivary assessments will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in FT group or AC group. Five different therapists with a&#xD;
      4-year postgraduate training on functional approach will apply the FT session. The treatment&#xD;
      was specifically manualized to reducing stress condition and to relieve inflammatory states.&#xD;
      Specifically, the treatment includes a variety of functional techniques such as diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breathing, and thoracic and abdominal manipulation, designed to stimulate the neurofunctional&#xD;
      interconnection between body, mind and immune system. The FT session will last 30 minutes.&#xD;
      The participants assigned to the AC will listen an audiobook lasting for 30 minutes, which&#xD;
      will be used as attention placebo control activity. At the end of the session, the third&#xD;
      psychological and salivary assessments will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, all the participants will be undergoing to a follow-up phase, designed to assess the&#xD;
      biofeedback and cytokines slow-responses to stress and relaxation procedures. Thus, subjects&#xD;
      will be provided with an additionally 30 minutes session of audiobook listening, used as&#xD;
      attention control placebo. At the end of the session, the fourth psychological and salivary&#xD;
      assessments will be carried out.&#xD;
