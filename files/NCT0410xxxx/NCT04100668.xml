  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to compare Sensifree Alpha sensor signal morphology, measured&#xD;
      at the radial artery, to an invasive arterial line pressure signal and the oxygen saturation&#xD;
      as read by a pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be split into two phases: the first phase will collect data for morphology&#xD;
      analysis and algorithm development, the second phase will compare device performance to the&#xD;
      reference invasive blood pressures. A secondary objective is to evaluate signal morphology&#xD;
      changes due to changes in subject arm position.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, non-randomized study with a maximum of 50 subjects. The&#xD;
      duration of the study for each subject test is expected to take approximately 3 hours: 1 hour&#xD;
      for screening (Visit 1) and 2 hours for data collection (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection, Visit 2, will be divided into two phases. Phase 1 will use up to 20 subjects&#xD;
      with the goal of collecting data for algorithm and sensor development. No requirements for&#xD;
      certain blood pressure populations are required for Phase 1. Once the analysis of the Phase 1&#xD;
      results is complete, Phase 2 will use up to 30 subjects with the following requirements to&#xD;
      test multiple blood pressure populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No more than 25% will be normotensive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 60% of the subjects will be hypertensive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 15% of the subjects will be hypotensive&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1- Screening Screening will be identical for both phases of the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      screened for per the inclusion criteria, assuring the subject will be a good candidate for&#xD;
      the data collection portion of the study. If the subject does not meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      they will not be invited to participate in Visit 2. During screening, the subject's wrist&#xD;
      circumference will be recorded and measured for each arm. The clinician will perform&#xD;
      auscultatory blood pressure measurements on both arms to determine the lateral systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure difference per Procedure 5.2.4.3.1. in the International Standards&#xD;
      Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2013. Using ultrasound, the clinician will also determine if the&#xD;
      subject has any bifurcations in the radial artery of each arm. Finally, the investigation&#xD;
      devices will be place on both wrists of the subject to determine if adequate signal can be&#xD;
      detected. If the subject meets all the inclusion criteria for screening they will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in the data collection portion of the study during Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2- Screening Visit 2, the data collection portion of the study, will begin with the&#xD;
      volunteer test subject lying in the supine position. The subject will be reminded they may&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time. The subject will have the investigational device, ECG&#xD;
      sensors, and a pulse oximetry sensor placed on them for data collection and to monitor their&#xD;
      safety for the duration of the study. An arterial line will be placed in the radial artery,&#xD;
      contralateral to the investigational device, under sterile conditions by a physician. To&#xD;
      begin data collection; 10 minute periods of simultaneous invasive data from the arterial line&#xD;
      and the non-invasive signal from the investigational device will be recorded. Once the supine&#xD;
      recording sessions are complete, the subject will be raised to a seated position and the&#xD;
      pressure transducer will be recalibrated. The subject will then vary both their arm positions&#xD;
      simultaneously from heart level, to above heart level, and to below heart level to record the&#xD;
      changes in pressure due to movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all data has been collected, the radial arterial catheter will be removed by the&#xD;
      physician and constant pressure held on the arterial puncture for a minimum of 10 minutes.&#xD;
      The clinician will review any final questions with the subject, the subject will be provided&#xD;
      with phone numbers for questions pertaining to the participation in this study or&#xD;
      research-related injury or reaction post study. Follow-up with each subject will be conducted&#xD;
      within 5 days following participation in the study and will be conducted via telephone, text,&#xD;
      or email.&#xD;
