      1. Analyzing the effects of severe trauma using sonoclot analyzer (which depicts the entire&#xD;
           hemostatic pathway) ,subsequently describing the convenient therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessing the correlations between sonoclot variables and conventional coagulation and&#xD;
           platelet function tests&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coagulopathy is a physiological response to massive bleeding that frequently occurs after&#xD;
      severe trauma and is an independent predictive factor for mortality[2]. . There are two of&#xD;
      the major causes of coagulopathy in trauma patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. coagulopathy secondary to hemorrhagic shock due to massive bleeding and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. coagulopathy secondary to severe head injury[3] which results in release of tissue&#xD;
           factor from damaged brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is very important to grasp the coagulation status of patients with severe&#xD;
      trauma quickly and accurately with objective indicator in order to establish the therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of viscoelastic devices in understanding the disease condition of patients&#xD;
      with traumatic coagulopathy has been widely recognized in Europe. Viscoelastic hemostatic&#xD;
      assays devices have practical advantages as point-of-care devices for monitoring major&#xD;
      hemorrhage including speed of results and a set of parameters that assesses a global&#xD;
      coagulation profile .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also In the USA, Massive Transfusion in Trauma Guidelines proposed by the American College of&#xD;
      Surgeons in 2013 presented the test results obtained by the viscoelastic devices, as the&#xD;
      standard for transfusion or injection of blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelet concentrate,&#xD;
      or anti-fibrinolytic agents in the treatment strategy for traumatic coagulopathy and&#xD;
      hemorrhagic shock .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, some studies have reported limitations of these viscoelastic devices&#xD;
