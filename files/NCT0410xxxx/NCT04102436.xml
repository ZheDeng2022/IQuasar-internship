      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A person s white blood cells can be modified in a lab to recognize certain changes in their&#xD;
      tumor. Many of these cells are collected from the person, modified, then given back to the&#xD;
      person. This may help treat some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if a person s white blood cells modified with T-cell receptors can cause solid&#xD;
      tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-70 who have cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, ovary,&#xD;
      breast, or lung that has spread, or who have glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened and have their cells prepared for treatment in another&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be hospitalized one week before treatment. They will stay approximately 3 -&#xD;
      4 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the modified white blood cells and chemotherapy through an IV catheter,&#xD;
      which is a small plastic tube inserted in a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take drugs by mouth to prevent infection. They will receive filgrastim as a&#xD;
      shot or injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tests before, during, and after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart, blood, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans: They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible apheresis: The participant s blood is removed through a needle in an arm. The blood&#xD;
      goes through a machine that removes the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned&#xD;
      through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits about 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. If they are responding to&#xD;
      treatment, they will then have visits every 3-6 months for 3 years. Then they will join&#xD;
      another study and be followed about 12 more years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The administration of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate&#xD;
           complete, durable regressions in 20-25% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Recent&#xD;
           studies have shown that these TIL predominantly recognize unique mutated neoantigens&#xD;
           expressed by the cancer not shared by other melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of bulk autologous TIL to patients with a variety of other solid cancers,&#xD;
           including cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, have little if&#xD;
           any therapeutic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent studies in the Surgery Branch, NCI, have shown that TIL from non-melanoma solid&#xD;
           cancers can also contain T-cells reactive against non-shared unique mutated neoantigens&#xD;
           expressed in the cancer. The frequency of these T-cells is very low (often &lt; 0.1%) and&#xD;
           it is thus difficult to isolate and grow mutation reactive T-cells to levels required&#xD;
           for effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In several patients with chemo-refractory metastatic epithelial cancers, we were able to&#xD;
           grow an enriched population of neoantigen reactive TIL and administration of these cells&#xD;
           mediated several partial regressions of metastatic disease and one complete regression&#xD;
           of all metastatic breast cancer now lasting more than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have now developed approaches to identify these rare neoantigen reactive T-cells from&#xD;
           common non-melanoma cancers, to isolate their T-cell receptors (TCR), and to genetically&#xD;
           engineer autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using the Sleeping Beauty system&#xD;
           to express these TCRs with high efficiency. The neoantigen TCR gene- modified cells can&#xD;
           recognize and destroy the autologous cancer in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We are now proposing a clinical protocol to treat patients with refractory solid cancers&#xD;
           using the adoptive transfer of autologous PBL transposed with genes encoding TCRs that&#xD;
           recognize unique mutated neoantigens expressed by the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the rate of objective response (using RECIST v1.1 criteria) of patients with&#xD;
      solid cancers who receive autologous PBL that have been genetically modified with genes&#xD;
      encoding TCRs that recognize mutated neoantigens in the autologous cancer using the Sleeping&#xD;
      Beauty system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years&#xD;
      must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable solid cancer with at least one lesion that is resectable for TIL generation&#xD;
           with minimal morbidity plus at least one other lesion that can be measured that falls&#xD;
           into one of four cohorts: (1) gastrointestinal and genitourinary, (2) breast and&#xD;
           ovarian, (3) non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and (4) glioblastoma. Metastatic&#xD;
           disease is required for Cohorts 1-3 but not for Cohort 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluable solid cancer that has recurred following standard chemotherapy or standard&#xD;
           erapy OR therapy has been declined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous&#xD;
           TIL cultures. Patients will be entered into four cohorts that include (1)&#xD;
           gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract cancers, (2) breast and ovarian cancers, (3)&#xD;
           non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and (4) glioblastomas. Exome sequencing and often&#xD;
           RNA Seq will be performed to identify the mutations expressed in the patient s cancer.&#xD;
           Multiple autologous TIL cultures will be grown and tested for reactivity against&#xD;
           mutations from the autologous tumor using assays we have developed that involve the&#xD;
           exposure of autologous antigen presenting cells to long peptides containing the mutation&#xD;
           or tandem mini genes encoding the mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cell cultures with reactivity against mutations will be identified and the individual&#xD;
           TCRs that recognize the mutation will be synthesized and used to transfect the TCR into&#xD;
           patient s autologous PBL using the Sleeping Beauty system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transposed autologous PBL will then be expanded to large numbers using our standard&#xD;
           rapid expansion protocol and administered to the patient following a non-myeloablative&#xD;
           lymphodepleting regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen of&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Patients will then receive the infusion of autologous&#xD;
           transposed PBL and begin high-dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to&#xD;
           10 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated approximately 4-6 weeks after cell&#xD;
           infusion and periodically thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that approximately one patient per month will enroll into the trial&#xD;
           for each of the four histologic groups. Thus, accrual of up to 4 x 50=200 total&#xD;
           evaluable patients may be completed in approximately 2-4 years. In order to allow for a&#xD;
           small number of inevaluable patients the accrual ceiling will be set to 210.&#xD;

                  to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Seronegative for active hepatitis B, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.&#xD;
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be co-enrolled on protocol 03-C-0277.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study treatment s potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with study therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent systemic steroid therapy, except for patients with glioblastoma (Cohort 4).&#xD;

             six months that were not related to glioma surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: History of prior intratumoral bleeding is not an exclusion criterion; however,&#xD;
        patients with a history of prior intratumoral bleeding will need to undergo a non- contrast&#xD;
        head CT to exclude acute bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
