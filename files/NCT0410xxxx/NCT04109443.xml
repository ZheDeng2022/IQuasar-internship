  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM) continue to account for a disproportionate number of&#xD;
      HIV infections in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly&#xD;
      affected. Increased HIV rates reflect sexual risk behaviors during early sexual experiences.&#xD;
      Research suggests that initial sexual risk-taking occurs during adolescence among sexual&#xD;
      minority males. Therefore, it is important for HIV prevention interventions to target&#xD;
      adolescent sexual minority males. Targeting sexual minority males during adolescence will&#xD;
      help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors early in their psychosexual&#xD;
      development, which will have both immediate and long-term health benefits.To promote&#xD;
      adolescent sexual minority males' critical examination of online media and decrease their&#xD;
      sexual risk-taking, this study proposes an exploratory clinical trial to pilot test an online&#xD;
      sexual health media literacy intervention that was developed during formative research for&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability. Overall, the proposed research has the potential to reach a&#xD;
      wide audience of sexual minority males early in their sexual development, ultimately&#xD;
      decreasing their sexual risk-taking and reducing the number of new HIV infections in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <measure>Study Feasibility Based on the Overall Recruitment Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The overall recruitment rate will be calculated by dividing the total number of participants enrolled (n=154) by the total number of eligible potential participants from the initial online screener (n=422).</description>

A mean of all ratings will be calculated. The closer the mean is to 5.0, the higher the satisfaction with the content areas. Participants will also be given the option of providing written feedback on each piece of content as well.</description>

        <population>Data collection for this project concurred with the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Although sexual behavior data were collected, our data indicates that at baseline the COVID-19 pandemic had already substantially reduced participants sexual contacts because most participants were no longer seeking out or interacting with sexual partners in-person. Thus, the validity and meaningfulness of these data are unclear.</population>

        <title>Knowledge of HIV and STI Transmission and Prevention</title>
        <description>A 52-item sexual health knowledge scale will be used to assess HIV/STI knowledge. The scale presents self-reported assessment of True/False statements about HIV and STI transmission and prevention. Each item will be scored as 0-1 (0=incorrect; 1=correct), yielding a total score of 0-52 with higher scores indicating higher levels of HIV/STI knowledge.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Data collection for this project concurred with the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. As such, it is possible that some of the outcomes changed independent of the intervention. Additionally, the SEOM measures (outcomes 10 and 11) were developed for this study and appear to have some potential issues with internal reliability. As such, they should be interpreted with caution.</limitations_and_caveats>
