  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observational study to investigate how the microbiome correlates with efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal microbiome of a healthy individual is comprised of many hundreds of&#xD;
      bacteria species and thousands of bacteria strains. The composition of bacteria in an&#xD;
      individual's microbiome can change over time and this can be influenced by factors including&#xD;
      diet, drugs, genetics and infection. These bacteria play a central role in digestion of food,&#xD;
      development and regulation of our immune system as well as our resistance to pathogens.&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggest that a patient's intestinal microbiota composition plays a critical,&#xD;
      though as yet poorly defined, role in determining both therapeutic efficacy and likelihood of&#xD;
      significant adverse events to T-cell checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionising treatment of many types of metastatic&#xD;
      cancer, including melanoma, renal and non-small cell lung cancer, in the expectation of&#xD;
      improving patient overall survival. However, they have limitations as they do not work for&#xD;
      all patients and can cause unpredictable, complex immune-related toxicities. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform a detailed study of cancer patients receiving checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors. Saliva and a series of stool samples will be collected from each patient to&#xD;
      analyse their microbiome and will be linked to treatment response, by examining blood samples&#xD;
      and - if available - tumour and organ samples. The investigators hope this work will enable&#xD;
      personalisation of patient immunotherapies based on microbiome biomarkers, as well as&#xD;
      precisely manipulate a patient's microbiota to optimise their immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison with a limited cohort of healthy household members (up to 360 volunteers) acting&#xD;
      as controls will provide additional essential information about the role of the&#xD;
      patient-specific microbiome.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Household controls must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOT have had any gastrointestinal infections i.e., parasites, viruses or diarrhoeal&#xD;
