      DURANCE is a two part, phase Ib/II, multi-centre study to assess the safety and activity of&#xD;
      S-488210/S-488211 in combination with durvalumab, in patients with non-muscle invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer (NMIBC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DURANCE is a registered, phase Ib/II study in patients with surgically debulked bacillus&#xD;
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) unresponsive (resistant or relapsing) or intolerant non-muscle invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer (NIMBC). Patients will receive up to 24 weeks of durvalumab (a PD-L1 immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor) in combination with S-488210/S-488211 (a 5-peptide cancer vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab will be given as 1500 mg IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to 7 doses, in&#xD;
      combination with S-488210/S-S488211 which will be administered as two subcutaneous injections&#xD;
      of S-488210/Montanide and S-488211/Montanide starting the day after the first durvalumab&#xD;
      dose, then weekly for 6 doses and every 2 weeks for a further 9 doses (up to a maximum of 16&#xD;
      doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must have a cystoscopy at the end of week 12 (from start of trial treatment) for&#xD;
      disease evaluation and to assess suitability to continue trial treatment. Patients with&#xD;
      complete response, as shown from the cystoscopy, may continue treatment for up to 24 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent; all other&#xD;
      patient will be withdrawn from further trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase Ib part of the DURANCE study will look to assess the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      treatment combination of durvalumab + S-488210/S-488211 by reviewing Dose Limiting Toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs) which have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to the trial treatments&#xD;
      (durvalumab and/or S-488210/S-488211). Up to 14 evaluable patients will be registered into&#xD;
      phase Ib and provided the DLTs do not exceed the DLT thresholds defined in the trial&#xD;
      protocol, the trial will proceed to the expansion phase of the study (phase 2). In phase 2&#xD;
      the trial will look to assess the disease free survival rate at 1 year following start of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
