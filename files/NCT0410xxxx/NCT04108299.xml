  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      family-oriented SMS intervention in 30 Chinese Americans with T2D and their family members.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of 2 arms (n=15 each): 1) wait-list control and 2) SMS&#xD;
      intervention. Both groups will continue to receive standard of care treatment for their T2D.&#xD;
      The SMS group will receive brief lifestyle counseling videos via SMS links. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, the wait-list control group will be provided the opportunity to receive the counseling&#xD;
      videos.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chinese Americans are one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the US, who suffer&#xD;
      disproportionately high type 2 diabetes (T2D) burden and have poorly controlled T2D. Given&#xD;
      the high economic and societal burden of T2D and rapid population growth in Chinese&#xD;
      Americans, there is an urgent need for research to develop effective interventions to address&#xD;
      T2D burden in this population. Recent evidence suggests the importance of involving and&#xD;
      empowering family members in diabetes intervention and calls for family intervention. A&#xD;
      mobile health approach such as short message service (SMS) might be a promising way to&#xD;
      deliver such family-oriented interventions to the target population given prior studies&#xD;
      suggests that Chinese Americans often report challenges to attend in-person lifestyle&#xD;
      counseling because of long working hours and lack of sick time from work. A SMS-based&#xD;
      intervention provides the flexibility of allowing them to view the intervention at a time and&#xD;
      place convenient to them. This study will serve as the first step to explore an alternative&#xD;
      approach for managing T2D in this group.&#xD;

    <description>2-3 SMS-based diabetes videos will be sent to patients each week for 12 weeks (each video within 10 minutes in duration) to both patients and their family members. Patients and their family members will receive the same intervention videos, including basic information about T2D, importance of diabetes self-management at home, behavioral techniques, and family-oriented sessions. BrainShark will be used to determine whether participants view these,videos. For participants who miss 3 consecutive videos, the study team will follow-up with a phone call to identify barriers to watching the video and remind them to review the video.</description>
