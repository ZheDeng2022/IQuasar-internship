  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of administrating&#xD;
      alternative substrates to intensive care unit (ICU) patients. This includes reconstituting&#xD;
      and administering a modular ketone-inducing (ketogenic) enteral feeding regimen to ICU&#xD;
      patients; to show that this feed does increase blood ketones; and that it is feasible to&#xD;
      collect the desired outcomes. This will allow us to determine in a subsequent randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial whether this intervention improves ICU outcomes (including ICU-related&#xD;
      muscle loss).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive muscle wasting occurs early in critical illness, and is associated with a greater&#xD;
      number of days on a ventilator, increased length of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or hospital&#xD;
      stay, and subsequent functional impairment which may last years. Hospital care costs, and&#xD;
      ongoing costs of community-based primary healthcare utilisation, are increased. No known&#xD;
      interventions prevent this wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioenergetic failure in critical illness and the potential for alternative substrate use:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle protein synthesis is highly energy-dependent.The bioenergetic state of the&#xD;
      critically-ill patient is compromised leading to decreased Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP)&#xD;
      synthesis. Alterations in mitochondrial function have been described repeatedly in the&#xD;
      literature which, with other altered cellular processes, impair the utlilisation of metabolic&#xD;
      substrates for ATP production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbohydrate utilisation is impaired in critical illness, partly through impaired&#xD;
      nuclear-to-membrane translocation of glucose transporter-4 and increased insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Hypoxia signalling and inflammation block activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase by upregulation&#xD;
      of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, increasing glucose availability thus driving pyruvate&#xD;
      metabolism to lactate - the Pasteur effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's recently published data suggest that critical illness also impairs&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in skeletal muscle, and that the majority of lipids&#xD;
      delivered in feed are not utilized for ATP production. This may be of clinical importance,&#xD;
      given that lipids contribute 29-43% of the energy content of enteral, and 50% of parenteral,&#xD;
      formulae. Lastly, oxidation of amino acids may produce ATP. However, this is not necessarily&#xD;
      in the best interest of the patient: these amino acids are then no longer available for&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis. Further, most amino acid oxidation results in pyruvate production&#xD;
      and therefore the same issues as those related to carbohydrate metabolism apply. Provision of&#xD;
      a new metabolic substrate such as Ketone Bodies (KBs) may address these limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential for Muscle Sparing Offered by Ketone Bodies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During periods of starvation they may provide up to 50% of total body basal energy, enabling&#xD;
      the high energy requirement of human brain to be met whilst sparing muscle. Additionally KBs&#xD;
      may act as metabolic modulators, improving mitochondrial efficiency (also impaired by&#xD;
      critical illness), and reducing reactive oxygen species and free radical formation. They also&#xD;
      have anti-inflammatory effects (intramuscular inflammation is a driver of altered protein&#xD;
      homeostasis, and anti-apoptotic activity. Together, these additional mechanistic effects may&#xD;
      prove useful in ameliorating skeletal muscle wasting. Further, pilot data demonstrate a&#xD;
      significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in&#xD;
      early critical illness, consistent with increased KB uptake and utilisation early in critical&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketone bodies have diverse extra-mitochondrial metabolic effects. These include immune&#xD;
      enhancement functions: specifically, to bacterial infection. Infection and inflammation are&#xD;
      drivers of muscle wasting and amelioration of these may impact on this and other outcome&#xD;
      measures. Thus, the critically ill patient may benefit from a ketogenic diet which have been&#xD;
      used safely in other population groups, including healthy subjects the obese, and in patients&#xD;
      with trauma, epilepsy, cardiovascular disease, Type-2 diabetes and Metabolic Diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives/aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Show that it is possible to recruit patients to receive a ketogenic feed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Show that it is possible for researchers to reconstitute the modular ketogenic feed on&#xD;
           ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Show that it is possible to administer ketogenic feed to ICU patients without ill&#xD;
           effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Characterise the time-course of ketone generation (and related changes in related&#xD;
           metabolic pathways) in response to the ketogenic feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Show that collection of outcome measures relevant for the subsequent substantive study&#xD;
           will be feasible.&#xD;
