  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Singers are over-represented in phoniatric consultations; they present increased risk of&#xD;
      developing voice disorders. The most common lesion found in singers is nodule. It comes from&#xD;
      vocal straining characterized by the use of a pressed phonation mode, resulting in an&#xD;
      increase subglottal pressure and a decrease flow rate. Voice therapy aims to restore a more&#xD;
      relaxed phonation. There is a growing interest in semi-occluded vocal tract exercises with a&#xD;
      straw in therapy; they have positive effects, particularly in terms of aerodynamic parameters&#xD;
      such as subglottal pressure and oral airflow. After these exercises, subglottal pressure&#xD;
      decreases and oral airflow increases. In other words, patient adopts a more relaxed phonation&#xD;
      mode. Several studies have investigated the effect of these straw exercises on dysphonic&#xD;
      patients i.e. on speaking voice; no study to date has explored the effect of these exercises&#xD;
      on dysodic subjects i.e. on singing voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of straw exercises compared to open-mouth&#xD;
      exercises on aerodynamic parameters in dysodic women singers with nodules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Singers are over-represented in phoniatric consultations; they present increased risk of&#xD;
      developing voice disorders whether they are amateurs or professionals. They represent a&#xD;
      specific population among phoniatric patients because of their increased sensitivity to the&#xD;
      slightest vocal change that makes them consult earlier than non-singers. In addition, their&#xD;
      complaints are specific to singing voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phoniatrics, at the CHU Gui de Chauliac in Montpellier, singers (amateurs and&#xD;
      professionals) represent one third of phoniatric patients. 80% of them are diagnosed with&#xD;
      dysodia. Dysodia refers to singing voice disorders, in the same way as dysphonia refers to&#xD;
      speaking voice disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysodia results in a variety of symptoms. Acoustic signs are the most numerous: tonal&#xD;
      anomalies (lack of accuracy, reduction of vocal range); dynamic anomalies (problem to sing&#xD;
      softly or loudly); timbre abnormalities (vibrato problems, strained voice , roughness,&#xD;
      difficulties on attacks). Dysodia also results in respiratory disorders, physical signs,&#xD;
      psychological consequences and damage to hedonistic properties (loss of comfort, vocal&#xD;
      endurance, musicality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can reach amateur or professional singers. For professional singers, voice is the main&#xD;
      working tool. When they have dysodia, professional difficulties can be temporary or even lead&#xD;
      to the loss of work. In addition, dysodia can lead to financial loss and well-documented&#xD;
      anxiety. For amateur singers, dysodia hinders their musical practice, thus limiting the&#xD;
      recognized benefits of choral singing on cohesion, social integration and personal&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of dysodia is higher among women. This vocal disorder is most often associated&#xD;
      with laryngeal pathology. Nodular lesions are most common in singers as in general&#xD;
      population. Nodules are the consequence of vocal straining, also known as vocal&#xD;
      hyperfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Singing means learning, more or less finely, depending on the level of training and singing&#xD;
      style, coordination between breath, vocal fold vibrations and resonators, the so-called&#xD;
      pneumo-phono-resonant adaptations. To have balanced phonation, singer must properly dose the&#xD;
      air pressure he applies under his vocal folds, have a sufficient flow rate and adapt muscular&#xD;
      tension of the vocal folds (neither too strain nor too loose). In this mode of phonation,&#xD;
      voice resonates without difficulty. On the other hand, during vocal straining, singer will&#xD;
      put too much subglottal pressure decreasing flow rate, which creates a laryngeal tightening&#xD;
      and can eventually cause nodules. The pressure threshold required to initiate a sound&#xD;
      (phonation pressure threshold) is then increased. Vocal gesture is therefore inappropriate&#xD;
      and the voice becomes ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After diagnosis of dysodia and vocal assessment to identify the patient's difficulties, the&#xD;
      patient is referred to speech-language pathologist for voice therapy. According to the vocal&#xD;
      difficulties identified, speech therapist defines the therapeutic objectives that will be&#xD;
      adapted to each patient and individualized according to the diagnosis, the singer's profile,&#xD;
      but also his objectives and his investment. Voice therapy aims not only to prevent the onset&#xD;
      or aggravation of vocal disturbances but also to remove or compensate for voice limitations&#xD;
      by reconditioning vocal gesture to make it more effective. In the case of nodular lesions,&#xD;
      voice therapy therefore aims to reduce vocal straining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no specific therapeutic tool for singers. As in speaking voice, speech-language&#xD;
      pathologist uses technical aids as well as indirect and direct therapies. The main technical&#xD;
      aid proposed is amplification of voice with a microphone in the event of vocal misuse or&#xD;
      abuse, i.e. when the vocal load is too high. Indirect therapy consists of giving vocal&#xD;
      hygiene advice, in order to eliminate causes of voice disorder and to establish a vocal&#xD;
      economy program with the patient. On the other hand, direct therapy consists in directly&#xD;
      modifying vocal gesture through vocal exercises. This therapy is based on the premise that&#xD;
      the subject has acquired an inappropriate vocal gesture that the therapist identifies and&#xD;
      corrects through vocal exercices. Direct therapy is based on three successive steps: i)&#xD;
      rehabilitation of respiratory gesture, ii) work on a vocal emission without associated&#xD;
      tension, so as to eventually reduce laryngeal lesions, and iii) awareness of the role of&#xD;
      resonance cavities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning work of vocal emission, to reduce vocal straining, many therapies are based on&#xD;
      semi-occluded vocal tract exercises, also called physiological exercises. They include labial&#xD;
      and lingual trills (lip and tongue vibration), nasal consonants, voiced fricative consonants,&#xD;
      kazoo as well as tubes or straws. Straw exercises are the most reproducible due to the&#xD;
      precise calibration of occlusion. Montpellier University Hospital is the national leader in&#xD;
      the development of these straw exercises in France, with a particular focus on flow control&#xD;
      during the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of these exercises is to teach the patient to use proper air pressure and flow&#xD;
      while singing. Several studies are investigating effects of these straw exercises on&#xD;
      aerodynamic parameters of subglottal pressure, phonation pressure threshold and oral airflow.&#xD;
      It appears that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  straw exercises reduce estimated subglottal pressure. For non-singers, this is true&#xD;
           after 15 minutes of exercises as well as after 8 rehabilitation sessions. For singers,&#xD;
           results are more variable and concern only singers without voice disorders. No studies&#xD;
           have explored effect of straw exercises on estimated subglottal pressure in dysodic&#xD;
           singers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  straw exercises lower phonation threshold pressure (PTP). Most studies find a decrease&#xD;
           in PTP after straw exercises, either in non-singer patients with speaking voice&#xD;
           disorders or in choristers without voice disorders. No studies have explored effect of&#xD;
           straw exercises on PTP in dysodic singers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Literature does not provide information on impact of straw exercises on oral airflow. In&#xD;
           euphonic subjects (without vocal disorder), whether singers or not, majority of studies&#xD;
           find an increase in airflow after straw exercises. Only one study found no difference in&#xD;
           airflow after straw exercises, while airflow increased after vocal exercises without&#xD;
           straw (vocalized). In dysphonic patients, no difference in flow rate is observed after&#xD;
           straw exercises. No studies have explored effect of straw exercises on airflow in&#xD;
           dysodic singers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, no study to date has explored effect of straw exercises on aerodynamic parameters&#xD;
      (estimated subglottal pressure, PTP, oral airflow) in dysodic singers. Singers are often&#xD;
      targeted as a study population because of their familiarity with semi-occluded exercises but&#xD;
      not to further explore singing voice. For example, in a study only one frequency is tested&#xD;
      (pitch and comfortable intensity), so singing voice is not further explored. However, the&#xD;
      economic and psychological impact of dysodia, particularly among professionals, is well&#xD;
      described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigator want to fill this gap by studying the singing voice effect&#xD;
      of straw exercises on the estimated subglottal pressure, PTP and oral airflow in dysodic&#xD;
      women singers. Do straw vocal exercises modify aerodynamic behaviour of dysodic women singers&#xD;
      with nodules after a rehabilitation session? Based on results of literature for speaking and&#xD;
      singing non-pathological voice, the investigator hypothesize that the estimated subglottal&#xD;
      pressure and PTP will decrease after straw exercise session while they will remain constant&#xD;
      after open mouth exercise session. Meanwhile, the investigator hypothesize that oral airflow&#xD;
      will increase following straw exercises while it will remain constant after open-mouth&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
