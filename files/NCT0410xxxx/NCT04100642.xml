  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study in health volunteers. The purpose is the local tolerability&#xD;
      and systemic safety of Hemay808, which is an ointment made of a novel small molecule&#xD;
      Hemay028. The safety and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of Hemay028 will be evaluated&#xD;
      following topical application of Hemay808 to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two pre-test groups. Group1 use Hemay808 and placebo on sensitive areas. Group2&#xD;
      will only topical use Hemay808 on 5%BSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 pre-test group, 4 formal testing groups will start. 1% Hemay808 apply to 25%BSA; 3%&#xD;
      Hemay808 apply to 25%BSA; 3% Hemay808 apply to 55%BSA; 7% Hemay808 apply to 25%BSA. First a&#xD;
      single doses then wash-out for three days, after that subjects will applicant twice daily for&#xD;
      7 days to assess the local skin tolerability, and systemic PK of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 42 healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled in this study with 8- 10&#xD;
      volunteers each cohort.&#xD;
