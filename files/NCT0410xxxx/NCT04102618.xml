  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if pelareorep in combination with different&#xD;
      therapies helps to reduce the growth of breast cancer cells and increase the immune system's&#xD;
      response to cancer. This study will also help to understand what this treatment does to the&#xD;
      tumor. In addition, the safety of the combination treatments with pelareorep will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a window of opportunity non-randomized exploratory study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      anti-tumor immunogenicity of pelareorep -/+ atezolizumab in five different cohorts in women&#xD;
      with operable early breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, pelareorep will be administered at 4.5 × 1010 TCID50 intravenously on days&#xD;
      1, 2, 8 &amp; 9. Other therapies will be administered according to the assigned treatment cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial biopsy (diagnostic biopsy in most cases), a second biopsy will be performed&#xD;
      on Day 3. Patients will continue the planned treatment until day 21(±5), when a third biopsy&#xD;
      will be performed. This third biopsy can be the surgical specimen if patient was scheduled&#xD;
      for primary surgery, or a core biopsy if patient will undergo neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected throughout the study at three time points, Day 1, Day 3, and&#xD;
      End of Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment for 3 weeks prior to surgery or neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients will either be considered for definitive surgery or primary medical&#xD;
      treatment (e.g. neoadjuvant chemotherapy) at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
      Surgery or biopsy prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be done within 3 weeks (±5 days)&#xD;
      from the start of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of study visit will be performed at the day of surgery. A safety follow-up, the end&#xD;
      of study visit, will be done at 28 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of treatment received&#xD;

    <measure>Changes from baseline in a score for tumor cellularity and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (CelTIL score) in women with operable early breast cancer treated with pelareorep in combination with different therapies.</measure>
    <time_frame>The CelTIL score will be measured from on-treatment tumor biopsies collected at baseline (pre-treatment), day 3, and at time of surgery (day ~21 ± 5 days).</time_frame>
    <description>CelTIL score is a metric for quantifying broad changes to the tumor microenvironment and is calculated by the following equation:&#xD;
CelTIL score = -0.8 × tumor cellularity (in percent) + 1.3 × TILs (in percent). The minimum and maximum unscaled CelTIL scores will be -80 and 130. This unscaled CelTIL score will then be scaled to reflect the reported values ranging from 0 to 100 points where an increase in CelTIL scores represent favorable changes to the tumor microenvironment.</description>
