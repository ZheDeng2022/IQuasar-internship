  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Merus is providing single patient/named access to the HER2/HER3 bispecific antibody,&#xD;
      MCLA-128, to patients with advanced NRG1-fusion positive solid tumor under this early access&#xD;
      program who are ineligible for an ongoing MCLA-128 clinical trial or have other&#xD;
      considerations that prevent access to MCLA-128 through an existing clinical trial.&#xD;
      Participating sites will be added as they apply for and are approved for the EAP. A medical&#xD;
      doctor must decide whether the potential benefit outweighs the risk of receiving an&#xD;
      investigational therapy based on the individual's medical history and program eligibility&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
