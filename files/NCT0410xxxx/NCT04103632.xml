      The purpose of this study is to validate the screening protocol to study risk factors of&#xD;
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) obtained in our previous study in high-school&#xD;
      elite athletes (NCT03587675), in recreational young athletes who perform intense physical&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Physical exercise, though absolutely beneficial for human well-being, is a&#xD;
      well-known trigger to induce bronchoconstriction. Exercise can provoke bronchoconstriction in&#xD;
      subjects with pre-existing asthma but can also induce bronchoconstriction in otherwise&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The latter phenomenon is called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).&#xD;
      EIB is frequent in the general population and might affect between 5 and 10% of them,&#xD;
      although population based reports are scarce. EIB is most prevalent in individuals performing&#xD;
      endurance sport disciplines, such as long distance running, duathlon and triathlon, cycling&#xD;
      and cross-country skiing. Due to frequent intense physical training, its incidence is higher&#xD;
      in elite athletes compared to non-elite athletes. Its prevalence in elite athletes within&#xD;
      these endurance sport disciplines is estimated to be up to 13%. The percentage in aquatic&#xD;
      endurance sports was surprisingly even higher and reached 20% in the Olympic games of 2008.&#xD;
      Besides intense physical training, environmental factors such as chlorine or cold air&#xD;
      exposure are therefore also linked to the appearance of EIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains very difficult to screen all athletes yearly for EIB. Therefore, the goal of this&#xD;
      study is to define risk factors and/or biomarkers that might predict EIB, already at the&#xD;
      start of their sport career. This would allow physicians to follow their lung function&#xD;
      parameters very closely and regularly; and, if necessary, start treatment early after the&#xD;
      first signs of EIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators already found that atopic individuals in a young cohort of elite athletes&#xD;
      (12-13y) had increased risk to test positive for EIB (Fisher exact test p=0.04). However, due&#xD;
      to the high number of subjects with a positive EIB test but negative Atopy/AQUA&#xD;
      questionnaire, the AQUA questionnaire by itself can't be used to predict EIB (p=0.4).&#xD;
      However, one out of five questions added by our group to this questionnaire (&quot;Do the&#xD;
      participant suffer from wheeze during exercise?&quot;) by itself predicted EIB with 93%&#xD;
      specificity and 24% sensitivity. Adding a second question to this (&quot;Has a doctor ever&#xD;
      diagnosed the participant with an allergic condition?&quot;) increased the specificity to predict&#xD;
      a positive EIB test to 99% but lowered sensitivity to 15% only (Jonckheere AC, J Allergy Clin&#xD;
      Immunol, 2019). Based on the preliminary data of the slightly older cohort of also elite&#xD;
      athletes (13-18 y), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels (cut off 16 ppb) may be a&#xD;
      useful indicator of atopic phenotypes among young elite athletes. Whether atopy is a risk&#xD;
      factor for EIB in recreational young athletes who perform intense physical exercise has to be&#xD;
      further studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the findings in the cohort of elite athletes&#xD;
      will be similar in the cohort of recreational athletes, performing at least 12 hours of sport&#xD;
      a week. This means that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They hypothesize that questionnaires (including AQUA questionnaire) can be used to&#xD;
           screen for EIB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They hypothesize that atopy will be a risk factor for EIB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They hypothesize that increased FeNO levels will be a risk factor for EIB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They hypothesize that adding blood based biomarkers increase the predictive value of the&#xD;
           screening protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: Therefore the aim of the study is to validate the screening protocol and&#xD;
      diagnostic EIB test in a powered (n=500) group of recreational adolescent athletes who&#xD;
      perform their sports at least 12h/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method: 500 recreational athletes who perform at least 12 hours of sports a week&#xD;
      will be recruited amongst different youth sport branches including indoor sports, outdoor&#xD;
      sports, swimming and even winter sports. Subjects will be contacted in collaboration with&#xD;
      their local sport doctors. Subjects from East-and West Flanders will be studied at AZ Maria&#xD;
      Middelares in Ghent by dr J Leus, subjects from Limburg will be studied at the Jessa Hospital&#xD;
      in Hasselt and subjects from Antwerp and Flemish-Brabant will be studied in Leuven, UZ&#xD;
      Gasthuisberg in close collaboration with prof L Dupont, copromotor of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements at the visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function will be assessed by spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires, including the AQUA questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atopy will be assessed by skin prick test for common environmental allergens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venous puncture (1 tube)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) test will be used as a test for EIB (adapted&#xD;
           for this young age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Power analysis to study the sample size has been performed based on the&#xD;
      previous study in first grade elite athletes. Atopy was present in 35% of the subjects and&#xD;
      EVH test was positive in 27% of these atopic subjects and 12.5% in non-atopic subjects.&#xD;
      Probably atopy rate was accidently higher than expected in the general population (25%)&#xD;
      Therefore a sample size of 405 subjects would allow to predict the presence of atopy and EIB&#xD;
      with a type I error rate of 0.05 as well as a type II error rate of 0.05 at a power of 95%.&#xD;
      The investigators expect drop-out of 15-20% of the subjects (which is more than the&#xD;
      investigators observed in elite athletes, but consider their willingness to adhere at a&#xD;
      screening protocol in elite athletes to be higher than that in non-elite athletes), aiming to&#xD;
      recruit 500 subjects.&#xD;
