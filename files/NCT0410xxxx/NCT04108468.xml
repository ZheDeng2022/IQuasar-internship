      Phase IIIb. Early Psoriatic Arthritis. Investigator initiated, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, two-armed, parallel-group, single centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective is to assess whether the combination of golimumab with methotrexate and&#xD;
      steroids is superior to standard care (MTX monotherapy plus steroids) in reducing clinical&#xD;
      disease activity in patients with early, treatment naïve PsA.&#xD;

        barrier method with spermicide, surgical sterilization) during the study and for 6 months&#xD;
        after receiving the last administration of study agent. Female subjects of childbearing&#xD;
        potential must test negative for pregnancy. Female subjects must agree to not donate eggs&#xD;

        subjects with a history of latent TB and documentation of having completed appropriate&#xD;
        treatment for latent TB 3 years prior to the first administration of study agent. It is the&#xD;
        responsibility of the investigator to verify the adequacy of previous antituberculous&#xD;
        treatment and provide appropriate documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7.2. Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical&#xD;
        examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7.3. Have had no close contact with a person with active TB or, if there has been such a&#xD;
        contact, will be referred to a physician specializing in TB to undergo additional&#xD;
        evaluation, and if warranted, receive appropriate treatment as if having latent TB prior to&#xD;
        or simultaneously with the first administration of study agent.&#xD;

        QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result or have a newly identified positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold&#xD;
        test result in which active TB has been ruled out and for which appropriate treatment for&#xD;
        latent TB has been initiated either prior to or simultaneously with the first&#xD;
        administration of study agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7.5. In the event of 2 indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube tests results, the&#xD;

        administration of study agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7.6. Have a chest radiograph (posterior-anterior view), read by a qualified radiologist,&#xD;
        whose diagnostic assessment is consistent with no evidence of current active TB or old&#xD;
        inactive TB, and taken within 12 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7.7. Have a screening laboratory test result as follows: 7.7.1. Hb≥8.5 g/dL or ≥5.3 mmol/L&#xD;

          2. Received previous treatment with golimumab or other tumour necrosis factor inhibitor&#xD;
             (TNFi) or other biologic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any chronic inflammatory arthritis diagnosed before 16 years old. Exclusions for&#xD;
             general safety&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with any ongoing or active infection or any major episode of infection requiring&#xD;

        testing for HBsAg (surface antigen), anti-HBs (surface antibody), and anti-HBc total (core&#xD;
        antibody total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        11.1. Subjects who test positive for surface antigen (HBsAg+) are not eligible for this&#xD;
