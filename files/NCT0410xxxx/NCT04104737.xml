      The primary purpose of this study is to conduct a Respiratory Rate accuracy validation&#xD;
      comparing the Spire Medical Health Tag to a FDA cleared End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor&#xD;
      Reference Standard (GE Datex-Ohmeda).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After IRB approval, a minimum of 20 healthy volunteer test subjects, 18 or older will be&#xD;
      entered into this study designed to validate the accuracy of the respiratory rate feature of&#xD;
      the Spire Medical Health Tag (Device Under Test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be selected to represent a range of body types including small, average,&#xD;
      muscular, and large with a range of BMIs. Each subject will be connected to a FDA cleared&#xD;
      EtCO2 monitor (GE Datex-Ohmeda) and will be instrumented with a mouthpiece or open system&#xD;
      mask that allows for measurement of EtCO2 derived respiratory rate. A range of stable&#xD;
      respiratory rates will be elicited from each volunteer test subject with the use of a paced&#xD;
      breathing application on a mobile phone. Subjects will also be connected to a 3-lead ECG (GE&#xD;
      Datex-Ohmeda) for the purpose of monitoring heart rate and comparing to the pulse rate&#xD;
      measurements recorded by the Spire Medical Health Tag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory rate and pulse rate will be measured simultaneously for the Reference and the&#xD;
      Device Under Test.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to collect data to validate the respiratory rate performance of&#xD;
      the Medical Health Tag developed by Spire Health. The Medical Health Tag respiratory rate&#xD;
      will be evaluated during non-motion conditions over the range a range of 5-50 breaths per&#xD;
      minute via Reference EtCO2. A FDA cleared, GE Healthcare S5 Multi-parameter monitoring system&#xD;
      with End Tidal Carbon Dioxide (EtCO2) and 3-lead ECG will be used for the Respiratory and&#xD;
      Pulse Rate References. There are no risks or adverse device effects to be assessed. There are&#xD;
      no contraindications for use in the proposed study / study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on the respiratory rate, RR parameter. The Spire Medical Health Tag is&#xD;
      investigational and has not been cleared by the FDA. The intended purpose of the device under&#xD;
      test is spot-checking, non-invasive monitoring / logging of respiratory rate on humans. For&#xD;
      this evaluation, the device will be run in a continuous data collection mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 20 healthy competent adults, ages 18 years and older. The&#xD;
      subject selection will be a mix of males and females with small to large physiques. The&#xD;
      subjects must understand the study and consent to participate by signing the Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form. The subjects must be healthy showing no evidence of medical problems as indicated by&#xD;
      satisfactorily completing the health assessment form and passing the health screening.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects need to meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the data collection will take approximately 4-7 days to complete. There&#xD;
      is no additional followup required for the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the Device Under Test will be collected on an application installed on the iOS&#xD;
      or Android mobile device separate from the reference equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-parameter monitor used during the study to observe a subject's vital signs include ECG&#xD;
      tracing, heart rate, respiratory rate, and EtCO2 with capnograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GE Healthcare S5 Compact Monitor, M-NESTPR module with ECG, and/or Multi-parameter&#xD;
           monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Portable oxygen tank, mask and ambu bag&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GE Healthcare (Datex-Ohmeda) 3900 TruTrak+ / OxyTip+ Oxy-F-UN or Oxy-AF Sensor and&#xD;
           Oxy-OL3 cable (SpO2 monitoring)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure cuff and stethoscope&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the FDA defines respiration rate devices as Class II devices. The Device Under Test&#xD;
      in this study is considered non-significant risk device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks or adverse device effects to be assessed. There are no contraindications&#xD;
      for use in the proposed study / study population.&#xD;
