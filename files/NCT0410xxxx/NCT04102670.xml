      An investigator initiated trial in which 20 subjects with moderate to severe changes of the&#xD;
      jawline, neck and décolletage will undergo combination treatment to achieve comprehensive&#xD;
      rejuvenation of the jawline and neck.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging changes in the lower face, neck and decollete are complex and involve skin,&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue/SMAS and muscle. It follows therefore that rejuvenation of the jawline,&#xD;
      neck and decollettage requires a multifactorial, combination approach. Microfocused&#xD;
      Ultrasound (MFU-V, Ultherapy) has been demonstrated to noninvasively lift the skin of the&#xD;
      submentum, neck, and reduce wrinkling of the décolletage.1-3 Injection of dilute calcium&#xD;
      hydroxylapatite (Radiesse) has also demonstrated improvement of skin quality and reduction of&#xD;
      wrinkles in the neck and décolletage skin.4 Combination therapy using MFU-V and Radiesse has&#xD;
      been used successfully to improve the appearance of the neck and décolletage and botulinum&#xD;
      toxin A has been used to improve jawline contouring and wrinkling of the décolletage.5,6 It&#xD;
      is well recognized that skincare products such as MicroFirm Neck and Decollete Rejuvenating&#xD;
      Complex improve skin quality and overall skin appearance. Further, Belotero Balance has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to have optimal biophysical properties for placement in the superficial dermis&#xD;
      and subsequent correction of etched lines.7 It is not surprising that horizontal &quot;necklace&#xD;
      lines&quot; in the neck respond better to injection of Belotero Balance than any other reported&#xD;
      treatment. Evaluation of the combination of skincare, botulinum toxin, MFU-V, and Radiesse&#xD;
      for rejuvenation of the jawline, neck, and décolletage has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal: I propose an investigator initiated trial in which 20 subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe changes of the jawline, neck and décolletage will undergo combination treatment to&#xD;
      achieve comprehensive rejuvenation of the jawline and neck. Adequate time will be allowed for&#xD;
      follow up to determine the complete effects of all treatments administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Neocutis MicroFirm Neck and Decollete treatment would be initiated at&#xD;
      Day 0 and continued bid throughout the entire duration of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultherapy will be used to treat the the lower face/neck and décolletage and will also be&#xD;
      provided at Day 0. Ultherapy treatments would of course be customized to meet each patient's&#xD;
      needs. The general guidelines that would be used to treat the lower face/jawline/neck would&#xD;
      be the 4-4.5 transducer (approx. 350 lines) and the 7-3.0 transducer (approx. 460 lines). The&#xD;
      décolletage area would be treated with the following transducers: 4-4.5 (approx. 120 lines),&#xD;
      7-3.0 (approx. 120 lines), and 10-1.5 (approx. 40 lines). As per consensus recommendations,&#xD;
      Ultherapy will be administered prior to injectables.8 Dilute Radiesse (1:2 with injectable&#xD;
      saline and 1% lidocaine without epinephrine) will be injected into the neck and décolletage&#xD;
      at days 30, 90, and 150. Radiesse will be injected as per standard protocol using sterile&#xD;
      technique and administered via a subcutaneous fanning approach. A total of 3 Radiesse&#xD;
      injections will be administered at 8 weeks intervals (Days 30, 90, and 150). The amount of&#xD;
      Dilute Radiesse used will be at the discretion of the Investigator but will not exceed 4.5mls&#xD;
      for both treatment areas, the neck and décolletage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xeomin will be injected in a &quot;Nefertiti Lift&quot; pattern horizontally, parallel to the jawline,&#xD;
      vertically in the platysma bands, and extending into the décolletage as indicated based on&#xD;
      platysma muscle anatomy. A total dose of no more than 70U of Xeomin will be utilized. The&#xD;
      first Xeomin injection will also be administered at Day 30. Additional Xeomin injections will&#xD;
      be administered at Day 120. Subjects will be assessed at Day 44 +/- 3 days, and Day 134 +/- 3&#xD;
      days to assess outcomes of Xeomin injections and provide touch up injections if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belotero Balance will be injected in horizontal necklace lines if present at Day 30 with&#xD;
      reassessment for optional injection Follow up and possible touch up treatment will be offered&#xD;
      at Day 44+/- 3 days.&#xD;
