      The goal of this study is to address the risk of diabetes among men by creating a Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program (DPP) tailored to men.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes is a major cause of disability and death that&#xD;
      disproportionately affects men. Compared to women, men have much worse health and higher&#xD;
      death rates for several chronic conditions, including diabetes. The National Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program (NDPP) has been shown to help decrease the chances of developing type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The NDPP has shown the value of lifestyle change for weight loss and diabetes&#xD;
      prevention. The Power-Up study is being done because although the evidence points to the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), men are less likely to be engaged or&#xD;
      participate in DPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Power-up study was designed to see whether a DPP tailored for men can help improve&#xD;
      engagement, participation, and results for men. Participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      undergo the Power-Up or standard NDPP classes. An assessment of whether a DPP created for men&#xD;
      will increase participation in the program, and decrease the risk for diabetes as compared to&#xD;
      the standard NDPP. Power-Up is designed to Aim 1) Assess the effect of Power-Up vs. standard&#xD;
      care NDPP on percent weight loss among men at risk for diabetes; Aim 2) Compare engagement of&#xD;
      minority men at risk for diabetes in Power-Up vs. standard care NDPP; and Aim 3) Evaluate the&#xD;
      Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Costs of Power-Up using the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework.The Power-Up intervention is tailored to the needs and preferences of men and uses:&#xD;
      a) men coaches; b) men-only groups; c) messaging tailored to be appreciated and motivational&#xD;
      to men; d) adapted content that highlights issues relevant to men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 22 classes over the course of 12 months for both Power-Up and standard NDPP. The&#xD;
      classes are split into two phases which are called the core and the maintenance phase. The&#xD;
      core phase of the program will consist of 16 classes over the first 6 months. After the core&#xD;
      of the program, participants will attend 6 maintenance classes over the next 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked over the course of the 12 months to complete surveys at four&#xD;
      different times before, during, and after completing the classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that men randomized to Power-Up will achieve significantly greater weight&#xD;
      loss (% weight loss from baseline) at 16-weeks and 1-year than men randomized to the standard&#xD;
      care, mixed-gender NDPP group (Aim 1). Evaluation of engagement and retention for Aim 2 will&#xD;
      be based on attendance records for Power-Up and NDPP sessions electronically collected by&#xD;
      trained coaches and monitored by study staff. The standards will be followed for NDPP&#xD;
      evaluation where engagement is defined as equal or greater than 4 core sessions attended and&#xD;
      retention is defined as equal or greater than 9 sessions attended. There will be a collection&#xD;
      of quantitative and qualitative data that will be rigorously evaluated: the reach of our&#xD;
      recruitment, broader patient-important indicators of effectiveness, adoption at the practice&#xD;
      level, and implementation of the intervention (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment consists of 300 participants through our health system partners. Men will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either the Power-Up intervention arm or referred to the standard NDPP at&#xD;
      their clinic site. Consistent with current CDC standards and current NDPP practices of our&#xD;
      health system partners, telephone make-up sessions will be offered by coaches in both&#xD;
      conditions to men who miss in-person sessions.&#xD;
