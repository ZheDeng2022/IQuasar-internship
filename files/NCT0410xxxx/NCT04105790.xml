      This study will examine the acceptability and effectiveness of using a stepped care treatment&#xD;
      model, and specifically, the CBTm classes, in a rural population. The introduction of CBTm&#xD;
      classes, developed in Winnipeg and used in outpatient mental health clinics there, is new to&#xD;
      Adult Community Mental Health in the Prairie Mountain Health region. This research is being&#xD;
      done to explore whether this is a treatment model that is effective at reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression and also whether it affects the workload for Community Mental Health&#xD;
      Workers in a more rural area. Further, this research is being done to explore whether clients&#xD;
      perceive this form of services to be useful and acceptable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of class-based psychoeducation&#xD;
      as the first step of a stepped care model in a community mental health program. In April of&#xD;
      2019, the Prairie Mountain Health (PMH) Adult Community Mental Health programs (both Northern&#xD;
      and Southern regions) instituted a change to their existing service model. Previously, all&#xD;
      individuals who sought access to public mental health services underwent an intake interview&#xD;
      and were subsequently assigned a community mental health worker (CMHW) with whom they met for&#xD;
      individual counselling. Due to the ever-increasing demand for services, CMHWs were required&#xD;
      to manage large caseloads which resulted in extended periods between counselling appointments&#xD;
      and strain on care providers. In an effort to introduce a stepped-care framework to mitigate&#xD;
      workload, the Adult Community Mental Health programs in PMH North and South began to offer&#xD;
      psychology-led psychoeducation classes as a step below individual counselling. Specifically,&#xD;
      the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Mindfulness (CBTm) classes, developed at the&#xD;
      University of Manitoba by Sareen, Sala, Wong, Whitney, and Kinley (2016), were delivered.&#xD;
      This program is comprised of four 90-minute sessions that deliver information about basic&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioural therapy principles and effective self-help resources. It was&#xD;
      developed to offer services to clients on the waitlist for outpatient mental health services&#xD;
      in Winnipeg and preliminary research on this program has demonstrated that it is an&#xD;
      acceptable form of treatment and effectively reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression (with&#xD;
      a small to medium effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the change in the service delivery model and the introduction of large psychoeducation&#xD;
      classes in PMH's Adult Community Mental Health programs is novel, evaluation of this change&#xD;
      is warranted. This study will examine foundational program variables including retention,&#xD;
      acceptability, and effectiveness (see Thakur, Bolton, &amp; Sareen, 2018). Assessing these&#xD;
      factors will provide critical information about the potential for further development of a&#xD;
      stepped care model, including the CBTm program, in this rural health region and afford the&#xD;
      opportunity to compare outcome measures in a rural setting to those from an urban centre&#xD;
      (data published by Thakur et al., 2018). In order to further increase access to services, the&#xD;
      program was also intended to be delivered to remote rural sites via telehealth; exploration&#xD;
      of the acceptability and efficacy of telehealth use in service delivery also merits&#xD;
      assessment. However, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person and MBTelehealth CBTm&#xD;
      classes were suspended to abide by provincial physical distancing guidelines. Moving forward,&#xD;
      the CBTm classes will be offered via MS Teams, a virtual videoconferencing platform for all&#xD;
      attendees, allowing individuals to participate via videoconference or telephone from their&#xD;
      preferred location within Manitoba.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions and hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the implementation of CBTm as the first step in a stepped model acceptable to rural&#xD;
           clients? The investigators hypothesize that class-based clinical service will be&#xD;
           acceptable to rural clients as it will increase their access to valuable mental health&#xD;
           services in their region; this will be demonstrated in a high rate of retention and&#xD;
           positive feedback from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How are issues unique to rural settings, such as concerns about confidentiality and&#xD;
           virtual delivery of programming, in a class-based setting viewed by rural clients? The&#xD;
           investigators anticipate initial concerns about confidentiality and virtual service&#xD;
           delivery related to the nature of the rural setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are class-based clinical services (i.e., CBTm) effective for reducing symptoms of&#xD;
           depression and anxiety for participants living in rural areas? Consistent with previous&#xD;
           research, the investigators anticipate a small to medium effect size in the decrease of&#xD;
           symptoms of depression and anxiety and increased incorporation of cognitive behavioural&#xD;
           strategies into daily life.&#xD;
