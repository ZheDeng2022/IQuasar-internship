  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 15,000 people in the United Kingdom experience sudden loss of&#xD;
      hearing that is sensorineural in nature. In the majority of cases, the cause is unknown&#xD;
      despite investigation, and these cases are termed idiopathic 'sudden onset sensorineural&#xD;
      hearing loss' (SSNHL). Treatment options for idiopathic SSNHL mainly include steroid&#xD;
      treatments, with considerable limitations in their effectiveness and evidence base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of new treatments being developed for idiopathic SSNHL based upon recent&#xD;
      discoveries in underlying molecular mechanisms. These treatments require rigorous testing in&#xD;
      clinical trials before they can become available for clinical use. To allow for such trials&#xD;
      to be run effectively, there is an urgent need for information on patient numbers,&#xD;
      geographical distribution, demographics, patient and treatment pathways, as well as outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to collect these data through an ENT trainee and Audiologist led&#xD;
      nationwide prospective cohort study of adult patients presenting with SSNHL within the&#xD;
      National Health Services (NHS). The study will take place at 97 NHS sites across England with&#xD;
      Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) and Audiology services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data once collected will be analysed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish the patient pathway for patients presenting with SSNHL in the NHS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a tool that will help predict recovery for patients with idiopathic SSNHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish the impact of idiopathic SSNHL on people's quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 20 people per 100,000 experience sudden loss of hearing that is&#xD;
      sensorineural in nature. 'Sensorineural' indicates an abnormality of the cochlea, the&#xD;
      auditory nerve, or higher central auditory pathways. When the hearing loss is of 30 dB&#xD;
      (decibel) or more, over at least 3 contiguous frequencies and within 3 days, the condition is&#xD;
      termed sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). SSNHL is predominantly unilateral and&#xD;
      the hearing loss can range from mild to profound. In 71% to 90% of cases, the cause is&#xD;
      unknown despite investigation, and these cases are termed idiopathic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated symptoms include tinnitus, vertigo and aural fullness. Idiopathic SSNHL is a&#xD;
      serious condition, adversely impacting people's lives with research indicating associations&#xD;
      with emotional distress, depression, difficulties at work and impaired social integration. It&#xD;
      is estimated that 32% to 65% of cases of idiopathic SSNHL recover spontaneously, although&#xD;
      clinical experience suggests that this may be an overestimation, with further research&#xD;
      required in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current care pathways for patients suffering from idiopathic SSNHL appear to vary&#xD;
      considerably in terms of the type of service patients first present to, their subsequent&#xD;
      referral, length of time between onset of symptoms, presentation and start of treatment, the&#xD;
      treatment plan as well as follow-up. Treatment options for idiopathic SSNHL include systemic&#xD;
      and intratympanic steroids, antiviral agents, rheological agents, diuretics, hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen treatment, and observation alone. The lack of evidence regarding the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of these treatments is recognised by clinical guidelines published by National&#xD;
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head&#xD;
      and Neck Surgery (ORL-HNS), and the British Academy of Audiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon recent discoveries in the molecular mechanisms that lead to sensorineural hearing&#xD;
      loss, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new treatments for patients&#xD;
      with idiopathic SSNHL. These treatments require rigorous testing in clinical trials before&#xD;
      they can become available for application in a clinical service setting. To allow for such&#xD;
      trials to be run effectively reliable information is required on where patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic SSNHL present and can be recruited from within the optimum timeframe from onset of&#xD;
      symptoms to start of treatment based upon the preclinical profile of the drug. This means&#xD;
      that there is an urgent need for information on patient numbers, geographical distribution,&#xD;
      demographics, patient and treatment pathways, as well as outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to collect these data through an ENT trainee and Audiologist led&#xD;
      nationwide prospective cohort study of adult patients presenting with SSNHL within the NHS.&#xD;
      Importantly, this study will not only provide key data to inform future trial design and&#xD;
      delivery, but also a unique dataset to develop a prediction model to predict recovery for&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic SSNHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To map the patient pathway and identify the characteristics of adult patients presenting&#xD;
           to NHS ENT and hearing services with SSNHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop a prediction model to predict recovery for patients with idiopathic SSNHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish the impact of idiopathic SSNHL on patients' quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design National multicentre prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting A multicentre study taking place at NHS centres providing ENT and Hearing Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients (male or female) aged over 16 years of age presenting to NHS ENT and&#xD;
           hearing services with SSNHL AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed with a hearing loss in one or both ears of 30 dB HL or more, over at least 3&#xD;
           contiguous frequencies, between 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AND -Willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with mixed or conductive hearing loss (CHL). CHL will be defined as a 'true'&#xD;
      air-bone gap of 15 dB HL or more in 3 or more contiguous frequencies between 500, 1000, 2000,&#xD;
      4000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in auditory function in the affected ear from initial presentation to follow-up&#xD;
      (at any one time between 6 and 16 weeks from onset of symptoms). Auditory function will be&#xD;
      defined as the Pure Tone Average (PTA) of air conduction thresholds at 250, 500, 1000, 2000,&#xD;
      4000 and 8000 Hz. If multiple pure tone audiograms have been carried out between 6 and 16&#xD;
      weeks, the most recent pure tone audiogram will be used for the calculation of auditory&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in auditory function classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full recovery: Final PTA in affected ear within 10dB of PTA of unaffected ear (≤10dB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Partial to no recovery: Final PTA in affected ear ≥10dB of PTA of unaffected ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degree of change in auditory function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete recovery: Final PTA in affected ear within 10dB of PTA of unaffected ear&#xD;
           (≤10dB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marked recovery: PTA improvement ≥30 dB (and final PTA in affected ear ≥ 10dB of PTA of&#xD;
           unaffected ear)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Slight recovery: PTA improvement ≥10dB and ≤30 dB (and final PTA in affected ear ≥10dB&#xD;
           of PTA of unaffected ear)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No improvement: PTA improvement ≤10 dB (and final PTA in affected ear ≥10dB of PTA of&#xD;
           unaffected ear)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (QoL):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in QoL score from initial presentation to follow-up at any one time between 6 and 16&#xD;
      weeks following treatment. QoL will be measured using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for&#xD;
      Adults (HHIA) (for patients under 60 years of age) or Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly&#xD;
      (HHIE) (for patients over 60 years of age) and the Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3). QoL&#xD;
      data will be only be collected in a selection of sites (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranges for HHIA and HHIE are from 0 (no handicap) to 100 (total handicap) Range for HUI3 = 8&#xD;
      (no handicap) to 45 (total handicap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic model:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop a multivariable prognostic model to predict recovery for&#xD;
      patients with SSNHL in NHS ENT and Hearing services. Missing outcome data at study end will&#xD;
      be imputed using multiple imputation by a chained equations procedure. Internal validation&#xD;
      will be performed to quantify optimism in the predictive performance (calibration and&#xD;
      discrimination) of the developed model using bootstrapping techniques. Bootstrapping&#xD;
      techniques provide information on the performance of the model in comparable datasets and&#xD;
      generate a shrinkage factor to adjust the regression coefficients.Statistical analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out using R software (version 3.5.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean change in HHIA, HHIE and HUI3 scores will be calculated from initial presentation to&#xD;
      follow up (any one time between 6 and 16 weeks). The investigators will use the&#xD;
      non-parametric Wilcoxon and McNemar-Bowker tests with a significance level of 5% to compare&#xD;
      results at patients' initial presentation and at their final follow up. Statistical data&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out using the SPSS program 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). QoL data&#xD;
      will be collected from a sub-set of sites (20%, n=20).&#xD;
