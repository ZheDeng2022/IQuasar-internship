  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Terminal Chronic Kidney Disease undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) often have&#xD;
      pathophysiological factors that promote chronic constipation. It affects the quality of life&#xD;
      of Patients undergoing PD in a much greater way than for hemodialysis patients because it&#xD;
      causes complications, mechanical and infectious associated with the transmural migration of&#xD;
      enteral bacteria, with an impact on patient morbidity and survival of the technique. In&#xD;
      addition, it should be noted that PD patients often take potentially constipants treatments&#xD;
      such as phosphorus chelators, calcium inhibitors, opiates, iron preparation and&#xD;
      antidepressants. Taking these drugs decreases gastric acidity, which is associated with an&#xD;
      increased prevalence of peritonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, a significant lack of literature, specifically studying the risk factors for&#xD;
      constipation in Terminal Chronic Kidney Disease patients treated with DP and the correlation&#xD;
      with mechanical and infectious complications, is improvable.&#xD;

      Patients included in this trial will be monitored as part of the usual management of their&#xD;
      pathology, a Terminal Chronic Kidney Disease treated by the Peritoneal Dialysis technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this treatment, patients will be follow every 2 months in consultation in the&#xD;
      Metabolic Diseases Department of the Hospital of Vichy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These consultations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-selection consultation/Inclusion (visit to J0 -3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Half-yearly review (visit J0, visit at 12 months and visit at 24 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simple consultation (visits to 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20, 22 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annual review (visits at 6 and 18 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective trial, there is no intervention on the patient; They will only have to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires on their intestinal transit (Charlson Scale, Katz Scale, Neurological&#xD;
      Functional Score, Intestinal Function Index, Severity Score for constipation, Bristol Scale,&#xD;
      Constipation Assessment Scale, Constipation Risk Assessment Scale). No minimal risk and&#xD;
      constraint is identified, excluding our trial from the category of interventional research.&#xD;
      The category 3 (non-interventional trial) of the jard√© classification is therefore accepted.&#xD;

        Clinically stable patients who have been in Peritoneal Dialysis for at least three months&#xD;
        will be pre-selected three months before the start of the study and included via the&#xD;
        Metabolic diseases Center of the Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol will be offered to adult patients suffering from Terminal Chronic Kidney&#xD;
        disease undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis.&#xD;
