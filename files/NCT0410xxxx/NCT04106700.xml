  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional, no-randomized, open-label, and single arm multicentre study of apixaban for&#xD;
      the prevention of thromboembolic events during induction therapy in transplant-eligible&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who receive bortezomib, thalidomide, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (VTD) during the induction phase of therapy prior to autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ASCT). The current study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      apixaban during the induction period. Efficacy will be defined as a composite endpoint of&#xD;
      acute symptomatic proximal and distal deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, VTE related&#xD;
      deaths, and acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of the oral anti factor Xa apixaban&#xD;
      2.5 mg given twice daily as a prophylaxis of VTE in transplant-eligible patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma during the induction therapy with VTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction therapy prior to ASCT will consist in no less than 4 and no more than 6 cycles of&#xD;
      VTD, depending on treatment response. Duration of each cycle is 4 weeks if there is not any&#xD;
      disease or treatment-related complication; therefore, treatment duration will be around 4-6&#xD;
      months. Daily Prophylaxis with apixaban will continue up to a maximum of 14 days after the&#xD;
      last dose of thalidomide. In addition, there will be an additional observation period of 14&#xD;
      (Â± 7) days, starting the day after the last dose of study medication (until 28 days after the&#xD;
      end of the last cycle of VTD).&#xD;
