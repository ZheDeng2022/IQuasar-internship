  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontic treatment extends over a longer period of time. lt takes months or rather years&#xD;
      and it is no short-term treatment. The current literature does not answer the question of&#xD;
      patients' expectations on aligner treatment and patients' experiences during aligner therapy&#xD;
      sufficiently. Therefore, it is clinically and ethically highly relevant to know answers to&#xD;
      these questions. This knowledge can highly improve the orthodontic consultation and therapy&#xD;
      as well as the patients' comfort and wellbeing during the therapy. The proposed&#xD;
      questionnaire-based interview survey is anticipated as a two-vear study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first year study patients' expectations and preferences before the aligner treatment&#xD;
      with Invisalign® aligners will be evaluated as well as preliminary changes in quality of life&#xD;
      during the first stages of the Invisalign® aligner treatment. In the second year study it is&#xD;
      planned to continue with the time equivalent questionnaires of the first year study and to&#xD;
      investigate the patients' expectations, patients' experiences and levels of quality of life&#xD;
      during and after aligner treatment. Therefore, it is planned to enroll 55 patients in this&#xD;
      multicentre questionnaire-based interview survey. Two different questionnaires will be handed&#xD;
      out to the patients. The first questionnaire, the aligner questionnaire, collects information&#xD;
      from three different time points regarding the patients' expectations, preferences,&#xD;
      experiences and views on second opinion concerning the aligner treatment. The results of&#xD;
      those three time points, i.e. first (Ta0 before treatment begin), second (Ta6Mo, after 6&#xD;
      months of treatment) and third (Ta final, after finishing the treatment) will be&#xD;
      statistically described and compared over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect most questionnaires of the second (during aligner treatment) and third time points&#xD;
      (after finishing of treatment) to be evaluated by the end of the second year (second-year&#xD;
      study), as the average treatment duration is about two years. The aim of the second&#xD;
      questionnaire (OHlP 14) is to find out the changes in quality of life and is scheduled be&#xD;
      started already in the firsfyear study. This questionnaire will be handed out to the patients&#xD;
      before the treatment begins (Tq0), at the first check-up after the beginning of the treatment&#xD;
      (TqCo1) and semi-annually afterwards (Tq6Mo' Tq12Mo, Tq18Mo, Tq24Mo, Tq30Mo) and finally at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment (Tq final).&#xD;

      It is planned to enroll 55 patients in this study, which is designed as a longterm&#xD;
      questionnaire-based multicenter survey. Patients have to give their written consent prior to&#xD;
      the study. Patients of the Clinical Division of Orthodontics at the University Clinic of&#xD;
      Dentistry in Vienna as well as of a private practice will be included in order to increase&#xD;
      the results' significance. All patients will be examined beforehand in order to exclude other&#xD;
      pre-orthodontical treatment. After a short briefing about the aligner procedure and the&#xD;
      therapeutic alternatives, each patient is selected for the aligner treatment with&#xD;
      lnvisalign®. At this stage the chosen patient will be informed about the survey. The patient&#xD;
      will receive the written consent form and the patient information form to think about at&#xD;
      home. Should the patient consider to take part in the study, the signed forms must be&#xD;
      returned at the following appointment. The patient will now receive the details about the&#xD;
      different questionnaires and the estimated time per questionnaire (approximately 10 mins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first treatment the patient is asked to fill out the first OHIP G 14 (Tq 0) and&#xD;
      the first aligner-questionnaire (Ta 0). The participants will be categorized by gender' age&#xD;
      and level of education (compulsory school degree, higher school certificate, apprenticeship,&#xD;
      university degree). Patients who have already been treated with aligners will not be included&#xD;
      in the study. The routine-made initial and final scans of the patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      according to the criteria of the orthodontic PAR (peer assessment rating) index. lnclusion&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invisalign® &quot;full&quot; aligner treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invisalign® &quot;lite&quot; aligner treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients (18 years and older)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous aligner treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined bracket and aligner treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OHIP G 14 (Oral Health lmpact Profile G 14) questionnaire is an established and validated&#xD;
      tool to evaluate the patients' quality of life. OHIP G 14 is the German version of OHIP (Oral&#xD;
      Health lmpact Profile) 14. OHIP-14 is a short form of the oral health impact profile whose&#xD;
      theoretic framework was based on a World Health Organization's International Classification&#xD;
      of lmpairments, Disabilities and Handicaps relating health and its sequence in a hierarchy of&#xD;
      different outcome levels. OHIP-14 has 7 conceptualized domains (2 items per domain):&#xD;
      functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability,&#xD;
      psychological disability, social disability and handicap. Patients are asked to rate how&#xD;
      frequently they experienced an oral health impact (as described by each item). The response&#xD;
      to each item is scored on a s-point Likert scale: 0, never; 1, hardly ever; 2, occasionally;&#xD;
      3, fairly often; and 4, very often or every day. Summary OHIP-14 scores can range from 0 to&#xD;
      56, and domain scores can range from o to 8. A higher oHlP-14 score indicates poorer oral&#xD;
      health related quality of life (4-6) The OHIP questionnaire will be handed out to the&#xD;
      patients before the treatment begins (Tq 0), at the first check-up after beginning of&#xD;
      treatment (Tq Co1) - (usually 4 weeks after treatment) - and semi-annually afterwards (Tq6Mo,&#xD;
      Tq12Mo' Tq18Mo' Tq24Mo, Tq3OMo) and at the end of treatment (Tq final). In order to simplify&#xD;
      the questionnaires and spare pages, both questionnaires (OHIP G 14 and aligner questionnaire)&#xD;
      will be merged into one questionnaire sheet, if applicable (at time points T0. T6 and&#xD;
      Tfinal). Aligner-questionnaires will be handed out before (Ta0), after 6 months of treatment&#xD;
      (Ta6) and at the end of treatment (Ta final). As there are no existing and comparable&#xD;
      templates aiming at the study objectives, we designed the questionnaire according to a study&#xD;
      on patients' perspectives on dental implant and bone graft surgery. lt is planned to explore&#xD;
      how the patients' expectations change before, during and after treatment. Furthermore, each&#xD;
      patient can evaluate his/her experiences with the aligner therapy after 6 months (most of the&#xD;
      supportive procedures such as interproximal enamel reduction, wearing intermaxillary&#xD;
      elastics, bonding of attachments will latest be started by then) and at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment. The patients will be asked specific questions concerning aligner-treatment before,&#xD;
      during and after the aligner-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will get a reminder of the second and last aligner-questionnaire at one previous&#xD;
      appointment. The estimated answer duration is going to be mentioned again' The patients are&#xD;
      asked to fill out the third aligner-questionnaire on the day of the last appointment of&#xD;
      active aligner therapy or within 8 weeks after the treatment Further, it is planned to&#xD;
      correlate the patients' expectations concerning the treatment process/-success, their&#xD;
      willingness for seeking a second opinion and their acceptance of different treatment&#xD;
      modalities (interproximal enamel reduction, intermaxillary elastics) to the reported quality&#xD;
      of life, the level of education, the grade of the PAR index at the beginning of treatment, as&#xD;
      well as to gender and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be arranged into the following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient expectations will be asked at three different time points (before, during and&#xD;
           after therapy) for their expectations at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient experiences will be asked at two different time points (during and after&#xD;
           therapy) concerning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient preferences and acceptances will be asked at three different time points&#xD;
           (before, during and after therapy) concerning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient willingness to seek a second opinion will be explored at three different time&#xD;
           points (before, during and after therapy) in consideration of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations were done using the usual formulas for the paired t-test, adjusting for&#xD;
      the planned use of non-parametric analysis by using the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE).&#xD;
      Assuming a SD (standard deviation) of 3.0 (from Liu 2011), a minimal sample size of 33 is&#xD;
      needed to achieve a power of 0.95, to detect a clinically meaningful change of 2 in OHIP at&#xD;
      significance level 0.05. Accounting fot 40% expected drop out due to the long-term character&#xD;
      of the planned study, we arrive at a final sample size of 55 [33(1 - 0.4 dropout]. Due to the&#xD;
      preliminary character of the questionnaire, there is no previous experience (clinical or&#xD;
      otherwise) to base any sample size calculations on. Considering the fact that compared to the&#xD;
      standardized and general OHIP, the questions in the new questionnaire are more detailed and&#xD;
      tailored to the treatment these specific patients receive, we expect the power for this new&#xD;
      questionnaire to be at least equal to the one computed for OHIP. Proportional odds mixed&#xD;
      model will be used for OHIP questionnaires and for aggregate scores of aligner&#xD;
      questionnaires, with covariate age, gender, level of education, reported quality of life and&#xD;
      the grade of the PAR index at the beginning of treatment.&#xD;
