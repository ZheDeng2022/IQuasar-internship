    <textblock>
      The ARCTIC-PCI (Aromatherapy for Cognitive Trajectory in Chinese after Percutaneous Coronary&#xD;
      Intervention) trial is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study to evaluated the effects of aromatherapy in improving cognitive function in&#xD;
      post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients. The study will recruit 660 patients&#xD;
      who undergo a PCI at the Department of Cardiology in Beijing Anzhen Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information will be collected prior to PCI, all eligible participants undergoing PCI&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio before hospital discharge to receive aromatherapy&#xD;
      (70% menthol and 30% propanediol) or placebo (10% menthol and 90% propanediol). The treatment&#xD;
      will last for 6 months in both groups. Cognitive function measurement will be conducted by&#xD;
      blinded assessors at baseline (1-3 days before PCI) and at 3- and 6- month after PCI. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the change in overall cognitive function (MOCA score) from baseline&#xD;
      to 6-month after PCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ARCTIC-PCI trial has two objectives. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      aromatherapy (70% menthol and 30% propanediol) in improving cognitive functions in Chinese&#xD;
      post-PCI patients. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of aromatherapy. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the aromatherapy will result in improved 6- month cognitive functions&#xD;
      compared to the placebo (10% menthol and 90% propanediol) among patients accepted a PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at Beijing Anzhen Hospital. All eligible patients plan to undergo&#xD;
      their PCI will be screened for eligibility, written informed consent need to be provided. For&#xD;
      patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline assessment will be carried&#xD;
      out 1 to 3 days prior to the PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and allocation concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be conducted after PCI and before hospital discharge. To ensure&#xD;
      concealment of the treatment allocation, randomization will be performed by a web-based IT&#xD;
      system. All eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      aromatherapy (70% menthol and 30% propanediol) or placebo (10% menthol and 90% propanediol).&#xD;
      Each sniffin' stick of aromatherapy or placebo will be labeled according to the&#xD;
      pre-determined random code by an independent agency that does not involve any persons&#xD;
      associated with the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, investigators, physicians, and outcomes assessors will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation. The sticks of aromatherapy and placebo are the same, and the smell of them is&#xD;
      similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will last for 6 months. All participants will receive the standard inhalation&#xD;
      method training before hospital discharge. For both arms, the aromatherapy/placebo will be&#xD;
      given twice daily (morning and evening), each time training for 4 times with deep inhalation&#xD;
      for 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervisory management will be carried out through WeChat app, each day all participants will&#xD;
      receive reminders via WeChat through the &quot;group assistant&quot;. By the end of the intervention,&#xD;
      we will collect all the rest of the medications (menthol/placebo) and the total amount of the&#xD;
      rest medication will be assessed to evaluate patients' adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measurement including the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laboratory data including: myocardial enzyme, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated&#xD;
           hemoglobin, total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol, high-density cholesterol,&#xD;
           triglyceride, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, creatinine, uric acid, liver function&#xD;
           indicators, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Genetic testing: APOE genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical examination: height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical data including: left ventricular ejection fraction, heart failure&#xD;
           classification, GRACE score, shock, thrombolytic therapy, myocardial infarction&#xD;
           classification, type of MI (ST elevation or non-ST elevation), vascular stenosis,&#xD;
           coronary artery calcification score, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of olfactory function: collection of prior history of dysosmia or using&#xD;
           Sniffin' Sticks test to assess olfactory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment of cognitive function: The Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
           Assessment (MoCA) will be used, which is translated from the original English version&#xD;
           and has been reviewed and authorized by the author of the original edition (Dr. Ziad&#xD;
           Nasreddine). The Chinese version of MoCA has been verified in the elderly population in&#xD;
           China, with good reliability and validity in screening for MCI and Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
           In addition, we will use internationally recognized scales to evaluate memory, executive&#xD;
           function and orientation. All researchers involved in the cognitive function assessment&#xD;
           are from the clinical research institute of Peking University, independent of the study&#xD;
           sponsor. All cognitive assessors have received MoCA training and obtained official&#xD;
           certification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assessment of depression symptom: The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale&#xD;
           (CES-D) will be used to measure depression symptoms severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Surgery information: methods of anesthesia, anesthetic drugs and dosage, duration of&#xD;
           PCI, stent type, number of stents, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Other information: length of stay in ICU, length of stay in general ward, discharge&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessment： All participants will be invited back to hospital twice at 3- and 6-&#xD;
      month after PCI. Cognitive functions will be assessed by the same assessors using the same&#xD;
      methods as baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6-month follow-up period will be recorded, which are defined as any of the&#xD;
      unexpected signs (such as abnormal lab values), symptoms, or diseases, whether or not&#xD;
      associated with aromatherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-related adverse reactions including 1) respiratory allergy and 2) sneeze. Severe&#xD;
      adverse events (SAE) during follow-up are defined as any of the following:1) all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, 2) hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, 3) re-myocardial infarction and 4)&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of subjects required for this study is 330:330 patients per group. This&#xD;
      number was determined on the basis of the following hypotheses, with reference obtained from&#xD;
      the FINGER trial (Lancet 2015;385:2255-2263), Xie et.al (JACC 2019;73: 3041-3050) and other&#xD;
      related observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A decrease of 0.2 Z-score with a standard deviation of 0.3 at 6-month post-PCI in the&#xD;
           control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention will reduce the overall cognitive decline by 40%, that is a decrease of&#xD;
           0.12 Z-score at 6-month post-PCI in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. α risk of 5% and β risk of 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the maximum lost to follow-up rate:10%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal analysis will be a modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis on patients with&#xD;
      at least one follow-up included in the study. The primary and continuous secondary outcomes&#xD;
      are repeated measures, and linear mixed models will be used for analysis. All continuous&#xD;
      outcomes will be standardized according to the mean and standard deviation of their baseline&#xD;
      values, and z-score of each variable will be obtained. Modified Poisson regression analysis&#xD;
      will be used for binary secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses include: 1) ITT analysis including all participants, with missing data&#xD;
      being imputed by using multiple imputation method. 2) Only include patients with both&#xD;
      follow-up measurements. 3) For the primary outcome, we will also test if the intervention&#xD;
      effect is modified by baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be carried out using the SAS Enterprise Guide 7.13 (SAS Institute&#xD;
      Inc, Cary, NC)&#xD;
