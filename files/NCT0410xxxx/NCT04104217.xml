  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the experience of music therapy&#xD;
      by cancer patients with delirium, and the experience of music therapists working with these&#xD;
      patients. The researchers are focusing on patients with delirium because of the challenging&#xD;
      symptoms of this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At MSK, music therapy is routinely used in patients with cancer. Music therapy sessions are&#xD;
      done at the patient's bedside, where the music therapist plays live music on a guitar,&#xD;
      keyboard, harp, or percussion instrument, sometimes as accompaniment to singing.&#xD;
