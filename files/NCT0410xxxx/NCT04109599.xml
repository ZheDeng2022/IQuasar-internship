    <textblock>
      This study's specific aims are to: develop a digital intervention as a prevention&#xD;
      intervention through focus groups with 40 youth; pilot-test the developed digital&#xD;
      intervention with 30 adolescents, using methods from the investigator's prior research;&#xD;
      develop implementation strategies and partners through focus groups with 50 School Based&#xD;
      Health Alliance affiliates and 30 adolescents from an Advisory Council.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most opioid misuse begins during adolescence and young adulthood. Adolescence is the time to&#xD;
      intervene with prevention interventions (i.e., interventions focused on adolescents who have&#xD;
      not yet misused opioids) in settings like school-based health centers (HCs), yet few&#xD;
      interventions exist that prevent initiation of opioid misuse. &quot;Serious videogame&quot;&#xD;
      interventions can improve health behaviors. Serious videogames meet adolescents &quot;where the&#xD;
      adolescents are,&quot; and compared to standard interventions, these type of interventions can&#xD;
      reach large populations, with consistent fidelity, place limited demands on&#xD;
      personnel/resources, facilitate rapid sustainable distribution, all at a potentially lower&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study harnesses the power of videogame interventions and incorporates components of&#xD;
      effective substance use prevention programs to develop an evidence-informed intervention to&#xD;
      prevent the initiation of opioid misuse in adolescents. Building on the investigator's&#xD;
      experience developing videogame interventions and in partnership with the national&#xD;
      School-Based Health Alliance (SBHA), the investigator and team will develop and test a new&#xD;
      videogame intervention, PlaySmart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PlaySmart will build upon the PlayForward videogame intervention platform that has&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy in improving attitudes and knowledge related to risk behaviors. Through&#xD;
      rigorous formative work and with input from adolescents, the SBHA and game development&#xD;
      partners, the PlaySmart videogame intervention will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PlaySmart will be designed to provide players with behavioral skills and knowledge through&#xD;
      repetitive and engaging videogame play to target adolescent perceptions of risk of harm from&#xD;
      initiating opioid misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has the potential to create a videogame intervention to prevent initiation of&#xD;
      opioid misuse with far-reaching and sustained impact on adolescents. This protocol&#xD;
      registration will focus on the pilot test portion of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>System Usability: System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate game usability (e.g., feasibility) and engagement, self-reported data using questions from the System Usability Scale (SUS) that is used for global assessment of systems usability. It is a ten-item scale using 5 (or 7) point Likert scale. Each question will be used separately to assess usability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>User Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will also be assessed using questions from the User Engagement Scale to assess game usability and engagement. The User Engagement Scale is a 31-item scale that measures 6 dimensions of engagement. Each question used will be used separately to assess usability.</description>

    <measure>Participant satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction (as a proxy for Acceptability) with the game play experience will be assessed using 12 Likert-type questions (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree, Not Sure) such as &quot;I enjoyed playing the game&quot; and &quot;I felt connected to my character in the game.&quot; Each item will be assessed individually to assess participant satisfaction.</description>
