      The subjects were randomly assigned to VR treatment group and imaginary leak treatment group.&#xD;
      In the VR treatment group, there were six VR exposure experiences, ranging from low to high&#xD;
      levels of exposure, about 20 minutes each time, twice a week. During the course of treatment,&#xD;
      physiological data such as skin electricity, skin temperature, heart rate and blood volume&#xD;
      were measured, and the state of the subjects was evaluated more objectively. At the same&#xD;
      time, every two minutes, the participants were asked the SUD value and recorded. AQ, ATHQ and&#xD;
      BAT were recorded before treatment, after treatment and during the follow-up period of six&#xD;
      months. The two groups were treated differently. n addition, at the beginning of this&#xD;
      treatment program, an experimental study was added to understand the eye movement&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with acrophobia. By viewing a group of high-altitude pictures,&#xD;
      recording their eye movement characteristics and physiological feedback data, and scoring the&#xD;
      anxiety level of each picture, and joining the normal control group, we can find a group of&#xD;
      high-altitude pictures which can cause high-altitude fear in patients with high-altitude&#xD;
      fear, and lay a foundation for future related research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study recruited 60 patients with Acrophobia and randomly assigned them to the VR&#xD;
      treatment group and the imaginary exposure treatment group. Recruitment conditions for&#xD;
      Acrophobia: The Acrophobia questionnaire scored more than 45.45 points; Age 18-55 years old;&#xD;
      Right-handedness; No psychotherapy or psychiatric medication for six months; Normal vision or&#xD;
      corrective vision; Not during pregnancy or lactation. Before the formal treatment, the&#xD;
      participants were interviewed, mainly to understand in detail the fear of heights in the&#xD;
      subjects, and to tell the subjects the reasons for the fear of heights and the principles of&#xD;
      our treatment. After confirming the participants 'intention to participate in the treatment,&#xD;
      a heart test was conducted to eliminate heart problems and finally sign an informed consent&#xD;
      form. At the end of the interview, pre-tests were performed to collect fear of heights&#xD;
      questionnaires, high attitude questionnaires, behavioral avoidance tests, and nuclear&#xD;
      magnetic data collection. There were a total of 5 treatments in the VR treatment group,&#xD;
      followed by cliffs, cliffs, cliffs, single-plank bridges, and high-altitude rescues. The&#xD;
      difficulty of the scene increased in turn. The frequency of treatment twice a week, about 30&#xD;
      minutes each time, fills in the motion sickness questionnaire before and after each treatment&#xD;
      to understand the safety of VR treatment. In the course of treatment, physiological data such&#xD;
      as skin electricity, skin temperature, heart rate, and blood volume were measured, and the&#xD;
      state of the subjects was objectively evaluated. At the same time, every two minutes,&#xD;
      participants were asked about sud values and recorded. Visualizing exposure therapy is to&#xD;
      achieve the goal of exposure by transforming the five scenes of VR exposure therapy through&#xD;
      language and guiding the subjects through the guidance language. Both treatment groups were&#xD;
      required to collect scales and nuclear magnetic data before, after and after six months of&#xD;
      follow-up. In addition, at the beginning of this treatment program, an experimental study was&#xD;
      added to understand the characteristics of eye movement in people with anorexia. By looking&#xD;
      at high altitude images, recording their eye movement characteristics and physiological&#xD;
      feedback, and rating the anxiety levels of each image, adding to the normal control group, we&#xD;
      found a high altitude image that can cause high altitude fear in people with high altitude&#xD;
      fear. And lay the foundation for future related research.&#xD;
