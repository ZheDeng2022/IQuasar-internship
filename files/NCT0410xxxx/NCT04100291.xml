  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with the chronic bowel disease pouchitis is disabled by bloody diarrhoea and&#xD;
      abdominal pain often followed by fever. Pouchitis is an inflammation in a pouch, a reservoir&#xD;
      formed by the small intestine in the management of the chronic inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis. Chronic pouchitis is a rare disease with a prevalence in Denmark of &lt;1.8&#xD;
      per 10,000 people, mostly younger people (&lt;50 years). The standard treatment for pouchitis is&#xD;
      intensive broad-spectrum antibiotics for a longer period. However, the treatment often fails&#xD;
      after repeated treatments. Recent studies show that patients with pouchitis have an altered&#xD;
      composition of the gut flora, called microbiota, compared to healthy individuals. As shown by&#xD;
      several studies, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) with administration of faeces from&#xD;
      healthy donors can alter the microbiota. Treatment with faecal microbiota transplantation is&#xD;
      today known to be the ultimate treatment for antibiotic resistant recurrent bowel infection&#xD;
      with the bacteria Clostridium difficile. It is however still uncertain if faecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation can be used to the treatment of chronic pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study primary aims to investigate if transplantation of faeces from healthy donors&#xD;
      administrated as enemas to patients with chronic pouchitis is superior to placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      treatment study. A positive result from the project will result in an improved treatment to&#xD;
      pouchitis patients. Moreover, repeated long-lasting broad-spectrum treatments with&#xD;
      antibiotic, which carry a high risk of antibiotic resistance in the society, will be avoided.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut dysbiosis plays a significant causal role in chronic pouchitis. Modulating the gut&#xD;
      microbiota using FMT has a clinical effect by inducing clinical remission in patients with&#xD;
      chronic pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the MicroPouch-trial is to investigate if transplantation (FMT) of faeces from&#xD;
      healthy donors to patients with chronic pouchitis is clinical significant to placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal microbiota transplantation is performed with faeces from healthy donors. Potential&#xD;
      donors are recruited from the Danish Blood Bank. They are screened for a various of&#xD;
      infectious diseases by serum analysis (haematology, inflammation, liver and kidney function,&#xD;
      HIV, Hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and HbA1c) and faeces analysis&#xD;
      (calprotectin, Clostridium difficile (PCR), enteric pathogenic bacteria and&#xD;
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria, parasites, cysts, and viruses). Furthermore, the potential&#xD;
      donors will complete an extensive questionnaire regarding general health, risk factors and&#xD;
      medical history, before they can be included as faecal donors in the project. The screening&#xD;
      procedure is based on recommendation from the European FMT Working Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transplantation is performed by enemas, which contain either faeces from the faecal&#xD;
      donors or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial before the treatment with either donor faeces or placebo, the patient will be invited&#xD;
      for serum analysis (CRP, leukocytes) and faecal analysis (calprotectin, Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile, enteric pathogenic bacteria), followed by a pouchoscopy with collection of&#xD;
      biopsies. Materials from serum- and faecal analysis and biopsies will be stored for later&#xD;
      analysis purpose. The patient will further complete questionnaires concerning symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life. The stage of disease will be evaluated based on the acknowledged&#xD;
      questionnaire for pouchitis called Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment begins after all the initial examinations, and the patient will be treated&#xD;
      during one month. The treatment consists of daily enema infusion, which either contain faeces&#xD;
      from the faecal donors or placebo. During the treatment, the patient will daily record&#xD;
      symptoms related to pouchitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding per rectum, fever, general&#xD;
      discomfort) and possible adverse effects to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment, the patient will meet to a follow-up examination including serum&#xD;
      analysis (CRP, leukocytes) and faecal analysis (calprotectin), pouchoscopy incl. biopsies,&#xD;
      and the questionnaires applied before the treatment. Materials from serum- and faecal&#xD;
      analysis and biopsies will be stored for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed up with serum- and faecal analysis and pouchoscopy after&#xD;
      additional 6 and 12 months to evaluate the long term effect of the transplantation. The&#xD;
      consumption of antibiotics during the first year will be recorded. In case of lacking effect&#xD;
      of faecal microbiota transplantation, the patient is offered standard antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      for pouchitis, and will leave the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal samples and biopsies collected in the study will be analyzed for the composition of&#xD;
      the microbiota.&#xD;
