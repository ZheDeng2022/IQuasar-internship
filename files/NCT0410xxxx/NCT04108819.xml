  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a condition that occurs in small percentage of&#xD;
      obese people that causes high carbon dioxide and low oxygen levels in the blood. OHS is&#xD;
      associated with respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, and death. The cause of OHS is&#xD;
      unclear. Since not all obese people develop OHS, it is believed that hormone imbalances can&#xD;
      contribute to the breathing problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some diets can change the body's hormones. For example, low-carbohydrate, high fat&#xD;
      &quot;ketogenic&quot; diets (KD) may decrease insulin and glucose levels and increase sensitivity to&#xD;
      other hormones. The investigators hypothesize that a KD will improve breathing in OHS&#xD;
      patients, even in the absence of weight loss.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a condition that occurs in small percentage of&#xD;
      obese people, that leads to high carbon dioxide levels and low oxygen levels in the blood.&#xD;
      OHS is associated with respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, hospital admissions, and&#xD;
      death. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for OHS besides massive weight loss which often&#xD;
      requires bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators are examining whether switching from a regular diet to a&#xD;
      ketogenic diet will improve breathing, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels in OHS patients.&#xD;
      After a few days-weeks on KD, hormone changes are known to occur and the investigators are&#xD;
      examining whether these hormonal changes could stimulate breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to examine the effects of a 12 day KD on OHS. The outcomes of the study&#xD;
      include blood oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, plasma levels of hormones such as insulin,&#xD;
      leptin, sleep studies, body composition a, weight, and metabolic rate.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obesity (BMIâ‰¥30 kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypercapnia (PaCO2&gt;45 or PvCO2&gt;50) on blood gas, OR a sleep study with&#xD;
             end-tidal/transcutaneous CO2 monitoring showing an awake CO2 level &gt;50&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants without blood gas data may also have suspected OHS on the basis of serum&#xD;
             bicarbonate &gt;=28 mEq/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of an alternative pulmonary diagnosis that adequately explains hypercapnia. Note&#xD;
             that a documented pulmonary diagnosis (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
             (COPD) or asthma) per se will not necessarily exclude subjects, since OHS is often&#xD;
             misdiagnosed as obstructive lung disease. Functional or radiographic data must&#xD;
             corroborate the presence of the alternate diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have had a sleep study and clinical evaluation for sleep apnea. Most&#xD;
             subjects with OHS are expected to have concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This&#xD;
             information is necessary to determine whether continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
             (CPAP)/noninvasive ventilation (NIV) will be used on the research sleep studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant participation in another weight loss or diet program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diabetes taking Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (due&#xD;
             to risk of diabetic ketoacidosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patients with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with incomplete sleep apnea diagnosis or management (i.e. those still&#xD;
             acclimating to CPAP, or pending therapeutic decisions about OSA management)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected abuse of narcotics or alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled gout&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic renal insufficiency requiring dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or intending to become pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Food allergies or diet restrictions that research nutritionists cannot accommodate&#xD;
