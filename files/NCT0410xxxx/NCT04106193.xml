  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20% of women Veterans (WV) using VHA primary care experience past-year intimate partner&#xD;
      violence (IPV), which contributes to numerous physical and mental health conditions,&#xD;
      including suicidality. Despite national recommendations to screen WVs for IPV, there is low&#xD;
      adoption of IPV screening programs in primary care. In response, VHA is spreading IPV&#xD;
      screening programs in Women's Health Model 1 and Model 2 primary care clinics, where the&#xD;
      majority of WV VHA primary care patients receive care. The systematic and effective&#xD;
      implementation of IPV screening programs within primary care clinics is expected to enhance&#xD;
      care for WVs as well as improve access to, and timeliness of, IPV-related care. Given the&#xD;
      high prevalence of IPV among WVs and its significant negative health effects, successful&#xD;
      implementation of IPV screening programs is expected to reduce morbidity among WV VHA&#xD;
      patients. This stepped wedge hybrid II implementation/effectiveness study will assess efforts&#xD;
      to implement routine IPV screening for WV VHA patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common among women Veterans (WVs), with nearly&#xD;
      20% of WVs treated in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care clinics experiencing&#xD;
      past-year IPV. VHA's Women's Health Services (WHS), the IPV Assistance Program, and the&#xD;
      Offices of Primary Care and Mental Health and Suicide Prevention developed recommendations&#xD;
      for implementing IPV screening programs in primary care. More than two-thirds of WV primary&#xD;
      care patients receive care in &quot;Model 1&quot; (i.e., mixed-gender primary care) and &quot;Model 2&quot;&#xD;
      (i.e., separate but shared space) clinics, but uptake of screening is low in these clinics.&#xD;
      WHS therefore plans to use Blended Facilitation (BF) to roll out IPV screening programs in&#xD;
      Model 1 and Model 2 primary care clinics. Given the high number of these clinics throughout&#xD;
      VHA, it is unclear whether resource-intensive BF is feasible and whether a less intensive&#xD;
      strategy (i.e., toolkit + Implementation as Usual [IAU]) can be effective. Research is also&#xD;
      needed on the clinical effectiveness of IPV screening programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: Given the high prevalence of IPV among WVs and its significant health&#xD;
      effects, successful implementation of IPV screening programs is expected to improve&#xD;
      healthcare services and reduce morbidity among WV VHA patients, an HSR&amp;D priority area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This study will be the most comprehensive evaluation of both the implementation&#xD;
      impact and clinical effectiveness of IPV screening programs globally. It is innovative in its&#xD;
      inclusion of four strong VHA operations partners dedicated to successful implementation of&#xD;
      IPV screening programs. This project capitalizes on a time-sensitive opportunity to advance&#xD;
      IPV screening programs and implementation science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: This objective of this proposal is to comprehensively evaluate two strategies&#xD;
      for implementing IPV screening programs through achieving three specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the degree of reach, adoption, implementation fidelity, and maintenance&#xD;
           achieved using two implementation strategies for IPV screening programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of IPV screening programs, as evidenced by&#xD;
           disclosure rates and post-screening psychosocial service use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify multi-level barriers to and facilitators of IPV screening program&#xD;
           implementation and sustainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The investigators propose a cluster randomized, stepped wedge, Hybrid Type II&#xD;
      program evaluation design to compare the impact of two implementation strategies (BF +&#xD;
      toolkit vs. toolkit + IAU) and the clinical effectiveness of IPV screening programs. This&#xD;
      study will use a mixed methods approach to collect quantitative (clinical records data) and&#xD;
      qualitative (key informant interviews) implementation outcomes (Aims 1 and 3), as well as&#xD;
      quantitative (clinical records data) clinical effectiveness outcomes (Aim 2). The&#xD;
      investigators will supplement these data collection methods with surveys to assess&#xD;
      implementation strategies survey to be completed pre-BF, post-BF, and in the maintenance&#xD;
      phase. The integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services&#xD;
      (i-PARIHS) framework will guide the qualitative data collection and analysis. Summative data&#xD;
      will be analyzed using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM)&#xD;
      Framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next Steps/Implementation: This study's four VHA operations partners are eager to use the&#xD;
      study results to inform future implementation strategies and clinical practices to spread IPV&#xD;
      screening programs to all VHA primary care clinics and other clinical settings so that this&#xD;
      vital intervention is accessible to all WV VHA patients.&#xD;
