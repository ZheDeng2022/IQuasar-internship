  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with dementia exhibit a wide range of behavioral symptoms which include mood&#xD;
      disturbances (e.g depression, anxiety), behavior and activity disturbances (e.g agitation,&#xD;
      aggression, wandering) and psychotic symptoms (e.g hallucinations and delusions). Behavioral&#xD;
      disturbances are a major source of caregiver burden and an important contributor to the&#xD;
      decision to admit AD patients to institutionalized long-term care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the innovative approaches, rocking chair therapy has been introduced as a potential&#xD;
      means for reducing agitation in elderly with dementia. Only few studies evaluated the effect&#xD;
      of this therapy on the behavioral symptoms in elderly with cognitive impairment. The results&#xD;
      were promising, but not sufficiently significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to perform this study having as a main goal to evaluate the effect of the rocking&#xD;
      chair therapy in agitation for home care residents with dementia. The secondary aim of the&#xD;
      study will be the evaluation of psychoactive drugs use as well as pain killers. Cohen&#xD;
      Mansfield agitation inventory will be employed for the pre- and post-therapy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included subjects will be installed in groups of five, rocking chairs will be placed away&#xD;
      from other residents in a semicircle in a corner of the dayroom. The therapy sessions will be&#xD;
      held every afternoon, for two hours, under the supervision of the unit psychologist and a&#xD;
      master's degree psychology student. During the daily session, each resident should be&#xD;
      encouraged to actively rock to reach the goal of 60 minutes of rocking accumulated per day.&#xD;
      The total duration of the therapy period will be 6 weeks. The use of pharmacological&#xD;
      restraint (neuroleptics, anxiolytics) and pain killers will be evaluated before, during and&#xD;
      after the six weeks therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome is a reduction of agitation among elderly with dementia, as well as a&#xD;
      reduction in the use of pharmacological restraint and pain killers.&#xD;
