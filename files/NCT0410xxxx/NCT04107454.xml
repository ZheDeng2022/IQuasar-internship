      Aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the laser treatment in vulvar LS,&#xD;
      mainly the reduction of existing symptoms. As measured by visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      symptoms as itching, burning, pain will be determined six weeks after the last laser&#xD;
      treatment. Secondary endpoints will be sexual function measured with the female sexual&#xD;
      function index (FSFI) and the vulvar skin changes measured by the Lichen score (LS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular photo-documentation of the treated skin will demonstrate a potential change of the&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a vulvar dermatosis that changes the skin to white plaques&#xD;
      (lichenification), less elasticity (sclerosis) and the tissue shows contractions with&#xD;
      erosions and fissures. Gold standard for the therapy of LS is the topical application of&#xD;
      ultrapotent corticosteroids, proper treatment reverses the underlying inflammation of LS,&#xD;
      reduces symptoms as itching and burning and may lower the risk of getting vulvar cancer.&#xD;
      While useful, steroid creams may have serious side effects that include thinning of the skin,&#xD;
      fungal infections, and lowering the immune system. Treatment with the fractional&#xD;
      microablative carbodioxide Laser is a minimal invasive procedure. In the literature only few&#xD;
      published reliable data in laser therapy of vulvar skin diseases can be found, there is only&#xD;
      one survey especially for the treatment of vulvar LS. However, published data show a&#xD;
      potential that justifies the use of this method for the indication in treating LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the laser treatment in vulvar LS,&#xD;
      mainly the reduction of existing symptoms. But there is little comparable data, so the&#xD;
      necessary frequency of treatment, the dose of laser application, additional use of&#xD;
      corticosteroid or the sustainability is not yet known&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the laser treatment in vulvar LS,&#xD;
      mainly the reduction of existing symptoms. As measured by visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      symptoms as itching, burning, pain will be determined six weeks after the last laser&#xD;
      treatment. Secondary endpoints will be sexual function measured with the female sexual&#xD;
      function index (FSFI) and the vulvar skin changes measured by the Lichen score (LS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular photo-documentation of the treated skin will demonstrate a potential change of the&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be the outcome after laser application, the change in symptoms between&#xD;
      both groups. As secondary endpoint it is important to see, weather sexual functions will be&#xD;
      influenced in this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomized placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All patients are treated in the dysplasia unit of the university&#xD;
      gynecological hospital of Bern. They have a histological confirmation of LS or a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of LS according to the lichen-score. Informed consent will be oral and written. The&#xD;
      minimum age is 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Pregnancy, local bacterial or parasitical infection, others severe&#xD;
      dermatosis, Lichen-score &lt; 5, vulvar cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who qualify for the study and signed informed consent will be grouped by&#xD;
      computer-controlled randomization. All of them are informed, that they have to take part in&#xD;
      three sequent sessions of treatment in the interval of three weeks and the defined follow&#xD;
      -ups after six and twelve weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The session starts with the application of an ointment for a local anesthesia in the vulvar&#xD;
      region. Meanwhile they will answer the questionnaires (VAS for recording the vulvar symptoms,&#xD;
      FSFI for the documentation of the sexual function, another questionnaire to evaluate the&#xD;
      present situation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After about 20 minutes the gynecologist will start the examination with a photo documentation&#xD;
      of the vulva, then the laser application of the vulva is following. After the treatment a&#xD;
      cream of silversulfadiazine (Flammazine) will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All personal data of the patients will be anonymized. The study specific intervention is an&#xD;
      application of laser radiation on the vulvar skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The used laser instrument for this specific intervention is a microablative fractional CO2&#xD;
      laser designed as SmartXide Touch C60, CO2 laser system for MonaLisa Touch, DEKA, Florence.&#xD;
      For the vulvar use the Hi-Scan V2LR scanning system has to be connected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser setting is: Power 24 W, exposure time 400 microsec, density 6,4 %, pulse energy&#xD;
      23,2 mJ, fluenz 1,18J/cm2, emission mode DP, DOZ Dwell 400, DOT spacing 1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projected are three sequent sessions in three weeks intervals. Application time takes&#xD;
      approximately five minutes for the whole vulvar skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare two groups of patients, both fulfil the same criteria as a&#xD;
      histological confirmation of LS or a clinical diagnosis of LS according to the lichen-score.&#xD;
      They will be grouped by computer-controlled randomization in an active group and in a placebo&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active group will be treated by radiation with a real dose: power 24 W, exposure time 400&#xD;
      microsec, DOT spacing 1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo group will be treated with a sham dose: power 0, 5 W, exposure time 400 microsec,&#xD;
      DOT spacing 1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups undergo the same procedures, they will have the same application time and&#xD;
      application area. Except of the different radiation dose they undergo the same regimen.&#xD;
