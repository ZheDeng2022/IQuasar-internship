  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is the symptomatic expression of a muscular or an articular&#xD;
      impairment at the manducatory tract. TMD affects between 30 to 65% of the population with a&#xD;
      higher prevalence for young women. The patients with DTM report a decrease of their personal,&#xD;
      social and professional quality of life. Treatment usually relies on physical therapy. Among&#xD;
      the different technics that can be used in physical therapy, there is growing evidence&#xD;
      advocating the efficacy of using motor imagery (i.e. imagining a movement with no concomitant&#xD;
      physical execution) during rehabilitation. It has also been shown that the benefits of&#xD;
      practicing motor imagery depend on the ability (i.e., the higher the ability, the greater the&#xD;
      benefits). However, there is no investigation of the motor imagery ability of the tongue and&#xD;
      mouth movements conditioning the use of motor imagery during TMD rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to investigate the ability of imagining tongue and mouth movements&#xD;
      using the Tongue and Mouth Imagery Questionnaire (TMIQ) as compare to the gold-standard&#xD;
      Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ - Malouin et al., 2007).&#xD;

      Principal objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the validity construct of the Tongue and Mouth Imagery Questionnaire (TMIQ) as compare&#xD;
      to the gold-standard Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ - Malouin et al.,&#xD;
      2007), both measuring the motor imagery vividness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the reliability of the TMIQ using a test-retest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the temporal coupling (i.e., the ratio between imagined and physically practiced&#xD;
           movement) and compare these ratios for the TMIQ and KVIQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the vividness scores of TMIQ for respectively&#xD;
           subject with and with no TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the vividness scores of KVIQ for respectively&#xD;
           subject with and with no TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the temporal coupling scores of TMIQ for&#xD;
           respectively subject with and with no TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the temporal coupling scores of KVIQ for&#xD;
           respectively subject with and with no TMD.&#xD;
