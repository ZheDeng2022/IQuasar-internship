  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study two different tablets for oral use of a known investigational medicinal&#xD;
      product, called semaglutide, will be tested. Besides semaglutide, the current version of the&#xD;
      tablet contains 300 mg SNAC and 3 helping agents, while the new version of the tablet&#xD;
      contains 300 mg SNAC and only one helping agent. Both are for the treatment of diabetes.&#xD;
      Currently, semaglutide is only prescribed as injections for the treatment of diabetes in some&#xD;
      countries. Semaglutide cannot yet be prescribed as a tablet. The aim of this study is to find&#xD;
      out if the dosage strength of the current formulation of semaglutide can be reduced in the&#xD;
      new tablet formulation. For this purpose, it will be measured how much semaglutide is taken&#xD;
      up in the body from the two (2) different tablet formulations each with three (3) different&#xD;
      dosage strengths. Participants will get semaglutide in the current tablet formulation and in&#xD;
      a new formulation - in which order they receive the two different formulations is decided by&#xD;
      chance. Participants will get one tablet per day over 4 weeks in each of the 3 treatment&#xD;
      periods (i.e. treatment for a total of 12 weeks). The tablets should be taken in the morning&#xD;
      together with half a glass of water (120 mL), after an overnight fast of at least 6 hours (no&#xD;
      food or drinks). Furthermore, water is not allowed from 2 hours before dosing. After dosing&#xD;
      participants must wait 30 minutes before they may eat or drink. At home, they must take their&#xD;
      breakfast 30-45 minutes after dosing.&#xD;
