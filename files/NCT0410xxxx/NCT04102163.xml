  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of treatment (medical and/or surgical) on&#xD;
      Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in participants with Crohn's Disease (CD) and Complex&#xD;
      Perianal Fistula (CPF), by the Quality of Life in patients with Anal Fistula Questionnaire&#xD;
      (QoLAF-Q), at 12 months after treatment initiation in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective follow-up post-authorization observational study of participants with&#xD;
      CD and CPF. The study will provide real-world data on how CPF treatments in CD participants&#xD;
      affect their HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 300 participants. All participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      one observational cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain. The study will collect data from a&#xD;
      routine medical practice visits for CD participants with CPF and an application that will be&#xD;
      designed ad hoc and will passively record participant's data. The overall duration of this&#xD;
      study will be approximately 31 months. Participants will be followed up at Months 6 and 12&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D- is a generic, self-reported measure of utility that consists of a five-item descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system has two versions, namely the 3L and 5L, both involving five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). In the EQ-5D-5L that will be used, participants may choose from the following five response levels: no problems=1; slight problems=2; moderate problems=3; severe problems=4; and unable to/extreme problems=5.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Scores at Months 6 and 12 After Treatment for CPF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS assesses participant's perceived nonspecific stress in a given situation or a daily life situation. The overall score of the scale is measured on a 14-item scale (from 0 to 4 points). Each item is scored 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Total score is obtained by inverting the scores on items 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 y 13 (as follows: 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1 y 4=0) and summing up the scores of the 14 items. Higher total scores indicate higher perceived stress.</description>

A score of 0 to 5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions that examine the 4 main domains of male sexual function: Erectile Function (EF), Orgasmic Function (OF), Sexual Desire (SD) and Intercourse Satisfaction (IS). EF has five categories: 1-10(Severe Erectile Dysfunction), 11-16(Moderate dysfunction), 17-21(Mild to moderate dysfunction), 22-25(Mild dysfunction), 26-30 (No dysfunction). OF: sum of Questions (Q) 9 and Q10, each rated 0 (no sexual stimulation) to 5 (almost always/always). OF domain score range: 0 to 10; lower scores denoted lower OF. SD: sum of Q11 and Q12, each rated 1 (almost never or low/no sexual desire) to 5 (almost always or very high sexual desire). SD domain score range: 2 to 10;lower scores denoted lower SD. IS: sum of Q6, Q7, and Q8, each rated 0 (low/no satisfaction) to 5 (high satisfaction). IS domain score range: 0 to 15; lower scores denoted lower satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FSFI is a 19-item multidimensional self-report questionnaire for the assessment of female sexual function. It has five domains of sexual function, including: desire and subjective arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain/discomfort. FSFI is scored on a scale ranging from 1.2 to 6.0 (desire), 0 to 6.0 (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and pain/discomfort) or 0.8 to 6.0 (satisfaction), with higher scores indicating better performance. The total score, falling in a possible range from 2.0 to 36.0, is obtained by adding the six domain scores together.</description>
