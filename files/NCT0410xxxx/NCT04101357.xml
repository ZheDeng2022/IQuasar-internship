    <textblock>
      This first-in-human (FIH) trial aims to establish a safe dose of BNT411 as a monotherapy and&#xD;
      in combination with atezolizumab, carboplatin and etoposide. BNT411 is a toll-like receptor 7&#xD;
      (TLR7) agonist which is expected to mount broad innate and adaptive immune reactions,&#xD;
      especially in combination with cytotoxic therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
