      This trial examines the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) versus risperidone for treatment of&#xD;
      psychosis and cessation of cannabis use in patients with recent-onset psychosis and comorbid&#xD;
      cannabis use.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with psychosis and comorbid cannabis use are particularly difficult to treat because&#xD;
      cannabis use worsens psychotic symptoms and increases the risk that a first-episode psychosis&#xD;
      will progress to schizophrenia. It is the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in cannabis that&#xD;
      aggravates psychotic symptoms whereas the CBD content has potential therapeutic effects. This&#xD;
      trial investigates treatment with CBD (without THC) versus risperidone (an antipsychotic&#xD;
      agent) in people with psychosis and comorbid cannabis use. We hypothesize that CBD will&#xD;
      ameliorate psychotic symptoms and increase the probability of cannabis cessation to a larger&#xD;
      extent than risperidone. Sleep disturbances are often a limiting factor in the treatment of&#xD;
      psychosis, and it is also examined how CBD affects objective and subjective sleep quality as&#xD;
      well as circadian rest-activity cycles. Based on previous studies investigating CBD as&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with schizophrenia, it is expected that CBD will be associated with&#xD;
      fewer adverse events than risperidone.&#xD;

    <description>Symptomatic remission is defined according to the Andreasen et al remission criteria. The criteria define symptomatic remission as a rating of no more than mild in four core positive and four core negative symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (P1, P2 P3, N1, N4, N6, G5, G9,) that is sustained for ≥6 months. Because of the duration of this study, the requirement of 6 month will not be considered.</description>

    <description>Global illness severity is assessed with the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). We will use the severity (CGI-S) at baseline and improvement (CGI-I) scores of the CGI at the following visits. Response will be defined as much improved or better on the CGI-I. The main item 'severity of illness' is measured on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 'normal, not at all ill' to 7 'among the most extremely ill patients').</description>
