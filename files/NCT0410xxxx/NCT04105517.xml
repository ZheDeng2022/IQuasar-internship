  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile hemangioma is a benign tumor belonging to the group of vascular tumors in the ISSVA&#xD;
      classification (International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies). The diagnosis is&#xD;
      clinical and radiological. The hemangioma appears during the first weeks of life (70%&#xD;
      classically within 2 weeks after birth) but can, when it develops in the subcutaneous tissue,&#xD;
      appear until the age of 2 to 3 months .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its evolution is characteristic and is divided into 3 phases with a proliferative phase&#xD;
      characterized by a rapid increase in the size of the tumor (up to 6 to 12 months), a phase of&#xD;
      stabilization (from 12 to 36 months) with a stopping of the growth of the hemangioma and a&#xD;
      regression of its size and a phase of involution with the disappearance of the lesion which&#xD;
      may give way to residual fibroadipose tissue, cutaneous telangiectases, scars … The usual&#xD;
      complications of haemangiomas occur during the proliferative phase. It is necrosis,&#xD;
      ulcerations that can be complicated by bleeding or infection and eventually indelible&#xD;
      scarring. Other complications related to the site of development of hemangiomas (amblyopia,&#xD;
      astigmatism, upper respiratory obstruction, nasal obstruction, sphincter disorders, eating&#xD;
      disorders), hemangiomas destroying structures noble (breast hypodévelopment, alopecia). The&#xD;
      aesthetic prognosis can be seriously compromised for facial locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, when drug therapy was required, patient management was based on systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids (at doses of 3 to 5 mg / kg / day) in first-line therapy and vincristine as a&#xD;
      second-line failure of corticosteroid therapy or when life-threatening is at stake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, the high French health authority (HAS) gave Marketing Authorization for Hemangiol&#xD;
      3.75 mg / ml oral solution for the management of infantile proliferative hemangioma requiring&#xD;
      first-line systemic treatment, evaluating the actual benefit as important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected indication concerns children from 5 weeks to 5 months with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemangiomas leading to a vital or functional risk,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemangiomas ulcerated painful and / or not responding to simple care,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemangiomas with a risk of permanent scarring or disfigurement. The 2014 HAS&#xD;
           Transparency Commission wishes in its report &quot;to have follow-up data of prescriptions&#xD;
           allowing to describe on a representative sample of patients, the characteristics of the&#xD;
           treated patients, the indication, the doses and the durations of treatment of this&#xD;
           specialty &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to describe the use of Hemangiol in current practice in our&#xD;
      hospital from 2014 to 2018.&#xD;

      This study is retrospective, longitudinal, descriptive and observational. Children aged 0 to&#xD;
      1 years hospitalized for introduction of Hemangiol between January 2014 and November 2018&#xD;
      will be included. Patients refuse the use of medical data will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to describe the population who received Hemangiol. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives is to evaluate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effectiveness of Hemangiol on proliferative infantile hemangiomas, -the tolerance of&#xD;
           Hemangiol in children with proliferative infantile hemangiomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the interest of systematic cardiological consultation in children with proliferative&#xD;
           infantile hemangiomas receiving Hemangiol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic description: age, sex, height, weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the hemangioma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  organ concerned: skin, liver, parotid, mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  location: head, thorax, pelvis, limbs, diffuse ...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  single or multiple&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  indication of treatment: aesthetic, functional, ulcerated, cardiac hyperacidity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhythm of follow-up: duration of treatment and observance of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescribed dose: 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg / kg / day in 2 doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolution of the hemangioma: progression, regression, stagnation. Needed a second medical&#xD;
      therapeutic line by specifying the treatment introduced. Necessity of surgical management by&#xD;
      specifying the delay between surgery and the introduction of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of serious adverse events: hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
      Description of other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of cardio-pediatric consultations, specifying:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of diagnosed heart disease through systematic cardiac consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effect on ECG data of increasing dosage of Hemangiol: heart rate, PR duration, QRS&#xD;
           duration, QT duration&#xD;
