  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of the use of an investigational drug that selectively delivers&#xD;
      radiation to malignant tumor cells, CLR 131, in combination with external beam radiation&#xD;
      therapy (EBRT) in subjects with locoregionally recurrent head and neck cancer. The trial will&#xD;
      enroll up to 24 participants who are amenable to retreatment with radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Participants who also have distant metastatic disease may be enrolled on this clinical trial,&#xD;
      but they must have evaluable disease that will be clinically treated with radiation therapy,&#xD;
      as per standard of care. All participants will receive a dosimetry test dose of CLR 131 to&#xD;
      establish drug uptake by the tumor and enable Monte Carlo dose estimation based on CLR 131&#xD;
      SPECT/CT imaging evaluation. Participants showing uptake will receive a cumulative tumor dose&#xD;
      of 60-70 Gy using personalized dose calculation (via Monte Carlo methods) of CLR 131 combined&#xD;
      with external beam radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent, all participants will receive a dosimetry test dose of 15 mCi CLR&#xD;
      131 to establish drug uptake by the tumor and enable Monte Carlo dose estimation based on CLR&#xD;
      131 SPECT/CT imaging evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have uptake of the CLR 131 dosimetry test dose at their disease site as&#xD;
      determined by the study radiologist will be eligible to participate on the treatment portion&#xD;
      of this clinical trial. Participants showing uptake will receive a cumulative tumor dose of&#xD;
      60-70 Gy using personalized dose calculation of CLR 131 (via Monte Carlo) combined with&#xD;
      external beam radiation. In this study, we are also studying a subset of up to 6 patients who&#xD;
      do not uptake after the CLR 131 test dose, who will still proceed with treatment with CLR&#xD;
      131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial involves two cohorts of subjects: (a) dose escalation and (b) dose&#xD;
      expansion. In the dose escalation phase, an mTPI-2 design, an extension of modified toxicity&#xD;
      probability interval (mTPI-2), will be used to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      using cohorts of 4 participants and up to 3 dose levels of CLR 131. Participants in the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase will receive 2 doses of CLR 131 with the first dose on day 1 followed by the&#xD;
      second dose on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with CLR 131 on the dose escalation cohort will begin at dose level 1 (15.6&#xD;
      mCi/m2). Participants at dose level 1 will receive an intravenous infusion of CLR 131 at 15.6&#xD;
      mCi/m2 on day 1 followed by a second dose on day 8. Participants at dose level 2 will receive&#xD;
      an intravenous infusion of CLR 131 at 18.75 mCi/m2 on day 1 followed by a second dose on day&#xD;
      8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is determined by the dose escalation phase, participants will be enrolled on the&#xD;
      dose expansion cohort. Participants on the dose expansion cohort will receive 2 doses of CLR&#xD;
      131 with the first dose on day 1 followed by the second dose on day 8, with the dose&#xD;
      determined by the dose escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECT/CT imaging will be performed on days 2, 3, 4-6, and 7-8 of the treatment period to&#xD;
      visualize and quantitate the biodistribution of CLR 131. Based on these SPECT/CT imaging&#xD;
      scans, the Bednarz lab will utilize the Monte Carlo method to predict absorbed dose of CLR&#xD;
      131 to tumors and normal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will start thyroid-protection medication the day prior to the CLR 131&#xD;
      dosimetry test dose and will continue to take thyroid protection medication for 14 days after&#xD;
      the last CLR 131 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the calculated absorbed dose of CLR 131 to the specific targeted tissue, the&#xD;
      participant will undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to complete the designated&#xD;
      radiation dose outlined in the re-irradiation plan, as per standard of care. Prior to CLR 131&#xD;
      administration and at 3 and 6 months post EBRT, participants will be assessed for changes to&#xD;
      swallow function. Prior to CLR 131 administration and at 3, 6 and 12 months post EBRT,&#xD;
      quality of life measures and salivary characteristics will be assessed. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate the total study (baseline, CLR 131 administration, EBRT and 3, 6, 12 and 24 month&#xD;
      follow up assessments) to take 27 months per participant.&#xD;
