  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biomarkers can be evaluated to provide information about disease presence or intensity and&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. By recording these biomarkers through noninvasive clinical techniques, it&#xD;
      is possible to gain information about the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which involuntarily&#xD;
      regulates and adapts organ systems in the body. Machine learning and signal processing&#xD;
      methods have made it possible to quantify the behavior of the ANS by statistically analyzing&#xD;
      recorded signals. This work will aim to systematically measure ANS function by multiple&#xD;
      modalities and use decoding algorithms to derive an index that reflects overall ANS function&#xD;
      and/or balance in healthy able-bodied individuals. Additionally, this study will determine&#xD;
      how transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), a noninvasive method of&#xD;
      stimulating the vagus nerve without surgery, affects the ANS function. Data from this&#xD;
      research will enable the possibility of detecting early and significant changes in ANS from&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; homeostasis to diagnose disease onset and assess severity to improve treatment&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biomarkers that reflect disease presence or intensity, or treatment efficacy are central to&#xD;
      medical advancements. Recorded biomarkers provide information about physiological processes&#xD;
      regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which include blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      sweating, and body temperature. The ANS has two major divisions: sympathetic and&#xD;
      parasympathetic systems. Most organs receive reciprocal input from both systems to achieve&#xD;
      homeostasis through ANS balance. This regulation occurs without conscious control (i.e.,&#xD;
      autonomously). Dysregulation of the ANS can occur as the result of disorders or injuries,&#xD;
      including diabetes, sepsis, spinal cord injuries (SCI), Parkinson's disease, and many other&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANS is the part of the nervous system that regulates and integrates bodily functions that&#xD;
      typically run involuntary, particularly internal organs including blood vessels, lungs,&#xD;
      pupils, heart, sweat, and salivary glands. Along with immunological systems, it controls and&#xD;
      adapts homeostasis of the internal environment based on changes in the external environment.&#xD;
      Disturbances in autonomic regulation have been described in a variety of diseases and&#xD;
      disorders, including those that directly affect the nervous system, such as spinal cord&#xD;
      injuries and stroke, and those that afflict other organ systems, such as sepsis and&#xD;
      infection, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus, and numerous heart&#xD;
      conditions. This dysregulation manifests differently for each of these conditions, even&#xD;
      inconsistently across patients, and the significance of symptoms due to ANS dysfunction are&#xD;
      not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANS can be divided into two major branches: the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.&#xD;
      All internal organs are innervated by one or both component systems through the ANS main&#xD;
      conduits, which include the brainstem, spinal cord, and cranial nerves, such as the vagus&#xD;
      nerve. The branches typically function opposite and complementary of each other;&#xD;
      physiological changes associated with the sympathetic system include accelerating heart rate,&#xD;
      dilating pupils, and perspiration, while the parasympathetic system slows the heart, lowers&#xD;
      blood pressure, and relaxes muscles. Both systems work in tandem to modulate and maintain&#xD;
      blood pressure, vagal tone, heart rate, respiration, and cardiac contractility. While both&#xD;
      systems operate to maintain homeostasis, the sympathetic system can be considered a quick&#xD;
      response and mobilizing system, while the parasympathetic is a more slowly activated and&#xD;
      dampening system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of measuring the ANS directly from the central or peripheral nervous system through&#xD;
      invasive implants, it is possible to record physiological signals through advances in&#xD;
      noninvasive clinical testing. Laboratories are able to test autonomic function and rely on&#xD;
      batteries of accepted, noninvasive tests. According to the American Academy of Neurology&#xD;
      (AAN), standard techniques of autonomic testing include measuring heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure variability during deep breathing, tilt table, and the Valsalva maneuver to assess&#xD;
      cardiovagal (parasympathetic) and sudomotor (sympathetic) function. It is straightforward to&#xD;
      add to the limited necessary equipment (blood pressure cuff, electrocardiogram [ECG]) by&#xD;
      including electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity, electromyography (EMG) to&#xD;
      measure muscle activity, and eye tracking glasses to measure pupillometry during this&#xD;
      battery. All noninvasive signals can be measured during controlled perturbations to&#xD;
      characterize the ANS. Assessment of ANS function is now used in multiple disciplines,&#xD;
      including neurology, cardiology, psychology, psychophysiology, obstetrics, anesthesiology,&#xD;
      and psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural reflexes control responses in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal,&#xD;
      hepatic, and endocrine systems. The vagus nerve-based inflammatory reflex is of particularly&#xD;
      interest at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and has been shown to regulate&#xD;
      immune function. The nervous system interacts with the immune system by this pathway;&#xD;
      molecular mediators of innate immunity activate afferent signals in the vagus nerve to the&#xD;
      brainstem, which sends efferent signals down the vagus nerve to regulate inflammation and&#xD;
      cytokine release. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to decrease production and&#xD;
      release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; bioelectronic devices have been used in preclinical&#xD;
      and pilot clinical trials to reduce inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The auricular branch of the vagus nerve comes from the vagus and innervates cutaneous areas&#xD;
      of the outer ear. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) offers a&#xD;
      non-invasive means of stimulating the vagus nerve without surgical intervention. The device&#xD;
      consists of a clip that supplies electrical signals to processes of the auricle, and it has&#xD;
      been used in previous clinical studies for multiple conditions, including refractory&#xD;
      epilepsy, depression, pre-diabetes, tinnitus, memory, stroke, oromotor dysfunction, and&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, with additional studies planned for therapy or treatment of stroke,&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. These studies have used a range of electrical&#xD;
      stimulation settings and sites; the mechanism of taVNS and responses are not well understood,&#xD;
      as well as the effects of changes in stimulation parameters on ANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, application of machine learning models and decoding algorithms permits utilizing&#xD;
      commonly used clinical measurement of physiological signals to better understand broader&#xD;
      phenomena of autonomic function and dysregulation. Research has been focused on developing&#xD;
      quantitative standards based on biomarkers to aid with diagnosis, prognosis, and estimates of&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. Autonomic data could potentially capture objective measures of disease&#xD;
      states, and machine learning techniques can be used to extract relevant features towards&#xD;
      building a predictive model of ANS balance. By training such a model on recordings from&#xD;
      healthy, able-bodied individuals, the investigators plan to characterize ANS balance, and&#xD;
      then apply this model to new data sets and individuals to diagnose or predict disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern methods of computational science have been used to decode complex clinical and&#xD;
      experimental data by detecting patterns, classifying signals, and extracting information&#xD;
      towards new knowledge. Through signal processing techniques, it has been possible to decode&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system signals conveyed through the vagus nerve by identifying groups of&#xD;
      vagal neurons that fire in response to the administration of specific cytokines.&#xD;
      Additionally, machine learning has been used to quantify clinical pain using multimodal&#xD;
      autonomic metrics and neuroimaging, and large-scale ambulatory data has been used to monitor&#xD;
      physiological signals and develop multi-sensor models to detect stress in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators want to examine how these measurements are affected by the&#xD;
      use of non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. Stimulation of&#xD;
      the vagus nerve by a surgically implanted stimulator regulates and suppresses&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine release. This has now been used in a successful clinical trial to&#xD;
      treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation of&#xD;
      the vagus nerve has also been showing promising early results, indicating that non-invasive&#xD;
      methods of activating a specific part of the autonomic nervous system can be used&#xD;
      successfully to treat disease. However, real-time biomarkers of efficacy of this treatment&#xD;
      are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the study will develop a framework to decode a multitude of noninvasive physiological&#xD;
      signals during controlled autonomic testing to form a model that can quantify ANS balance, as&#xD;
      well as the effects of taVNS on the system, in healthy and able-bodied individuals. Data&#xD;
      derived from this study will enable the ability to detect early and significant deviations&#xD;
      from &quot;normal&quot; homeostasis and provide novel non-invasive real-time biomarkers that could be&#xD;
      used to assess disease onset or severity, as well as efficacy of a therapy in activating the&#xD;
      ANS in a specific way. In the long-term, this will improve current treatment protocols and&#xD;
      suggest new therapeutic opportunities.&#xD;
