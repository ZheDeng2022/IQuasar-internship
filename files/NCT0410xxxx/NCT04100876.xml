      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), is an immune-mediated acquired disease of adults and children&#xD;
      characterized by transient or persistent decrease of the platelet count and, depending upon&#xD;
      the degree of thrombocytopenia, increased risk of bleeding (Rodeghiero et al., 2009).&#xD;
      International guidelines define thrombocytopenia as a peripheral blood platelet count less&#xD;
      than 100 000/uL (Raj, 2017). Platelet count values between 100 000/uL and 150 000/uL are&#xD;
      frequently found in apparently healthy people (Adibi et al., 2007) and this threshold reduces&#xD;
      the concern over the mild &quot;physiologic&quot; thrombocytopenia associated with pregnancy (Neunert&#xD;
      et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune thrombocytopenia may be primary or secondary. Primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion.&#xD;
      Secondary ITP occur due to an underlying diseases/conditions. Causes of secondary ITP include&#xD;
      infection (CMV, Helicobacter pylori, HCV, HIV, Varicella zoster), Systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus, Antiphospholipid syndrome, Drug-induced, Lymphoproliferative disorders, Post&#xD;
      bone marrow transplantation, and Post vaccination (Neunert et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary ITP is an acquired autoimmune disease causing both increased platelet destruction and&#xD;
      insufficient platelet production. More than one mechanism could contribute to this including&#xD;
      autoreactive B lymphocytes, Th1/Tc1 polarization, T-cell-mediated platelet lysis and abnormal&#xD;
      circulating Treg cells. Also, DNA methylation may participate in the pathophysiology of ITP&#xD;
      (Semple et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA methylation is a heritable, stable, and also reversible way of DNA modification; it can&#xD;
      regulate gene expression without changing the nucleotide sequences (Huiyuan et al., 2013).&#xD;
      DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). There are five members in DNMT&#xD;
      group including DNMT3A and DNMT3B (Okano et al., 1999). DNMT3A and DNMT3B catalyze de novo&#xD;
      methylation and it is important in the establishment of DNA methylation patterns within the&#xD;
      embryo and during fetal development (Sawalha, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA methylation status takes part in the regulation of immune response, the loss of&#xD;
      methylation pattern in immune cells will result in autoimmune disease by inducing aberrant&#xD;
      gene expression. ITP is an autoimmune disease with many immune deficiencies with abnormal DNA&#xD;
      methylation involved in the disease etiology (Huiyuan et al., 2013). Chen et al., 2011,&#xD;
      concluded that aberrant DNA methylation may take part in the pathogenesis of ITP by&#xD;
      quantifying the methylcytosine concentration of genomic DNA. They found hypomethylation&#xD;
      pattern in CD4 T cells of ITP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNMT3A, and DNMT3B DNA methyltransferases are encoded by different genes on distinct&#xD;
      chromosomes (Sawalha, 2008). There are many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNMT3A&#xD;
      gene which may affect catalytic activity of the DNMT3A enzyme, including -448G/A SNP (Zhao et&#xD;
      al., 2012). Twenty-one polymorphisms have been identified in the DNMT3B gene including -149&#xD;
      C/T SNP and -579 G/T SNP (Zhang et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study in Assiut University Hospital (AbdelKader et al., 2018), the DNMT3A -448&#xD;
      G/A SNP variant A allele was significantly associated with decreased risk of primary ITP,&#xD;
      while, DNMT3B -149C/T SNP variant T-allele was significantly associated with nearly&#xD;
      double-fold increase in risk of primary ITP. However, the underlying mechanism behind this&#xD;
      association was not investigated. Authors recommended to study mRNA expression of DNMT genes,&#xD;
      enzymatic activity of DNA methyltransferases, quantification of global methylated DNA, and/or&#xD;
      methylation status of methylation-sensitive genes involved in primary ITP pathogenesis to&#xD;
      understand this association.&#xD;
