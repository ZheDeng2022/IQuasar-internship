      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase I trial and the aim of this trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction and safety with SHR3162 combined with Abiraterone in Metastatic&#xD;
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients. The trial is a dose-escalation and -expansion&#xD;
      study. Approximately 35~38 patients in will receive fixed- dose of orally Abiraterone and&#xD;
      only one of two dose levels of orally SHR3162. The Primary endpoints are incidence of adverse&#xD;
      events(AE) and PK characteristics. The secondary endpoints are efficacy and recommended phase&#xD;
      2 dose(RP2D).&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patients have given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care,with the understanding that&#xD;
