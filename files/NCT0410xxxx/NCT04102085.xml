      The study aims to recruit eligible participants and conduct interviews, collect human milk&#xD;
      samples, and conduct laboratory analysis of persistent organic pollutants' levels in human&#xD;
      milk samples.&#xD;

      Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are a group of chemicals which have been intentionally&#xD;
      or inadvertently produced and introduced into the environment. Due to their stability and&#xD;
      transport properties, they are widely distributed around the world, and are even found in&#xD;
      places where they had never been used, such as the arctic regions. Given their long&#xD;
      half-lives and fat solubility, POPs tend to bioaccumulate in animals, particularly in&#xD;
      long-lived species at the top of the food-chain. POPs appear at higher concentrations in&#xD;
      fat-containing foods, including fish, meat, eggs and milk. POPs are also present in the human&#xD;
      body and traces can be found in human milk. The most commonly mentioned POPs are&#xD;
      organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT, industrial chemicals, most notably polychlorinated&#xD;
      biphenyls (PCBs), and by-products, especially polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and&#xD;
      polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). As a group, POPs are of concern for both the&#xD;
      environment and human health 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the ratification of the Stockholm Convention on POPs in early 2004, the international&#xD;
      community signaled its commitment to reduce or eliminate production and emission of POPs into&#xD;
      the environment and ultimately, the human body. There were 12 POPs initially listed under the&#xD;
      Convention in 2004 2. The Convention is effective to the People's Republic of China,&#xD;
      including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The Environmental Protection&#xD;
      Department (EPD) coordinates the HKSAR Government's efforts for the Convention and prepared&#xD;
      the HKSAR Implementation Plan 3, in which the Department of Health (DH) is required to&#xD;
      conduct the regular local monitoring of POPs in human milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study of POPs in human milk by DH was conducted during 2008 to 2011, which was made&#xD;
      reference to Guidelines for Developing a National Protocol of the Fourth World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) - Coordinated Survey of Human Milk for POPs in Cooperation with United&#xD;
      Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) (2007) 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the first study by DH was published in a scientific journal 5 and submitted to&#xD;
      EPD, which were also discussed in the HKSAR Implementation Plan for the Stockholm Convention&#xD;
      on POPs (2016) 5. Compared to the related earlier local studies 7,8,9 conducted by local&#xD;
      universities, levels of POPs in human milk had declined over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers should be reassured that breast milk is naturally the superior food for infants. The&#xD;
      study is intended to provide data to evaluate the effectiveness of the international&#xD;
      agreement, i.e. the Stockholm Convention, which aims to reduce the levels of certain POPs in&#xD;
      our environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also support national capabilities for monitoring and sound management of&#xD;
      POPs.&#xD;

        Fifty eligible participants (nursing mothers) will be identified during their postnatal&#xD;
        visits at four selected Maternal Child Health Centres (MCHCs) of the Department of Health,&#xD;
        representing four major regions in Hong Kong:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sai Ying Pun MCHC (Hong Kong Island); Kowloon City MCHC (Kowloon); Madam Yung Fung Shee&#xD;
        MCHC (New Territories West); and Ma On Shan MCHC (New Territories East).&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the recruitment is unsatisfactory in the above four centres, other MCHCs will be&#xD;
        involved.&#xD;
