      The primary objective of the study was to provide sera (collected from participants before&#xD;
      vaccination [Blood Sample 1] and after final vaccination [Blood Sample 2]) to the Center for&#xD;
      Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for further analysis by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) to support formulation recommendations for subsequent influenza&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;

      All participants received 1 intramuscular injection of the study vaccine associated with&#xD;
      their assigned group at Visit 1. For participants 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age for whom 2&#xD;
      doses of influenza vaccine are recommended per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&#xD;
      (ACIP) guidance, a second intramuscular injection of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine was&#xD;
      administered at Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens were obtained from all participants prior to the first vaccination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Visit 1 (Day 0) and 28 days following the final vaccination (Visit 2, if no study&#xD;
           vaccine was administered at Visit 2; or Visit 3, if a second dose of study vaccine was&#xD;
           administered at Visit 2), for participants 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age (Group 1 and&#xD;
           Group 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Visit 1 and 21 (window, 21-28) days post-vaccination (Visit 2), for participants&#xD;
           greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 65 years of age (Group 3) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs),&#xD;
           suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), or Adverse Event of Special&#xD;
           Interests (AESIs) were collected from Visit 1 through Visit 2 for participants receiving&#xD;
           1 dose of study vaccine, and from Visit 1 through Visit 3 for participants receiving 2&#xD;
           doses of study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration per participant was approximately 28 days for participants 6 months to less&#xD;
      than (&lt;) 9 years of age, and 21 days for participants &gt;= 65 years of age.&#xD;
