      Nutrition and mindful movement program activities will take place during the school day.&#xD;
      Children will be given the opportunity understand the value of quality nutrition in the&#xD;
      prevention com-morbidities of treatment and poor lifestyle choices. The intervention will&#xD;
      consist of ten sessions. This includes pre- and post-assessments (weeks 1 and 10) and eight&#xD;
      weekly 1-hour interactive culinary medicine education sessions. Children will be asked&#xD;
      questions about their diet, feelings, physical activity. Height, weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      and grip strength will also be measured. This will take about one hour prior to beginning the&#xD;
      education portion of our program. Each week, \a nutrition lecture, a cooking demo and fitness&#xD;
      activities will be completed over two-45 minutes sessions during PE class. These hands-on&#xD;
      applied nutrition sessions include fundamental of nutrition, cooking skills, cooking skills,&#xD;
      and activities. Experiential or hands-on applied learning, including culturally appropriate&#xD;
      meal preparation and personalized nutrition and mindful movements, represents a potential&#xD;
      tool to increase adolescent health literacy as well as empower adolescent to engage their&#xD;
      families. Cooking as medicine helps people make the healthy behavior changes they are seeking&#xD;
      because it allows hands-on teaching and learning in a fun interactive environment, without&#xD;
      stigma. This strategy encompasses combination of thinking and doing skills that are applied&#xD;
      during home food preparation, as well as conceptual and perceptual abilities on food&#xD;
      handling, safety and storage, and other factors related to nutrition. The delivery of cooking&#xD;
      as medicine programs serves as a way to improve and promote confidence, well-being, and&#xD;
      enhance meal quality and preparation practices and offer a valuable platform to engage&#xD;
      children and families via inclusive social activities, whilst positively impacting their&#xD;
      dietary profiles and health outcomes.&#xD;
