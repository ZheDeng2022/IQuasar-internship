  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect on Arabinoxylan on gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) tolerance, bowel habits, and microbiota in adults. The study is a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover, single-center trial with 3 study periods separated by minimum&#xD;
      2-week washout periods. 45 healthy adults will be recruited for the trial. Participants will&#xD;
      be required to drink a beverage twice a day for 3 weeks during each study period. The&#xD;
      beverage will contain either approximately 7.25 grams of Arabinoxylan leaf fiber extract per&#xD;
      day, or approximately 14.5 grams of Arabinoxylan leaf fiber extract per day, or will not&#xD;
      contain any Arabinoxylan (control). Subjects will record their bowel movements daily, fill&#xD;
      out daily questionnaires about their gastrointestinal systems, and record their food intake&#xD;
      at specified times during the study. Stool samples will also be collected prior to and at the&#xD;
      end of each study period for analysis of bacteria composition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-center trial with one&#xD;
      screening visit (Visit 1; Week -1) and 3 test periods [Test Period 1 (Visits 2 and 3; Weeks 0&#xD;
      to 3), Test Period 2 (Visits 4 and 5; Weeks 5 to 8), and Test Period 3 (Visits 6 and 7; Weeks&#xD;
      10 to 13)] separated by minimum 2-week washout periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (Week -1), subjects will provide informed consent and undergo assessments of&#xD;
      medical history and prior, current medication/supplement use, and inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and a last menses query, where applicable. Additionally, height, body weight, and&#xD;
      vital signs will be measured and BMI will be calculated. Fasting (12 ± 2 h) blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected for chemistry and hematology, and female subjects will undergo an in-clinic&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test. Subjects will be instructed to maintain physical activity and habitual&#xD;
      diet as much as possible with the exception of excluding fermented foods or beverages that do&#xD;
      or might contain live probiotics (e.g., yogurt, kombucha). Subjects will be dispensed a&#xD;
      Baseline Diet Diary with instructions to record intake 7 days prior to Visit 2 (Week 0).&#xD;
      Subjects will also be dispensed a Bowel Habits Diary and Daily GI Tolerance Questionnaire&#xD;
      with instructions to complete these during the 7 days prior to Visit 2 (Week 0). Finally,&#xD;
      subjects will be dispensed a stool collection kit and will be instructed to collect one fecal&#xD;
      sample from one bowel movement during the 3 days prior to Visit 2 (Week 0). Subjects will be&#xD;
      reminded that they are not required to fast prior to Visit 2 (Week 0) and will be encouraged&#xD;
      to eat breakfast prior to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects will arrive at the clinic to undergo clinic visit procedures&#xD;
      (concomitant medication/supplement use, assess inclusion/exclusion criteria, body weight and&#xD;
      vital signs measurements, last menses query, where applicable). Subjects will be queried&#xD;
      about compliance with study instructions. The fecal sample will be collected and the Bowel&#xD;
      Habits Diary, Baseline Diet Diary, and Daily GI Tolerance Questionnaire will be collected and&#xD;
      reviewed. Subjects will be assigned to a randomization sequence. The first study product&#xD;
      consumption will occur in the clinic and subject will be dispensed the remaining study&#xD;
      products according to their assigned randomization sequence for home consumption (twice a&#xD;
      day, once in the morning and once in the evening, with or without food). Subjects who&#xD;
      consumed breakfast at home prior to arriving at the clinic will be administered the study&#xD;
      product alone while those who did not consume breakfast prior to arriving at the clinic will&#xD;
      be administered the study product with a snack. Subjects will also be dispensed a Study&#xD;
      Product Diary to record study product intake. Subjects will be dispensed a copy of the last 5&#xD;
      days of their completed Baseline Diet Diary (reviewed at Visit 2, Week 0) and will be&#xD;
      instructed to replicate the same food and beverage intake as closely as possible during the&#xD;
      days prior to the collection of their fecal sample, which will occur during the 3 days&#xD;
      immediately prior to Visit 3 (Week 3). Additionally, subjects will be dispensed 3-day&#xD;
      Analysis Diet Records with instructions to record all food and beverages consumed during 3&#xD;
      days (2 weekdays and one weekend) following Visit 2 (Week 0) and before Visit 3 (Week 3) that&#xD;
      do not coincide with the 5 replication days immediately prior to Visit 3 (Week 3). Subjects&#xD;
      will be dispensed a Bowel Habits Diary and stool collection kit, and will be instructed to&#xD;
      complete the Bowel Habits Diary during the 7 days immediately prior to Visit 3 (Week 3) and&#xD;
      to collect a fecal sample from one bowel movement during the 3 days immediately prior to&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Week 3). Subjects will also be dispensed a Daily GI Tolerance Questionnaire with&#xD;
      instructions to complete the questionnaire daily starting from Visit 2 (Week 0) up to Visit 3&#xD;
      (Week 3). Finally, study instructions will also be provided [(i.e., overnight fasting (12 ± 2&#xD;
      h, water only), maintenance of physical activity with the exception of avoiding vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity for 24 h prior; maintenance of habitual diet as much as possible with the&#xD;
      exception of avoiding alcohol for 24 h prior and excluding fermented foods or beverages that&#xD;
      do or might contain live probiotics (e.g., yogurt, kombucha) and consumption of study&#xD;
      products].&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 (Week 3), subjects will arrive at the clinic to undergo clinic visit procedures&#xD;
      (concomitant medication/supplement use, assess inclusion/exclusion criteria, body weight, and&#xD;
      vital signs measurements, last menses query, where applicable) and adverse event (AE)&#xD;
      assessments. Subjects will be queried about compliance with study instructions and diet&#xD;
      replication. Fasting (12 ± 2 h) blood samples will be collected for chemistry and hematology.&#xD;
      Fecal samples will be collected and the Bowel Habits Diary, Daily GI Tolerance Questionnaire,&#xD;
      and the 3-day Analysis Diet Record will be collected and reviewed. The Study Product Diary&#xD;
      will be collected/reviewed, any unused study products will be collected, and compliance with&#xD;
      study product consumption will be assessed. The Product Likeability Questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered in clinic. Subjects will be dispensed a stool collection kit and will be&#xD;
      instructed to collect a fecal sample from one bowel movement during the 3 days immediately&#xD;
      prior to Visit 4 (Week 5). Subjects will also be dispensed a copy of the last 5 days of their&#xD;
      completed Baseline Diet Diary (reviewed at Visit 2, Week 0) and will be instructed to&#xD;
      replicate the same food and beverage intake as closely as possible during the days prior to&#xD;
      the collection of their fecal sample, which will occur during the 3 days immediately prior to&#xD;
      Visit 4 (Week 5). Subjects will also be instructed to begin the 2-week washout period and&#xD;
      return to the clinic to begin Test Period 2 at Visit 4 (Week 5). Finally, study instructions&#xD;
      will also be provided [(i.e., maintenance of physical activity; maintenance of habitual diet&#xD;
      as much as possible with the exception of excluding fermented foods or beverages that do or&#xD;
      might contain live probiotics (e.g., yogurt, kombucha)]. Subjects will also be reminded that&#xD;
      they are not required to fast prior to Visit 4 (Week 5) and will be encouraged to eat&#xD;
      breakfast prior to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4 (Week 5), subjects will return to the clinic, crossover to the other study product&#xD;
      in their test sequence, and repeat the procedures from Visits 2 (Week 0) with the exception&#xD;
      of the randomization procedure. At Visit 5 (Week 8), subjects will repeat the procedures from&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Week 3), followed by a 2-week washout period before starting Test Period 3 at Visit&#xD;
      6 (Week 10). At Visit 6 (Week 10), subjects will return to the clinic, crossover to the other&#xD;
      study product in their test sequence, and repeat the procedures from Visits 2 (Week 0) with&#xD;
      the exception of the randomization procedure. Finally, at Visit 7 (Week 13), subjects will&#xD;
      repeat the procedures from Visit 3 (Week 3).&#xD;
