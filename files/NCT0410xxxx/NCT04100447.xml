  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      LB1148 in subjects undergoing elective bowel resection. During abdominal surgery, surgeons&#xD;
      handle, manipulate, and often make incisions in the bowel. These actions can create bruising,&#xD;
      lesions, and microscopic damage to the bowel, which may allow digestive enzymes to cross the&#xD;
      intestinal mucosal barrier potentially resulting in injury both locally and remotely. Leaking&#xD;
      digestive enzymes may delay return of normal gastrointestinal (GI) function, lead to a lack&#xD;
      of motility in the intestine (ileus), and promote the formation of intestinal scar tissue&#xD;
      (adhesions).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intestinal mucosal barrier plays a key role in both acute critical care medical&#xD;
      conditions as well as burdensome chronic diseases. Healthy maintenance of the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosal barrier requires oxygenation and blood flow and avoidance of mechanical or physical&#xD;
      injury. Potent digestive enzymes are maintained within the intestine as long as normal blood&#xD;
      flow continues and no damage or disturbances to the wall occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breakdown of the intestinal mucosal barrier can be produced by wide variety of events. These&#xD;
      include prolonged low blood pressure (e.g. during shock), disruption of blood flow (e.g.&#xD;
      during ischemia), and physical and mechanical perturbations (e.g. during trauma or abdominal&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key advances toward the use of LB1148 to reduce postoperative complications was&#xD;
      the learning that with more subtle perturbations of the mucosal barriers, such as during&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, intraluminal pancreatic digestive enzymes played a role in GI dysfunction.&#xD;
      Perioperative oral administration of LB1148 in preclinical models was sufficient to reduce&#xD;
      the delayed return of GI function. Furthermore, the reduction in pancreatic digestive&#xD;
      enzyme-induced tissue damage resulted in a profound reduction in postoperative adhesion&#xD;
      formation. Together, these preclinical studies provide evidence that blocking pancreatic&#xD;
      digestive enzymes with LB1148 in the intestine reduces local tissue damage, preserves GI&#xD;
      function, and reduces adhesion formation.&#xD;
