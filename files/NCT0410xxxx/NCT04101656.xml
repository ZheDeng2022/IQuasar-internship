      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate a dose fractionation scheme for APBI using&#xD;
      external radiotherapy with modulated intensity technique (IMRT), with the possible impact on&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients as it decreases the treatment number of sessions and improves&#xD;
      the efficiency and accessibility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common tumor among women; although its treatment used to be very&#xD;
      aggressive, nowadays is based on the minimum effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-metastatic patients, the therapeutical strategy is based on surgery, systemic therapy&#xD;
      and radiotherapy. Usually in the early stages of the disease, the treatment begins with a&#xD;
      conservative surgery followed by adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It´s been proved that the majority of relapses after conservatory surgery occur near the&#xD;
      surgical bed which suggests that the main benefit of radiotherapy treatment lies in its&#xD;
      primary effect on residual microscopic disease in the surgical bed. Regarding the&#xD;
      radiotherapy used after conservative surgery, it´s accepted as standard treatment&#xD;
      hypofractionated schemes, after they have demonstrated at least the same grade of&#xD;
      effectiveness as the classic fractionation in terms of locoregional control, survival,&#xD;
      aesthetic results or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the options of hypofractionated schemes is APBI (Accelerated Partial Breast&#xD;
      Irradiation), that by reducing the volume of the radiated breast and an accelerated dose&#xD;
      fractionation scheme, can eliminate the residual microscopic disease in the surgical bed. The&#xD;
      main advantage of APBI is that can shorten the overall time (total treatment time) by&#xD;
      increasing the dose per fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who meet the following criteria:≥ 45 years or 40-44 if there isn´t any other risk&#xD;
      factor, diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)&#xD;
      and that have undergone conservative surgery without ganglionar involvement (pN0) of any&#xD;
      histological degree except from invasive lobular carcinoma and with a size ≤ 3 cm, with a&#xD;
      free margin of at least 2 mm, as well as with positive and negative estrogen receptor tumors;&#xD;
      APBI is currently considered standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This radiotherapy modality can be administered using 4 different techniques: interstitial&#xD;
      brachytherapy, spherical balloons, intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons or with&#xD;
      dedicated kilovoltage (RIO) systems and External Radiotherapy (3D shaped RT or modulated&#xD;
      intensity radiotherapy - IMRT-). Each of them have their advantages and disadvantages,&#xD;
      without any of them being superior to the others in terms of survival or local control,&#xD;
      however, IMRT achieves a more shaped and uniformed dose after conservative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate a dose fractionation scheme for APBI (28&#xD;
      Gy in 5 fractions of 5.6 GY, 5 days/week) using external radiotherapy with modulated&#xD;
      intensity technique (IMRT), with the possible impact on the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
