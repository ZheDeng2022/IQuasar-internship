  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidences suggest that alternative obesity management strategies need to address&#xD;
      gender preferences to adopt healthier lifestyles such as resistance training. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that more men living with obesity who will be exposed to a novel resistance&#xD;
      circuit training program (RT+) for 12 weeks will more physically active, 48 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention compare with people who will not exposed to RT+ program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty men living with obesity will be recruited and randomly assigned to either a standard&#xD;
      care group (N = 30) or an intervention group (N = 30). Eligible participants will be age 19&#xD;
      years or older, living with obesity (BF â‰¥ 28%), able to perform exercises, but not currently&#xD;
      engaged in regular physical activities (150 min of moderate to vigorous aerobic activities +&#xD;
      two sessions of RT per week). Participants will be asked to maintain their current dietary&#xD;
      habits within the duration of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations was done based on the anticipated change in the proportion of obese&#xD;
      men to achieve the PA guidelines (minimum of 150 minutes spent at MVPA in a week in addition&#xD;
      to two sessions of RT). It is predicted that the proportion of men living with obesity who&#xD;
      meet physical activity guidelines (both aerobic MVPA and RT) in the RT+ group will increase&#xD;
      to 26.2% (similar to lean counterparts) at follow-up compared with 0% increased for the&#xD;
      control group. The alpha level and power of analysis were set at 0.05 and 80% respectively,&#xD;
      considering a drop-out rate of 30% in each group. A total of 23 people per group were&#xD;
      required, so investigators will recruit 30 per group.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in RT+ group will be asked to exercise three times per week and perform four basic RT exercises in a circuit manner for 12 weeks while supervised via an online platform such as Skype or TEAM.&#xD;
The first four weeks of sessions will be fully supervised. Participants will be eased into the program using a three-week progressive start, completing 120 minutes of exercise in week one, 150 minutes in week two, 180 minutes in week three and week four. Participants will be supervised 3X/week for the first four weeks, then 2X/week for the next four weeks and 1X/week for the remaining four weeks.&#xD;
At each session, a participant will perform the four prescribed exercises (i.e., squats, tricep dips, lunges, and push-ups) for 45 seconds each, then switch immediately (15 seconds) to the next exercise followed by one-minute of rest at the end of each circuit. The circuit will repeat until the session is complete.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the control standard care group will receive free access to an exercise platform (V-Shred-Ripped-in-90-days) for the same period of time (12 weeks) to become more active. It will be recommended that they do a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activities and two resistance training sessions using the platform.</description>
