      Choosing to participate in an expanded access program is an important personal decision. Talk&#xD;
      with your doctor to learn more about this program. The treating physician must contact&#xD;
      StealthBiotherapeutics using the Expanded Access Program Contacts provided. Elamipretide will&#xD;
      only be made available after careful review of an individual request submitted by the&#xD;
      treating physician. The initiation and conduct of the treatment with elamipretide for an&#xD;
      individual patient, and compliance with this treatment guideline, will be under the full and&#xD;
      sole responsibility of the treating physician.&#xD;
