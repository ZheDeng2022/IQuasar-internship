  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A more rapid test for bacteriuria is desired. This will exclude the patients not having&#xD;
      bacteriuria, which will contribute to a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of infectious&#xD;
      diseases. The aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care&#xD;
      urine flow cytometry on diagnosing and excluding bacteriuria&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prerequisite for the appropriate use of antibiotics is timely access to accurate diagnostic&#xD;
      tests, since treatment of acute infections should be initiated within a few hours to avoid&#xD;
      serious complications such as bacteremia, sepsis, organ failure, septic shock and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of urinary tract infections including acute pyelonephritis (APN) is difficult&#xD;
      due to often weak and non-specific symptoms and high incidence of asymptomatic bacteruria in&#xD;
      especially elderly patients. The diagnosis is verified by significant bacteriuria in urine&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the time from urine sample to result from urine cultures is more than 24 hours&#xD;
      days. Urine test strips are unreliable with low specificity and low predictive values.&#xD;
      Therefore, a point-of-care (POC) test is desired, which can provide rapid results and quickly&#xD;
      identify a bacteriuria. One such tool may be urine flow cytometry (UFC), which has shown&#xD;
      promising diagnostic value for the exclusion of bacteriuria with a high negative predictive&#xD;
      value. However, better documentation for its use as an ED diagnostic screening method is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of POC-UFC on diagnosing and&#xD;
      excluding bacteriuria? Our hypothesis is that by excluding patients not having bacteriuria,&#xD;
      it will contribute to a more rapid and accurate diagnosis&#xD;

    <description>An expert panel will define the final diagnosis (including APN) based on all findings during admission. The expert panel consists of two independent consultants from the emergency department with significant experience in emergency medicine and acute infections. They will individually determine the type of infection the patient admitted actually had. The final diagnosis will be based on all available relevant information from the patient medical record including MRI of kidneys and HR-CT of lungs. A standardized template will be used. Disagreement will be discussed until a consensus is reached.</description>

    <description>Diagnostic test of urine flow cytometry. A urine sample will be collected according to routine procedure by a study assistant. The sample will be divided into two aliquots; half for routine urine culturing, and half for Point-of-care Urine Flow cytometry (POC-UFC) analysis (UF-5000, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The analysis will be performed according to manufacturer's instruction and conducted by laboratory staff. Laboratory staff will be blinded to the participants diagnosis and outcome. The results of the POC-UFC analysis will not be visible to the treating physician.</description>
