    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical pilot study is to evaluate the effects of the MR-010 on&#xD;
      tolerability, biomechanics and walking speed in the acute stroke care setting in addition to&#xD;
      its impact on length of stay.&#xD;

    <description>MR-010 includes a patient application and sensors with commercially available headphones and smartphones. Sensors are placed on the subject's shoes and measure gait metrics. The algorithm uses data from the sensors to inform changes made to the audio cues. These cues, which are embedded in time-shifted music, are delivered back to the users who aim to walk to the beat.</description>
