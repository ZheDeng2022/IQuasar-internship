      This study has purpose to investigated the association of protein intake with sarcopenia in&#xD;
      the institutionalized elderly at south tangerang&#xD;

      Data were collected using interview with subjects or with care giver to know the basic&#xD;
      characteristic of subjects. Anthropometric measurements were done body weight in kilograms&#xD;
      was measured using SECA scale. Body height in meters was predicted by knee height measurement&#xD;
      using knee height caliper. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight per height square.&#xD;
      Fat free mass was examined using bioelectrical impedance analyzer Tanita type SC-330.&#xD;
      Independency was assessed using Barthel index. Protein intake was measured using 2x24 hour&#xD;
      food recall and analyzed using a computer program Nutrisurvey 2007, data were compare to&#xD;
      Recommended Dietary Allowances established for Indonesian 2018. Handgrip muscle strength was&#xD;
      examined using Jamar handgrip dynamometer. Physical performance was measured using Short&#xD;
      Physical Performance Battery test. Sarcopenia was diagnosed using Asian Working Group on&#xD;
      Sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS)&#xD;
      version 20 for windows. Nominal data were described using frequency, n (%). Normality of data&#xD;
      was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with normal distribution (p&gt;0.05) described using&#xD;
      mean and SD while not normal distribution (p&lt;0.05) described using median and range&#xD;
      minimum-maximum. The investigators used Independent T-test analysis to investigate the&#xD;
      association.&#xD;
