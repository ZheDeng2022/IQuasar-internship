  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer screening program has been proven to reduce colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      mortality and is cost-effective. It has been adopted by most countries in the world, and&#xD;
      colonoscopy is regarded as the most accurate test for detecting colorectal neoplasm. After&#xD;
      screenees underwent colonoscopy, most endoscopists do not routinely explain the preliminary&#xD;
      optical diagnosis to the subjects before they going home, which may cause unnecessary anxiety&#xD;
      and may reduce the quality of life of the subjects before acquiring the final results. In&#xD;
      recent years, endoscopic optical diagnostic technology has been validated by meta-analysis&#xD;
      studies as an excellent tool to predict the histology of colorectal polyps and to&#xD;
      differentiate the invasion depth of colorectal cancer. The real time feature of endoscopic&#xD;
      optical diagnosis allows endoscopists to explain the preliminary results confidently to the&#xD;
      subjects immediately after colonoscopy, which is expected to reduce the anxiety of the&#xD;
      subjects before they acquired the final results and improve their quality of life. We&#xD;
      designed a randomized controlled trial to validate whether real-time endoscopic optical&#xD;
      diagnosis could decrease the anxiety burden and improve the quality of life for&#xD;
      colorectal-cancer screenees after colonoscopy.&#xD;
