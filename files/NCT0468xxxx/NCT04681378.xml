      The purpose of this study was to compare the short term operative outcomes of three different&#xD;
      surgical techniques for uterine incision closure during cesarean section (CS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial enrolled 120 patients scheduled for primary cesarean delivery. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized into either classical double layer uterine closure, purse string double layer&#xD;
      uterine closure (Turan), or our new approach of uterine closure (double layer step up-step&#xD;
      down technique). For short term comparison, transvaginal ultrasonography was planned for all&#xD;
      patients 6 weeks after surgery. Compared to group II and Group III, residual myometrial&#xD;
      thickness was significantly thinner in group I (P&lt; 0.001). The number of patients with&#xD;
      uterine niche was 10 (50% of all scar defects) in group I whereas it was 4 (20%) in group II&#xD;
      and 6 (30%) in group III. Operative time was significantly longer in group II (P&lt; 0.001).&#xD;
      This led to our conclusion that Turan technique and our new approach are associated with&#xD;
      thicker myometrial thickness and less frequency of uterine scar defect than classical double&#xD;
      layer uterine incision closure; however, our approach takes less operative time.&#xD;

      The investigators performed single site randomized clinical trial that was conducted at&#xD;
      department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Menoufia University Hospital, which is a large&#xD;
      tertiary center in the Delta region in Egypt. The study population consisted of 120 eligible&#xD;
      pregnant women with a singleton first-time cesarean delivery without preterm rupture of&#xD;
      membranes, contractions or cervical dilatations that were recruited from the inward section&#xD;
      one day before surgery from January 2017 to April 2019; only 114 cases remained for analysis.&#xD;
      The study was approved by our hospital ethics committee and a written consent was obtained&#xD;
      from each participant woman after full explanation of the study design. No important changes&#xD;
      occurred to the trial design after it began, and the CONSORT guidelines was observed and&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: pregnant women who refused to participate, women under age of 18&#xD;
      years, history of previous CS or any other uterine surgery ( Hystrotomy , myomectomy,&#xD;
      perforation),placenta previa, abruptio placenta, fibroids located in the cervical or the&#xD;
      cervico-corporal border, presence of maternal disease ( diabetes mellitus, anemia, connective&#xD;
      tissue disorders, uterine malformations), reoperation following the CS, and presence of&#xD;
      chorioamnionits. Secondary exclusion criteria were the need for more than three additional&#xD;
      single sutures for hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One author evaluated all obstetric patients who applied to the delivery room within the study&#xD;
      period and selected eligible cases. After excluding patients who did not meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and patients who refused to participate, all remaining patients were equally&#xD;
      randomized into either classical double layer uterine closure (group I), purse string double&#xD;
      layer uterine closure (Turan technique, group II), or our technique of double layer step up-&#xD;
      step down uterine closure (group III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated random numerical table (Randomization Generator Version 1.0) was used by&#xD;
      our statistical department to prepare sealed opaque envelopes containing a group assignment.&#xD;
      Three groups of envelopes-corresponding to the study groups were given to an anesthesia&#xD;
      nurse. The nurse distributed envelopes to patients, alternating between groups during&#xD;
      preanesthetic consultation. The patients were blinded the groups, and two authors performed&#xD;
      the operations randomly. Another author who was blinded to the suturing technique performed&#xD;
      all of the ultrasonographic examinations at 6 week follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cesarean deliveries were performed under spinal anesthesia. An abdominal opening was made&#xD;
      through a slightly curved transverse incision that was placed 3-4 cm above the symphysis&#xD;
      pubis (Pfannestiel incision). The subcutaneous tissue was left untouched apart from midline.&#xD;
      The rectus sheath was separated along its fibers and the rectus muscles pulled apart.&#xD;
      Stretching with index fingers opened the peritoneum and the uterus was opened by transverse&#xD;
      lower segment incision (Kerr incision), then the hole was enlarged between the index finger&#xD;
      of one hand and the thumb of the other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classical double layer closure of uterine incision was performed as follows: a holding Vicryl&#xD;
      1-0 was placed in the in the left corner to stabilize and define the demarcation of the&#xD;
      suture line. A continuous unlocked stitch beginning at the right corner was used, closing the&#xD;
      whole thickness of the uterine wall, including the decidual layer. The second unlocked stitch&#xD;
      was performed by Vicryl 1-0 in a lateral -lateral (horizontal) position, adapting the first&#xD;
      layer. Up to three additional single sutures were added for hemostasis if required. The Turan&#xD;
      technique may be summarized as follows: beginning in one corner, the incision is closed using&#xD;
      Vicryl 1-0 stitch. The first layer is transversely passed through the inner&#xD;
      myometrium-decidua line, and second layer is transversely passed through outer&#xD;
      myometrium-visceral line continuously in the form of a purse string closure. With this&#xD;
      technique, the original string is returned to the starting point and tied with a knot.&#xD;
      Following the double layered purse-string closure, the aperture left in the middle of the&#xD;
      uterine incision is closed with one separate figure of eight suture (Figure 1A). Our new&#xD;
      approach can also be summarized as follows: the incision is closed using Vicryl 1-0 stitch&#xD;
      starting from one corner. The first layer is transversely passed through the inner&#xD;
      myometrium-decidua line, and second layer is transversely passed through outer&#xD;
      myometrium-visceral line continuously by alternating continuous stitches through the upper&#xD;
      (step up) and the lower (step down) uterine flaps. The original string is returned to the&#xD;
      starting point and tied with knot as in Turan technique. Following the double layered step&#xD;
      up-step down closure, additional single sutures were added for hemostasis if required (Figure&#xD;
      1B). Included in the surgical technique was uterine exteriorization. The visceral and&#xD;
      parietal layers were left open and the rectus muscle was not stitched. The rectus sheath was&#xD;
      stitched with a continuous unlocked no 1 Vicryl and subdermal was closed in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received prophylactic intravenous antibiotics (Cefazolin sodium vial. 1gm, i.v)&#xD;
      preoperatively to reduce the rate of wound infection. In addition, uterotonics (5 IU units of&#xD;
      oxytocin) were given intravenously as a bolus, before manual removal of the placenta to&#xD;
      prevent postpartum hemorrhage. During the surgery, one author recorded operative time from&#xD;
      skin incision to skin closure, blood loss, type of uterine closure technique used, and Kerr&#xD;
      incision length before and after suturing and whether additional sutures for hemostasis were&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were discharged within 3 days of the operation and a detailed transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound examination was planned for all patients 6 weeks after surgery. Examinations were&#xD;
      performed with C8-4V endocavitary transducer with frequency of 4-8 MHz (Philips, HD11 XE&#xD;
      Ultrasound system, USA). The uterus was visualized in a sagittal plane with both the&#xD;
      endometrium and the cervical canal visible, the scar area was magnified and the outcome&#xD;
      measures were obtained from a frozen image. The scar was then visualized in a transverse&#xD;
      plane by carefully rotating the probe at the level of the scar. Our main variable for scar&#xD;
      evaluation was residual myometrial thickness (RMT). The cesarean scar site was identified as&#xD;
      a small triangular anechoic defect in the anterior wall of the uterus (uterine niche). In&#xD;
      these patients RMT was measured from the top of niche to serosal surface. In patients without&#xD;
      a scar defect RMT was measured from the delineation of the endometrium to the serosal surface&#xD;
      at the level of CS scar and total myometrial thickness was measured at the myometrium&#xD;
      adjacent to CS scar in all patients (Figure 2). If a scar defect was identified,&#xD;
      investigators measured in a sagittal plane its height (distance from the base/anterior lining&#xD;
      of the endometrium to the apex) and width (W) at its base. The length of the defect at its&#xD;
      base in a transverse axis (distance between the proximal and distal parts of the myometrium&#xD;
      of the anterior uterine wall) was also recorded.&#xD;
