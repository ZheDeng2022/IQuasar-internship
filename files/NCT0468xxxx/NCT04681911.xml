    <textblock>
      HER2-targeted therapy after the failure of trastuzumab treatment has become a new difficulty&#xD;
      and challenge. Inetetamab, a new antibody to optimize the ADCC effect, has become one of the&#xD;
      second-line treatment options after trastuzumab fails, showing good survival benefits.&#xD;
      Pyrotinib, another second-line HER2 targeted drug, is a typical representative of TKI drugs,&#xD;
      which not only has a strong HER2 antagonistic effect but also can synergize with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies to amplify the ADCC effect. Pyrotinib and Inetetamab showed excellent anti-tumor&#xD;
      efficacy and good safety in TKI and optimized ADCC respectively. we plan to carry out a phase&#xD;
      II single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of &quot;Inetetamab combined with&#xD;
      Pyrotinib and chemotherapy&quot; in the treatment of her positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab is the first target drug for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, which can&#xD;
      significantly improve the survival of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      and become the first-line standard treatment. However, the selection of second-line targeted&#xD;
      drugs after the failure of trastuzumab treatment has become a new difficulty and challenge.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the ADCC effect is one of the main mechanisms of the anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect of trastuzumab. Therefore, Inetetamab, a new antibody to optimize the ADCC effect, has&#xD;
      become one of the second-line treatment options after trastuzumab fails, showing good&#xD;
      survival benefits. Pyrotinib, another second-line HER2 targeted drug, is a typical&#xD;
      representative of TKI drugs, which not only has a strong HER2 antagonistic effect but also&#xD;
      can synergize with monoclonal antibodies to amplify the ADCC effect. As two important class&#xD;
      1.1 innovative drugs in China, Pyrotinib and Inetetamab showed excellent anti-tumor efficacy&#xD;
      and good safety in TKI and optimized ADCC respectively. Considering that the current&#xD;
      guidelines recommend the combination of multiple anti-HER2 targeted drugs, and basic research&#xD;
      also shows that Pyrotinib and Inetetamab have a synergistic effect, we plan to carry out a&#xD;
      phase II single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of &quot;Inetetamab&#xD;
      combined with Pyrotinib and chemotherapy&quot; in the treatment of her positive metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer, so as to provide better results for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer Treatment options!&#xD;
