      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, cervical cancer (CC) screening was opportunistic until recently. The target&#xD;
      population includes women aged 25 to 65 years. About 66% of women aged 25-40 years have&#xD;
      performed a screening test over the last three years but this figure decreases to 55% in&#xD;
      women over 40. The third &quot;Cancer Plan&quot; proposed by the French National Institute for Cancer&#xD;
      recommends to achieve an 80% participation in eligible women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving women compliance to CC screening is a major challenge to decrease cancer incidence&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve patient adherence, a CC screening organization will be launched in 2020 at a&#xD;
      national scale in France. Women who did not perform a PAP test over the last 3 years will&#xD;
      receive an invitation letter from the local public health association in charge of cancer&#xD;
      screening organization. The invitation letter will remind women that they should consult a&#xD;
      healthcare professional (a general practitioner (GP), a gynecologist or a midwife) to perform&#xD;
      a screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing GPs with a list of their non-adherent patients could also improve women compliance&#xD;
      to CC screening recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to assess whether sending both an invitation letter to non-adherent&#xD;
      women and a list of their non-adherent patients to GPs (&quot;invitation letter + GP reminder&quot;&#xD;
      group) could increase the proportion of women who perform a screening test, compared to only&#xD;
      sending an invitation letter to non-adherent women (&quot;invitation letter&quot; group) or not sending&#xD;
      any invitation (&quot;usual care&quot; group).&#xD;

      Design, Setting and Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a 3-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial in the&#xD;
      Loire-Atlantique region, in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a total of 1,500 GPs and about 100,000 women. The randomization will&#xD;
      be based on GP practices to avoid a contamination bias resulting from shared tracking&#xD;
      mechanisms and communication between GPs within a given practice. Thus, several GPs working&#xD;
      in the same practice will be assigned to the same study arm. Women on the patient list of a&#xD;
      given GP will be assigned to the arm of this GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a cluster randomization according to the practice, the GPs and their female patients&#xD;
      will be included in one of the following 3 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Invitation letter + GP reminder&quot; (Arm 1): 40-65 year-old women who did not perform a&#xD;
           PAP test over the last 3 years will receive an invitation to consult a health&#xD;
           professional to perform a screening test, AND GPs will receive the list of their 40-65&#xD;
           year-old patients who did not perform a PAP test over the last 3 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Invitation letter&quot; (Arm 2): 40-65 year-old women who did not perform a PAP test over&#xD;
           the last 3 years will receive an invitation to consult a health professional to perform&#xD;
           a screening test. GPs will NOT receive any list of their non-adherent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Usual care&quot; (arm 3): 40-65 year-old women who did not perform a PAP test over the last&#xD;
           3 years will NOT receive any invitation to consult a health professional to perform a&#xD;
           screening test. GPs will NOT receive any list of their non-adherent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect an increase in the proportion of women who perform a screening test&#xD;
      in the intervention arm (arm 1), compared to arms 2 and 3. Previous studies have suggested&#xD;
      that the proportion of women adherent to CC screening could be increased by 25% in arm 1&#xD;
      compared to arm 3, whereas the participation could be increased by 15% in arm 2 compared to&#xD;
      arm 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that the proportion of adherent women in arm 3 should be of about 55%, the&#xD;
      absolute increase in participation could reach 11% in arm 1, and 6.6% in arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A higher adherence to CC screening could improve the detection of pathological lesions by 5%&#xD;
      for pathological pap smears and by 10% for positive HPV tests.&#xD;
