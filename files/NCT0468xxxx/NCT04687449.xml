    <textblock>
      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 120 patients with a diagnosis of COPD will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either a daily curcumin preparation or placebo for 90 days, in addition&#xD;
      to the standard of care treatment. The outcomes will be compared between the study arms. No&#xD;
      dose escalation will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) kills more than 3 million people worldwide every&#xD;
      year. COPD is managed mainly by pharmacological therapy during the stable stage. Research&#xD;
      illustrates many proven beneficial outcomes associated with the use of bronchodilators&#xD;
      (beta-agonists and anticholinergics), inhaled and oral steroids to decrease the bronchial&#xD;
      tree inflammation, some antibiotics, such as azithromycin, which have not only antibacterial&#xD;
      but also some anti-inflammatory properties. However, these remedies have many limitations due&#xD;
      to the development of adverse effects and resistance. Despite the treatment, symptoms related&#xD;
      to COPD negatively affect patients' quality of life and limit their essential physical&#xD;
      abilities, such as walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although achievements have been made in the management of COPD, exacerbation (worsening or&#xD;
      flare up) remains a leading cause for hospital admission. COPD exacerbation adversely affects&#xD;
      patients' quality of and creates a significant financial burden on the healthcare system&#xD;
      nationally and on a local level. Hospitals with excess readmission ratios for COPD are&#xD;
      penalized financially by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In Danbury Hospital,&#xD;
      about 15% of patients admitted for COPD exacerbation are readmitted within 30 days on&#xD;
      average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is an urgent need for continued development of maintenance drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of COPD. Aside from the ordinary accepted pharmacological therapy approved for&#xD;
      treatment of this chronic respiratory illness, some alternatives have pharmacologic&#xD;
      properties that may potentially target the pathophysiologic processes involved in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin, a well-known polyphenol, is an active component of a plant Curcuma longa, commonly&#xD;
      known as turmeric. Turmeric has been used for centuries as a spice and has recently become a&#xD;
      widely used dietary supplement. Curcumin is reported to have anti-inflammatory properties by&#xD;
      inhibiting NF-κB activation and IL-8,4,5 which are known to promote white blood cell activity&#xD;
      and expression of COX-2 (enzyme responsible for production of inflammatory cytokines)&#xD;
      involved in the pathophysiology of COPD. It has also been associated with the inhibition of&#xD;
      cigarette smoke-induced NF-κB activation in bronchial epithelium in mice; in addition, it has&#xD;
      been shown to revitalize steroid response in human cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on the effects of curcumin on inflammatory cytokines, as described above, has been&#xD;
      derived from in vitro cell line and animal studies. While curcumin has been studied in humans&#xD;
      for other inflammatory conditions (arthritis, gastrointestinal conditions, etc) to our&#xD;
      knowledge, no human studies to explore its role in the management of COPD are available. As&#xD;
      bronchial inflammation plays a key role in pathophysiology of COPD and curcumin has been&#xD;
      shown to exhibit significant anti-inflammatory properties, we hypothesize that use of&#xD;
      curcumin is associated with improvement in outcomes in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To study if daily oral consumption of a curcumin preparation is associated with decreased&#xD;
      health impairment in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study if daily oral consumption of a curcumin preparation is associated with improved&#xD;
           functional exercise capacity among patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study if daily oral consumption of a curcumin preparation is associated with&#xD;
           decreased risk of an acute COPD exacerbation, and related hospital admission, in&#xD;
           patients with COPD.&#xD;
