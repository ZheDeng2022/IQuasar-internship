  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema refers to edema caused by insufficient drainage of interstitial fluid through the&#xD;
      lymphatic circulation system. It occurs mainly in the upper and lower extremities and causes&#xD;
      chronic inflammation, and finally fibrous adipose tissue is replaced. In this study,&#xD;
      the'LYMPHA' (Lymphatic microsurgical preventing healing approach) procedure, which connects&#xD;
      lymphatic vessels drained from the arm to the side branches of the axillary vein, contributes&#xD;
      to the prevention of lymphedema in patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection for&#xD;
      breast cancer. Investigator aim to help patients' quality of life by prospectively analyzing&#xD;
      the effects and applying them to clinical practice, reducing the incidence of lymphedema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the LYMPHA group undergo Axillary reverse mapping before the start of surgery,&#xD;
      and after axillary lymph node resection, LYMPHA procedure is performed in which the lymphatic&#xD;
      vessels drained from the arm and the axillary vein are micro-bonded to the side branches.&#xD;
