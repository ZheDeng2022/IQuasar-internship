    <textblock>
      As the opioid epidemic continues on, more research is needed on multi-modal approaches to&#xD;
      decrease opioid exposure after common procedures. The aim of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      role of a transverses abdominis block using liposome bupivacaine suspension in reducing use&#xD;
      of opioid medications through post-operative day 7. The study is a proposed double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 in 3 women in the US deliver by cesarean delivery. After cesarean delivery,&#xD;
      approximately 75-87% percent of women are discharged from the hospital with an opioid&#xD;
      prescription. Most women fill that prescription and 1% continue to use those opioids 90 days&#xD;
      after delivery despite no longer requiring them for pain control, predisposing them to opioid&#xD;
      dependence. This study aims to determine if transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block using&#xD;
      bupivacaine liposome suspension injection (EXPAREL®) significantly reduces the use of opioid&#xD;
      medications after discharge in women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery. The study is a&#xD;
      proposed double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Pregnant women who have completed 37&#xD;
      weeks gestation and are scheduled for cesarean delivery will be randomized to receive a TAP&#xD;
      block with 80 ml of mixed liposomal bupivacaine or saline. Based on its use in other surgical&#xD;
      settings, the investigators hypothesize that women who receive a liposomal bupivacaine TAP&#xD;
      block will use significantly less opioids by postoperative day 7 as calculated in morphine&#xD;
      milligram equivalents. In addition to overall consumption of opioids after discharge, other&#xD;
      aims to be studied include inpatient opioid use, effect on pain scores, rates of postpartum&#xD;
      depression, patient-perceived quality of breastfeeding, patient quality of recovery, and&#xD;
      composite adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With better overall pain control and less dependence on opioids postpartum, liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine TAP blocks at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery may offer a highly&#xD;
      effective analgesic alternative that can help shift the tide in the ongoing opioid epidemic&#xD;
      among reproductive females.&#xD;

    <description>The transversus abdominis plane block is a procedure involving injection of a local anesthetic solution into the abdominal plane between the internal oblique muscle and the transversus abdominis muscle. In our institution, this is done under ultrasound guidance which is the current standard to improve efficacy and limit complications. Liposomal bupivacaine uses an innovative technology consisting of lipid-based particles containing active pharmaceutical agent (bupivacaine) which extends the duration of the medication through a process of gradual release for metabolism.This drug delivery technology extends the duration of action to up to 96 hours when given at a dose of 266 mg liposomal bupivacaine admixed with 30 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% and 30 ml of saline. Forty ml of solution is deposited on the left side of the abdomen and 40 ml on the right.</description>
