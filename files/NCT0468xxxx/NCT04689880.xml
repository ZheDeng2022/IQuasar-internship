  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the NuVasive&#xD;
      XLIF Decade Plate System as measured by patient-reported outcomes (PROs), radiographic&#xD;
      outcomes, and reported complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the XLIF Decade Plate in patients undergoing a thoracic and/or lumbar&#xD;
      interbody fusion, at one or two levels, with supplemental fixation using a lateral plate.&#xD;
      Consecutive patients at a given site who meet all eligibility requirements will be asked to&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. Eligible patients include those with degenerative&#xD;
      conditions in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and&#xD;
      will be screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      XLIF surgery with lateral plating using the Decade Plate. At least 75 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled and will be followed for 24 months after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Back and leg pain measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) will be assessed to determine the percentage of subjects who meet MCID (1.2 points and 1.6 points respectively) where 0 is &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;Unbearable Pain&quot;.</description>

    <description>Overall physical and mental health measured by PROMIS-10 will be assessed to determine the percentage of subjects who meet MCID (5 points). PROMIS-10 scoring uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population.</description>

    <description>Back and leg pain measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) will be assessed to determine the percentage of subjects who meet SCB (3.5 points or less, at least a 2.5 point improvement, or at least a 41.4% improvement) where 0 is &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;Unbearable Pain&quot;.</description>
