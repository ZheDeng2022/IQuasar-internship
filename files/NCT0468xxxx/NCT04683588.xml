  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA); It is frequently applied to adults, especially those over the&#xD;
      age of 55. Total knee arthroplasty surgery is among the surgeries with a high satisfaction&#xD;
      rate for the patient, although complications can develop and this rate varies between&#xD;
      1.65-11.3%. It has a privileged place in the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of the&#xD;
      problems and complications that may occur. In this way, patients' anxiety will be reduced,&#xD;
      self-care competence will be provided, recovery process will be accelerated, quality of life&#xD;
      and care satisfaction will increase. In this context, the training, information,&#xD;
      skill-building, counseling and care practice that the nurse will provide to the patient; With&#xD;
      the results to be obtained from this study, patients with TKA can be given pre-operative and&#xD;
      post-operative nursing care using a nurse coaching strategy, and patients' anxiety level,&#xD;
      pain control, patient satisfaction It is predicted to have a positive effect on self-care&#xD;
      ability and re-hospitalization rates. Thus, it is thought that both quality healthcare&#xD;
      services will be provided and will contribute to the creation of evidence-based data. It is&#xD;
      thought that the study will also contribute to the dissemination of the pre-operative and&#xD;
      postoperative nurse coaching strategy in patients undergoing TKA, and will guide the planning&#xD;
      of nursing education. This study is an experimental study to determine the effect of&#xD;
      continuous nursing care given with a coaching strategy to patients scheduled for TKA surgery&#xD;
      on anxiety, pain, self-care ability, satisfaction, and re-hospitalization. The study will be&#xD;
      carried out in Konya Private Hospital. Data collection time is set as September-December&#xD;
      2020. Data will be collected by the researcher using the Diagnostic questionnaire form, State&#xD;
      Anxiety Scale, Visual Analog Scale, Newcastle Nursing Care Satisfaction Scale, Modified&#xD;
      Barthel index and Self-Care Ability Scale. In this context, the training, information,&#xD;
      skill-building, counseling and care practice that the nurse will provide to the patient; It&#xD;
      will contribute to achieving the desired results by positively affecting both the success of&#xD;
      the surgery and the healing process of the patient.&#xD;

      The universe of the research; patients who are planned to undergo total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      between January 1, 2021 and June 1, 2021 in the orthopedic surgery clinic where the study&#xD;
      will be conducted will comprise the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental&#xD;
      study. Block randomization method will be used to determine the experimental and control&#xD;
      groups. In order for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the order produced by a&#xD;
      computer program (www.randomizer.org) will be used. Randomization will be done by a&#xD;
      biostatistician outside the researcher. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to&#xD;
      the randomization list. Research data will be collected in a hospital's orthopedics and&#xD;
      traumatology service surgery ward between 1 January 2021 - 1 June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependent variables of the study are postoperative statue anxiety score, patient&#xD;
      self-care ability score, pain severity (Visual Analog Scale-VAS), pain control and status (&#xD;
      pain-causing conditions, analgesic such as use case), patient satisfaction score,&#xD;
      re-hospitalization average. In the research, &quot;Individual Characteristics Form&quot; and &quot;Patient&#xD;
      Follow-up Form&quot; prepared by the researcher in line with the literature will be used as data&#xD;
      collection tools.&#xD;

    <description>Different strategies, methods and training techniques are used in the implementation of preoperative and postoperative nursing care of surgical patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty surgery. One of them is patient coaching. Coaching is a method that increases the quality of nursing care.While the coaching strategy contributes more to the recovery process of the patient with the role of the case manager of the nurse, it provides a reduction in the problems related to surgery (pain, nausea-vomiting, mobilization problems), reduction in repeated hospitalizations and positive contributions to the cost.</description>
