    <textblock>
      Rationale: It is now recognized that diet plays a critical role in the etiology and&#xD;
      management of chronic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
      Evidence shows an increasing prevalence of type-2 diabetes as well as obesity, whereby large&#xD;
      consumptions of carbohydrate foods is one of the leading contribution to these diseases. Food&#xD;
      structure and texture can be modified to control oral processing behaviour, which would have&#xD;
      subsequent impact on total energy intake and glycaemic response through altering the food&#xD;
      breakdown path. Whilst it has been demonstrated that foods which are eaten at a faster rate&#xD;
      leads to more food consumed ad-libitum and therefore higher energy intake, they are also&#xD;
      eaten at fewer chews per bite, resulting in larger food particle sizes and hence slower&#xD;
      digestion. Therefore it is important to understand the overall net effect of the opposing&#xD;
      outcomes of food texture and oral processing behavior, bolus properties and glycaemic&#xD;
      response, and identify the key factors which has the biggest influence on glycaemic response.&#xD;
      The findings from this study can be used as guidelines on meal planning and making better&#xD;
      informed choices between foods which are of the same composition/nutrition but with different&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims: The aim of this study is to understand how food texture and saliva&#xD;
      characteristics influences oral processing behavior, bolus characteristics and postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomised crossover design where participants receive 2 treatments (i.e. 2&#xD;
      test meals) over 2 test sessions. Test sessions will include bolus characterisation of foods&#xD;
      where participants chew and expectorate test foods (5g each) based on a fixed chew protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 40 healthy males aged 21-50 years with BMI between 18-25 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: For test session 1 and 2, participants will receive 2 treatments (i.e. 2 test&#xD;
      meals) in randomised order over 2 sessions. The test meals contain 50g carbohydrate load of&#xD;
      different textures. Participants will be video recorded while consuming the test meals to&#xD;
      derive oral processing behaviour (bites, chews, time food spent in mouth). Blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected at baseline and post consumption (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes) to&#xD;
      measure glycaemic responses to the test meals. For test session 3, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to follow a fixed chew protocol to chew and expectorate 3 test foods while being video&#xD;
      recorded. Similarly, oral processing behaviours will be analysed from the recorded videos.&#xD;
      The spat out food samples (i.e. bolus samples) will be analysed for saliva uptake and bolus&#xD;
      particle size indicating extent of food breakdown.&#xD;

      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to understand how food texture and saliva characteristics influences&#xD;
      oral processing behavior, bolus characteristics and postprandial glycaemic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that foods with a more elastic texture are eaten slower and requires&#xD;
      more chewing, resulting in smaller bolus particle sizes and therefore higher postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemic response due to an increased surface area for enzymatic digestion. Participants&#xD;
      with higher saliva flowrate and/or alpha-amylase activity would also have shorter eating&#xD;
      times and higher postprandial glycaemic responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral processing behaviours have high individual variances (Bolhuis et al 2013; Ketel et al&#xD;
      2019) and a large sample size is required in order to get significant differences between&#xD;
      treatments. Based on previous papers on food texture and oral processing, a minimum of 20&#xD;
      healthy young male Chinese participants will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require participants to attend 1 screening session (1 hour) and 3 test&#xD;
      sessions (3 hours for test sessions 1 and 2; 1 hour for test session 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (1 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will be asked to give informed consent before taking part in any&#xD;
      of the research activities. Baseline measurements including anthropometric (height, weight,&#xD;
      percentage body fat using a Bioelectrical Impedance Analyser), fasting blood glucose via&#xD;
      finger prick and blood pressure will be taken to access eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successfully screened participants will proceed to complete intraoral volume capacity&#xD;
      measured using simple sip-and-spit measures, as well as provide stimulated and unstimulated&#xD;
      saliva sample (approximately 4 x 5 ml each) via passive drooling to assess their saliva&#xD;
      flowrates and saliva alpha-amylase activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Foods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commercially available and commonly consumed foods (e.g. white rice, korean rice cake,&#xD;
      carrot, biscuits, etc.) are safe for human consumption and prepared in line with safe&#xD;
      hygienic food preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test session 1 and 2 (3 hours each):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed to fast 10 to 12 hours prior to test session 1 and 2. They are&#xD;
      required to arrive the test centre between 08:00 - 09:00 a.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to consume a test meal during each session, consisting of a 'fast'&#xD;
      (less elastic texture and eaten more quickly) or 'slow' food (more elastic texture and eaten&#xD;
      more slowly) in total. The order of test foods presented will be randomised. These test foods&#xD;
      will be of the same carbohydrate load (50g carbohydrate) with different textures (i.e. white&#xD;
      rice vs. rice cakes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline finger prick blood sample will be taken. After obtaining the baseline blood&#xD;
      samples, test meal will be given to the participant to consumed within 15 minutes while being&#xD;
      video recorded using a laptop webcam at face level. Following consumption of the test meal,&#xD;
      finger prick blood samples will be taken for the next 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120&#xD;
      minutes. The amount of blood that will be collected at every time point will be about a drop&#xD;
      of blood (approximately 0.5ml per time point and 5 ml in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory and textural ratings of the test meal will be taken using a visual analogue scale on&#xD;
      a laptop. Post-meal satiety responses using a visual analogue scale will also be collected on&#xD;
      a laptop every 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of blood collection and satiety responses, the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      chew on a separate portion of test meal (5g) until ready to swallow, and will be asked to&#xD;
      expectorate the food bolus to assess their bolus properties including saliva uptake and&#xD;
      particle size distribution. Video-recordings of the participant chewing the test foods will&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of ad-libitum snacks will be provided to participants after all the measurements have&#xD;
      been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test sessions 1 and 2 will be interspaced by a minimum of 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test session 3 (1 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to chew on 3 test foods (white rice, rice cake, raw carrot) using&#xD;
      a fixed chew protocol (i.e. 15 chews, 30 chews and chew until point of first swallow) and&#xD;
      then expectorating the bolus to assess their bolus properties including saliva uptake and&#xD;
      particle size distribution. Video-recordings of the participant chewing the test foods will&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2 and 3 will be interspaced by a minimum of 1 day.&#xD;
