  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution, single-arm, phase 2 study in which belantamab mafodotin&#xD;
      (GSK2857916), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), will be&#xD;
      administered to patients with multiple myeloma prior to and following high-dose melphalan and&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), in conjunction with standard lenalidomide&#xD;
      maintenance. We hypothesize that administration of belantamab mafodotin as part of autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplant consolidation and maintenance will be safe, well tolerated, and&#xD;
      efficacious in comparison to historical data.&#xD;
