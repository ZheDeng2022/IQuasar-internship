  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      rogrammed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor is recommended to treat advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the safety of PD-1 inhibitor in patients with a high&#xD;
      HBV-DNA load is unknown because of the potential risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#xD;
      reactivation. This study was to compare the HBV reactivation between patients with low&#xD;
      HBV-DNA loads and high HBV-DNA loads undergoing antiviral prophylaxis and PD-1 inhibitor.&#xD;

    <description>HBV Reactivation rate was defined as one of the following according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018 hepatitis B guidelines: (i) a ≥2 log (100-fold) increase in HBV DNA compared to the baseline level, (ii) HBV DNA ≥3 log (1,000) IU/mL in a patient with previously undetectable level (since HBV DNA levels fluctuate)</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>HBV-associated hepatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>HBV-associated hepatitis was defined as HBV Reactivation plus an ALT increase to ≥3 times the baseline level and &gt;100 U/L according to the AASLD 2018 Hepatitis B Guidance</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PD-1 inhibitor disruption due to hepatitis</measure>

    <description>PD-1 inhibitor disruption due to hepatitis was defined as either premature termination or a delay of at least 7 days between PD-1 inhibitor cycles because of hepatitis.</description>

        Eligible patients were divided into low HBV-DNA group (low group, ≤500 IU/ml) and high&#xD;
        HBV-DNA group (high group, &gt;500 IU/ml) according to baseline HBV-DNA level. Baseline&#xD;
        HBV-DNA was the HBV-DNA level within 2 weeks prior to initial PD-1 inhibitor therapy. For&#xD;
        patients who had prior experience with antiviral therapy, the antiviral therapy would be&#xD;
        continued. For patients who did not have prior experience with antiviral therapy, antiviral&#xD;
        therapy would be administered after patients was confirmed with positive HBsAg or positive&#xD;
        HBV-DNA level. Prior use of antiviral therapy was defined that patients have taken&#xD;
        antiviral therapy for a period of time before they received PD-1 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
        Antiviral prophylaxis was defined as anti-HBV treatment administered before and during PD-1&#xD;
        inhibitor therapy. Antiviral treatment was continued even though PD-1 inhibitor therapy was&#xD;
        terminated.&#xD;
