    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicentre, parallel-group, active-controlled, non-inferiority&#xD;
      study conducted in adult patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye disease (DED) related to&#xD;
      keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis. This study is conducted at a national level, in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomised to receive ALOCROSS® or the reference treatment, VISMED®&#xD;
      (ratio 1:1) in an investigator-masked fashion&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the ocular efficacy of ALOCROSS® with that of VISMED® in patients with moderate&#xD;
      to severe DED related to keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis after a 4-week treatment period&#xD;
      (Day 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the ocular efficacy of ALOCROSS® with that of VISMED® in patients with&#xD;
           moderate to severe DED related to keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis over a 12-week&#xD;
           treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ocular tolerability and safety of ALOCROSS® versus VISMED® in patients&#xD;
           with moderate to severe DED related to keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis throughout the&#xD;
           duration of treatment&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of ocular surface staining (OSS) score between baseline and Day 28.</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Baseline and day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the difference between patients treated with ALOCROSS® and patients treated with VISMED® in the change of ocular surface staining (OSS) score between baseline and D28.&#xD;
An OSS higher than 0 is considered to be abnormal and may be a sign of KCS. But scores of 1 or 2 can also represent a late staining artifact if interpretation of the fluorescein corneal staining pattern is delayed beyond 8 minutes. Because this could lead to a high level of misclassification, an abnormal OSS is defined as being a score of 3 or above.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of ocular surface staining (OSS) score between baseline and Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and Day 14 and between baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between patients treated with ALOCROSS® and patients treated with VISMED® in change of OSS score between baseline and Day 84.&#xD;
An OSS higher than 0 is considered to be abnormal and may be a sign of KCS. But scores of 1 or 2 can also represent a late staining artifact if interpretation of the fluorescein corneal staining pattern is delayed beyond 8 minutes. Because this could lead to a high level of misclassification, an abnormal OSS is defined as being a score of 3 or above.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of ocular stainings (corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) and clearing and conjunctival staining) between baseline and Day 28 and between baseline and Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and Day 28 and between baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between patients treated with ALOCROSS® and patients treated with VISMED® in change of ocular stainings (corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) and clearing and conjunctival staining)&#xD;
Staining using fluorescein will be graded using the modified Oxford scale (7-point ordinal scale, score 0, 0.5, and 1 to 5 per area [cornea + nasal and temporal conjunctiva]) for cornea and conjunctiva separately, On this modified scale, the score 0 corresponds to no staining dots and the score 0.5 corresponds to one staining dot per area. A CFS grade of 0 represents complete corneal clearing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of ocular discomfort symptoms on Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and Day 28 and between baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between patients treated with ALOCROSS® and patients treated with VISMED® in the change of ocular discomfort symptoms according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
Patient experiencing at least 2 symptoms of ocular discomfort rated ≥23 mm on the 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (among itching, eye dryness, sticky feeling, photophobia, pain, burning or stinging, sandy feeling or grittiness, or foreign body sensation) at Screening and Baseline visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change tear breakup time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and Day 28 and between baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between patients treated with ALOCROSS® and patients treated with VISMED® in the change of tear breakup time (TBUT)&#xD;
Generally, &gt;10 seconds is thought to be normal,(10, 11, 12) 5 to 10 seconds, marginal, and &lt; 5 seconds is considered low. A short tear break-up time is a sign of a poor tear film and the longer it takes the more stable the tear film.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in Schirmer's tear test</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and Day 28 and between baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between patients treated with ALOCROSS® and patients treated with VISMED® in the change of Schirmer's tear test&#xD;
Healthy eyes are considered to leave each strip of paper containing more than 10 millimeters of moisture. Less than 10 millimeters of moisture indicates probable dry eye syndrome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary endpoints are the difference between patients treated with ALOCROSS® and patients treated with VISMED® in:</measure>
    <time_frame>after 12 weeks of treatment (84 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall efficacy evaluation of the investigator&#xD;
The study investigator at each centre will conduct an overall assessment of the effect of the study device on improvement in the patients DED using the following rating scale:&#xD;
0 = Unsatisfactory&#xD;
1 = Not very satisfactory&#xD;
2 = Satisfactory&#xD;
3 = Very satisfactory</description>

The patients complete a subjective assessment of the effect of the study device on improvement in their DED using the following rating scale:&#xD;
0 = Unsatisfactory&#xD;
1 = Not very satisfactory&#xD;
