    <textblock>
      The research study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a virtual support&#xD;
      intervention to reduce stress and poor self-care for caregivers of persons with behavioral&#xD;
      variant Frontotemporal Degeneration (bvFTD) compared to receiving health information alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers of persons with Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) are an understudied&#xD;
      population with unique needs. FTD is a common cause of young-onset dementia with no known&#xD;
      cure. Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) is the most common of the FTD syndromes and involves a&#xD;
      progressive disorder of emotional regulation and personality, and significant impairment in&#xD;
      executive function. bvFTD caregivers face unique challenges which are particularly stressful,&#xD;
      including young age at which the disorder appears, behavioral symptoms like apathy and&#xD;
      disinhibition that are severe and appear early in bvFTD, and the lack of appropriate&#xD;
      supportive services. Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that stress, depression and&#xD;
      burden are higher in FTD caregivers than in any of the other ADRDs, yet caregiver&#xD;
      interventions tested in specifically in the FTD population have been limited to a few small&#xD;
      studies that focus on education around patient behavior management, not caregiver self-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a virtual support&#xD;
      intervention to reduce stress and poor self-care for caregivers of persons with behavioral&#xD;
      variant Frontotemporal Degeneration (bvFTD) compared to receiving health information alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 caregivers will be randomized 1:1 to a health information: health information + health&#xD;
      coaching group. Catered information will be delivered via tablets over 6 months with testing&#xD;
      dispersed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale, a 14-item instrument that provides a global rating of an individual's belief in the severity and frequency of stressful experiences during the last month. The Perceived Stress Scale includes 14 items designed to assess symptoms of stress and global measures of the degree of stress experienced in the past month. Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very often), with total sum scores ranging from 0 to 56; higher scores indicate higher perceived stress. Cronbachs alpha of the scale ranges from 0.84 to 0.86, and was 0.91 for older African American and European American females.</description>

    <description>CES-D is a valid and reliable scale for detecting caregiver depression in dementia.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Ways of Coping Questionnaire, short form</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 42-item questionnaire measures the use of five different coping styles: avoidance, problem-focused, seeking social support, self-blame, and wishful thinking. The original scale has been used widely since developed by Lazarus in 1985. The short version (30 items) uses a 4-point Likert-scale response format (0 = not used to 3 = used a great deal). Scores range from 0-90 with higher scores indicating greater coping. It is reliable (alpha 0.95) and has construct validity. This instrument has been used numerous times in studies with older adult caregivers.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ZBI has been used in numerous informal dementia caregiver studies to capture burden associated with providing care to a loved one. Total scores are summed and a range is provided for little to no burden (0-21) to severe burden (61-88).</description>
