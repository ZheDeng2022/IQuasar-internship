  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is the leading reason of ICU admission in immunocompromised&#xD;
      patients. Failure to identify the ARF etiology is associated with increased mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and mortality rates. This was confirmed in the large Efraim 1 study published in&#xD;
      2017, where undetermined ARF etiology affected 609/1611 (38%) patients at day 3, 402 (25%)&#xD;
      patients at day 7 and 199 (12.3%) patients overall, and was associated with a case fatality&#xD;
      of 55% (vs. 40% in other patients). In lung biopsy/autopsy findings from these patients,&#xD;
      invasive fungal infection, steroid-sensitive affections (organized pneumonia, non-infectious&#xD;
      interstitial involvement, drug-related pulmonary toxicity…), and lung infiltration by the&#xD;
      underlying disease (lymphoma, carcinomatous lymphangitis, systemic vasculitis, connective&#xD;
      tissue diseases, etc.) were the leading etiologies. No study has evaluated survival benefits&#xD;
      from empirical steroids and/or antifungals in immunocompromised patients with ARF from&#xD;
      undetermined etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to reduce the 90-day mortality in immunocompromised&#xD;
      patients with ARF from undetermined etiology at day-3. The intervention would evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of steroids ± isavuconazole for 14 days or until ICU discharge.&#xD;

    <description>Depression and anxiety will be assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. HADS is a self-administered scale of 14 items which assessed levels of depression and anxiety, divided into 2 subscales of 7 items (Anxiety or HADS-A, Depression or HADS-D). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score is generated for each of the two sub-scales (sum of the 7 items, ranging from 0 to 21). Limit scores : clearly or clinically symptomatic cases (score ≥ 11).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be evaluated using SF36. SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting. Items are grouped into three categories: functional status, well-being, overall health assessment. In two dimensions, the answer is binary (yes / no) and in the other 6 in ordinal quality (3 to 6 possible answers). For each dimension, the scores for the different items are coded and then summed and transformed linearly on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. A physical composite score and a mental composite score can be calculated according to an established algorithm</description>
