  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression affects 10-15% of women postpartum and has a recurrence rate of 40%.&#xD;
      Women who develop perinatal depression might be particularly susceptible to the rapid and&#xD;
      large changes in sex steroid hormones, particularly estradiol, across pregnancy to&#xD;
      postpartum. This trial aims 1) to evaluate the preventive effect of transdermal estradiol&#xD;
      treatment in the immediate postpartum on depressive episodes in a subgroup of women at&#xD;
      high-risk for perinatal depression, and 2) to determine if a set of biomarker gene&#xD;
      transcripts can identify this subgroup and thus form the basis for future personalised&#xD;
      prevention or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAMA Trial is a double-blind, 1:1 randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The trial&#xD;
      involves maternity wards at three university hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;
      Women who are singleton pregnant in the third trimester with a prior history of perinatal&#xD;
      depression are eligible to participate. Participants will be randomised to either estradiol&#xD;
      patches (200 μg per day) or placebo patches for three weeks starting immediately postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistical analysis will be performed based on the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
      A sample size of 220 will provide the trial with 80% power (alpha 0.05, beta 0.2) to detect a&#xD;
      reduction in postpartum depression of 50% and to tolerate a drop-out of around 20%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder affects twice as many women as men. Women are at increased risk for&#xD;
      depression in life phases, where endogenous sex steroid hormone milieu changes; such as in&#xD;
      puberty, during late pregnancy to postpartum and across menopausal transition. This includes&#xD;
      a subtype of MDD, perinatal depression (PND) that affects 10-15% of mothers postpartum and&#xD;
      has a recurrence rate of 40% in subsequent pregnancies. PND is a disabling disorder that&#xD;
      affects the entire family, including development and future health of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying risk and resilience mechanisms in MDD are far from clear, consequently,&#xD;
      current treatment strategies are suboptimal. Women who develop PND might be particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to the rapid and large changes in sex steroid hormone milieu, seen in the&#xD;
      transition from high levels of sex steroid hormones, in particular estradiol, in pregnancy to&#xD;
      low levels in the hormone withdrawal phase postpartum. Thus, PND is most likely has a&#xD;
      distinct pathophysiology, which may provide a unique opportunity for protecting mental health&#xD;
      by targeted short-term prevention in the immediate postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intriguingly, recent human data has provided direct evidence for sex hormone manipulation to&#xD;
      provoke subclinical depressive symptoms in about 12% of healthy volunteers. The phenomenon&#xD;
      was linked to changes in estradiol, which were induced by the pharmacological manipulation&#xD;
      with a Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone agonist. Estradiol affects critical domains and key&#xD;
      brain regions known to be dysfunctional in women with major depressive disorder. Estradiol&#xD;
      sensitivity predisposes to PND, which can be demonstrated at the level of gene transcription&#xD;
      in clinical cohorts, and is also directly supported by recent research results. Such&#xD;
      peripheral markers of estradiol sensitivity may prove useful in identifying individuals at&#xD;
      excess risk for PND, also in their first pregnancy, and thus may help direct preventive&#xD;
      efforts for the women who can benefit the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transdermal estradiol emerges as a promising preventive treatment option for the postpartum&#xD;
      onset of PND supported by epidemiological, preclinical, and clinical research, robust and&#xD;
      rapid response to estradiol in some pilot postpartum depression (PPD) trials with few side&#xD;
      effects and minimal breastmilk passage to the infant. Further, transdermal estradiol appears&#xD;
      to be effective in preventing clinically significant depressive symptoms among perimenopausal&#xD;
      women, which is another group of women in hormonal transition phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, a double-blind randomized, controlled trial (RCT) showed effect of treatment with&#xD;
      transdermal estradiol on manifest PND. A recent pilot RCT with transdermal estradiol as a&#xD;
      candidate treatment for postpartum depression failed to achieve its primary outcome, but&#xD;
      notably, did reduce depressive symptoms postpartum compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rather than treating manifest depressive episodes postpartum, the investigators here propose&#xD;
      a different approach: to target, and potentially prevent, early risk mechanisms in the first&#xD;
      three weeks postpartum, and to direct this preventive strategy towards women in high risk.&#xD;
      This immediate and early postpartum timing corresponds to the peak risk period and covers the&#xD;
      peak of hormonal decline postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims 1) to evaluate the preventive effect of transdermal estradiol treatment in&#xD;
      the immediate postpartum on depressive episodes in a subgroup of women at high risk for&#xD;
      Perinatal Depression with postpartum onset, and 2) to determine if a set of biomarker gene&#xD;
      transcripts can identify this subgroup and thus form the basis for future personalized&#xD;
      prevention or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The Maternal Mental Health (MAMA) Trial is designed as a double-blind, 1:1&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial setting involving maternity wards at three&#xD;
      university hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are singleton pregnant in third trimester with a prior history of perinatal&#xD;
      depression (onset before six months postpartum) and aged 18 to 45 years are eligible to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will be assessed for eligibility by the midwife or obstetrician when attending&#xD;
      antenatal care at the outpatient clinic. Eligible participants who verbally consent to&#xD;
      receive more information about the trial will subsequently be contacted by telephone. Written&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained before inclusion in the MAMA Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation will be conducted by the capital region pharmacy. Trial participants,&#xD;
      clinical care providers, research assistants, investigators, outcome assessors, and data&#xD;
      analysists will all be blinded to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated that a sample of 2*88 complete cases would provide the trial&#xD;
      with 80% power (at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05) to detect a reduction in postpartum&#xD;
      depression of 50%. Thus, with a study number of 2*110, the design is considered solid and can&#xD;
      tolerate 22% dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistical analysis will be performed on basis of the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. The investigators will compare data on the primary outcome for the two groups for&#xD;
      the superiority of estradiol over placebo with Pearson's chi-squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes with a continuous distribution will be compared between groups with&#xD;
      respect to the mean (Student's t-test) if the distribution is unimodal and symmetric, or to&#xD;
      the median if the distribution is unimodal but asymmetric, or otherwise to the ranks of the&#xD;
      observations (Mann-Whitney test). A test on the difference in proportions will be used for&#xD;
      binary secondary outcomes and a Pearson's chi-squared test will be used for categorical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a sensitivity analysis, we will use an instrumental variable approach to estimate causal&#xD;
      treatment effect using randomisation as an instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The short-term administration of estradiol transdermally is not&#xD;
      expected to pose unacceptable or intolerable side-effects, disrupt breastfeeding or pass to&#xD;
      the infant in any dosages that may pose a risk to the infant. Should un-expected side effects&#xD;
      for mother or infant occur or be suspected, the treatment will be disrupted immediately. When&#xD;
      removing the patch, serum concentrations of estradiol return to baseline levels within 24&#xD;
      hours. Participants who develop levels of mental distress or depressive symptoms that&#xD;
      approach clinical thresholds will be referred to relevant and timely psychiatric care by a&#xD;
      trained clinician. All potentially sensitive personal data will be anonymized. The trial will&#xD;
      adhere closely to the Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospect There is a pressing need to develop a preventive strategy to depressive episodes&#xD;
      during pregnancy and childbirth, that is targeted, cheap, short-term, and easy to implement.&#xD;
      Such work holds promise to positively affect women's mental health, their families, and&#xD;
      importantly, if successful, may also improve long-term outcomes of the infant's physical and&#xD;
      mental health.&#xD;
