    <measure>Time to Alleviation of Symptoms in Participants Randomized to ZSP1273 or Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days after first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the severity of seven influenza-associated symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) on a 4-point scale (with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 mild symptoms, 2 moderate symptoms, and 3 severe symptoms).&#xD;
Time to alleviation of symptoms was defined as the time from the start of the study treatment to the time when all seven influenza-related symptoms were assessed by the participant as absent (0) or mild (1) for at least 21.5 hours.&#xD;
Time to alleviation of symptoms was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier(KM) method; participants who did not experience alleviation of symptoms were censored at the last observation time point</description>
