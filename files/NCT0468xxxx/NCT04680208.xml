    <textblock>
      Background: This study assessed perioperative factors associated with planned and unplanned&#xD;
      postoperative ICU admission and evaluated the outcome of the two groups. There are limited&#xD;
      researches evaluating these factors. Hence, it is important to do an audit that assesses the&#xD;
      perioperative factors to help creating a criteria for postoperative ICU admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: This retrospective study evaluated medical records of 68 patients&#xD;
      above 18 years between January'2016- December'2018 that were admitted to ICU postoperatively&#xD;
      in Sultan Qaboos University hospital in Oman. Both planned and unplanned admissions were&#xD;
      assessed who underwent elective as well as emergency surgeries. Neurologic and cardiothoracic&#xD;
      surgeries were excluded. Data collected included patient's demographics, social status like&#xD;
      smoking, ASA physical status (American Society of Anesthesiologists), associated&#xD;
      comorbidities, other perioperative factors and investigations, surgical and anesthesia&#xD;
      details were recorded. The primary outcome studied was reasons of admission for planned&#xD;
      versus unplanned postoperative ICU admissions. The secondary outcomes included mortality&#xD;
      outcome and length of stay in ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 Levels of care available for patients who require high level of organ support and&#xD;
      monitoring. First of them is the high dependency unit (HDU) where higher level organ support&#xD;
      and monitoring is given (exception for mechanical ventilation) such as invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring. Second one is the intensive care unit (ICU), which provides support for&#xD;
      patients with multiple organ dysfunction that needs higher level of care which cannot be&#xD;
      provided in the ward or the high dependency unit (HDU) and without this care the patient may&#xD;
      not survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU admission post-operatively can be either in a planned or unplanned way. The complex&#xD;
      interaction between associated comorbidities, anticipated complications intra-operatively and&#xD;
      high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status are major factors in&#xD;
      planning for ICU admission post-operatively. ASA physical status indicates patient's health&#xD;
      status and has been accepted as a determinant of comorbidity and mortality. Unplanned ICU&#xD;
      admissions can be due to unpredicted surgical or anesthetic intra-operative complications or&#xD;
      poor assessment of perioperative factors. After surgery, some patients are admitted to ICU&#xD;
      for further management and monitoring based on their underlying low functional status and&#xD;
      co-morbidities. Out of these some patients may actually need ICU interventions and others may&#xD;
      not. If an ICU bed is booked for unworthy patient, this may lead to unnecessary increased&#xD;
      expenditure, wastage of valuable resources as well as deny the ICU services to potentially&#xD;
      survivable and worthy critically ill patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to assess perioperative factors associated with planned and unplanned&#xD;
      admissions to find out the main reasons of admission to ICU at Sultan Qaboos University&#xD;
      hospital (SQUH). This will help to lay guideline for guiding future admission to ICU for&#xD;
      surgical patients in immediate postoperative period and help to reduce the unplanned&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective observational study traced all adult patients (above 18 years old) who&#xD;
      underwent surgery and got admitted to ICU directly from operating theatre during the 3-year&#xD;
      period: 2016-2018 at SQUH. These were segregated into planned and unplanned admissions.&#xD;
      Required information was accessed using the hospital information system after receiving the&#xD;
      ethical approval from Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Ethics and Research Committee&#xD;
      (MREC#1937). Patients who were admitted to specialized ICU and those who underwent neurologic&#xD;
      or cardiothoracic operations were excluded from this study since they are admitted&#xD;
      postoperatively to ICU by default.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's data that were collected included age, gender, social status like smoking, ASA&#xD;
      physical status (American Society of Anesthesiologists), associated comorbidities such as&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, pulmonary diseases,&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease and cirrhosis. Associated factors and investigations were collected&#xD;
      like dehydration, hypoxia, hypercarbia, pH changes, pulmonary complications,&#xD;
      fluid/electrolyte imbalance, temperature changes, random blood sugar, sepsis, coagulopathy,&#xD;
      elevated WBC, low hemoglobin, hemodynamic instability, septic shock, hypovolemic shock,&#xD;
      infection, blood loss more than 20%, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. Type, nature and&#xD;
      duration of surgery, type of anesthesia and airway issues were recorded. Patients mortality&#xD;
      outcome and length of stay in ICU were included as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for&#xD;
      patient's data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to determine median, frequencies&#xD;
      and percentages of the data and were presented in form of graphs and tables. For testing the&#xD;
      significance between the way of ICU admission (planned/unplanned) and different variables,&#xD;
      Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used. To assess risk factors of mortality outcome and&#xD;
      long ICU stay, odds ratio was used. P-value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant.&#xD;
