    <textblock>
      This trial investigates whether an online intervention, iConquerFear, can reduce fear of&#xD;
      cancer coming back (recurrence) and anxiety in patients with renal cell carcinoma that is&#xD;
      restricted to the site of origin, without evidence of spread (localized). This intervention&#xD;
      is an online adaptation of a highly effective face-to-face treatment for fear of recurrence&#xD;
      that teaches strategies for: controlling worry and excessive threat monitoring, modifying&#xD;
      unhelpful beliefs about worry, developing appropriate monitoring and screening behaviors,&#xD;
      addressing cancer-related existential change, promoting values-based goal setting, and&#xD;
      reducing uncertainty by providing information about cancer and treatment. The information&#xD;
      learned may help others with renal cell carcinoma who also have a fear of cancer recurrence.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the iConquerFear program for patients with&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess preliminary effects of the program on Fear of Cancer Recurrence-7 item scale&#xD;
      (FCR-7), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-anxiety,&#xD;
      PROMIS-depression, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General (FACT-G).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore differences in feasibility and efficacy of iConquerFear by sociodemographic or&#xD;
      clinical factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete 5 sessions of iConquerFear program online over 5 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      complete questionnaires at baseline, after the intervention, and 2 months later.&#xD;

Fear of Cancer Recurrence-7. This is a 7-item scale that assesses the degree of FCR, with a cutoff score of 17 or above indicative of moderate and a cutoff score of 27 or above indicative of severe FCR.</description>

Scores range from 0-28 for the physical, social/family and functional subscales, 0-24 for the emotional subscale and 0-108 for the total score. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life.</description>
