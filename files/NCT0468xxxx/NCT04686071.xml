    <textblock>
      Background: Early rehabilitation following knee arthroplasty is an integral part of medical&#xD;
      management which reduces the time of patient's stay at hospital and eliminates the risk of&#xD;
      post-operative complications. The absence of consensus on the most efficient post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategy and shortage of practices based on evidence lead to seek new&#xD;
      therapeutic solutions. Therefore the goal of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the&#xD;
      PNF method in assessing functional performance in early stage patients following knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty Material and methods: The study was conducted among 96 patients (66,34 years&#xD;
      Â±7,29) who were qualified to total knee arthroplasty. The patients were randomly divided into&#xD;
      two groups. In the control group standard rehabilitation protocol was implemented while&#xD;
      post-operative treatment in the study group based on PNF method. All the patients were tested&#xD;
      on the day of admission to the hospital and after completing a 10-day rehabilitation program.&#xD;
      Structural and functional parameters of the operated knee (muscle strength, range of motion,&#xD;
      circuit measurements) as well as functional abilities (Staffelstein Score, Lequesne Index)&#xD;
      were evaluated.&#xD;

      Involution changes of the human body are characteristics of aging. A decrease in physical&#xD;
      activity as well as increased life expectancy can be a factor in the development of many&#xD;
      pathological changes in the movement system resulting in increase in the number of people&#xD;
      with diagnosed osteoarthritis (OA) [1]. Epidemiological studies indicate that osteoarthritis&#xD;
      affects up to 40 million people in Europe [2], including 10% of men and 13% of women above 60&#xD;
      years of age with knee degenerative changes [3]. It is estimated that in Poland over 8&#xD;
      million people suffer from osteoarthritis, out of which 25% have gonarthrosis [4].&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis detracts from the quality of life and leads to malfunction and this is&#xD;
      therefore necessary to early implement prevention and treatment actions which allow for&#xD;
      keeping functional performance and protection against development of destructive changes&#xD;
      [5].The study will be conducted in Cracow Rehabilitation and Orthopedics Centre. The study&#xD;
      group will be qualified to the total knee arthroplasty due to pain caused by advanced knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. . The patients will be randomly divided into two groups which differed in the&#xD;
      type of a 10-day treatment model used after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group standard rehabilitation protocol will be used in patients following TKA,&#xD;
      which is mainly based on activities in open chains (passive exercises with continuous passive&#xD;
      motion (CMP) device, active exercises, isometric, active resistance, patella mobilization,&#xD;
      deep tissue massage, verticalization and gait relearning). Treatment in the study group will&#xD;
      be conducted with PNF method with a use of indirect training based on irradiation phenomenon.&#xD;
      The program included: proprioceptive stimulation of the operated limb, improving trunk&#xD;
      stabilization and active control, active foot training, muscle strength facilitation of lower&#xD;
      limbs in closed kinematic chain with considering periarticular stabilization within the&#xD;
      operated knee joint as well as exercises improving mobility of the operated knee,&#xD;
      verticalization and locomotion with emphasis on the stance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, an attempt will be made to analyze treatment effects on parameters assessing&#xD;
      function of the knee joint and functional abilities in daily living with a use of a classic&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol and PNF method in patients following TKA. To evaluate efficacy of the&#xD;
      therapy all the patients will be tested on the day of admission to the hospital and on the&#xD;
      last day of the treatment. Structural and activity parameters of the operated knee joint will&#xD;
      be evaluated, such as muscle strength (6-point Lovett scale), range of motion (digital&#xD;
      inclinometer) and circuits measurement (centimeter). Circuits were measured on the level of&#xD;
      the knee joint articular space, 10 cm (Thigh I) and 20 cm (Thigh II) above the articular&#xD;
      space as well as on the level of lower leg (the widest point). Scales based on a subjective&#xD;
      evaluation, such as Staffelstein Score and Lequesne Index will be performed to assess&#xD;
      functional abilities.&#xD;
