  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implantation of artificial hip joints is one of the most frequently performed surgeries.&#xD;
      Normally, patients are very satisfied with the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MobileLink hip prosthesis system is a CE marked medical device. This means the the safety&#xD;
      and performance of the prosthesis ist approved. Aim of the study is to collect clinical data&#xD;
      about the outcome of the MobileLink hip prosthesis systen under routine condition and the&#xD;
      determine the satisfaction of the patients.&#xD;
