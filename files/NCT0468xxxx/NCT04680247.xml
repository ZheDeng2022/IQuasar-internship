  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From October 2013 28 patients with proximal tibia fractures (AO/ASIF 41 B-C) were included in&#xD;
      this study. According to our treatment algorithm for this entity Patients were assigned into&#xD;
      two groups and treated with different polyaxial locking plates (NCB-PT®, Zimmer vs. VA-LCP®&#xD;
      Synthes). After 12 months postoperative the investigators conducted clinical and radiological&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;

      Prior to the onset of the study, the approval by the medical ethics committee of the&#xD;
      Technical University of Munich (TUM) (Trial Number: 5923/13) was obtained. During a period&#xD;
      from October 2013 to December 2015 the investigators enrolled 28 patients aged 25 to 82 into&#xD;
      our study. All patients suffered a fracture of the proximal tibia. The fractures were&#xD;
      classified according to the AO/OTA classification. Every one of the 28 patients had an&#xD;
      indication for locking plate osteosynthesis. The investigators included all type 41-B&#xD;
      fractures and all type 41-C fractures. Pathological fractures, pregnancy, adolescence (age&#xD;
      &lt;18 y), prisoners and patients currently put under tutelage were excluded. The patients were&#xD;
      scheduled for a locking plate osteosynthesis with either the NCB-PT® system or the VA-LCP®&#xD;
      system. The discission was made by using our internal treatment algorithm for proximal tibia&#xD;
      fractures. Age, bone quality, fracture configuration, allergies and distal fracture extension&#xD;
      were among the criteria the investigators took into account to determine the plate type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical technique was standardized, as far as possible. All surgeons agreed upon the&#xD;
      following procedure. The anterolateral approach was used in all cases. Depending on the&#xD;
      fracture type and the damaged column the standard approach was supplemented with either a&#xD;
      posterolateral approach or a posteromedial approach. After arthrotomy and suturing of the&#xD;
      lateral meniscus the fracture was reduced. This was performed under direct visual control of&#xD;
      the joint surface and/or image intensifier. K-wires and/or a reduction forceps was used to&#xD;
      secure the reduction. Afterwards the locking plate was inserted and temporarily fixed to the&#xD;
      bone with K-wires. After checking the correct position of the plate with an image intensifier&#xD;
      the screws were applied. In case of VA-LCP®, additional lag screws have been inserted at&#xD;
      discretion of the surgeon. All patients received a perioperative single shot antibiotics. Our&#xD;
      postoperative procedure consisted of a partial weight bearing for 6 weeks for all patients.&#xD;
      Regarding the allowed range of motion the investigators distinguished two different groups:&#xD;
      patient who received an arthrotomy and a refixation of the meniscus ought to comply with a&#xD;
      limited range of motion for 6 weeks overall (week 1-2 30/0/0, week 3-4 60/0/0, week 5-6&#xD;
      90/0/0, week 7 free RoM). Patients with no arthrotomy were allowed free range of motion&#xD;
      immediately after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative clinical and radiologic follow-up The investigators conducted the follow up&#xD;
      after 12 months. The clinical evaluation was performed in our trauma outpatient clinic. With&#xD;
      the help of standardized questionnaires, the investigators examined amongst others: the range&#xD;
      of motion, cruciate ligament/ collateral ligament instability and meniscus signs to measure&#xD;
      the clinical outcome. Also the investigators collected data from 5 different knee scoring&#xD;
      systems, the Tegner score, the Rasmussen score (clinical part), the Oxford knee score the&#xD;
      Munich knee questionnaire and the Lysholm score. To measure the patient satisfaction the&#xD;
      investigators used the SF36 (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) Besides the clinical data the&#xD;
      primary outcome measurements also included standardized, blinded radiological evaluation. The&#xD;
      investigators conducted X-ray examinations in two plains (AP, lateral view) and examined them&#xD;
      for signs of screw misplacement, primary/secondary loss of reduction, non-union and&#xD;
      malalignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The statistical analysis was performed with the program GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad&#xD;
      Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). To check the data for standard distribution the&#xD;
      investigators used the D'Agostino omnibus K2 test. For continuous parametric variables the&#xD;
      investigators used the Student's t-test, for non-parametric variables the Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      and for binominal variables the Fisher's exact test. In all analysis the significance level&#xD;
      was set at a p-value &lt;0,05, the investigators plotted the data as mean values ± SEM.&#xD;
