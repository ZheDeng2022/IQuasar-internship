  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent access site for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO)&#xD;
      is the common femoral artery (CFA), using either an open or percutaneous technique.&#xD;
      Currently, percutaneous closure devices for femoral arterial access sites are approved for&#xD;
      use only when a 10-F or smaller sheath has been used. However, the availability of the&#xD;
      Perclose ProGlide (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) device has now made it possible to&#xD;
      perform percutaneous vessel closure after using larger sheaths.The preclose technique using&#xD;
      Perclose ProGlide, has been widely used in endovascular procedures. In a prospective&#xD;
      randomized study, complication rates at the access site were similar in patients who&#xD;
      underwent total percutaneous access (including percutaneous arteriotomy closure) than in&#xD;
      those who underwent surgical cutdown and subsequent surgical closure. Total percutaneous&#xD;
      closure of femoral arterial access sites increases patient comfort and decreases the rate of&#xD;
      wound infections and lymphatic fistulas.[6,7] Furthermore, patients are mobilized and&#xD;
      discharged earlier following the use of closure devices than with compression alone. Despite&#xD;
      the above observations, no data have been published regarding percutaneous closure of femoral&#xD;
      artery access sites in patients who have undergone VA-ECMO. In this study, we evaluated the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of a percutaneous closure technique using Perclose ProGlide to close&#xD;
      the CFA access site after VA-ECMO.&#xD;
