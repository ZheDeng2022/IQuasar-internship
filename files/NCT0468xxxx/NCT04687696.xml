  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      78 overhead athletes with Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD) will be included in&#xD;
      this study. Participants will be randomly divided into 3 different groups of 26 people. In&#xD;
      each group will be applied posterior shoulder stretching exercises (PSSE) performed with&#xD;
      different Muscle Energy Techniques (MET).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post Isometric Relaxation Group (PIRG) participants will perform a PSSE with post isometric&#xD;
      relaxation (PIR) technique, Isolytic Stretching Group (ISG) participants will perform a a&#xD;
      PSSE with isolytic stretching technique and Static Stretching Group Group (SSG) participants&#xD;
      will perform a PSSE with static stretching technique. All exercises will be performed in the&#xD;
      modified crossbody position, for 5 times a week total of 6 weeks. Subacromial space,&#xD;
      posterior capsule and muscle tendon thicknesses will be measured using a 7-12 MHz linear&#xD;
      transducer with USG (LOGIQ e Ultrasound, GE Healthcare, USA). Athletes' GIRD results and&#xD;
      rotational ROM measurements and Posterior shoulder tightness will be measured and recorded&#xD;
      using a bubble inclinometer (Fabrication End Inc, New York, USA). Scapula kinematics&#xD;
      (posterior tilt, upward rotation) will be evaluated with a digital inclinometer. Shoulder and&#xD;
      scapular muscles will be evaluated with hend held dynamometer. Tightness of Levator scapulae&#xD;
      and pectoralis minor will be assessed. The upper extremity functional performance of the&#xD;
      athletes will be evaluated with the Functional Throwing Performance Index (FTPI). Evaluations&#xD;
      will be performed before training program and repeated after 6 weeks of training, and at the&#xD;
      1st, 3th and 6th months after training program is completed and the effects of different&#xD;
      muscle energy techniques (MET) will be compared. Investigators hypothesized 6 weeks of PSSE&#xD;
      with different MET would have different effects on Acromio-Humeral Distance, posterior&#xD;
      capsule thickness, muscle tendon thickness, rotational ROM measurements, scapula kinematics,&#xD;
      muscle strength, posterior shoulder tightness and performance on overhead athletes with GIRD&#xD;
      and the effects of MET would be superior to static stretching.&#xD;

    <description>Athletes will be positioned in a modified cross-body position. They will be asked to actively bring their underlying arm in the direction of horizontal adduction up to the physiological barrier barrier. The participants will be asked to perform an isometric contraction for 5 seconds in the horizontal abduction direction with 20% of the maximum muscle strength. After the relaxation, the arm will be moved towards horizontal adduction and 15 seconds active-assistive stretching will be applied. Participants will be given a 5-second rest period between contractions.This stretching exercise will be applied in 5 repetitions in one session for 6 weeks 5 times a week.</description>

They will be asked to actively bring their underlying arm in the direction of horizontal adduction up to the physiological barrier barrier. The participants will be asked to perform a contraction in the horizontal abduction direction with 20% of the maximum muscle strength. When the muscle contraction occurs, the arm will be moved quickly in 2-4 seconds towards horizontal adduction and 15 seconds active-assistive stretching will be applied. Participants will be given a 5-second rest period between stretches. This stretching exercise will be applied in 5 repetitions in one session for 6 weeks 5 times a week.</description>
