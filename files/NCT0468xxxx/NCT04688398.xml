      This project proposes to conduct the first fully controlled and randomized clinical study&#xD;
      demonstrating the impact of DPA-rich sea bass oil on the reduction of symptoms related to&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. This unique approach will allow to clinically evaluate the benefits of&#xD;
      sea bass oil on the relief of rheumatoid arthritis-related pain in a population suffering&#xD;
      from inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to measure the efficacy of DPA-rich marine seal oil in&#xD;
      improving the clinical signs and symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis through the&#xD;
      score calculated from the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index (RADAI) questionnaire,&#xD;
      in patients suffering from this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of DPA-rich seal oil on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the degree of disease activity as measured by a joint examination performed by the&#xD;
           physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the patient's overall health, quality of life and level of fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. blood biomarkers of inflammation (CRP: c-reactive protein, TNF-: tumor necrosis factor,&#xD;
           IL-1, IL-6 and IL-17: interleukin);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the occurrence of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, the proposed study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-designed&#xD;
      study involving 130 participants with a previous diagnosis of RA from three research and&#xD;
      treatment centers in Quebec: the Centre de l'ostéoporose et de rhumatologie de Québec, the&#xD;
      Clinique de rhumatologie/physiatrie du Centre du Québec and the Institut de rhumatologie de&#xD;
      Montréal. Rheumatologists from each of the centers, as well as research nurses, will be&#xD;
      involved in this project, which will be coordinated by a research professional from the&#xD;
      Institut sur la nutrition et les aliments fonctionnels (INAF) at Université Laval. Half of&#xD;
      the participants (n=65) will randomly receive the experimental treatment (marine seal oil)&#xD;
      while the other half will receive the control treatment (vegetable oil). In order to reach a&#xD;
      minimum blood concentration of omega-3 fatty acids for measurable effects, the experimental&#xD;
      and control treatments will be administered over a 12-week period.&#xD;

    <description>Change in the RADAI (Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index) score post intervention is measured with a self-administrated questionnaire of 5 questions. Total score can vary from 0 to 10. Higher the score, higher the signs and symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Degree of disease activity through the 66/68-swollen and tender joint count (SJC66/TJC68)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after the beginning of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by doctor's joint examination on 66/68 joints (number of painful and swollen joints). The 66/68-swollen and tender joint count (SJC66/TJC68) is a common questionnaire used for rheumatoid arthritis. The joints count is scored as a sum of the tender joints and the sum of the swollen joints. Higher the score, higher the disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Patient's overall health</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after the beginning of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by a self-administrated questionnaire called Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Each question asks on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 if the categories can be performed without any difficulty (scale 0) up to cannot be done at all (scale 3). Result of this questionnaire is a mean score between 0 to 3. Higher the score, higher the difficulties related to the overall health issues.</description>

    <description>Measured by a self-administrated questionnaire called Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 or MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF36). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The higher the score the less disability.</description>
