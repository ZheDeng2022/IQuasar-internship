  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoring systems for use in intensive care unit (ICU) patients have been introduced and&#xD;
      developed over the last 30 years. They allow an assessment of the severity of disease and&#xD;
      provide an estimate of in-hospital mortality&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severity scoring systems that are commonly used in critical care settings include Acute&#xD;
      Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE), which was developed in the 1980s for&#xD;
      predicting mortality, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS), and Mortality Probability&#xD;
      Model (MPM). Although these scoring systems use different variables and weights for the&#xD;
      classification of disease severity, they commonly monitor parameters such as heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure, neurological state, and clinical data as these factors significantly deviate&#xD;
      from physiological normality in the progression of critical disease. Old age and chronic&#xD;
      disease are also captured by the scoring systems. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)&#xD;
      score, which is based on organ failure over time to evaluate morbidity and multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction is also used.&#xD;
