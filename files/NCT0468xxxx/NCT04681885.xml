  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cross-over clinical research is to evaluate the cleaning efficacy of&#xD;
      toothbrushes tufted with two types of tapered bristles and end rounded bristles in removal of&#xD;
      interdental plaque with clinical measurement (Plaque Index) and objective measurement&#xD;
      (digitally measured plaque area). This study will demonstrate the influence by a type of&#xD;
      processing bristles on removal of interdental plaque and determine an agreement between the&#xD;
      different evaluation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized evaluator-masked crossover study with 10 subjects. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to three test groups. Subjects will use the assigned toothbrush at&#xD;
      baseline appointment and two times a day for a week. Plaque Index and plaque area will be&#xD;
      assessed before/after one time use at baseline and Day 7. Subjects will be assigned to&#xD;
      another toothbrush after one week wash-out period.&#xD;
