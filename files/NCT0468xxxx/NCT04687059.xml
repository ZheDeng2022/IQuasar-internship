      PQGrass309 is aimed at exploring the expected average treatment effect of PQ Grass 27600 SU&#xD;
      cumulative dose on symptom and medication score in a field setting. The study will enrol&#xD;
      adult subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis (SAR) induced by&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PQGrass309 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory study to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of PQ Grass 27600 SU in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or&#xD;
      rhinoconjunctivitis (SAR) induced by grass pollen exposure. The study is expected to be&#xD;
      conducted in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). The study will enrol enough&#xD;
      subjects to allow treatment of approximately 150 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this exploratory field study is to explore amongst others the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficacy and safety (up to 6 months following treatment) of a cumulative dose of&#xD;
           27600 standardised units (SU) of PQ Grass in the treatment of grass pollen allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The expected average treatment effect on combined symptom and medication score.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Good general health, as determined by the investigator, based on a medical evaluation,&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. A subject with&#xD;
             a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the&#xD;
             population being studied may be included only if the investigator agrees that the&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Positive history of moderate to severe symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or&#xD;
             rhinoconjunctivitis ascribed to grass (Pooideae) pollen exposure that required&#xD;

             for relief of symptoms during the last 2 consecutive seasons prior to the study,&#xD;
             confirmed by subject records.&#xD;
&#xD;

             controlled (according to current Global Initiative for Asthma {GINA} guidelines [GINA,&#xD;
             2020]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A positive SPT for grass pollen (wheals [longest diameter] ≥3 mm and histamine ≥3 mm)&#xD;

&#xD;
             Exception: screening, treatment and collection of eDiary data can be conducted outside&#xD;
             of the pollen season(s) of concern or perennial allergies are irrelevant due to&#xD;
             avoidance measures (e.g., cats and dog allergy).&#xD;

             the interpretation of efficacy of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of severe or uncontrolled or partly controlled asthma as defined in the GINA&#xD;
             guidelines (GINA 2020) or asthma that requires more than a daily dose above 400 mcg of&#xD;
             inhaled budesonide or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Emergency room visit or hospitalisation for asthma in the 12 months prior to screening&#xD;

             will be allowed to participate at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any acute infection (including upper respiratory tract infections in the 14 days prior&#xD;
