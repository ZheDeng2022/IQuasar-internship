    <textblock>
      Pregnancy Induced Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) is common complaint in pregnant women all over the&#xD;
      world and it has a major impact on health and functioning as it decreases quality of life.&#xD;
      The onset of PGP is usually seen at 17-19 week of gestation, with a peak of incidence at 24-&#xD;
      36 weeks. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of stabilization exercises on&#xD;
      pregnancy induced pelvic girdle pain and its effects on the activity levels as compare to the&#xD;
      physiotherapy exercises that are routinely prescribed&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the study is Randomized Controlled trial which will be conducted in the Outpatient Physical&#xD;
      therapy Department. Patient with suspected PGP will be referred by midwives, physicians or&#xD;
      directly contact to Physiotherapist. Sample size of 30 individual was calculated by using&#xD;
      open Epi tool with 95% confidence Interval (CI) and 80% Power. Inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      patients is 13-28 gestational weeks determined by special test include P4 Test (Posterior&#xD;
      Pelvic Pain Provocation) and FABER test (Flexion Abduction and External Rotation).&#xD;
      Individuals would be randomly allocated into two groups by sealed envelope method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will be done at base line and 4th week by using NPRS and PGP Questionnaire. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed by using SPSS version 21.&#xD;
