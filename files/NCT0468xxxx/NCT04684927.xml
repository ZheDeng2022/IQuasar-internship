  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ApiFix MID-C System is a unidirectional expandable rod, designed to be connected&#xD;
      unilaterally to the spine via 2 anchor points on the concave side of a scoliotic deformity&#xD;
      above and below the apex of the major curvature to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The&#xD;
      MID-C System is designed to act as an internal brace. A total of 10 patients, who are planned&#xD;
      to undrego the MID-C System implantation procedure will be enrolled for the study. A 5 years&#xD;
      follow-up post surgery will be performed for these patients in order to evaluate the long&#xD;
      term safety and efficacy of the MID-C System.&#xD;

    <description>A 5 years follow-up will be performed for all patients who underwent AIS repair surgery using the MID-C System. The follow-up in order to assess safety and efficacy measurments. Eligible Patients will be followed and assessed at the following time points: Immediate Post-op up to 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually out to 5 years post-implantation.&#xD;
During the study, the following rating scales and assessments will be conducted to assess the probable benefit and safety of the treatment: Physical exam,X-rays,Cobb angle measurements,Adverse Events (AEs) and Scoliosis research society (SRS-22) questionnaire: The questionnaire is commonly used to assess health related quality of life in children with AIS.</description>
