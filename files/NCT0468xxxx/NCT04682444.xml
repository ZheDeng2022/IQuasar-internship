  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single blind clinical study was conducted to investigate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the drug Amizon (enisamium iodide), in comparison with placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI), including influenza.&#xD;
      Enisamium iodide is an antiviral small molecule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients were enrolled and randomised into 2 groups. On the first day of the onset of&#xD;
      symptoms of ARVI, one group of patients took Amizon tablets (active ingredient enisamium&#xD;
      iodide) for 7 days; the other group of patients took matching placebo tablets for 7 days.&#xD;
      Examination and observation of all participants was done for up to 14 days after the first&#xD;
      intake of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of treatment was assessed by subjective reporting of the symptoms of ARVI and&#xD;
      influenza, using a predefined symptom scale score system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective assessment was performed by measuring vitals signs, laboratory tests (including&#xD;
      blood and urine assessment), as well as evaluating the immune status (including measuring the&#xD;
      relative concentration of interferon and immunoglobulins).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have shown that influenza vaccines, prepared against the relevant epidemic&#xD;
      seasonal vaccine strains, are an effective remedy in prevention of this mass disease and are&#xD;
      able to protect about 80% of otherwise healthy children and adults. However, to develop&#xD;
      vaccines against the emerging new pandemic strain of the influenza virus and produce them in&#xD;
      the necessary amounts requires at least 6 months. During such interim periods, sufficient&#xD;
      protection of the population is essential by effective measures for treatment and prevention&#xD;
      of influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, single-blind, clinical study was conducted to investigate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the drug Amizon (N-methyl-4-benzylcarbamidopyridinium iodide,&#xD;
      international nonproprietary name enisamium iodide) compared with placebo, for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with ARVI, including influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enisamium iodide is an antiviral small molecule. Enisamium can directly inhibit influenza&#xD;
      viral RNA replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design was: randomised, single-blind, 2 parallel groups. Adult patients (18-60 y)&#xD;
      with symptoms of ARVI, including influenza took either Amizon tablets (active ingredient&#xD;
      enisamium iodide) for 7 days; in the control group patients took placebo tablets for 7 days.&#xD;
      Study visits occurred on Day 0 (screening, examination, check inclusion/exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      enrollment, randomization, and first intake of study drug); further study visits were on Day&#xD;
      3, Day 7, and Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of treatment was assessed by questioning the patients regarding ARVI and influenza&#xD;
      symptoms that included pain, headache, general weakness, sore throat, pain in the joints,&#xD;
      fatigue, runny and itchy nose. The severity of symptoms was recorded using a 4-point Likert&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further evaluation of the treatment was performed by measuring the vitals signs, laboratory&#xD;
      tests that included blood and urine analysis, biochemical analysis, as well as assessing the&#xD;
      immune status (including measuring the absolute lymphocytes count, and evaluating the&#xD;
      relative concentration of interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma, and immunoglobulins (IgA,&#xD;
      IgM, and IgG).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 0, 3, 7, 14</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the number of patients in the treatment and the placebo groups regarding clinical improvement from Day 3 after therapy start.&#xD;
Clinical improvement was assessed by the investigator from scores of objective and subjective data, relating to the severity of clinical symptoms of ARVI, including influenza.&#xD;
Objective symptoms were assessed using the following score system: normal or abnormal blood pressure was counted 0 or 4 score points; lung auscultation was counted 0 for vesicular breath sound and wheezing or crepitation were scored 2 or 4 points, respectively; clear and rhythmic heart sounds were each scored 0 points, whereas noisy and arrhythmic heart sounds were scored 2 points each.&#xD;
The subjective symptoms were assessed using a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (absent) to 4 (severe).</description>
