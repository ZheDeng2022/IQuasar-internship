  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheterization through the jugular vein is a standard procedure for&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgical patients. Ultrasound (US) guidance is preferred and compared to&#xD;
      traditional landmark approach decreases complications and increases success rate. Both long&#xD;
      and short axis views are used for obtaining access, both with their own advantages and&#xD;
      shortcomings. Complications have also not completely diminished with the use of US. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a new technique using 3D biplanar imaging, combining advantages from&#xD;
      both long and short axis views in one image, enabling more successful procedures and a lower&#xD;
      complication rate&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters (CVC) are frequently placed in patients who are scheduled for&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery (ICU). Ultrasound (US) guidance has consistently shown to not only&#xD;
      improve success rate of procedures, but also to decrease complications with most benefit for&#xD;
      the jugular vein. However, serious adverse events still occur despite US guidance&#xD;
      Conventional two dimensional ultrasound (2D US) guided access if performed in either the&#xD;
      short axis or long axis view, with both approaches having their own limitations. Using short&#xD;
      axis view, the operator is never certain of the position of the needle tip as the shaft of&#xD;
      the needle is not distinguishable from the tip in this view. Structures not (yet) visible in&#xD;
      the US screen can already be punctured, or a vessel can be entered at a different position&#xD;
      than preferred. A possible mechanism through which carotid artery puncture can happen is the&#xD;
      posterior wall puncture4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For long axis view, with proper technique the needle is viewed entirely during the procedure.&#xD;
      However, this requires extensive experience and the overview of surrounding structures is&#xD;
      lost.Multiple attempts at improving US guided venous access have been tried, such as oblique&#xD;
      visualization or alternating short and long axis views but those approaches still have their&#xD;
      shortcomings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dimensional ultrasound (3D US) has a theoretical advantage of increased anatomical&#xD;
      awareness, but evidence of improvement in needle based procedures is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new 3D US probe is introduced which can address the above mentioned limitations&#xD;
      of 2D US for access procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that this superior three dimensional awareness can improve&#xD;
      needle placement during central venous catheterization, increasing success rates and&#xD;
      potentially decreasing complications.&#xD;
