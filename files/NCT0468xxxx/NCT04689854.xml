    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of cervical&#xD;
      spine surgery using interbody implants as measured by reported complications, radiographic&#xD;
      outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of select interbody implant devices in patients who undergo interbody fusion&#xD;
      surgery of the cervical spine. Consecutive patients at a given site who meet eligibility&#xD;
      requirements will be asked to consent to participate in the study. These patients will&#xD;
      present with degenerative conditions in the cervical spine that are amenable to surgical&#xD;
      treatment and will be screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled into the study,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo interbody fusion surgery using one of the NuVasive interbody implant&#xD;
      groups based on the surgeon's standard of care. At least 150 subjects (a minimum of 75&#xD;
      patients in each implant group) will be enrolled and will be followed for 24 months after the&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>Radiographic Fusion Success</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of subjects meeting minimal clinically important difference (MCID) as compared to baseline for neck/arm pain measured by visual analog scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neck and arm pain measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) will be assessed to determine the percentage of subjects who meet MCID (2.5 points and 2.5 points respectively) where 0 is &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;Unbearable Pain&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of subjects meeting minimal clinically important difference (MCID) as compared to baseline for disability measured by the neck disability index.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disability measured by the neck disability index (NDI) will be assessed to determine the percentage of subjects who meet MCID (4.1 points) where a higher score on the NDI indicates a more severe disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of subjects meeting minimal clinically important difference (MCID) as compared to baseline measured by overall physical and mental health from PROMIS-10.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall physical and mental health measured by PROMIS-10 will be assessed to determine the percentage of subjects who meet MCID (5 points). PROMIS-10 scoring uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population.</description>

        The Enrolled Population will include all subjects who meet the criteria for enrollment,&#xD;
        specifically, those subjects who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent the surgical procedure, as defined in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects not meeting any of these criteria will not be considered enrolled in the study,&#xD;
        and therefore not included in any study population or analysis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Have a planned spine surgery using interbody implants at one or more cervical levels&#xD;
