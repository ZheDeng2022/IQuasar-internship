  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of proprioceptive vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation on balance, functional mobility, posture, sensory profile and quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with vertigo due to peripheral vestibular hypofunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral vestibular system; It forms the part extending from the structures in the inner&#xD;
      ear to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. Peripheral vestibular hypofunction is a&#xD;
      chronic disease affecting one or both sides of the vestibular system, which occurs when the&#xD;
      function of the vestibular organs, vestibular nerve, or both is reduced or destroyed. Many&#xD;
      patients with peripheral vestibular hypofunction develop symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo,&#xD;
      imbalance, gait disturbance. Many different exercise methods have been tried so far to&#xD;
      relieve these symptoms and increase the functionality of the patient. In this study, we aimed&#xD;
      to examine the effect of proprioceptive vestibular rehabilitation on balance, quality of&#xD;
      life, posture, sensory profile and functional mobility in patients with vertigo due to&#xD;
      peripheral vestibular hypofunction aged 18-65 years. Patients with vertigo due to peripheral&#xD;
      vestibular hypofunction between the ages of 18-65 will be included in our study. The&#xD;
      population of the research will be created by the cluster sampling method and the&#xD;
      randomization of the patients to be recruited will be determined using the &quot;research&#xD;
      ramdomizer&quot; computer program; Patients will be divided into 3 groups as experimental and&#xD;
      control groups. A randomized controlled, single-blind study will be planned. Group I&#xD;
      (experiment): Glance stabilization exercises, Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises and Proprioceptive&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation exercises, Group II (experiment): Glance stabilization exercises&#xD;
      and Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises and Group III (control): no exercise will be given, they will&#xD;
      be asked to continue daily life. Exercises will be applied to each group for 8 weeks, 4 days&#xD;
      a week, 30 minutes, in the presence of 1 set of physiotherapists and as a home exercise&#xD;
      program every day of the week. Individuals will be evaluated before and 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      treatment. Tinetti Balance Test for balance assessment, One leg stand test; timed up and go&#xD;
      test for functional mobility assessment; Dizziness Disability Inventory for quality of life;&#xD;
      mobile posture assessment application for posture assessment; Adult / Adolescent Sensory&#xD;
      profile will be used for sensory assessment. Pre- and post-treatment and intergroup&#xD;
      evaluations will be compared, and the effectiveness of proprioceptive vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation on balance, functional mobility, posture, sensory profile and quality of life,&#xD;
      and its superiority over standard exercises will be interpreted.&#xD;
