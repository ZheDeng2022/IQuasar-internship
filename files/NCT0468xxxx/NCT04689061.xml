      Surgery using the Arthrex PEEK or Biocomposite FastThread Interference Screw for ACL or PCL&#xD;
      (PCL at US sites only, Biocomposite screw PCL only) repair or reconstruction.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the continued safety and effectiveness of the PEEK&#xD;
      and Biocomposite FastThread Interference Screws used for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and&#xD;
      Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) repair or reconstruction (PCL at US sites only,&#xD;
      Biocomposite screw PCL only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess safety, device-related adverse events will be reported and evaluated over the&#xD;
      course of the study. To evaluate effectiveness, patient reported outcomes will be collected&#xD;
      at 3 months postoperative, 6 months postoperative, and one year postoperative using the&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for measuring pain in the affected knee and the Knee Injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) as well as Range of Motion (ROM, optional) for measuring&#xD;
      knee functionality.&#xD;

    <description>The absorbable Biocomposite Interference Screws combine the inherent degradation characteristics of a biocompatible polymer with the bioactivity of a ceramic. They are made of a combination of 70% poly (L-lactide-co-D, L-lactide) (PLDLA) and 30% biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP). The material has withstood the test of time with over a decade of clinical use and millions of implantations. It has been shown that the Biocomposite Interference Screw integrates well into the surrounding bone, produces little to no inflammatory response, and partially degrades 2 years after implantation</description>
