  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to provide reference for clinical application, the normal values of retinal blood&#xD;
      flow parameters in Chinese healthy children were measured by oct-angiography. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      repeatability and consistency of retinal blood flow parameters measured by oct-angiography in&#xD;
      children were further analyzed, and the correlation of retinal blood flow parameters with eye&#xD;
      axis, choroidal thickness, age and diopter was analyzed, so as to provide basis for clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of children's ophthalmopathy. Objective to study the effect of short-term optical&#xD;
      defocusing on retinal blood flow parameters, and analyze the correlation between the changes&#xD;
      of posterior segment parameters before and after short-term optical defocusing, so as to&#xD;
      provide the basis for the possible compensation mechanism of posterior segment optical&#xD;
      defocusing, and further understand the possible physiological mechanism of myopia.&#xD;

    <measure>Blood flow density measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>2017.05.01-2019.11.11</time_frame>
    <description>The vascular density was defined as the percentage of the area occupied by the vascular cavity after secondary reconstruction. The percentage of vascular lumen in macular area is automatically displayed based on the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) partition (i.e. macular area, paramacular area, temporal area, last time area, nasal area and inferior area), and the other partition method is based on the &quot;Nine Palace&quot; partition (i.e. central macular area, supratemporal area, superior area, Supranasal area, nasal area, infranasal area, inferior area, infratemporal area and temporal area)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Macular avascular area measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>2017.05.01-2019.11.11</time_frame>
    <description>The new non vascular area measurement option was used to automatically measure the FAZ area. The boundary of avascular zone is detected and defined by system software and quantified automatically. The reference range of shallow retinal foveal avascular zone,It was defined as within 60 LM from the inner limiting membrane. In the images of shallow and deep capillary layers, the foveal avascular zone is measured automatically by clicking the center of foveal avascular zone.</description>
