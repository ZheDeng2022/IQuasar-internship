  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information to develop a heart failure screening and&#xD;
      prevention program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will undergo phlebotomy for specimen collection (BNP, hs-cTn, BMP and lipid&#xD;
      testing, biorepository storage) and baseline echocardiography. All participants will&#xD;
      additionally be administered a health and lifestyle questionnaire, undergo measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs, and receive uniform education on heart-healthy lifestyle and signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of heart failure. Participants who are randomized to the intervention arm will receive a&#xD;
      referral to Heart Failure Prevention Clinic, a pharmacist-directed practice in collaboration&#xD;
      with an attending cardiologist, where they will be followed for 1 year, with their primary&#xD;
      care physician updated after each visit. The information from their BNP, hs-cTn, and&#xD;
      echocardiography will be provided to them and their primary care physicians as well as the&#xD;
      pharmacist and cardiologist team members. The participants (and their primary care providers)&#xD;
      who are randomized to usual care will be blinded to their BNP and hs-cTn values and&#xD;
      echocardiography results.&#xD;
