      In this proposal the investigators will use an accelerated TMS protocol that concentrates the&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation that would usually occur over 6 weeks into 10 treatment sessions per&#xD;
      days, for 5 consecutive days in patient with treatment-refractory depression. This protocol&#xD;
      will build on a previously published study demonstrating clinical efficacy of intermittent&#xD;
      theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-dlPFC) in a&#xD;
      treatment refractory population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disabling mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      up to16% . Approximately 30% of MDD patients suffer treatment resistant depression (TRD),&#xD;
      with at least 2 failed adequate trials of pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to be a safe treatment for TRD, yet the standard clinical&#xD;
      technique for using it as treatment depressive disorders is associated with limited efficacy&#xD;
      to date. Among the potential causes of limited efficacy have been the scalp based targeting&#xD;
      technique that is currently the most common targeting method rather than techniques that&#xD;
      incorporate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuronavigation, which have been&#xD;
      shown to have greater efficacy. Image guided TMS can target specific functional brain&#xD;
      networks with greater resolution that takes into account individual differences in brain&#xD;
      anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another technique for improving treatment efficacy, shown to modulate cortical excitability,&#xD;
      may be the application of intermittent theta-burst stimulation in regular intervals, which&#xD;
      has been shown to be no different than a longer-in-time application of rTMS. Paired with the&#xD;
      evidence that iTBS has produced significant antidepressant responses in severely depressed&#xD;
      individuals, and that relapse in depressive states predicts diminished efficacy of treatment&#xD;
      as well as increased quantity of TBS pulses to have a beneficial effect, these recent iTBS&#xD;
      findings suggest that iTBS may offer a valid treatment alternative to options that have&#xD;
      proven otherwise ineffective in treating TRD. Therefore, the investigators aim to administer&#xD;
      iTBS to severely-depressed participant in a shorter amount of time, in order to improve their&#xD;
      antidepressant outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This protocol builds on different notions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. iTBS is not different in treatment outcome than rTMS while applying the same amount of&#xD;
           pulses in shorter amount of time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The degree of treatment resistance is indicative of iTBS quantity needed to obtain an&#xD;
           antidepressant treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Repeated iTBS produces a significant effect in treating refractory depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Decreasing the interval between iTBS applications enhanced positive treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the compression of iTBS pulses with shorter intervals between sessions is&#xD;
      hypothesized to have an increased beneficial effect on individuals affected by&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;

    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured before and after treatment by means of the clinician-administered Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (0-60, lower scores indicate lower depressive symptoms) and the self report Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II) (0-30, lower scores indicate lower depressive symptoms). Change will be measured by comparing measurements pre- and post- on the same measures. The bigger the change, the bigger the reduction in depressive symptoms.</description>
