    <textblock>
      Primary objective of the study is to establish a 3-way PK similarity bridge between&#xD;
      MabionCD20 (candidate biosimilar to rituximab), MabThera® (EU-sourced rituximab) and Rituxan®&#xD;
      (US-sourced rituximab) following the administration of these drugs to patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Main secondary objective is to confirm therapeutic&#xD;
      similarity between MabionCD20 and the reference rituximab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to the 2010&#xD;
      ACR criteria will be randomized to receive a blinded treatment course of either MabionCD20,&#xD;
      EU-Rituximab (MabThera®) or US-Rituximab (Rituxan®) on the top of a stable methotrexate&#xD;
      therapy. Two infusions of investigational drug at a dose of 1000 mg will be given at Day 1&#xD;
      and 15. Patients will be then followed for a minimum of 24 weeks to establish PK and&#xD;
      therapeutic similarity and to compare PD, safety and immunogenicity parameters between the&#xD;
      three rituximab products (Main Phase). Patients may receive a second course of&#xD;
      investigational therapy at Week 24, provided that they meet re-treatment eligibility criteria&#xD;
      specified in the study protocol. Subjects in MabionCD20 and EU-Rituximab groups will be&#xD;
      continued on their assigned treatments, while all subjects in US-Rituximab group will be&#xD;
      switched to MabionCD20. All subjects (re-treated and not re-treated) will continue the&#xD;
      follow-up until Week 48 to collect long-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data.&#xD;
