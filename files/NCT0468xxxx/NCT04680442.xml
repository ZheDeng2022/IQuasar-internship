    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab is an important treatment for HER 2 positive breast cancer. But trastuzumab can&#xD;
      cause injury to the heart, and this is one of the main reasons it cannot be administered as&#xD;
      planned. Heart injury can often be successfully treated using cardiac medications. The&#xD;
      objectives of SCHOLAR-2 are to evaluate whether is it safe and effective to continue&#xD;
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab or trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with early stage HER-2&#xD;
      positive breast cancer despite mild, minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic systolic left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction as compared with a guideline-driven approach of withholding or&#xD;
      discontinuing trastuzumab, pertuzumab or trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In SCHOLAR-2, we will compare two thresholds of withholding or discontinuing&#xD;
      trastuzumab/pertuzumab/trastuzumab-emtansine: a threshold that is currently advocated for by&#xD;
      existing treatment practice guidelines versus a more aggressive threshold that allows&#xD;
      trastuzumab/pertuzumab/trastuzumab-emtansine to continue at lower levels of LVEF than&#xD;
      currently supported by guideline documents.&#xD;

      SCHOLAR-2 is a Phase II open-label randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome event&#xD;
      ascertainment with a target sample size of 130.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Recommendations for continuing or holding trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or&#xD;
      trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) for the control group are guided by an adaptation of the 2008&#xD;
      Canadian recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group The intervention group will continue to receive trastuzumab, pertuzumab,&#xD;
      or trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) in the setting of asymptomatic decline in LVEF up to an LVEF&#xD;
      of 40% as outlined in the criteria listed in Table 3. For reasons of practicality, in the&#xD;
      intervention group, the first dose of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or trastuzumab-emtansine&#xD;
      (T-DM1) after randomization can be administered up to 3 weeks late. This will allow time for&#xD;
      the participant to be reviewed by a cardiologist and to receive ACE-I/angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blocker and/or beta-blocker, and for dose titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 3 weeks after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6 weeks after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up at every 3 months thereafter until 12 months after the last dose of&#xD;
           trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1)&#xD;
