  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic prostate cancer will undergo two protocol 68Ga-PET scans within&#xD;
      24-48 hours with 68Ga-PSMA-cyclotron and 68Ga-PSMA-generator radiotracers. The goal of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate repeatability and equivalence across the different 68Ga-PSMA production&#xD;
      methods. This research study is being conducted to assess whether the PET/CT imaging results,&#xD;
      as generated from the two different 68Ga production methods, are equivalent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in the study and will&#xD;
      undergo two 68Ga-Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen- Positron Emission Tomography (PSMA-PET)&#xD;
      scans within 24-48 hours. The difference between the two scans is that the radiotracer used&#xD;
      in each scan will be produced with a different method (68Ga-PSMA-cyclotron and&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-generator produced). The first scan will occur after a baseline clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, which will include a history, physical, and baseline lab draw. After each scan,&#xD;
      blood draws will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate equivalence of two processes to create&#xD;
      68Ga-HBED-PSMA and compare dosimetry, biodistribution and whole body excretion/ metabolism.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the research team will perform dynamic analysis of the PET scans to investigate&#xD;
      repeatability of whole-body 68Ga-PSMA-generator Ki Patlak imaging against that of&#xD;
      conventional whole-body 68Ga-PSMA- SUV imaging and evaluate equivalence of whole-body&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA Ki Patlak imaging between the two processes to create 68Ga-HBED-PSMA&#xD;
      (68GA-PSMA-cyclotron vs. 68Ga-PSMA-generator). Patients will afterwards receive standard of&#xD;
      care treatment and follow up imaging.&#xD;

    <description>The biodistribution of 68GA-PSMA-cyclotron versus 68Ga-PSMA-generator will be evaluated by measuring the radioactivity concentration in various organs of interest. Based on the SUVmean and SUVmax, the RC unit will be used to compare these scans.</description>
