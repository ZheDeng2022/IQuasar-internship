  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mechanical vibration on root&#xD;
      resorption with or without the application of orthodontic force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients who required maxillary premolar extractions as part of their orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment were randomly separated into two groups of 10: no-force group and force group.&#xD;
      Using a split-mouth procedure, each patient's maxillary first premolar teeth were randomly&#xD;
      assigned as either vibration or control side in both groups. Buccally directed vibration of&#xD;
      113 Hz, using an Oral-B HummingBird device with a modified tip, was applied to the maxillary&#xD;
      first premolar for 10 mins/day during 12 weeks. After the force application period, the&#xD;
      maxillary first premolars were extracted and scanned with micro-computed tomography.&#xD;
      Fiji(ImageJ) which made slice-by-slice quantitative volumetric measurements was used for&#xD;
      resorption crater calculation. Total crater volumes was compared with Wilcoxon and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The sample included 40 maxillary first premolars from 20 orthodontic patients (7 boys and 13&#xD;
      girls; range: 15.08-18.58 years; mean: 16.77 years) who required bilateral maxillary first&#xD;
      premolar extractions as part of their orthodontic treatment. They were recruited according to&#xD;
      strict selection criteria as described previously.These included need for bilateral maxillary&#xD;
      first premolar extractions (necessitating moderate anchorage) and fixed appliance treatment;&#xD;
      permanent dentition; completion of apexification; similar minimal crowding on each side of&#xD;
      the maxillary arch; no previous orthodontic or orthopedic treatment; no unilateral or&#xD;
      bilateral posterior crossbites; no craniofacial anomaly; no history of trauma, bruxism, or&#xD;
      parafunction; no past or present signs and symptoms of periodontal disease; no significant&#xD;
      medical history that would affect the development or structure of the teeth and jaws and any&#xD;
      subsequent tooth movement; and no history of asthma. The sample size was calculated by using&#xD;
      Piface 1.72, and guaranteed 82.56% power. This number was reached by considering the standard&#xD;
      deviation of 0.46mm3 in our previous similar study. True difference of means was estimated at&#xD;
      0.2mm3, and type I error(α) was accepted as the standard value .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Bulent Ecevit University (2012/23).&#xD;
      All subjects and their guardians consented to participate in this study after receiving&#xD;
      verbal and written explanations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impressions were taken with alginate of the maxillary jaw only to construct the appliance.&#xD;
      The study model was obtained by pouring hard plaster. On this model, the transpalatal arch&#xD;
      was formed by bending a 0.09 mm steel wire between the maxillary right and left first molar&#xD;
      teeth. To prevent potential contact of the teeth during buccal movement to the transpalatal&#xD;
      arch, occlusion rising acrylic plates were added. The acrylic plates were of mean 2mm&#xD;
      thickness to only include occlusion of the first molar teeth. After fitting the transpalatal&#xD;
      arches in the mouth, light-cured glass ionomer cement (TransbondTM Plus, 3M Unitek, Monrovia,&#xD;
      USA) was applied to the maxillary first molar teeth of all the patients. After these&#xD;
      procedures, the patients were randomly separated into 2 equal groups. Randomization was made&#xD;
      using the Excel program (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA), and allocation was hidden in&#xD;
      consecutively numbered, closed envelopes. Blinding was used for treatment and outcome&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No-force group: The right and left side first premolar teeth were randomly assigned&#xD;
      (split-mouth design) so that mechanical vibration was applied in the buccal direction on one&#xD;
      side and the other side was used as the premolar tooth control group. Oral B Hummingbird&#xD;
      device (Procter&amp;Gamble, USA) with a modified tip was used for the application of vibration.&#xD;
      The tip was positioned mid-buccally of teeth to perform buccally directed vibration.&#xD;
      HummingBird is prescribed maximum period 0.00885s corresponding to 6800RPM or 113Hz of the&#xD;
      motor. The vibration procedure was applied for 10mins/day during the period of 12 weeks. At&#xD;
      the end of the 12th week, the first stage was completed and the first premolar teeth were&#xD;
      extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force group: The right and left side first premolar teeth were randomly assigned (split-mouth&#xD;
      design) so that mechanical vibration was applied in the buccal direction to one side and the&#xD;
      other side was used as the premolar tooth control group. As in no-force group, same device&#xD;
      procedure was used for the application of vibration. Self-ligating Speed (Strite Industries,&#xD;
      Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) tubes and brackets with 0.022×0.026 inch slots were bonded to the&#xD;
      buccal surfaces of the right and left first molar teeth and first premolar teeth.150g of&#xD;
      buccally directed forces, producing by a 0.017×0.025-in beta-titanium-molybdenum alloy (3M&#xD;
      Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) cantilever spring, were applied to premolar teeth on both side. The&#xD;
      force magnitude was measured with a strain gauge (Dentaurum). At the end of the 12th week,&#xD;
      the first stage was completed and the first premolar teeth were extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premolar teeth were extracted under local anesthesia by the same dental practitioner in&#xD;
      all cases. To remove blood and tissue remnants from the teeth after extraction, they were&#xD;
      washed with non-pressurized isotonic solution without touching the root surfaces, then each&#xD;
      tooth was placed in a 5 ml sterile tube containing 10% formalin solution (Sarstedt Ag &amp; Co.,&#xD;
      Nümbrecht, Germany). After 2 weeks the formalin solution was changed and no other procedure&#xD;
      was applied until examination of the roots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning of the root surfaces was applied using the SkyScan-1172 x-ray micro-tomography&#xD;
      device (SkyScan, Aartselaar, Belgium). To calculate the volume of the resorption craters&#xD;
      isolated on the axial slices, open-source Fiji (ImageJ) software was used. Using the convex&#xD;
      hull module in the software, a line was drawn joining the edges of the resorption craters and&#xD;
      the area below the line was calculated as the volume (Figure 4). Volumetric changes in the&#xD;
      craters on the root surfaces were evaluated both locally and totally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version 24.0(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normal distribution. Wilcoxon test was applied to the&#xD;
      within-group comparisons of the resorption volumes formed at different levels(cervical, mid,&#xD;
      apical) on different surfaces of the root(buccal, palatal, mesial, and distal). The&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test was used in comparisons between the groups.&#xD;
