  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the previous studies, it is reported that the use of sevoflurane in the&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia may lead to delayed occurrence of positive electromyographic (EMG)&#xD;
      signal and lower obtained signal amplitude. In this study, the investigators aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the anesthetic effect of sevoflurane combined with dexmedetomidine for&#xD;
      neuromonitoring during thyroid surgery. The investigators hypothesize that sevoflurane&#xD;
      combined with dexmedetomidine can reduce the movement or spontaneous activity of vocal cords&#xD;
      in patients and without affecting the EMG signals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury is one of the most serious common complications in&#xD;
      thyroid operation. Compared with the traditional operation under direct eye vision alone,&#xD;
      application of intraoperative neural monitoring (IONM) is able to help surgeon in identifying&#xD;
      the RLN during thyroid dissection, and enabling continuous monitoring of the neurological&#xD;
      function during operation, thus reducing the incidence of intraoperative RLN injury.&#xD;
      Sevoflurane is a common inhaled anesthetic in clinical practice, with the effect of&#xD;
      prolonging the action time of muscle relaxants. According to the previous studies, it is&#xD;
      reported that the use of sevoflurane in the maintenance of anesthesia may lead to delayed&#xD;
      occurrence of positive electromyographic (EMG) signal and lower obtained signal amplitude,&#xD;
      which may affect the surgeon's judgment on neurological function during the operation. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the anesthetic effect of sevoflurane&#xD;
      combined with dexmedetomidine for neuromonitoring during thyroid surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that sevoflurane combined with dexmedetomidine can reduce movement or spontaneous&#xD;
      activity of vocal cords in patients without affecting the IONM signal.&#xD;
