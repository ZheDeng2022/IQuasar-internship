      This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind controlled clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (TCI) with propofol and patient-controlled sedation (PCS) with&#xD;
      propofol, to conventional combination of midazolam and pethidine, in terms of quality and&#xD;
      safety of sedation, and patient recovery during outpatient colonoscopy.&#xD;
