      Study Objective(s)：This study is to evaluate the feasibility, preliminary safety and&#xD;
      performance of Exalt D Single-use Duodenoscope in ERCP procedures in China, to generate local&#xD;
      real world data from a Chinese ERCP population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design：Prospective, single-arm study Planned Number of Subjects：Up to 35 to satisfy 30&#xD;
      treated cohort Primary Endpoint：Ability to complete the ERCP procedure for the intended&#xD;
      indication(s) without crossing to reusable duodenoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also considered as Exalt D's ability if the clinical effect is the same per the&#xD;
      investigator's judgement in case of an endoscope change (non-Exalt D).&#xD;

      Device Description：The Exalt™ Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope is a sterile, single-use&#xD;
      endoscope that facilitates access to the duodenum, delivery of accessories, and live video&#xD;
      when connected to an Exalt™ Controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Exalt™ Controller is an electronic device that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receives video signals from a Boston Scientific single-use endoscope,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Processes the video signals,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outputs video images to a video monitor, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outputs electrical signal(s) that interface with external image capture systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design：This is a prospective, single-arm study with up to 35 subjects to satisfy 30&#xD;
      treated cohort in up to 3 centers. The study duration is expected to be approximately 7&#xD;
      months, assuming 6 months enrollment and 1 month follow up. The study duration for each&#xD;
      subject is expected to be approximately 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses：All statistical analyses will be done using The SAS System software, version 8&#xD;
      or higher (Copyright © 2000 SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, North Carolina 27513,&#xD;
      USA. All rights reserved).&#xD;

    <description>Endoscopist rating of the Exalt single-use duodenoscope compared to their past experience with marketed reusable duodenoscopes as it pertains to various design and performance related attributes. Besides those criteria similar to Exalt DScope 01 study, assessment in this study will include imaging quality (brightness, color, photometry), overall maneuverability and overall satisfaction, which will be rated from 1-10, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best.</description>
