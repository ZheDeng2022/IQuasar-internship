  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm, Phase II, multicenter study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of Camrelizumab (anti-programmed death-receptor 1 [PD-1] antibody) in combination with&#xD;
      Apatinib+carboplatin plus (+) etoposide in chemotherapy-naive participants with ES-SCLC.&#xD;
      Participants will be receive camrelizumab +apatinib+ carboplatin + etoposide on 21-day cycles&#xD;
      for four -six cycles in the induction phase followed by maintenance with camrelizuab&#xD;
      +apatinib until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued&#xD;
      until persistent radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration.&#xD;
