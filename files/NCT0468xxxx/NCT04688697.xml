  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the main malignant tumors threatening women's lives. In recent years,&#xD;
      the increasing demand for reconstruction of breast cancer patients in China has made the&#xD;
      proportion of breast reconstruction increase year by year, while implant reconstruction has&#xD;
      become the most important way of breast reconstruction due to its less injury, shorter time&#xD;
      of operation and relatively simple surgical technique. In the long-term clinical practice,&#xD;
      due to the lack of safe and effective alternative methods, the reconstruction method with&#xD;
      prosthesis placed to posterior pectoralis major has been accepted by surgeons and patients,&#xD;
      and has become the most commonly used method of prosthesis construction. However, the&#xD;
      development of biomaterials provides new ideas for breast reconstruction. At present, more&#xD;
      and more doctors in clinical practice discontinue the use of serratus anterior, but use the&#xD;
      synthetic mesh (mostly titanium mesh TiLoop® Bra) or allogeneic acellular dermal matrix mesh&#xD;
      to cover part of the dilator or prosthesis so as to shorten the entire operation cycle and&#xD;
      make the appearance of the reconstructed breast more natural and aesthetic. In particular, it&#xD;
      can improve the contour of the folds under the breast and shape the breasts with a certain&#xD;
      degree of sagging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study takes the patients receiving immediate reconstruction with an implant combined&#xD;
      with TiLoop® Bra after total mastectomy as the subjects, aiming to compare the aesthetics and&#xD;
      safety of the placement of implant to anterior and posterior pectoralis major through a&#xD;
      prospective and randomized study. The primary objective of the study is to analyze the&#xD;
      aesthetics of breast appearance, patient satisfaction and postoperative quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
      of the placement of implant to anterior and posterior pectoralis major. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to analyze the incidence of complications and type of reoperation&#xD;
      in both groups.&#xD;
