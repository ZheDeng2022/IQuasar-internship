  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T Cell Receptor-engineered T-cell therapy (TCR T-cell therapy) offers a potentially&#xD;
      transformative approach to treating cancer, but is currently limited by the lack of known&#xD;
      targets (Maus and June, 2016; Ping et al., 2018). Arguably the most clinically meaningful way&#xD;
      to discover new targets and TCRs for TCR T-cell therapy is to study the tumorinfiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes of patients that are actively responding to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)&#xD;
      therapy. These T cells are clonally expanded as a result of checkpoint inhibition and are&#xD;
      responsible for the patient's clinical response. The goal of this study is to acquire tumor&#xD;
      and blood samples from up to 40 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) malignancies who&#xD;
      respond to ICI therapy. T cells will be isolated from these samples and the targets of their&#xD;
      TCRs determined using TScan's genome-wide, high-throughput target ID technology. The expected&#xD;
      outcome of this study is the discovery of a collection of new targets for TCR T-cell therapy,&#xD;
      along with associated TCRs that will then be developed as novel therapies for patients with&#xD;
      similar malignancies.&#xD;

        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this&#xD;
        protocol. It is expected that the mix of patients entering this study will reflect the&#xD;
        demographics of the clinic population seen at the Washington University hospitals and&#xD;
        associated clinics.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known or suspected diagnosis of renal clear cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years at time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be eligible for or currently receiving treatment with immune checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitor (ICI) therapy as determined by the patient's treating oncologist. The&#xD;
             treatment regimen may comprise more than one agent but must include at least one ICI&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Examples of FDA-approved ICI drugs include pembrolizumab (Keytruda), nivolumab&#xD;
             (Opdivo), atezolizumab (Tecentriq), avelumab (Bavencio), durvalumab (Imfinzi),&#xD;
             cemiplimab (Libtayo), and ipilimumab (Yervoy). Immune-checkpoint inhibitors not on&#xD;
             this list may also be used, provided they are FDA-approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients undergoing an on-treatment biopsy must show a partial response of one or more&#xD;
             lesions, as assessed by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1 or irRECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients undergoing surgical resection of residual tumors must show a partial response&#xD;
             by RECIST 1.1 or irRECIST criteria of at least one of the resected lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients undergoing an on-treatment biopsy must have a cancer lesion that is amenable&#xD;
             for biopsy under local anesthesia or moderate sedation per standard procedures. The&#xD;
             tumor biopsy must have an acceptable clinical risk, as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Platelet count ≥50×109 /L prior to biopsy or per the service performing the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500×103 /L.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Must be able to safely hold aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient),&#xD;
             cangrelor (Kengreal), or ticagrelor (Brilinta) for ≥5 days prior to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of the biopsy. Patients on&#xD;
             therapeutic anticoagulation must be able to safely hold anticoagulation for the&#xD;
             procedure with an acceptable risk, as judged by the investigator. Patients who are on&#xD;
             anticoagulation for clinical reasons and deemed appropriate for biopsy must be OFF&#xD;
             anticoagulation prior to biopsy as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. No warfarin (Coumadin) for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH; e.g. dalteparin/ Fragmin, enoxaparin/&#xD;
                  Lovenox) for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No fondaparinux/ Arixtra for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients receiving alternative forms of anticoagulation not listed above (e.g.,&#xD;
                  dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) should consult with the prescribing&#xD;
                  physician and the service performing the biopsy regarding safety and&#xD;
                  administration guidelines prior to biopsy. Bleeding risks with these agents&#xD;
                  should be considered when deciding on whether to perform the biopsy if for&#xD;
                  research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent disease or condition that would make the patient inappropriate for study&#xD;
             participation, or any serious medical or psychiatric disorder that would interfere&#xD;
             with the subject's safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the&#xD;
             understanding or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction to local anesthetics (i.e.,&#xD;
             lidocaine, xylocaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant women are excluded because there may be an increased risk to both mother and&#xD;
             fetus in the setting of moderate sedation, which is required for biopsies of certain&#xD;
             anatomic sites (e.g., liver, lung, bone). Also, ionizing radiation from CT-guided&#xD;
             biopsies may pose a risk to the unborn fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active cardiac disease, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic angina within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of clinically significant arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia,&#xD;
                  ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes). Atrial fibrillation with&#xD;
                  controlled ventricular response on treatment is not an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months from study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the patient's treating oncologist or the&#xD;
             physician performing the biopsy procedure, would make participation in this protocol&#xD;
             unreasonably hazardous for the patient.&#xD;
