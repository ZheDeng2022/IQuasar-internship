      HS-10296-302 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase III study&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib versus placebo in stage II-IIIB NSCLC with&#xD;
      EGFRm+ following complete tumor resection, with or without postoperative adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (2~4 cycles of platinum-based doublet). Eligible patients are randomized to&#xD;
      receive either Almonertinib (110 mg orally, once daily) or placebo (110 mg orally, once&#xD;
      daily) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
