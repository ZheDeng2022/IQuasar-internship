      Doravirine is a novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that has demonstrated&#xD;
      good efficacy, tolerability, and safety for the treatment of patients with HIV infection in&#xD;
      phase III clinical trials. Doravirine achieved non- inferiority when compared with efavirenz-&#xD;
      and darunavir/ritonavir-based regimens. Doravirine is mainly metabolized and eliminated by&#xD;
      the liver, with only 6% of the drug being excreted unchanged through the urine.In a study&#xD;
      comparing 8 subjects with severe renal disease to 8 subjects without renal impairment, the&#xD;
      single dose exposure of doravirine was 43% higher in subjects with severe renal function&#xD;
      impairment.However, according to prescribing information, no dosage adjustment of doravirine&#xD;
      is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. On the other hand,&#xD;
      data on doravirine pharmacokinetics in patients with ESRD on dialysis are lacking. This may&#xD;
      be of special interest because doravirine has a relatively low molecular weight and it is&#xD;
      only 76% bound to proteins in plasma. These characteristics could make possible for&#xD;
      hemodialysis to remove doravirine from plasma, potentially leading to subtherapeutic&#xD;
      concentrations of doravirine after the dialysis sessions. On the contrary, doravirine volume&#xD;
      of distribution is about 60 liters,15 what could limit extraction of doravirine by&#xD;
      hemodialysis. Since data on doravirine pharmacokinetics in PLWH with ESRD on dialysis are&#xD;
      lacking, our aim is to evaluate the effect of intermittent hemodialysis on doravirine&#xD;
      concentrations in HIV-infected patients with ESRD&#xD;
