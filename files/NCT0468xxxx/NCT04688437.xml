    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-center study. Patients with adult degenerative scoliosis are&#xD;
      prospectively enrolled and followed. All patients will take standard standing and sitting&#xD;
      posteroanterior and lateral whole spine X-ray and lumbar MRI examination before and after&#xD;
      surgery. Functional evaluation and radiographs were assessed preoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively.This study will focus on the correlation among standing-sitting sagittal&#xD;
      spinal alignment, paravertebral muscle and postoperative clinical outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      adult degenerative scoliosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sagittal alignment of the spine, or sagittal balance, describe the ideal and normal&#xD;
      sagittal spinal curvature distribution. With the deepening of the research on spinal&#xD;
      morphology, function and pathology, more and more researchers pay attention to the role of&#xD;
      sagittal alignment in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal deformity diseases. Some studies&#xD;
      have shown that the restoration of patients with appropriate sagittal alignment can&#xD;
      significantly improve their quality of life. Besides, paravertebral muscle can also influence&#xD;
      the retaining of sagittal alignment. However, how to define the ideal sagittal alignment is&#xD;
      still controversial for different patients with adult degenerative scoliosis(ADS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was proved that the differences in sagittal parameters of the standing and sitting&#xD;
      positions positions were influenced by age, gender and pelvic incidence(PI). In addition,&#xD;
      patients with high PI are more prone to sagittal decompensation after long segment fixation&#xD;
      (fixation of three or more segments) .Therefore, We speculate that the sagittal curvature of&#xD;
      patients with large PI changes greatly from standing position to sitting position. So after&#xD;
      long segment fixation, the spine in the state of standing position is more difficult to adapt&#xD;
      to the changes of curvature and stress in sitting position, which is the possible reason that&#xD;
      patients with high PI are more prone to sagittal decompensation. At present, how to design&#xD;
      the proper corrective goals for patients according to both sagittal alignment and&#xD;
      paravertebral muscle needs further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study is aim to explore these three points about ADS patients: the characteristics&#xD;
      of the sagittal spinal alignment changes from standing to sitting ; the adaption of the spine&#xD;
      curvature in the standing and sitting position after long segment fixation surgery and the&#xD;
      relationship among standing-sitting sagittal spinal alignment, paravertebral muscle and&#xD;
      postoperative clinical outcomes.&#xD;
