  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, long-term catheter patients in the Community setting (both catheter clinic&#xD;
      attenders or home catheter changes) will be invited to participate in a randomised cross-over&#xD;
      study to compare their standard Foley catheter with the Optitip catheter. The participants&#xD;
      will be randomised to Arm A (Standard Foley catheter then Optitip) or Arm B (Optitip then&#xD;
      Standard Foley catheter) and will have each catheter inserted for successive periods of 4&#xD;
      weeks (+ up to 7 days). The catheters will be collected following removal and analysed for&#xD;
      presence of biofilm; catheter specimens of urine will also be collected to measure&#xD;
      detection/quantity microorganisms and cytokines. The quality of life of participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and the end of each study period using a validated quality of life tool&#xD;
      for long-term catheter users - the ICIQ-LTCqol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When normal bladder emptying is not possible due to injury, disease, surgery, or neurological&#xD;
      conditions, an indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) may be required. An estimated 90,000 people&#xD;
      in the UK require a long-term urinary catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary catheters are associated with significant harm and can cause substantial distress.&#xD;
      Furthermore, managing frequent catheter-associated problems is a resource intensive burden to&#xD;
      the providers of community healthcare services Currently, most patients use the standard&#xD;
      Foley catheter design and experience problems that can constrain work and social lives, lead&#xD;
      to UTI and pain and substantially reduce quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optitip catheter became available on the Drug Tariff in 2017. Unlike the Foley catheter&#xD;
      design which has a protruding tip, the Optitip has a blunt open end (eyelet) that protrudes&#xD;
      slightly beyond a single fluid-filled 10ml balloon. It has an additional drainage eyelet&#xD;
      underneath the balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optitip therefore has the potential to make important differences to patients by reducing&#xD;
      pain/discomfort; reducing blockage frequency and potentially reducing clinical infection.&#xD;

    <description>To compare the accumulation of biofilm on the catheter surface as a marker for the likelihood of blockage following 4 weeks insertion of an Optitip catheter to 4 weeks insertion of a standard Foley catheter. The 2 catheters (Foley and Optitip) will be collected and sent to the laboratory immediately after removal - the insertion period is 4 weeks + up to 7 days.</description>
