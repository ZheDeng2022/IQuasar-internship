    <textblock>
      After emergency room visits, the elderly patients can increase their dependence and&#xD;
      functional decline. In this context the goal of this study is to demonstrate that there are&#xD;
      robustness predictive factors after visit to the emergency room.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergency department is one of the main access routes to the hospital for elderly&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older age is often associated with an increase risk of longer stay in the emergency room with&#xD;
      a high subsequent risk of hospital re-admission. One of the essential care objectives when&#xD;
      treating these patients is to maintain the autonomy to avoid any dependence in order to keep&#xD;
      the quality of life, and limit the time of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency room visits and hospitalizations are too often considered as a source of autonomy&#xD;
      loss aggravation in the elderly. Many studies have demonstrated the mortality predictive&#xD;
      factors existence, functional decline, or re-hospitalization of the elderly after an&#xD;
      emergency room visit or after hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study until now has investigated the existence of factors directly predictive of&#xD;
      robustness. Then the goal of this study is to demonstrate that there are robustness&#xD;
      predictive factors after going to the emergency room.&#xD;

    <description>The TRST score is a tool to predict repeat emergency department visits and hospitalizations in older patients discharged from the emergency department; This tool evaluates 5 dimensions : cognitive disorders presence, walking disorders, polymedication, hospitalization antecedents and functional assessment (loss of autonomy). Every dimension is worth 1 point if the patient presents the disorder. The final maximum score is 5 points.</description>

    <measure>Sleep assessment using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale allows patients to assess their fatigue. The patients locate their fatigue intensity on a 100-millimeters horizontal line. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>
