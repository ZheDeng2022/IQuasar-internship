  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current antibiotic prescription for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is generally based on the Anthonisen criteria in The Global&#xD;
      Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) guideline, that has a potential&#xD;
      risk of antibiotics overuse. The dilemma is to identify patients who are most likely to&#xD;
      benefit from antibiotics while avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use. Procalcitonin (PCT), a&#xD;
      more sensitive and specific biomarker of bacterial infection than other conventional&#xD;
      laboratory tests, has the potential to determine those patients in whom antibiotics would be&#xD;
      beneficial. It is unclear whether PCT-guided antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for&#xD;
      inpatients with AECOPD. The investigators aim to conduct a 2-arm, multicenter randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in China to determine whether PCT-guided antibiotic therapy will reduce the&#xD;
      antibiotic prescription rate for AECOPD without negatively impacting the treatment success&#xD;
      rate, compared with the GOLD guideline antibiotic recommendations.&#xD;

      This trial will recruit 500 hopitalized patients with AECOPD. The eligible participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either PCT group or guideline group.The investigators aim to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety between PCT-gudied antibiotic therapy and guideline-guided antibiotic&#xD;
      recommendations. The primary hypothesis is that PCT-guided antibiotic therapy will reduce the&#xD;
      antibiotic prescription rate for AECOPD without negatively impacting the treatment success&#xD;
      rate, compared with the GOLD guideline antibiotic recommendations.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the PCT group will complete a PCT test within 2 hours after randomization and the results will be sent back to the clinician by laboratory through the internal network of the hospital. The prescribing clinician will use the results of the PCT to help guide their antibiotic prescription decision. The detailed recommendations are as follows: if PCT&lt;0.1ng/ml，strongly discouraged；if PCT (0.1-0.25ng/ml) and no sputum purulence, discouraged; if PCT (0.1-0.25ng/ml) and sputum purulence, Recommended; PCT&gt;0.25 ng/ml, Strongly recommended.</description>

    <description>Participants in the guideline group will also need to complete a PCT test within 2 hours after randomization, however, the laboratory will save the results and do not sent back to the clinician. The clinician will make an antibiotic prescribing decision on the basis of the recommendations of GOLD guideline. The guideline recommend the following patients to receive antibiotic therapy. Patients with exacerbations of COPD who have three cardinal symptoms: increase in dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence; have two of the cardinal symptoms, if increased purulence of sputum is one of the two symptoms; or require mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive).</description>
