  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label whole-body PET/CT study for investigating the value of 68Ga-DOTA-TATE&#xD;
      and 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 PET/CT in patients with Tumor-induced osteomalacia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), also known as oncogenic osteomalacia, is a rare&#xD;
      paraneoplastic syndrome. The key to the cure of TIO is surgical resection of the culprit&#xD;
      tumor. Over the last decade, 68Ga-labeled SSTR-based imaging has made a significant impact in&#xD;
      detecting the culprit tumor of TIO 68Ga-DOTA-TATE is the most used SSTR PET tracer for the&#xD;
      detection of TIO and it was recommended as first-line imaging method for localization of the&#xD;
      causative tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, false positive, including fracture and/or inflammation, in 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT is&#xD;
      a challenge in image interpretation, which may make the causative tumor indistinguishable in&#xD;
      multiple suspicious lesions. There is no effective way to identify multiple suspicious&#xD;
      lesions with intensive increased uptake on 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTA-JR11 is a SSTR2 specific antagonist used for PET tracer. However, the SSTR2&#xD;
      affinity of 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 is lower than 68Ga-DOTA-TATE, which means that the uptake of&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTA-JR11 by suspected lesions may be lower than that of 68Ga-DOTA-TATE. The purpose of&#xD;
      this prospective study is to compare the sensitivity of 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 and 68Ga-DOTA-TATE&#xD;
      PET/CT for detecting the responsible tumor of TIO and investigate if 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 PET/CT&#xD;
      can identify the culprit tumor of TIO in multiple suspicious lesions.&#xD;
