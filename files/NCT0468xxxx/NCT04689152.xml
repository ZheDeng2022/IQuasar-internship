    <description>In order to compare the difference between groups in the amount of change in each evaluation variable at the time of visit after cell administration/best supportive therapy compared to the baseline value, covariance analysis (ANCOVA) is performed by setting the baseline time point and stratification factor as a correction variable for each evaluation variable.&#xD;
CP score was calculated using five factors: hepatic encephalopathy, prothrombin time, bilirubin, serum albumin, and ascites, and the score range was 5-15 points.&#xD;
In the Child-Pugh grade, scores of the five factors are summed and evaluated as A if it is less than 7 points, B if it is 7-9, and C if it exceeds 9 points.</description>
