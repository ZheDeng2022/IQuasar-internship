      This novel pilot project will assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids in treatment of&#xD;
      acute post-concussion headache. The investigators hypothesize that the use of corticosteroids&#xD;
      will cause significant headache reduction in frequency and/or intensity than individuals who&#xD;
      undergo the current standard of care. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      corticosteroid use will lead to a reduction in other somatic symptoms including vestibular&#xD;
      symptoms, leading to quicker return to school, work, and/or ability to play sports.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To the best of the investigators' knowledge, this is a novel study. Studies have been&#xD;
      previously done on individuals who have suffered an acute TBI and were admitted to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) setting but none have been completed on individuals who suffer&#xD;
      post-concussion headaches. Despite a high prevalence of post-concussive headache, there are&#xD;
      no evidence-based guidelines for acute or preventive pharmacological treatment. Patients who&#xD;
      experience very frequent or daily headache post-concussive headache are also at risk of&#xD;
      developing medication-overuse headache (MOH)12. In addition, patients with post-concussive&#xD;
      headache experience disabling comorbidities such as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      sleep disturbances 12 This study will be of benefit to patients who suffer headaches after a&#xD;
      concussion because, though various treatments have been studied, including a combination of&#xD;
      Reglan and Benadryl (63% effective in one prospective study) triptans vs non-triptans (70%&#xD;
      effective vs 42% effective in one retrospective trial), gabapentin vs tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants vs. no medication (no significant difference in outcome), none have been&#xD;
      established as a definitive treatment regimen for post-concussive headache 12.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are currently utilized for management of these headaches; they are done so at&#xD;
      the discretion of the physician and like the aforementioned medications, are not standard of&#xD;
      care. Corticosteroid used in severe TBI (GCS &lt; 8) have been widely studied8, however the&#xD;
      utility has not been conclusive. Of note, case studies in the pediatric population with mild&#xD;
      TBI (GCS 13-15) and post-concussive headache, report that they respond well to the Medrol&#xD;
      Dose Pack with headache improvement during or after completion of the medication2. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no standard treatment of post-concussion headaches, and in clinical practice, it has&#xD;
      been observed that only approximately 50% of patients improve without any medication use. It&#xD;
      is important to establish the role of corticosteroids in treating post-concussive headaches&#xD;
      because they may improve quality of life and accelerate patient's functional recovery.&#xD;
