  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the potential effect of a supplement of maltodextrin and added&#xD;
      dietary carbohydrates on the level of function in patients with apoplexia. The study has an&#xD;
      intervention group and a control group. The study is randomized, but not blinded. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is level of function measured with Barthel-100. Besides the primary outcome there are&#xD;
      several secondary outcomes (see detailed description). All patients are recruited from&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, Glostrup.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the potential effect of a supplement of maltodextrin (20 g for&#xD;
      women and 30 g for men) and added dietary carbohydrates on the level of function in patients&#xD;
      with apoplexia. The study has an intervention group and a control group. The study is&#xD;
      randomized, but not blinded. The primary outcome is level of function measured with&#xD;
      Barthel-100. Secondary outcomes are: training intensity, duration and frequency; length of&#xD;
      stay; self-training (training without a therapist) and patient's experienced fatigue; and&#xD;
      patient's experienced pain. All patients are recruited from Rigshospitalet, Glostrup. The&#xD;
      supplement will be administered before and after each training session with a therapist. The&#xD;
      supplement is a powder desolved in a glass of juice. The nursing staff will add extra&#xD;
      carbohydrates to the patient's meals in the form of potatoes, rice, bread, fruit or other&#xD;
      carbohydrate rich food items. All meals will be noted daily and validated the following day&#xD;
      by the primary investigators.&#xD;
