  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A more recent competing technology for implementing the DIBH technique is real-time surface&#xD;
      photogrammetry using the AlignRT system (Vision RT Ltd., London, UK). AlignRT system use&#xD;
      non-ionization near infrared light to track patient surface motion. The system has one&#xD;
      projector projecting near infrared optical pattern on patient surface. The optical pattern is&#xD;
      imaged by optical cameras (two per pod) at ~25 Hz. The user selects a region-of-interest&#xD;
      (ROI) on the surface and the software calculates and displays the real-time position in six&#xD;
      degrees (3 translations and 3 rotations) in real-time. Once the patient has matched the&#xD;
      pre-determined DIBH position (within threshold accuracy), the radiation beam is enabled to be&#xD;
      turned on for treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VRT-DIBH has already applied to left breast radiotherapy to spare lung and heart. Compared to&#xD;
      ABC-DIBH, VRT-DIBH has several potential advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VRT monitors patient (surface) position in addition to DIBH signal, while ABC only check&#xD;
           the tidal volume, which can remain the same even if the patient shifts slightly on the&#xD;
           couch;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. VRT is more cost effective, as patient tubing needs to be replaced daily for ABC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VRT potentially has advantage on patient compliance, as with ABC breath is forced&#xD;
           impeded while with VRT breath-hold is voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we renovate the established DIBH motion management strategy by adopting&#xD;
      AlignRT system. The purpose of this study is to develop, validate, and prove the feasibility&#xD;
      of VRT-DIBH technique for lung and liver SBRT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be willing and capable to provide informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
