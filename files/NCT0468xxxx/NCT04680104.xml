      Prospective observational study comparing calcium and sodium levofolinate in combination with&#xD;
      5FU/or in FOLFIRI regimen on patients affected by gastrointestinal cancer (any site of&#xD;
      disease along with gastrointestinal tract) who have been prescribed FOLFIRI in standard&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an observational, perspective trial on patients affected by gastrointestinal cancer&#xD;
      (any site of disease along with gastrointestinal tract) who have been prescribed FOLFIRI in&#xD;
      standard clinical practice. All patients will be treated and monitored according to the local&#xD;
      clinical practice. No additional procedures/patient visits in comparison with the usual&#xD;
      clinical practice are planned for the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety profiles of Na-Lev and Ca-Lev when administered in combination with 5-FU in FOLFIRI regimen to cancer patients under standard clinical practice. Reported Adverse Events (AE) will be summarized by system organ class, seriousness, severity (according to NCI -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE version 4.0) and relationship to study drug. Comparison between groups will be performed using non parametric statistical test.</description>

    <measure>organizational impact on Drug production</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>organizational impact that the introduction of Na-Lev would have on Drug production and delivery. The set-up times of preparation of Na-lev (by manual procedure) with respect to Ca-lev will be measured: for each individual therapy prescribed by clinicians the timing of the manual preparation in Official Pharmaceutical Lab (LFO) will be measured by chronometer, for the entire duration of each production line.</description>

    <measure>economical impact</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>economical impact hat the introduction of Na-Lev would have on Drug production and delivery. The set-up times of preparation of Na-lev (by manual procedure) with respect to Ca-lev will be measured: after preparation, the difference in waste of residual drug will be measured (if present) for each production. Quantity of residual drugs will be reported for each product line taking account of weight of enrolled patients.</description>
