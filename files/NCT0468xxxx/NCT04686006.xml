  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the drug treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism, Plummer reported the effectiveness of&#xD;
      excess iodide in 1923 and iodide was used as the therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism starting&#xD;
      from the 1930s. After the introduction of more potent antithyroid drug, thionamide, most&#xD;
      thyroidologists preferred to use thionamide expecting potent antithyroid effect, but some&#xD;
      careful thyroidologists continued to prescribe iodide in mild type Graves' hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
      Recently, American and Europe Thyroid Association recommended methylmercaptoimidazole (MMI),&#xD;
      one of the potent thionamide drugs, as the first-choice drug for Graves' hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
      However, it became apparent that thionamide has serious side effects such as not only&#xD;
      agranulocytosis, but also severe liver injury, MPO-ANCA related vasculitis and embryopathy in&#xD;
      the pregnant women. In Japan, one patient died of thionamide-induced agranulocytosis every&#xD;
      year. The incidence of side effects including minor side effect of drug eruption is more than&#xD;
      10%. We used to treat the patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism with MMI, as we reported in J&#xD;
      Clin Endocrinol Metab 65:719, 1987. However, many side effects of thionamide prompted us to&#xD;
      revive the treatment with classical KI in our outpatient clinic and found that KI was&#xD;
      effective in the patients who showed side effects to thionamide, resulting in remission&#xD;
      (reported in J Clin Endocrinol Metab 99:3995, 2014). Therefore, we began to treat the&#xD;
      patients without serious complications such as heart failure or arrhythmia, with 100mg KI&#xD;
      since 1996 and followed for 180 days. We were surprised to find that serum thyroid hormone&#xD;
      level decreased in all the patients. Thionamide drugs were added only when euthyroidism could&#xD;
      not be achieved by KI alone. Compared with thionamide, side effect of KI was almost none.&#xD;
      Between 1996 and 2004, about 504 patients were treated with KI and a third of the patients&#xD;
      were successfully treated with KI alone and other patients were also successfully treated&#xD;
      with the combination of KI and thionamide, suggesting additive effect, or by radioactive&#xD;
      iodine therapy. The long term prognosis of the patients initially treated with KI was almost&#xD;
      the same as the patients initially treated with MMI. Our clinical experience suggested that&#xD;
      patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism are also susceptible to excess iodide, as in the cases&#xD;
      with Hashimoto thyroiditis, and this suppressive effect of excess iodide on the thyroid gland&#xD;
      is a useful information for many patients suffering from Graves' hyperthyroidism and&#xD;
      thionamide side effects.&#xD;
