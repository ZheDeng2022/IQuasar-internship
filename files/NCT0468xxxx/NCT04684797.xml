  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is one of the largest riddles in&#xD;
      cognitive neuroscience and a major challenge in mental health research. ACC dysfunction&#xD;
      contributes to a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as&#xD;
      depression, ADHD, Parkinson's disease, OCD and many others, but nobody knows what it actually&#xD;
      does. Recently a new theory has been developed about ACC function; the HRL-ACC (Hierarchical&#xD;
      Reinforcement Learning Theory of ACC). This theory proposes that the ACC selects and&#xD;
      motivates high-level tasks based on the principles of hierarchical reinforcement learning.&#xD;
      The ACC associates values with tasks, selects the correct tasks and applies control over&#xD;
      other neural networks (such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia), which&#xD;
      execute the tasks. The values of these tasks are attributed based on &quot;reward prediction error&#xD;
      signals&quot;, which are sent from the midbrain dopamine system to the ACC. These signals can be&#xD;
      recorded using scalp-EEG as an &quot;event-related brain potential&quot; (ERP), which is called the&#xD;
      &quot;reward positivity&quot;. Until this day, the exact origin of the reward positivity is not yet&#xD;
      known. Studies have delivered strong indirect evidence that the reward positivity is&#xD;
      generated in the ACC. However, there is an important lack of direct evidence to support this&#xD;
      hypothesis. The goal of this study is to provide direct evidence that the reward positivity&#xD;
      is generated in the ACC by letting a group of patients with refractory epilepsy perform the&#xD;
      virtual T-maze task (which is known to elicit reward positivity) and simultaneously recording&#xD;
      intracranial video-EEG.&#xD;

      This is a monocentric prospective interventional clinical trial that will include patients&#xD;
      with refractory epilepsy and for whom a hospitalization at the Centre for Neurophysiological&#xD;
      Monitoring (CNM) at the University Hospital Ghent is planned for invasive video-EEG&#xD;
      recording. This hospitalization is part of a pre-surgical work-up to determine if the patient&#xD;
      is eligible for resective surgery. It is important to note that the decision to plan the&#xD;
      patient for invasive video-EEG monitoring is made by neurologists and neurosurgeons&#xD;
      specialized in refractory epilepsy and is in no way connected to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient that will be admitted to the CNM for invasive video-EEG monitoring has a&#xD;
      consultation with Prof. Dr. Alfred Meurs about one month before hospitalization. During this&#xD;
      consultation, Prof. Meurs will ask if the patient is willing to participate in this study. If&#xD;
      the patient agrees and has given informed consent, the first session of the study will take&#xD;
      place directly after the consultation. However, if the patient is not available at that time,&#xD;
      a new appointment will be made for the first session. The first session has to take place&#xD;
      before admission to the CNM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two experimental sessions. The first session takes place after giving&#xD;
      informed consent and before admission to the hospital for invasive video-EEG monitoring.&#xD;
      Therefore, this session is completely study-specific and may require and extra visit to the&#xD;
      hospital if the patient is not available right after the consultation with Prof. Meurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this session, the patient will perform the virtual T-maze task for 20 minutes while&#xD;
      scalp-EEG will be recorded simultaneously. During this task, patients will see a T-maze on a&#xD;
      computer screen and have to choose at every junction whether they go left or right. Depending&#xD;
      on the direction they choose, they get rewarded or not. This feedback will elicit the reward&#xD;
      positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this first session is that it is important to know whether or not the&#xD;
      patient produces a normal reward positivity measured by scalp EEG, before the intracranial&#xD;
      electrodes are placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second session takes place during the admission at the CNM, after the intracranial&#xD;
      electrodes are placed. The invasive video-EEG monitoring is part of a pre-surgical work-up&#xD;
      and is planned independently from the study. During this session, the patient will once again&#xD;
      have to perform the virtual T-maze task while scalp-EEG and intracranial-EEG will&#xD;
      simultaneously be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the two sessions, the data will be analysed using ERP analysis and the amplitude of the&#xD;
      reward positivity will be calculated for every electrode. It is expected that the amplitude&#xD;
      of the reward positivity ERP-component will be largest for patients with electrodes in the&#xD;
      frontal lobe, located closely to the ACC. This will deliver direct evidence that the reward&#xD;
      positivity is in fact generated in the ACC.&#xD;
