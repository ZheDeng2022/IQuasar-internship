  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATN DREAM is an early phase-1, open label study to examine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and acceptability of a one-dose tenofovir (TFV) medicated douche. The&#xD;
      overall goal is to inform the design of an extended safety study of an on-demand and&#xD;
      behaviorally congruent TFV douche to confer protection from HIV acquisition in an outpatient&#xD;
      pre-RAI context&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On demand and behaviorally-congruent forms of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have long&#xD;
      been demanded by communities at great risk of HIV, especially men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM). The DREAM Program is developing a tenofovir (TFV) douche for on demand PrEP use prior&#xD;
      to receptive anal intercourse (RAI), given that the vast majority of MSM very commonly douche&#xD;
      prior to RAI (behaviorally-congruent). This ATN protocol seeks to ensure the inclusion of&#xD;
      adolescent and young adults' (age 15-24 years) perspectives as next generation biomedical&#xD;
      prevention, specifically a rectal douche, is being developed for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATN DREAM is an early phase 1, open label study to compare the safety, PK, PD, and&#xD;
      acceptability of a TFV-medicated douche. Each participant will undergo a Screening Visit to&#xD;
      evaluate eligibility. Baseline Visit will assess pre-dose safety, PK, PD, and behavioral&#xD;
      points of reference. Safety, PK, PD, and behavioral readouts are assessed at specified times&#xD;
      after the single dose. The TFV douche to be used consists of TFV 660 mg in 125 mL half-normal&#xD;
      saline (TFV 5.28 mg/mL). Study objectives including safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and acceptability of a single TFV douche, are essential to inform the&#xD;
      design of an extended safety study of a TFV douche in outpatient pre-RAI contexts. The&#xD;
      necessity of extending the testing of new HIV prevention modalities to this proposed&#xD;
      adolescent population is motivated by anticipated behavioral differences, not biological&#xD;
      ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant accrual will take approximately 9 months and each participant will be on study&#xD;
      for approximately 3 months. Total study duration is about 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>Colonic tissue cell TFV-DP concentrations (femtomoles/million cells) will be measured the study douche administration, based on the individual participant's sampling schedule, on Day 1 (at 1 hour or 6 hours post dose), Day 2 (24 hours post dose), or Day 4 (72 hours post dose).</description>

    <time_frame>Following administration of study product, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>To analyze study product sequence acceptability, the outcome will be examined in both continuous and dichotomous forms. For each sequence, descriptive statistics of overall acceptability will be generated (i.e., mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and proportion of subjects who consider the sequences acceptable -- with score 3 or greater). The acceptability of each sequence is defined as a mean score of 3 on 4-point continuous acceptability measure (1=completely unacceptable; 2=somewhat unacceptable; 3=somewhat acceptable; 4=highly acceptable) that is defined in this study as the minimal clinically meaningful threshold for sequence acceptability.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the safety of a single dose of a TFV douche when applied rectally, as measured by the number of ≥Grade 2 adverse events (AEs) as defined by the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, the number and the frequency of all adverse events (AEs) will be tabulated. Safety analyses will also tabulate the number and type of AEs observed overall, and by severity, site, and study product. AEs that lead to discontinuation of study participation will be tabulated separately.</description>

    <description>Once enrolled, participants will complete a baseline sampling session and then a single dose of study product administration. Post-dose observations and data collection will follow at 1, 6, 24, and 72 hours, using a sparse PK sampling design in which plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are collected at each designated time. Between sampling windows, YMSM will complete a web-survey examining their perceived reactions and comfort using the study douche, factors influencing product use in the future, and comfort with the trial procedures. The survey will be administered after dosing but scheduled not to interfere with other study assessments. Sampling for safety, PK, PD, and acceptability assessments will be collected according to the schedule of events. Phase I Trial participants will complete an in-depth interview as part of their Termination visit.</description>
