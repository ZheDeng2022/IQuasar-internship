  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The expanded access program allows people to gain access to an unlicensed treatment on&#xD;
      compassionate grounds. Lanadelumab, also known as TAK-743, is a medicine to help prevent&#xD;
      hereditary angioedema attacks. Lanadelumab is not yet licensed for use in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to allow Japanese teenagers and adults with type I or type II&#xD;
      hereditary angioedema to be treated with lanadelumab, through the expanded access program in&#xD;
      Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can either have taken part in the previous study SHP643-302 or can be new&#xD;
      participants. Participants just completing study SHP643-302 who reach the criteria can&#xD;
      automatically take part in this study. However, for new participants, the study doctor will&#xD;
      check who can take part at the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who can take part, new participants will receive injections of lanadelumab just&#xD;
      under the skin. Eventually, after training, some of these will be able to inject themselves&#xD;
      with lanadelumab in the same way. Participants who injected themselves with lanadelumab in&#xD;
      study SHP643-302 can continue to do so during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctors will decide if each participant will be treated with lanadelumab every 2&#xD;
      weeks or every 4 weeks. Treatment with lanadelumab will continue until lanadelumab is&#xD;
      commercially available in Japan or the sponsor (Takeda) stops the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can visit the clinic during treatment if needed. If treatment continues after 6&#xD;
      months, participants will visit the clinic every 12 weeks for a check-up. This will include&#xD;
      noting any hereditary angioedema attacks and side effects from the treatment. After 7 months&#xD;
      of treatment, the study staff will check-up with each participant every 2 weeks by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment has finished, participants will visit the clinic for a final-check-up 4 weeks&#xD;
      later.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is Japan Expanded Access Program with TAK-743. The study drug in this study is&#xD;
      called TAK-743. TAK-743 will be administered to people who have Type I or II hereditary&#xD;
      angioedema (HAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of participants will be enrolled into this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who rollover from Study SHP643-302 (NCT04180163).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are non-rollovers (ie, were not participants in Study SHP643-302).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who discontinue from Study SHP643-302 after providing informed consent are not&#xD;
      eligible to enroll in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to administer TAK-743 300 mg with subcutaneous injection every&#xD;
      2 weeks throughout this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan (approximately 15 sites). The overall time&#xD;
      to participate in this study is over 182 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the&#xD;
      clinic basically every 2 weeks until Day 182, and will be contacted by telephone every 2&#xD;
      weeks after Day 182 plus multiple visit every 12 weeks after Day 182 for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment until study completion.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In the opinion of the Investigator, the participant is capable of understanding and&#xD;
             complying with protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be of Japanese descent, defined as born in Japan and having Japanese parents and&#xD;
             Japanese maternal and paternal grandparents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male and female HAE participants who are 12 years of age or older at the time of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Type I or II) based on all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (subcutaneous [SC] or mucosal,&#xD;
                  nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompanying urticaria).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior lanadelumab&#xD;
                  study) that confirm HAE Type I or II: C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) functional level &lt;40%&#xD;
                  of the normal level. Participants with functional C1-INH level 40% to 50% of the&#xD;
                  normal level may be enrolled if they also have a C4 level below the normal range.&#xD;
                  Participants may be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history or&#xD;
                  believed by the Investigator to be confounded by long-term prophylaxis (LTP) use.&#xD;
                  It is understood that C1-INH therapy may alter the lab results of C1-INH&#xD;
                  assessments; therefore, the Investigator's discretion in collaboration with&#xD;
                  sponsor is advised for proper documentation of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema symptoms&#xD;
                  =&lt;30 years, a family history consistent with HAE Type I or II, or C1q within&#xD;
                  normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-rollover participants only: A historical baseline HAE attack rate of at least 1&#xD;
             attack per 4 weeks in the recent 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Rollover participants only: Participants from Study SHP643-302 are permitted to&#xD;
             rollover and enroll into this study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They completed the treatment period of Study SHP643-302; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They consented to enter Study TAK-743-5007 on or before Day 350 of the SHP643-302&#xD;
                  study (since Day 378 of Study SHP643-302 is also Day 0 of Study TAK-743-5007,&#xD;
                  informed consent may be completed on Day 364 or this visit, if not already&#xD;
                  provided).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adult participants and caregivers of subjects under the age of 20 are willing and able&#xD;
             to read, understand, and sign an informed consent form. Participants aged 12 to 19,&#xD;
             whose caregiver has provided informed consent, are willing and able to read,&#xD;
             understand and sign an informed consent form (an assent form, if applicable) as much&#xD;
             as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Agree to adhere to the protocol-defined schedule of treatments, assessments, and&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Males and females who are fertile and sexually active must adhere to contraception&#xD;
             requirements for the duration of the study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended&#xD;
                  to use highly effective forms of contraception from the screening period through&#xD;
                  70 days after the final study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of nonchildbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status&#xD;
                  post-hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or&#xD;
                  postmenopausal for at least 12 months do not require contraception during the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Males, including males who are surgically sterile (post-vasectomy), with female&#xD;
                  partners of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a&#xD;
                  medically acceptable form of contraception from the screening period through 70&#xD;
                  days after the final study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If rolling over from Study SHP643-302, presence of important safety concerns that&#xD;
             would preclude participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as&#xD;
             acquired angioedema, HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE Type III/normal&#xD;
             C1-INH), idiopathic angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Dosing with an investigational drug (not including lanadelumab or other HAE therapies)&#xD;
             or exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             screening or any newly initiated or dose modification of estrogen-containing&#xD;
             medications with systemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal&#xD;
             replacement therapy) 3 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unwilling to discontinue short or long-term prophylactic therapy for HAE, eg, C1-INH,&#xD;
             attenuated androgens or anti-fibrinolytics within 3 weeks after starting the treatment&#xD;
             period. Short-term prophylaxis is defined as C1-INH, attenuated androgens, or&#xD;
             antifibrinolytic used to avoid angioedema complications from medically indicated&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any of the following liver function test abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&#xD;
             &gt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 × ULN, or&#xD;
             total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of Gilbert's&#xD;
             syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have any uncontrolled underlying medical condition which would require treatment&#xD;
             adjustment during the study treatment period, that, in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             or sponsor, may confound the results of the safety assessments or may place the&#xD;
             participant at risk. Participants with stable treatment for at least 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening and NOT expecting any change to their treatment regimen for 6 months during&#xD;
             the study treatment period, will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participant has a known hypersensitivity to the study drug or its components.&#xD;
