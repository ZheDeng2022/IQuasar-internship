  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The surgical method for breast cancer is determined according to the size and location&#xD;
           of the remaining lesions after prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are many patients who were able to undergo partial resection when confirming the&#xD;
           final results of patients who underwent total resection after prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, we would like to investigate whether it is effective to make decisions based&#xD;
           on the results of pre-operative tests after prior chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a study published by Jennifer F. et al., sensitivity to lesions remaining after prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy of breast magnetic resonance imaging was measured as 83%, specificity 47%, PPV&#xD;
      47%, NPV 83%, and accuracy 74%. have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the preoperative examinations after prior chemotherapy have the most confidence in&#xD;
      the results of breast magnetic resonance imaging, but there will be other factors to predict&#xD;
      this result as there will be differences in the actual postoperative pathology results. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After prior chemotherapy, total resection was performed, and cases where partial resection is&#xD;
      possible in the postoperative pathologic results are prospectively identified and compared&#xD;
      and analyzed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast cancer patients over 20 years of age undergoing surgery at Seoul National&#xD;
             University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients to undergo total mastectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergoing total mastectomy were&#xD;
             the main subjects, but as a control group, patients who did not receive neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy but undergoing total mastectomy were included as subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In case of total mastectomy at the request of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Except for cases where total resection is performed regardless of size because it is a&#xD;
             lesion under the areola and is close to the nipple.&#xD;
