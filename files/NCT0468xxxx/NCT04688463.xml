    <textblock>
      In this retrospective observational case study, the investigators review the clinical&#xD;
      experience with pressure-pain algometry in children with suspected appendicitis. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that algometry can discriminate children with appendicitis from&#xD;
      children without appendicitis and aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of algometry,&#xD;
      compared to ultrasound imaging and clinical assessment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As a retrospective cohort study, participants include all children referred with abdominal&#xD;
      pain from January 2000 to June 2006 to one surgeon (R.P.) on the pediatric general surgery&#xD;
      service at the Health Sciences Centre (HSC)-Children's Hospital in Winnipeg. The&#xD;
      HSC-Children's Hospital is the only pediatric surgery centre within a radius of 600 km. All&#xD;
      included participants have had acute abdominal pain ≤ 7 days, and suspected appendicitis&#xD;
      based on standard history and physical exam. Standard appendicitis treatments were used:&#xD;
      analgesia, antibiotics, operation. The Research Ethics Board of the University of Manitoba&#xD;
      approved the study and reporting of the findings (H2003:104).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators use standard clinical, laboratory, diagnostic imaging procedures for&#xD;
      appendicitis diagnosis. The final diagnosis is defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pathology report indicating transmural inflammation, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from the surgeon's report when pathology was unavailable, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  by discharge diagnosis in non-operated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendix rupture is defined by the presence of pus and full-thickness perforation of the&#xD;
      appendix wall or abscess formation at operation or on pathology examination. The appendix&#xD;
      condition is classified as normal, non-perforated or perforated; all other pathologies at&#xD;
      operation are recorded. Treatments, complications and morbidity are tabulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient demographics, clinical presentation details, and results of laboratory testing&#xD;
      (WBC) are collated. From this, the components of the Alvarado and Samuel pediatric&#xD;
      appendicitis scores (PAS) are calculated retrospectively for comparison purposes and not used&#xD;
      in patient management. Time intervals are calculated from the date and time entries in the&#xD;
      clinical record. Results of diagnostic abdominal imaging (U/S, CT, plain x-rays) are based on&#xD;
      recorded verbal or, if available, official written reports at the time of patient management&#xD;
      decision. Equivocal imaging results are deemed negative. The reasons why algometry was not&#xD;
      done are tabulated and the number of patients who reached or exceeded the maximum algometer&#xD;
      readout (≥4 kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algometry Device and Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator (PI) designed and produced in 1983 a simple, lightweight,&#xD;
      aluminum-Teflon®, pocket-size, calibrated spring-gauge algometer, similar to a tire gauge,&#xD;
      that was used for all measurements. The PI used this routinely in his clinical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children were first familiarized with the algometer and allowed to hold and play with it. The&#xD;
      device head was then depressed with increasing force to the child's unencumbered mid-forearm&#xD;
      to simulate the abdominal examination and algometry procedure. Children were instructed to&#xD;
      indicate with their preferred 'signal' (e.g. 'now', 'ow!', or squeezing the examiner's&#xD;
      fingers) when the sensation of pressure changed to a sensation of discomfort or pain.&#xD;
      Pressure-pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum force (in kilograms) applied via the&#xD;
      algometer to produce discomfort. Lower PPT readings imply greater tenderness. All&#xD;
      measurements were obtained and recorded by the Principal Investigator. Algometry was a&#xD;
      standard tool used by the PI in all clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single mid-forearm 'pressure-pain threshold algometry' (PPTA) measurements are used as the&#xD;
      patient's background, 'global', non-abdominal discomfort/pain threshold. This was then&#xD;
      followed by single PPTA measurements from the centre of each four abdominal quadrants in the&#xD;
      following sequence: left lower quadrant, left upper quadrant, right upper quadrant and right&#xD;
      lower quadrant. The lower quadrant centre was defined midway between the umbilicus and&#xD;
      anterior iliac spines. The upper quadrant centre was defined midway between the umbilicus and&#xD;
      mid-costal margins. Algometer depressing velocity (rate) mimicked normal, heuristic palpation&#xD;
      velocity (i.e. approximately 1 kg./sec (0.241 kg/cm2/sec or 23.6 kilopascal/sec). From the 5&#xD;
      sites, the investigators define 7 pressure-pain threshold algometric measurements of interest&#xD;
      (forearm, left lower quadrant, left upper quadrant, right upper quadrant and right lower&#xD;
      quadrant, lowest reading, average reading).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional algometry 'mapping' is done when the most tender site apparent on qualitative&#xD;
      palpation was outside the standard four abdominal quadrants e.g. suprapubic or flank&#xD;
      tenderness. If the algometry measurements and qualitative assessment agreed, patients are&#xD;
      classified as 'concordant' versus 'discordant' when no agreement. For purposes of analysis,&#xD;
      'discordant' patients are included with the non-mapped group. The site of these maximal&#xD;
      abdominal wall tenderness measurements are then correlated with the location of the inflamed&#xD;
      appendix found at operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis is with baseline algometry readings or the final of serial readings. The&#xD;
      algometry readings of non-appendicitis appendectomy patients are grouped with&#xD;
      non-appendicitis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When available and appropriate, algometry measures are repeated during the period of&#xD;
      diagnostic observation to determine if serial PPTA 'mirrored' the patient's clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these algometry measures the following ratios are determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal tenderness localizing ratio (ATLR), calculated as the ratio of abdominal&#xD;
           tenderness between the least tender (highest PPT) and most tender (or RLQ) quadrants. A&#xD;
           higher ATLR indicates a greater degree of tenderness localization within the abdomen;&#xD;
           lower ATLR indicates more diffuse tenderness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global abdominal tenderness localizing ratio (GTLR), calculated as the ratio of the&#xD;
           forearm and most tender (or RLQ) quadrant's (lowest PPT) reading. Higher GTLR indicates&#xD;
           a greater degree of tenderness localized to the abdomen relative to the patient's global&#xD;
           discomfort/pain threshold. Patients thus serve as their own tenderness control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analysis of correlation with clinical variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient R2,&#xD;
      are calculated between the 7 PPTA's and age, weight (expressed as a percentile), and duration&#xD;
      of symptoms, stratified by gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the discriminatory power and predictive values of algometry, we randomly split the&#xD;
      data into derivation and validation groups, stratify to gender and final diagnosis of&#xD;
      appendicitis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is then performed to identify&#xD;
      the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive&#xD;
      values (PPV and NPV) of algometry. The diagnostic accuracy of algometry is compared to&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment and clinical diagnosis, again stratified to gender. GraphPad™ is used&#xD;
      for all the statistical analysis.&#xD;
