  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precision prevention holds great promise for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening but has not&#xD;
      been adequately explored. A patient's chance of having an advanced colorectal neoplasm (ACN),&#xD;
      i.e. a cancer or precancerous polyp in the colon, significantly affects the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of approved tests. Giving patients a decision aid with information about their&#xD;
      risk for ACN, and giving their providers similar information, could help patients and&#xD;
      providers decide if colonoscopy or a non-invasive test (such as the fecal immunochemical&#xD;
      test) is more appropriate. This could improve decision making and increase uptake of CRC&#xD;
      screening, which are the investigative team's long-term goals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team has developed and pilot tested a decision aid and provider message that&#xD;
      discloses the patient's current risk of ACN, based on a prediction rule developed and&#xD;
      validated by Dr. Thomas Imperiale, a member of the study team. The Imperiale Prediction Rule&#xD;
      uses five variables (gender, age, CRC family history, waist circumference, and smoking&#xD;
      history) and identifies a wide range of risk for current ACN among average risk patients. For&#xD;
      patients with &quot;high-average&quot; risk (22%), personalized messages in the decision aid and&#xD;
      provider notification highlight the advantage of colonoscopy because of the likelihood of&#xD;
      finding and removing an ACN. For patients at low risk for ACN (2% or 4%), personalized&#xD;
      messages highlight the advantage of stool testing, due to the relatively low chance of&#xD;
      failing to detect ACN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' long-term goal is to increase uptake of CRC screening by informing and&#xD;
      improving patient and provider discussion and decisions. The main objective of this project&#xD;
      is to test whether providing patients and their providers with personalized messages about&#xD;
      ACN risk results in higher screening uptake and higher decision quality, compared to an&#xD;
      approach that does not utilize ACN risk.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of patients who complete colorectal cancer screening</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' completion of colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), or other CRC screening within 6 months, based on documentation in the participants' electronic health record.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Quality assessed using the multi-dimensional measure of informed consent (MMIC) which incorporates knowledge, intent, and behavior.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Decision quality will be assessed using the multi-dimensional measure of informed consent (MMIC), where a high-quality decision is one where the individual has adequate knowledge regarding the available options and undergoes the intervention that he or she has chosen or that fits his or her values (&quot;values concordance&quot;). Patient knowledge of colorectal cancer and screening will be assessed by a 12-item test made up of 6 multiple choice questions and 6 true-false questions. Adequate knowledge = 10 correct. Concordance will be measured between the patient's test choice at the post-provider survey and the screening test underwent, if any, within 6 months after patient enrollment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Screening Intention</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' intention to be screened for CRC with any CRC screening test will be measured with 1 item: &quot;Do you plan to get any type of colon cancer test within the next 6 months?&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Screening Test Choice</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>For those patients who answer the screening intent with &quot;definitely not,&quot; &quot;probably not,&quot; or &quot;may or may not&quot;, test choice will be categorized as &quot;no screening&quot;. Those who answer Screening Intent with &quot;Probably&quot; or &quot;Definitely&quot; have Test Choice categorized based on their answer to a single item: &quot;If you have a colon test, which one would you choose?&quot; Response options are: Stool test (FIT or Cologuard), Colonoscopy, Another test, or Don't know.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Risk of Colorectal Cancer (CRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple choice questions assessing the patients' perception of how likely they are to get colon cancer in the next 5 years, in the next 10 years, and sometime during their lifetime. Each has response options: 4=very likely, 3=somewhat likely, 2=somewhat unlikely, and 1=very unlikely.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' decision conflict is assessed using the low literacy version of the Decision Conflict Scale, a ten-item instrument that assesses patients' subjective feeling regarding the decision process over five areas. Each item has three response categories (yes, no, unsure). Scores are summed; divided by 10; and multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0 [no decisional conflict] to 100 [extremely high decisional conflict].</description>
