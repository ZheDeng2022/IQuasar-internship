  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited agents are optional after standard first and second line treatment for mCRC. Only&#xD;
      Regorafenib and Fruquintinib are approved in China. PFS of these targeted drugs are not very&#xD;
      long. Pemetrexed has shown significant efficacy in advanced lung cancer regarding PFS and OS&#xD;
      with controllable toxicity. TAS-102 has been used in colorectal cancer with promising&#xD;
      outcomes. Bevacizumab is also an important monoclonal antibody which could make benefits in&#xD;
      treated patients. This study is aimed to explore the efficacy, safety in advanced colorectal&#xD;
      cancer failed to standard therapy in Chinese population.&#xD;
