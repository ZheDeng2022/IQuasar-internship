  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal behavior among adolescents is a major public health problem. Exacerbation of&#xD;
      suicidal risk most often occurs when the young person is in his or her natural environment,&#xD;
      far from the health care system. Therefore, real-time risk detection would make it possible&#xD;
      to deploy immediate action interventions. A smartphone application for personalized&#xD;
      assessment and intervention would enable patients to better anticipate and manage suicidal&#xD;
      crises and stay connected to the healthcare system. The increasing use of smartphones and&#xD;
      mobile applications among adolescents supports the feasibility and value of such follow-up&#xD;
      among young people. In a first phase of this project, investigators first undertook to&#xD;
      develop bae: a smartphone application adapted to a population of adolescents collecting&#xD;
      information on their suicidal behaviour in a contextualized manner, with the added benefit of&#xD;
      offering emotion management modules as well as personalized psychoeducational messages and&#xD;
      alerts delivered to young people in the event of a crisis. The application is intended to be&#xD;
      a complementary tool to the usual treatment. Before testing its effectiveness and due to the&#xD;
      novelty of the intervention, a rigorous feasibility study in a real clinical context is&#xD;
      necessary to ensure acceptability and satisfaction with the use of the bae application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate, over a 6-month period, the acceptability of a follow-up of a&#xD;
      population of 100 adolescents (12-17 years) at risk of suicidal driving via the bae&#xD;
      smartphone application.&#xD;

      100 patients having recently attempted suicide or having suicidal ideation will be recruited.&#xD;
      They will be asked to use the application bae during 6 months and will be followed up during&#xD;
      this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial visit (inclusion) : clinical assessment and installation of the application bae.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be assisted by a research team member to install and configure the application bae on their smartphone; then, they will be trained to use it.&#xD;
Bae proposes 4 types of assessments :&#xD;
5 times a day during 3 days, every month (5 minutes) : patients can assess their emotions, their thoughts, their behavior and their occurrence context.&#xD;
Weekly (7 minutes) : consists of a summary of the week, about their emotions, thoughts, behavior, their relationships (family, work, friends), and their quality of life.&#xD;
Monthly (5 minutes): assessment of the usefulness and satisfaction about the application.&#xD;
Assessment available at any time An action plan is designed to support the participants, to help them facing difficult emotions and feelings, and to encourage them to ask for help.&#xD;
They can contact a relative or call the psychiatric emergency service directly by clicking on a button.&#xD;
Patients can try to identify their own warning signs, to prevent suicidal behavior.</description>
