  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with short cervical length (&lt;25 mm) in second-trimester ultrasonographic&#xD;
      assessment are at high risk for preterm birth, a major cause of perinatal mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity worldwide. Some of these short-cervix women proceed to a more advanced stage&#xD;
      manifested as a painless prematurely dilated cervix in the second trimester. It is not fully&#xD;
      understood why some women have short cervical length or prematurely dilated cervix (cervical&#xD;
      insufficiency), although evidence is mounting that there is an association between short&#xD;
      cervical length and infection by microorganisms. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      cervical microorganisms in pregnant women with a shortened or dilated cervix are different,&#xD;
      compared with those in women with normal cervical length and a closed cervix.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, culture-dependent methods were used to detect bacterial or fungal infection, but&#xD;
      the sensitivity was low, since not all species grew well in culture. Recently, molecular&#xD;
      methods based on PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene or the&#xD;
      fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) followed by capillary sequencing has been used to&#xD;
      identify bacteria and fungi. However, the resolution of such capillary sequencing-based&#xD;
      method (&lt;100 sequencing reads/sample) is too low to capture the major collection of&#xD;
      microorganisms in a sample. Less abundant but possibly pathogenic microorganisms associated&#xD;
      with short cervical length remain undetectable. To address the current gap in this field, we&#xD;
      propose to more comprehensively survey microbial communities in the cervix of pregnant women&#xD;
      by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA region, ITS or other genomic regions with taxonomic&#xD;
      classification potential. This will be followed by next-generation sequencing (&gt;40,000&#xD;
      sequencing reads/sample), which has been proven to capture the majority of microorganisms in&#xD;
      a sample.&#xD;

However, cervical samples collected from both groups are subjected to amplicon sequencing for taxonomic classification of microorganisms.</description>
