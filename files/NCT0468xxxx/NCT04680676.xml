  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with active psoriatic arthritis who have tender and swollen&#xD;
      joints. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called BI 730357 helps to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms and to prevent damage to joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different doses of BI 730357 are tested. Participants are put into 4 groups by chance.&#xD;
      Participants in 3 of the 4 groups take BI 730357. Participants in the fourth group take&#xD;
      placebo. Participants take BI 730357 or placebo as tablets once a day. Placebo tablets look&#xD;
      like BI 730357 tablets but do not contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 4.5 months. During this time, they visit the study&#xD;
      site about 8 times. At these visits, doctors check whether the swelling of inflamed joints&#xD;
      has changed. The results between the BI 730357 and placebo groups are then compared. Doctors&#xD;
      also regularly check the general health of the participants.&#xD;
