    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects, of the research study drug Telomelysin&#xD;
      (OBP-301) in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with inoperable, recurrent, or&#xD;
      progressive squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Telomelysin is an investigational&#xD;
      treatment, while pembrolizumab and SBRT are approved standard treatments. The combination of&#xD;
      these three treatments is also considered investigational.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open label single arm study of OBP-301 in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and SBRT in advanced HNSCC which is either recurrent and inoperable, or progressing after&#xD;
      prior radiation with curative-intent for advanced disease (adjuvant or definitive with or&#xD;
      without chemotherapy or cetuximab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy is modest in second or third line of treatment of&#xD;
      advanced head and neck cancer (~response rate 16-22%). SBRT reirradiation in patients that&#xD;
      received prior surgery and chemoradiation for advanced disease is associated with a response&#xD;
      rate (RR) of approximately 60% and approximately 50% 1-year survival. Recently, the results&#xD;
      of the Keynote-048 study were published. The projected 1-year survival in the immunotherapy&#xD;
      arms with pembrolizumab alone or pembrolizumab and chemotherapy was approximately 57%. So, at&#xD;
      present, the benchmark RR for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with&#xD;
      inoperable, recurrent or progressive disease treated with SBRT is approximately 60% and the 1&#xD;
      year survival for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with&#xD;
      inoperable, recurrent or progressive disease using the most effective contemporary treatments&#xD;
      including immunotherapy is approximately 50-57%. Trying to improve the results of the current&#xD;
      standard of care, this study will examine the effects of oncolytic virus, OBP-301,&#xD;
      administered in addition to pembrolizumab and SBRT in this patient population. The goal of&#xD;
      using this triple therapeutic combination is to enhance the chances of cure of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 patients will be enrolled into a two-stage parallel cohort design: In the first&#xD;
      stage, 12 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive intratumoral injection(s) with OBP-301. If tolerated and no&#xD;
      progression is observed, up to twelve injections may be given in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the targeted injected lesion(s) disappear, another lesion can be injected at the&#xD;
      Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum additional 3 doses of concurrent OBP-301 and pembrolizumab will be given if no&#xD;
      toxicity, technical impediment to injection or progression is seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum total of up to 9 doses of concurrent OBP-301 and pembrolizumab will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab alone will be continued after day 183 for a total treatment time up to 1 year.&#xD;

             receive SBRT. For example, patients with locoregional neck recurrence without&#xD;
             significant overlap with the previous radiation field, and who do not warrant SBRT for&#xD;
             re-irradiation as per the treating radiation oncologist (e.g. out-of-field&#xD;
