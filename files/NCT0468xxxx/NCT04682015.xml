    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive educational messages related to hypertension, such as impact of hypertension on cardiovascular system, lifestyle adjustment and side effects of antihypertensive drugs. Participants will be reminded to take their blood pressure regularly and enter the blood pressure readings into the WeChat platform. If participants enter extremely high or low readings, they will be asked to seek medical help from doctors. Participants can also consult doctors online via WeChat platform by text and voice messages, or voice calls.</description>
