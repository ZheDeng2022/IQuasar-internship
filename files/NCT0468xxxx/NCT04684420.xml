      The purpose of this study is to assess bioequivalence (BE) of newly developed Glucophage® XR&#xD;
      (GXR) reduced mass (RM) tablet (metformin hydrochloride 500 milligrams (mg) test tablet) and&#xD;
      marketed Glucophage ® XR tablet (metformin hydrochloride 500 mg reference tablet) following&#xD;
      single oral dose administration under fasted and fed conditions by comparing&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability between test and reference in healthy participants.&#xD;
