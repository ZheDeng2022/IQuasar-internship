  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation, phase I study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), preliminary efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of CAL056&#xD;
      mesylate in cancer patients with resistant or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with resistant or refractory malignant solid tumors and no standard treatment&#xD;
      available will be screened for the eligibility. Patients will be screened within 28 days&#xD;
      prior to the first dose of CAL056 mesylate. Eligible patients will receive CAL056 mesylate&#xD;
      daily with the assigned dose level for 28 days (Day 1 to Day 28) for each treatment cycle.&#xD;
      Patients will be administered with CAL056 mesylate at clinical site at scheduled visits (i.e.&#xD;
      Day 1/Visit 1, Day 8/Visit 2, Day 15/ Visit 3, Day 22/Visit 4, Day 28/Visit 5). Remaining&#xD;
      doses of CAL056 mesylate on all other days will be self-administered by patients at home.&#xD;
      After the administration of CAL056 mesylate on Day 1 and Day 28, patients can stay at the&#xD;
      clinical site for 24 hours to have safety monitoring and blood samples collected for PK&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients completing Cycle 1 without a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or disease&#xD;
      progression will be allowed to continue the subsequent cycles at the same dose level. The&#xD;
      maximum number of dosing cycle is 6 cycles in each patient in this study. Continuation of&#xD;
      using CAL056 mesylate may be permitted after the evaluation of the risk/benefit in individual&#xD;
      patient by the Investigators and with the approval of Calgent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Cycle 1 of study period, a total of 5 visits are scheduled to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      PK, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of CAL056 mesylate. Each visit is planned on&#xD;
      Day 1 of each subsequent cycle if patients continue the treatment of CAL056 mesylate. After&#xD;
      the end treatment of CAL056 mesylate, an end of treatment (EOT) visit and a safety follow-up&#xD;
      visit will be scheduled.&#xD;
