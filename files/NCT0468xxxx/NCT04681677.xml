  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the overall survival of patients treated with the Xoft&#xD;
      Axxent eBx System and post-radiation adjuvant Bevacizumab for single-fraction IORT following&#xD;
      maximal neurosurgical resection of recurrent glioblastoma. A historical comparison will be&#xD;
      made to the results of the EBRT + Bevacizumab arm of RTOG 1205.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for IORT, as the sole radiation therapy following surgical resection of&#xD;
      recurrent GBM is to expand upon the favorable preliminary results in feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy outcomes obtained at the European Medical Center Study Group (EMC Study Group). The&#xD;
      rationale to add Bevacizumab as a systemic treatment is to target radio-resistant and highly&#xD;
      tumorigenic cancer stem cells as well as to benefit from its radioprotective effects, i.e.&#xD;
      reducing risk of radiation necrosis. Lastly, using Bevacizumab as a systemic therapy will&#xD;
      enable the comparison of the results to the historic control arm, the EBRT arm of RTOG 1205.&#xD;
