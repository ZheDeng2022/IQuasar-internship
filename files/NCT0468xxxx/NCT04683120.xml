    <textblock>
      Our investigational team has developed a technology to visualize the operative margins in&#xD;
      'real time,' in other words during the operation while the patient is still on the table.&#xD;
      While different surgeons use different operative techniques, our technique involves removing&#xD;
      the main lumpectomy specimen, marking two of its borders with suture to orient the specimen&#xD;
      for correct pathologic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FLIM (Fluorescent Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) technique can differentiate between&#xD;
      cancerous and noncancerous specimens using a complex algorithm that essentially utilizes a&#xD;
      definitive delta between the metabolic activities of diseased and non-diseased tissue. The&#xD;
      research coordinator along with the surgeon will be able to insert the lumpectomy specimen&#xD;
      followed by the 6 shaved margins (one by one) in a matter of minutes once the specimens have&#xD;
      been resected. To be clear, the FLIM analysis will be taking place in- vitro. The device is&#xD;
      invitro test and would be tested against the gold standard the pathologist biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FLIM analysis by the surgeon will not take more than several minutes, therefore not adding&#xD;
      any significant time for patient to be under anesthesia. All specimens will be removed from&#xD;
      the patient's body prior to their evaluation by the FLIM technique. Our team will not be&#xD;
      making decisions based on FLIM analysis during this early phase of study. In other words,&#xD;
      even if FLIM suggests a positive margin still exists in the body, our team will not act on&#xD;
      these results by resecting additional tissue at this stage. FLIM margin results will be&#xD;
      compared directly with pathology results for accuracy of the findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational Zenith FLIM&#xD;
      Diagnostics imaging device that's modality is a direct support during lumpectomy cancer&#xD;
      surgery to achieve the common goal of improving patient quality of life by decreasing rates&#xD;
      of re-operation. The team is fully dedicated to bringing the Gold Standard in the operating&#xD;
      room, enabling margin assessment, in real time, at the histological detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our operative technique involves removing the main lumpectomy specimen, marking two of its&#xD;
      borders with suture to orient the specimen for correct pathologic evaluation. Next, we take 6&#xD;
      shave margins in all directions around the lumpectomy cavity (superior, inferior, medial,&#xD;
      lateral, posterior, anterior) and anchor an orientation stitch at the far side of the margin,&#xD;
      again, for pathologist to understand which side was farthest away from the lumpectomy&#xD;
      specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator along with the surgeon will be able to insert the lumpectomy&#xD;
      specimen into the Zenith FLIM device followed by the 6 shaved margins (one by one) in a&#xD;
      matter of minutes once the specimens have been resected. To be clear, the Zenith FLIM&#xD;
      analysis will be taking place in-vitro. The machine will be placed a good distance from the&#xD;
      patient, in an ante-room, and does not require sterility. Of course, if the surgeon breaks&#xD;
      sterility while handing off the specimens for FLIM analysis, he or she will have to&#xD;
      re-sterilize as would be standard if sterile conditions are broken for any other reasons&#xD;
      (having to re-scrub because sterility is broken is a common procedure). Once the specimens&#xD;
      are placed in the Zenith FLIM, the specimens will no longer be sterile, but there is no need&#xD;
      to maintain sterility of the specimens once they are in-vitro. In fact, even in the absence&#xD;
      of Zenith FLIM analysis, once the specimens are placed in cups for pathologic evaluation,&#xD;
      they are no longer sterile. In other words, loss of sterility of the specimen is a necessity&#xD;
      of the operation regardless of Zenith FLIM analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is an in-vitro test and would be tested against the gold standard: the pathologic&#xD;
      evaluation of resected tissue. The test results would not be used for any diagnosis. Neither&#xD;
      the test nor the unit comes in contact with patients under any circumstance. The Zenith FLIM&#xD;
      margin results will be compared directly with pathology. The effectiveness of the Zenith FLIM&#xD;
      Diagnostics margin results will be compared directly with pathology and evaluated in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
