  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, multi-site, Phase I/IIa dose escalation, safety, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) trial of BNT141 followed by expansion cohorts in patients with&#xD;
      CLDN18.2-positive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design consists of three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1A is a dose escalation of BNT141 as monotherapy in patients with unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2)-positive gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)&#xD;
      and esophageal cancer of the adenocarcinoma subtype, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      biliary tract cancers, and mucinous ovarian cancer, for which there is no available standard&#xD;
      therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, or the patient is not a candidate for such&#xD;
      available therapy. The dose of BNT141 will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BNT141 as monotherapy are defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1B and Part 2 with adaptive design elements will be added at a later stage.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Stable brain or leptomeningeal disease on the computer tomography (CT) or magnet&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan within 4 weeks before signing the informed consent form&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Not undergoing acute corticosteroid therapy or steroid taper.&#xD;
