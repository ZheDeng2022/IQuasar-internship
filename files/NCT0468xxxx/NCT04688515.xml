  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, childhood malnutrition remains a public health concern. Malnutrition can be diverse&#xD;
      from undernutrition to overnutrition. A young child, primarily refers to those under the age&#xD;
      of 5, is suffering from undernutrition when the child is lacking of adequate nutrition that&#xD;
      necessary for proper growth and health due to direct or indirect causes such as not having&#xD;
      enough food. In fully urbanized area such as Kuala Lumpur, urban poor children tend to face&#xD;
      greater deprivations such as lower education and poor health which significantly influence&#xD;
      their daily diet and nutritional status. Hence, urban poor children who are living and&#xD;
      growing up in such underprivileged environment should not be neglected. Since young children&#xD;
      are generally depending on maternal feeding for daily diet, intervention that focus on&#xD;
      encouraging positive change in maternal feeding practices might be efficient in reducing&#xD;
      childhood undernutrition. The positive deviance (PD) approach may consider as a better&#xD;
      alternative to empower mothers by promoting new behaviour to feed their children. Hence, this&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition program using PD approach in reducing&#xD;
      undernutrition among urban poor children aged 3 to 5 years old in Kuala Lumpur.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undernourished children who fail to grow in height and weight as other normal children can be&#xD;
      underweight, stunting or wasting. In fully urbanized area such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia,&#xD;
      the consequences of undernutrition are more detrimental in urban poor young children. Since&#xD;
      young children are generally depending on maternal feeding for daily diet, alternative&#xD;
      intervention that focus on encouraging positive change in maternal behaviour when feeding&#xD;
      children might be efficient in reducing childhood undernutrition. The positive deviance (PD)&#xD;
      approach is one such alternative intervention. This approach emphases the identification of&#xD;
      positive deviant, individuals who successfully discover a way to solve a problem by&#xD;
      performing some uncommon but advantageous actions or behaviours in the same underprivileged&#xD;
      environment as their peers. In the context of child nutrition, positive deviance is more&#xD;
      frequently referred to as adaptive child care practices, positive hygiene practices and&#xD;
      feeding practices that enable children to develop appropriately in a harsh environment with&#xD;
      limited resources. The nutrition program developed using this approach helps to discover&#xD;
      positive deviant, spread local wisdom from mothers of well-nourished children to mothers of&#xD;
      undernourished children, and initiate positive behavioural change as a preliminary step to&#xD;
      promote healthy weight gain in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mixed method study which will be carried out in two phases. Phase I of the study&#xD;
      will involve focus group discussion (FGD) with semi-structured interview to explore maternal&#xD;
      feeding practices and also foods being fed to children. Mothers of children aged 3 to 5 years&#xD;
      old will be recruited through purposive sampling or until saturation point is reached. Phase&#xD;
      II of the study will involve a two-armed randomized controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness of nutrition program. A total of 164 mother-child dyads will be recruited, in&#xD;
      which 82 of them will be recruited separately and randomly from different PPR flats with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation to form intervention and comparison groups. Ethical approval will be obtained from&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects Universiti Putra Malaysia&#xD;
      (JKEUPM). Permission to conduct this study in PPR flats and the list of PPR flats in KL will&#xD;
      be obtained from the Kuala Lumpur City Hall. Intervention group will need to participate in a&#xD;
      nutrition program for 3 months that consists of education session with peer-led cooking&#xD;
      session and rehabilitation session. The comparison group will be given all the materials used&#xD;
      in the program for reference after the last data collection. The height and weight of&#xD;
      children will be measured by researcher. Mothers will be interviewed on the dietary intake of&#xD;
      their children. Mothers will also need to answer a Malay language self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics, nutrition knowledge&#xD;
      and food security status. These measurements will be taken at the baseline (before&#xD;
      intervention), immediate post-intervention and 3-month post-intervention for both&#xD;
      intervention and comparison groups.&#xD;

    <description>It is a 3-month nutrition program including nutrition education session and rehabilitation session. The education session consists of half hour education lesson and one and half hours peer-led cooking session. The cooking demonstration will be led by volunteers from PD family. Participating mothers will need to bring along their children during this session, prepare meal according to pre-planned menu and feed their children with the prepared meal after cooking as snack or additional meal. The rehabilitation session will be the rest of the days following each education session until the next education session. Growth monitoring session will also be conducted in each session, whereby mothers will be taught and trained to weigh their children.</description>
