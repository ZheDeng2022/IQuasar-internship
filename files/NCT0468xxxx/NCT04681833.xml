  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advaccine Clinical Research are developing a vaccine called BARS13 for the active&#xD;
      immunisation of infants (aged 6 months to 5 years old) and the elderly (aged 60-80 years old)&#xD;
      for the seasonal prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. A total of 120&#xD;
      volunteers aged 60 - 80 years (inclusive) will be enrolled in this study, and will be divided&#xD;
      into 3 groups (or 'cohorts') of 40 people per cohort. The aim of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of BARS13 in this age group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advaccine Clinical Research is developing a recombinant Respiratory Syncytial Virus (rRSV)&#xD;
      vaccine - BARS13 for the protection of children (6 months to 5 years old) and the elderly&#xD;
      from RSV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults&#xD;
      aged 60-80 years old to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rRSV investigational&#xD;
      vaccine, BARS13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two centres in Australia with CMAX as the coordinating site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinations for all participants will occur before local Australian RSV peak season&#xD;
      (winter/early spring). A total of up to 120 eligible participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      administered by IM injection to the deltoid region of the arm. Cohort 1 (low repeat dose)&#xD;
      includes one dose of 10micrograms of the vaccine on one arm and one dose of placebo on the&#xD;
      other arm given sequentially on Day 1 and 29. Cohort 2 (high repeat dose) includes one dose&#xD;
      of 10micrograms of the vaccine on each arm given sequentially on Day 1 and 29. Cohort 3 (high&#xD;
      repeat multiple dose) includes one dose of 10microgarms of vaccine to each arm sequentially&#xD;
      on Day 1, 29 and 57.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study is double-blinded. Sealed participant-specific code break envelopes will be produced by the unblinded statistician so that the treatment assigned to each participant can be obtained if required, in an emergency only, where knowledge of the randomisation code is required to provide appropriate treatment. The code break envelopes will be retained at the clinical unit in a secure, accessible location. Those blinded to study drug assignment include the sponsor, the PI, clinical study personnel participating in participants' care or clinical evaluations, and the study participants.</masking_description>
