  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's goal is to improve the patient's compliance and accurate capture of&#xD;
      patient reported gas and bloating symptoms, by utilizing a phone application that&#xD;
      interactively records each gas and bloating event in addition to bowel events and other bowel&#xD;
      symptoms. Such an electronic stool diary may relieve the burden of using a paper daily stool&#xD;
      diary. The investigator will compare and validate the electronic gas and bloating diary with&#xD;
      the paper gas and bloating diary.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gas-related symptoms (GRS) such as abdominal bloating, flatulence, and belching are some of&#xD;
      the most common gastrointestinal complaints posed by the general population. These are&#xD;
      hallmark symptoms in patients with functional gut disorders like irritable bowel syndrome but&#xD;
      have also been linked to conditions such as gut hypersensitivity, altered gut microbiota and&#xD;
      altered gut motility. The main issue with grasping the full impact of these symptoms on a&#xD;
      patients' quality of life is that they are largely subjective and thus almost impossible to&#xD;
      standardize. However, given their pervasiveness there is merit attempting to gauge their&#xD;
      severity in as objective a manner as possible in order to track disease progress and response&#xD;
      to treatment. GRS can be widely irregular and requiring patients to call into the office to&#xD;
      answer questionnaires post treatment or keep handwritten logs to turn in later can lead to&#xD;
      inaccurate data collection that can hinder accurate diagnosis and management. The ubiquitous&#xD;
      nature of smartphones and user-friendly interfaces of electronic applications allow for&#xD;
      information to be logged/accessed remotely and securely, each log would have their own time&#xD;
      stamp and be recorded in an organized, consistent manner.&#xD;
