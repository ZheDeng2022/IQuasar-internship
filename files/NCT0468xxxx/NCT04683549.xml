  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to describe changes in plasma HPV DNA levels in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced cervical cancer during radical radiochemotherapy (CRT) and to correlate&#xD;
      changes with response to treatment. Monitoring of the response to treatment will also be&#xD;
      assessed in FDG PET CT imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety-five per cent of cervical cancer cases are caused by persistent infections with&#xD;
      carcinogenic HPVs. Locally advanced stage IB2 to IVA cervical cancers are treated with&#xD;
      definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Despite known clinical prognostic factors of poor&#xD;
      treatment outcome such as advanced stage and positive nodal status, we still don't know&#xD;
      predictors of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV status will be assessed in the neoplastic tissue and DNA from the blood serum of patients&#xD;
      with cervical cancer will be isolated and analyzed by real-time PCR. Plasma HPV DNA would&#xD;
      identify patients with residual disease after CRT due to persistent detectable HPV. This&#xD;
      would earlier detect high risk patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While metabolic response in post - therapy FDG PET CT is predictive of survival, there is&#xD;
      usually 3 months waiting period time needed to perform this imaging. This pilot study will&#xD;
      provide preliminary estimates of the correlation between plasma HPV DNA level, PET finding&#xD;
      and clinical outcome in polish cervical cancer patients.&#xD;
