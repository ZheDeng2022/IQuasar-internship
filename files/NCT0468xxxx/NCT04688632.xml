      dose, parallel group study will be conducted in healthy male and female subjects. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Group 1a (n=18) will be administered moxifloxacin placebo on Day 1, ampreloxetine&#xD;
      placebo from Day 1 to Day 15, and moxifloxacin &lt;Dose A&gt; on Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Group 1b (n=18) will be administered a single oral dose of moxifloxacin &lt;Dose A&gt;&#xD;
      on Day 1, ampreloxetine placebo from Day 1 to Day 15 and moxifloxacin placebo on Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Group 2 (n=36) will be administered moxifloxacin placebo on Day 1 and on Day 15,&#xD;
      and ampreloxetine &lt;Dose A&gt; from Day 1 to Day 7, ampreloxetine &lt;Dose B&gt; from Day 8 to Day 14,&#xD;
