  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and control of hypertension depend on accurate measurements of blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP); alternative approaches to measuring BP, such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or&#xD;
      home blood-pressure self-measurement (HBPM), are gaining increasing acceptance in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of hypertension and the monitoring of hypertensive patients.To achieve accurate BP&#xD;
      measurements at home, measurement guidelines must be closely followed. However, previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that patient compliance is in most cases unsatisfactory.The study aims at&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of a family nurse (FN)-led home blood pressure management (HBPM)&#xD;
      training program in improving BP control based on a comparison with routine care and&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of HBPM was found to be higher in patients who received some form of training in&#xD;
      BP measurement from healthcare professionals than in patients who did not receive training.&#xD;
      Although self-estimation of BP may be prone to error, this risk can be minimized through&#xD;
      adequate patient education and training that includes simple but nonetheless important&#xD;
      recommendations. However, unclear is whether specific training offered by nurses, who&#xD;
      frequently have a close relationship with their hypertensive patients, could result higher&#xD;
      patient adherence to HBPM recommendations. Therefore, we assume that a specifically tailored&#xD;
      training program conducted by a family nurse (FN), when provided in addition to usual care,&#xD;
      could improve patient adherence to HBPM recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>In addition to usual care: a 1-h educational and training program conducted by the family nurse (FN) in a dedicated room of the ambulatory care centers. During the program, the nurse instructed patients on how to self-measure blood pressure (BP) using the BP self-measurement device and on the importance of adequate device maintenance. The intervention was carried out by the FN on a daily basis during outpatient visits of the participants to the general practitioner (GP).</description>

    <description>The training program was performed in accordance with current guidelines and consisted of a 1-h educational session led by one family nurse (FN) tasked with instruction of the patients. During the training program the FN emphasized that since morning and evening blood pressure (BP) values can widely differ, especially in patients taking medications, BP should be measured twice a day, in the morning and at evening, at specific fixed times (between 6:00 am and 9:00 am and between 6:00 pm and 9:00 pm) at least during the first week of monitoring. Thereafter, measurements can be taken before antihypertensive drugs are taken.</description>
