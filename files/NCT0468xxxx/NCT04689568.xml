  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are doing this study to learn more about which online self-help resources,&#xD;
      including a smartphone app, an online program, or an informational website, primary care&#xD;
      patients with depression are likely to choose and whether the chosen tool will improve their&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and wellbeing. The researchers would also like to know how likely someone&#xD;
      is to use the resources and their satisfaction with the resources.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be using a self-help resource for the 6-week study period. A Care Manager&#xD;
      will contact participants by phone, once a week, for about 5-10 minutes at a pre-arranged&#xD;
      time. Participation will be needed for 10 weeks in total (6 weeks of active participation and&#xD;
      a survey 1-month after the study intervention ends).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subscription-based self-help resources being tested during the study will not be freely&#xD;
      available after the study period. However, the researchers will share information on how to&#xD;
      access these resources for a fee after the study period to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the time above, the researchers will collect information from participant's&#xD;
      medical records for another 10 months after participation. The entire study is expected to&#xD;
      last about 2 years.&#xD;

Additional areas of advice and goal setting are contained in a section called Thrive Tips.</description>
