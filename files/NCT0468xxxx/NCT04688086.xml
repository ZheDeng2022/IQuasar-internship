      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical performance of AI-based Thermalytix&#xD;
      with the current standard-of-care diagnostic modalities in women.&#xD;

      While mammography is the most accepted breast cancer screening test, it is less sensitive in&#xD;
      women with dense breast tissue, who have a four fold high risk for developing breast cancer.&#xD;
      Thermalytix is a novel automated breast cancer screening solution that uses artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (AI) over thermal images to detect and localise breast cancer lesions in women.&#xD;
      In this study the performance of Thermalytix over mammography is evaluated in women with&#xD;
      dense and non-dense breast tissue who presented for a health check-up at a hospital. All&#xD;
      women underwent Thermalytix and mammography, and participants who were reported as positive&#xD;
      on either test were recommended for further investigations. Sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated across age-groups,&#xD;
      menopausal status, and breast densities against the current standard-of-care diagnostic&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;

    <description>Women who came in for a breast mammography between ages 30 and 80 years were invited to take part in the study. All the women included in the study underwent breast cancer screening first by Thermalytix, the AI-based thermal imaging test, followed by mammography.</description>

    <description>Thermalytix is an Artificial intelligence based automated breast screening solution that analyzes thermal distribution on the breast to generate a breast health score automatically. Thermal imaging was performed by a trained technician to capture thermal images of the participant in five views. These thermal images were uploaded to Thermalytix software on the cloud where it was automatically analyzed by AI-based Thermalytix computer-aided detection (CADe) engine. This CADe engine analyzes uploaded thermal images and outputs an interpretation report for each participant with quantitative scores corresponding to computed probability of malignancy based on the structural, vascular, areolar, thermal properties of the observed abnormality. Thermalytix also generates annotated images with markings of abnormal regions and an overall Thermalytix score suggesting likelihood of breast malignancy. The locked AI model Thermalytix algorithm version 3, dated December 2018 was used for the analysis.</description>
