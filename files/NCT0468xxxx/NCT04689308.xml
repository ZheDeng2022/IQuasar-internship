      Malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1 study of MH048 in patients with selected&#xD;
      Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes 2 parts: Part A is the dose escalation part of the study, and Part B is&#xD;
      the dose expansion part of the study. In Part A, patients were enrolled using accelerated&#xD;
      titration design for the first three single patient cohorts and 3+3 dose escalation design&#xD;
      for the rest cohorts. The starting dose of MH048 in soft gel capsule form was 5 mg/day QD.&#xD;
      Cycle length will be 28 days. In Part B, the dose and lymphoma subtypes for expansion phase&#xD;
      will depend on the results from Part A.&#xD;
