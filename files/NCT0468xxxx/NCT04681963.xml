    <textblock>
      There is no gold standard when diagnosing of pneumonia. The variability of clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms make it difficult to distinguish pneumonia from other causes of respiratory&#xD;
      conditions. Well defined characteristics upon arrival to the emergency department will&#xD;
      contribute to the better and quicker diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, pneumonia diagnosis is primarily based on clinical symptoms such as cough,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, chest pain, fever and sputum production, combined with X-ray of the&#xD;
      lungs, relevant blood tests and microbiological analysis of sputum samples. The X-ray is an&#xD;
      imprecise diagnostic tool, and results from sputum assays are first available after 2 days.&#xD;
      In the elderly, pneumonia presents with clinically differing signs such as delirium,&#xD;
      malnutrition, and there may be an absence of fever, cough and dyspnea. The physical&#xD;
      examination is also challenged by a broad variety of atypical symptoms like headache, dry&#xD;
      cough and gastrointestinal symptoms in the form of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that well-defined clinical characteristics upon arrival to the emergency&#xD;
      department will contribute to the better and quicker diagnosis of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to identify the information available upon arrival to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      that contributes to diagnosis and prognosis of community-acquired-pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify the information available upon arrival that correlates to the diagnosis of&#xD;
           community-acquired pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the information available upon arrival that correlates to severity of&#xD;
           community-acquired pneumonia&#xD;

    <measure>Diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>expert assessment within 3 months after patient discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia determined by an expert panel. This outcome measure is a binary variable - verified pneumonia or no pneumonia.&#xD;
The expert panel consists of two independent consultants from the emergency department with experience in infection and emergency medicine, who individually will determine whether or not the patient admitted with suspected community-acquired pneumonia had the diagnosis. The diagnosis will be based on all available relevant information from the patient medical record within 48 hours from admission including computed tomography. A standardized template will be used. Disagreement will be discussed until a consensus is reached.</description>
