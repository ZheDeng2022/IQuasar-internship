  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label trial, designed to explore the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) combined with second-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) , TTFields is an portable, battery&#xD;
      operated device for chronic treatment of patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) using alternating electric fields&#xD;

      PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the electric fields generated by the TTFields has been tested in two Ⅲ phase&#xD;
      trials in humans(EF-11&amp;EF-14). The data from these trials suggest TTFields may improve time&#xD;
      to disease progression and overall survival of recurrent GBM patients. EF-11 is a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial, designed to test the efficacy and safety of a new medical device.Although&#xD;
      the number of patients in the trials is small, FDA has approved TTFields as a therapy for&#xD;
      patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with GBM whose disease has recurred or progressed despite standard treatment&#xD;
      (Surgery, radiation therapy, Temozolomide treatment) and meet all of the requirements for&#xD;
      participation in the study will be included.Before receiving TTFields treatment, the patient&#xD;
      can receive surgery again, and TTFields+BPC chemotherapy can be used after surgery;&#xD;
      TTFields+BPC chemotherapy can also be used directly without surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, TTFields treatment is a cycle (treatment course) every four weeks, and&#xD;
      patients are required to complete at least one cycle of treatment. Recommended average daily&#xD;
      wearing time ≥18 hours, patients will need to return once every month the hospital outpatient&#xD;
      clinics where they will be examined by a physician and undergo routine laboratory&#xD;
      examinations. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not&#xD;
      progressing. After progression, if such occurs, patients will need to return once per month&#xD;
      for two more months to the outpatient clinic for similar follow up examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically. A&#xD;
      routine MRI of the head will be performed at baseline and after 2, 4 and 6 months. After this&#xD;
      follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic&#xD;
      questions about their health status. If the disease progresses, imaging tumor assessment or&#xD;
      survival follow-up will be performed every 2 months thereafter, until 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will use the RANO evaluation criteria for tumor imaging assessment, and&#xD;
      classify the objective tumor response as follows: The objective tumor response status based&#xD;
      on the evaluation of the target lesion can be: complete response (CR), partial response (PR),&#xD;
      stable disease ( SD), disease progression (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on&#xD;
      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of&#xD;
      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic&#xD;
      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.&#xD;
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their&#xD;
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200&#xD;
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects&#xD;
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the&#xD;
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakthrough finding made by NovoCure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very&#xD;
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are&#xD;
      multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a&#xD;
      way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature&#xD;
      building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to&#xD;
      place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of&#xD;
      electric charge.&#xD;
