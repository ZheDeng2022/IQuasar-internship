  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot; Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD)&quot; is characterized by the appearance of new&#xD;
      choroidal vessels. Several clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of intra-vitreous&#xD;
      injections of anti-VEGF (bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept) against these choroidal&#xD;
      neovessels. However, some eyes appear to respond less well or be resistant to anti-VEGF&#xD;
      injections, which affects visual acuity. To improve the clinical management of patients with&#xD;
      wet AMD, it is important to be able to determine which factors determine the response to&#xD;
      anti-VEGF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-modifiable factors such as visual acuity or the patient's age at the time of the first&#xD;
      injections, the type and size of choroidal neovascularization, as well as certain genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms are known. Two studies, one carried out in Korean patients, the other in&#xD;
      different centers in Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Switzerland showed that active&#xD;
      smoking was associated with a poorer response to intra-vitreous injections of ranibizumab,&#xD;
      since smoking is also an already well-known modifiable risk factor for the onset of AMD.&#xD;
      Another study in the Netherlands shows a poorer visual prognosis after five years of&#xD;
      injection treatment in patients who smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to study the effect of active smoking on the visual prognosis of patients&#xD;
      with exudative AMD and treated with anti-VEGF injections in a Belgian cohort.&#xD;
