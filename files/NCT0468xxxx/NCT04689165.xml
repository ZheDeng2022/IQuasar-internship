  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, and controlled phase III clinical trial of the&#xD;
      Group A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy infants aged 6-15 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was divided into two stages. The first stage study was an early safety assessment&#xD;
      study among 80 subjects. The first stage study was conducted gradually in 20 subjects aged&#xD;
      18-50 years, 20 subjects aged 3-17 years, and 40 subjects aged 6-15 months. The second phase&#xD;
      was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, non-inferiority phase III clinical trial in 1200&#xD;
      healthy infants aged 6-15 months, to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine after two doses of immunization.&#xD;
