  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a window of opportunity trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of a short course of&#xD;
      the study combination, composed by an Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (Dostarlimab (TSR-042))&#xD;
      and a PARPi (Niraparib). The study population will be surgically resectable, HPV-negative&#xD;
      (defined by p16 negative status) locally advanced HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance treatment will be then delivered, so to better integrate the therapeutic benefits&#xD;
      of this drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to neoadjuvant treatment will be evaluated by the rate of major pathologic response,&#xD;
      morphologic, and functional imaging (MRI with functional evaluation -DWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that neoadjuvant and maintenance PARPi plus immunotherapy treatment could lead&#xD;
      to a reduction of loco-regional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastasis (DM) rates in such a&#xD;
      high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the window of opportunity portion of this trial will allow in vivo acquisition&#xD;
      of valuable knowledge on mechanisms of action and primary resistance to Anti-PD-1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody and PARPi in HNSCC. In this phase of the study, biological specimens will be&#xD;
      collected (pre-treatment tumor biopsy, tissues from the surgical specimen, liquid biopsy,&#xD;
      blood and saliva samples) as well as functional imaging (MRI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The entire patient population will receive the following treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Niraparib 200 mg/day: day -49 to day -21;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dostarlimab 500 mg iv: day -49 and day -28; At day -21, clinical evaluation will be&#xD;
           performed and the patient will be directed to surgery with exclusion from the study in&#xD;
           case of progressive disease. Radiological assessment will be performed according to the&#xD;
           physician's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no clinical evidence of disease progression, the following schedule will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Niraparib 200 mg/day day -21 to day -7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dostarlimab 500 mg iv: day -7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and radiological evaluation with Diffusion Weighted Imaging Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
           Imaging (DWI MRI) of the disease at day -1 (± 3 days);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery (original margin) day 0 (± 3 days, within 72 hours from radiological&#xD;
           assessment); Following surgery, patients included in the study will undergo standard&#xD;
           postoperative (chemo)radiotherapy according to pathologic report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the following schedule will be carried out, in a period comprised between 2 and&#xD;
      6 weeks after the end of radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance Niraparib, 200 mg/day for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance Dostarlimab, 500 mg iv q3W for the first four cycles and 1000 mg iv Q6W&#xD;
           thereafter for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting this adjuvant treatment phase, inclusion and exclusion criteria of the&#xD;
      protocol should be re-assessed and every patient should meet these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the patient will start the follow up period, consisting in clinical visits every 3&#xD;
      months for the first year and every 4 months for the second year, then every year. After this&#xD;
      period, the patient will be followed according to clinical practice in each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each follow up, clinical evaluation with fiberendoscopic assessment will be carried out;&#xD;
      moreover, radiological imaging with MRI will be performed every other visit. CT scan of&#xD;
      abdomen and thorax or PET/CT will be requested at 12 and 24 months after treatment end. In&#xD;
      any case, radiological exams will be requested in case of any doubts of recurrence or late&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
