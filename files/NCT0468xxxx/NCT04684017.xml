    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, single center study, aiming to investigate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of etoposide and carboplatin (administered intravenously) in combination with&#xD;
      anlotinib (administered orally) in treatment-naive advanced NSCLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer can be divided into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), of which SCLC accounts for about 15%-20%.Because of the high degree of malignancy of&#xD;
      SCLC, patients often lose the opportunity of surgical treatment due to metastasis at the time&#xD;
      of admission. Traditional cytotoxic drugs can improve the prognosis of patients and life&#xD;
      treatment, but the survival benefit is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular targeted therapy is an important treatment strategy for metastatic lung&#xD;
      cancer.Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has&#xD;
      significant inhibitory activity against angiogenesis related kinases such as VEGFR1/2/3,&#xD;
      FGFR1/2/3, and other tumor related kinases such as PDGFR /, C-Kit, Ret, etc. (e.g., Met,&#xD;
      FGFR1/2/3). An exploratory phase II study explored the efficacy of third-line single-drug&#xD;
      therapy for ED-SCLC and found significant improvement in prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above status and research results, the purpose of this study was to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with etoposide/carboplatin in&#xD;
      first-line treatment of extensive small-cell lung cancer.&#xD;
