  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression doubles the risk of death in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but so&#xD;
      far, there is insufficient evidence that we can reduce the risk of death by treating&#xD;
      depression. This study will investigate the cardiac risk markers that are associated with&#xD;
      depression symptoms that remain despite treatment, and identify potential targets for their&#xD;
      treatment. The results of the study will inform the development of more effective&#xD;
      interventions to improve both depression and survival in patients with CHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is associated with an increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      coronary heart disease (CHD). Although safe and modestly effective treatments for major&#xD;
      depression exist, only about 30% of patients ever achieve full remission. CHD patients with&#xD;
      depression symptoms that do not respond to treatment are at high risk for cardiac morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality compared to those whose depression symptoms respond to treatment. Anhedonia and&#xD;
      fatigue are among the most common symptoms to remain following treatment in both depressed&#xD;
      CHD patients and in medically well psychiatric patients. In a recent study, the investigators&#xD;
      found that several risk markers of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including a high&#xD;
      normal level of the thyroid hormone free thyroxine (FT4), low nocturnal heart rate&#xD;
      variability, blunted circadian heart rate, and poor sleep quality predict depression&#xD;
      treatment response and post-treatment symptoms of fatigue and anhedonia. It is unclear why&#xD;
      these risk markers are associated with residual anhedonia and fatigue. Elevated cortisol&#xD;
      levels, chronic sympathetic nervous system activation, reduced vagal modulation of HR, high&#xD;
      levels of perceived stress, low level of physical activity, disordered sleep, and occult&#xD;
      subclinical thyroid diseases are among the most plausible explanations. Any or all of these&#xD;
      factors may explain the relationship between the risk markers and residual fatigue and&#xD;
      anhedonia, and all are potentially modifiable and thus possible targets for future clinical&#xD;
      trials. The purpose of the proposed research is to identify modifiable correlates of these&#xD;
      risk markers and of fatigue and anhedonia in depressed patients with CHD. Study participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from cardiology practices at Washington University School of Medicine.&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients will be scheduled for a structured clinical interview. Those&#xD;
      who score ≥ 14 on the BDI-II and meet the DSM-5 criteria for major depression and no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Participants will be evaluated by phone, or in person at&#xD;
      the Behavioral Medicine Center at Washington University School of Medicine. The evaluation&#xD;
      will be performed in the morning. An appointment will be made for a blood draw on a morning&#xD;
      after a 12-hour fast to obtain a thyroid panel, lipid profile, plasma cortisol, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, and other biomarkers. Participants will be fitted with an ambulatory ECG monitor and&#xD;
      a wrist actigraph that will be sent to them, and they will complete a battery of self-report&#xD;
      inventories. The ECG monitor and actigraph will be worn for 48 hours on two consecutive&#xD;
      weekdays to measure the ECG markers, activity levels, and sleep parameters. Participants will&#xD;
      be compensated for their time upon return of the samples and equipment. This study will&#xD;
      identify potential targets for adjunctive interventions to augment traditional depression&#xD;
      treatments and thereby help to lay the groundwork for a randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      determine whether treating depression in patients with CHD can improve both depression and&#xD;
      event-free survival.&#xD;
