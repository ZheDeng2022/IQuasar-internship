      STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of combination of regional&#xD;
      anesthesia and physical therapy measured as an improvement in pain related disability scores&#xD;
      of the impaired shoulder using the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ), Shoulder Pain and&#xD;
      Disability Index (SPADI), and improvement in pain score measured by Brief Pain Inventory&#xD;
      (BPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of treatment on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety, measured by General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression, measured by Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction, measured by Global Improvement and Satisfaction Score (GISS) STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
           This is as a single-center, prospective cohort study. The study does not imply any new&#xD;
           intervention; all decisions regarding the treatment will be made at the sole discretion&#xD;
           of the treating physician as part of clinical care. The study will be conducted over a&#xD;
           period of 14 months, including approximately 1-2 months of enrolment, 4-6 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment and follow-up at 3, 6, 12 months after the initiation of treatment for frozen&#xD;
           shoulder. Treatment 1 can be scheduled along with baseline consult and screening (Day&#xD;
           0), three to five more treatment visits (Treatment 2 to Treatment 6) will be scheduled&#xD;
           weekly (4-6 treatments in total), and follow up visits on 3, 6, and 12 months (with&#xD;
           Â±1week window). If patient has achieved any early full ROM, treatment will be stopped&#xD;
           according to the physicians' decision. The study will be conducted at the Allevio Pain&#xD;
           Clinic, Toronto, Canada. Research Ethics approvals will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Patients with unilateral or bilateral frozen shoulder in any stage will be&#xD;
      screened for study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      1st part of treatment: (by Anesthesiologist) Treatment will be provided to all eligible&#xD;
      patients at baseline visit (Day 0). In the procedure room, after exposing the affected&#xD;
      shoulder, the skin of the shoulder and neck on the affected area will be be prepared with the&#xD;
      mixture of chlorhexidine and alcohol. The position of the patient will be decided based on&#xD;
      the preference of the practitioner for performing brachial plexus block. Some of our&#xD;
      practitioners prefer to perform the procedure on supine position and some prefer lateral&#xD;
      position. Any difference in performing the brachial plexus block on supine or lateral&#xD;
      position is not expected. Furthermore, using a familiar position for the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      performing the brachial plexus block only adds to the safety of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist will use ultrasound and a sterile technique to perform two procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first step, with the guidance of ultrasound, brachial plexus block (inter scalene&#xD;
           approach) will be provided. In total, 10 mL of a very dilute local anesthetic, marcaine&#xD;
           0.08 %, would be injected. The real-time guidance of ultrasound will be used to monitor&#xD;
           the whole procedure. By using an ultrasound guidance, the practitioner wiill make sure&#xD;
           that the local anesthetic has reached to all three nerve roots in inter scalene space.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second step of the procedure, the patient will be asked to sit up. In this step,&#xD;
           normal saline will be injected into the shoulder joint. The posterior approach will be&#xD;
           used with the real-time guidance of ultrasound. Depending on the compliance of the&#xD;
           shoulder joint, between 10-40 mL of normal saline will be injected. The target area for&#xD;
           normal saline is between the shoulder capsule and the head of the humorous. The goal is&#xD;
           to use the hydrostatic pressure to lift the capsule and separate the layers of adhesion&#xD;
           from the cartilage of the head of humorous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will stay in the recovery area for 15 minutes after both interventions are&#xD;
      performed. For the entire duration of both procedures, pulse rate, blood pressure, and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation in the room air will continuously be monitored every 5 minutes. Then the patient&#xD;
      will be moved to another area of the clinic to start physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the consult plus treatment day, assessment of the shoulder will begin in the seated&#xD;
      position. The range of passive external rotation will be measured with the elbow held tight&#xD;
      to the torso and bent at 90 degrees. Care will be taken to ensure that the patient does not&#xD;
      rotate at the trunk during external rotation of the shoulder. Manual palpation of the&#xD;
      coracoid process and deltoid insertion will be performed to check for pain and/or point&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient then will be placed in the supine position to check passive flexion and abduction&#xD;
      of the shoulder. Care will be taken to ensure the patient does not hike the shoulder towards&#xD;
      the ear during the passive abduction or arch the back during passive flexion, thereby&#xD;
      allowing evaluation solely of the rotator cuff. Due to the relatively small sample size and&#xD;
      working within a very active clinic environment, a visual estimation of the passive ROM will&#xD;
      be recorded in 20-degree increments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After physical assessment and suitability confirmation, patients will be scheduled for 4-6&#xD;
      treatment appointments where they will undergo brachial plexus block and shoulder joint&#xD;
      injection by the anesthesiologist before passive mobilization performed by the chiropractor.&#xD;
      Each passive mobilization treatment will be generally 20 minutes in duration. Care will be&#xD;
      directed solely at the affected shoulder, and no other passive modalities will be applied&#xD;
      other than manual mobilization. The patient will be given three home based exercises to&#xD;
      perform. These exercises are pendulums, passive external rotation against a door frame, and&#xD;
      active wall walks within the patient's pain tolerance. The patient will be asked to perform 2&#xD;
      sets of exercises once a day, at 10 repetitions per set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES Study visits and related procedures are displayed in Table 1.&#xD;
      During the screening visit the study coordinator will obtain informed consent and perform&#xD;
      eligibility check, (which has been explained in recruitment section). Additional visits may&#xD;
      be required to address patient questions and to sign informed consent, collect demographics&#xD;
      (age, gender, race), medical history, clinical data. Qualified participants will be scheduled&#xD;
      for their combined appointment with anesthesiologist and chiropractor at the same time&#xD;
      (Baseline visit), and thereafter every week for 4-6 weeks depend on ROM achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the baseline visit, after routine documentation of the blood pressure, heart rate and&#xD;
      saturation of oxygen in room air and completion of baseline questionnaires, the patient would&#xD;
      move to the procedure room to receive the intervention that is described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will also be collected at each follow-up visits. Furthermore, the investigator&#xD;
      will perform the following procedures at all visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perform clinical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  report adverse events (AE) and/or serious adverse events (SAE), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete relevant section of case report form (CRF)&#xD;
