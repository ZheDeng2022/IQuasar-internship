  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous Icelandic studies regarding prevalence of diabetes have mostly used data from the&#xD;
      capital area. Information on the proportion of people at risk at developing T2DM or having&#xD;
      undiagnosed T2DM among people living in rural Northern Iceland is unknown. Clinical&#xD;
      guidelines recommend that patients with prediabetes (diabetes warning signs) should be&#xD;
      referred to a counselling program. The study will evaluate effectiveness of nurse-coordinated&#xD;
      Guided Self-Determination (GSD) follow up program toward health promotion, for people at risk&#xD;
      of T2DM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) a major health problem is rising. This&#xD;
      metabolic disease characterized by the inability to effectively metabolize glucose, and often&#xD;
      also a silent and sneaky onset. A lag is often found between diagnose and onset of the&#xD;
      disease. Diabetes related complications are expensive for the society, and reduce quality of&#xD;
      life for the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around one out of three with T2DM in an Icelandic study were unaware of their T2DM when&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose was measured. In the U.S.A., the average interval between onset of the&#xD;
      disease and diagnose is seven years, and the authors claimed that 30% of people with T2DM are&#xD;
      undiagnosed, with increased risk for chronic diabetes complications higher Cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors (CVR), and higher premature death for people with early onset of T2DM compared&#xD;
      to late onset of T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research have shown 1.83-fold higher risk of CVD for those with prediabetes and 2.26-fold&#xD;
      higher risk for individuals with undiagnosed diabetes compared to individuals with normal&#xD;
      HbA1c. These results highlight the pivotal need to prevent development of diabetes, as there&#xD;
      is an association between increased obesity and increased prevalence of T2DM as Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2DM) is also found to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Icelandic people and especially men are becoming more overweight. From the years 1968-2012,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) increased by 11%, from 25.8 kg/m2 to 28.7 kg/m2 for men between 50-69&#xD;
      years. In women 50-69 years, the BMI increased from 25.2 kg/m2 to 27.2 kg/m2, or 8%. These&#xD;
      results highlight the pivotal need to prevent development of diabetes in Iceland, as there is&#xD;
      an association between increased obesity and increased prevalence of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Guided Self-Determination (GSD) is based on a strong theoretical value and is a well&#xD;
      establish nurse-led interventional method for people diagnosed with T2DM and other diseases.&#xD;
      To our knowledge this is the first time that GSD is used in Iceland. Nurses working in&#xD;
      primary care, at The Health Care Institution of North Iceland (HSN), in Akureyri, Husavik and&#xD;
      Sau√∞arkrokur, will offer the GSD intervention. Before the intervention the nurses will&#xD;
      receive teaching and consultation from an experienced GSD diabetic nurse. During their use of&#xD;
      the GSD method they will have counseling from the experienced GSD nurse and the PhD student.&#xD;
      A systematic review claimed, that multi-professional interventions are more effective in&#xD;
      improving diabetes care compared to single professional interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent Cochrane review using data from 18 trials, investigated the impact of nurses working&#xD;
      as substitutes for primary care doctors. The results demonstrate that using the capacity and&#xD;
      skills of nurses to deliver primary healthcare services leads to similar or better patient&#xD;
      health and higher patient satisfaction. As such, this might be an important strategy to&#xD;
      improve access, efficiency, and quality of care, and at the same time strengthen health&#xD;
      promotion aspects of care and management of chronic diseases and increase teamwork in primary&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a part of doctoral student study. This PhD project is collaboration between&#xD;
      University of Akureyri, Iceland (UNAK), Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL)&#xD;
      and the Health Care Institution of North Iceland (HSN). HVL has a considerably experience in&#xD;
      researching diabetes through the Diabetes Research Group for BEST Practice (DiaBEST). The&#xD;
      research group DiaBEST consist of researchers from Bergen University Collage, the University&#xD;
      of Bergen and the University of Stavanger. The projects contribute to increase knowledge&#xD;
      about and implementation of evidence-based practice within primary care.&#xD;
