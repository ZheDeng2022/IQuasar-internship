  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose-escalation phase Ⅰa clinical study to observe the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profiles of RBD1016 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of screening period (Day -28 to Day -1), treatment period (Day 1 to Day&#xD;
      2), safety assessment period (to Day 29) and safety follow-up period (up to Day 85).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation, phase Ia study.&#xD;
      The study will enroll 40 healthy subjects, including 5 dose escalation cohorts for dose&#xD;
      escalation with 0.3 mg/kg body weight as the starting dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a single-dose injection, there will be a 4-week safety assessment and monitoring phase&#xD;
      (Days 1-29). Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected within 60 minutes before dosing,&#xD;
      and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after dosing, respectively.&#xD;
      According to the previous PK results, the subsequent PK blood collection points can be&#xD;
      adjusted. Total urine samples will be collected once before dosing and in each of 2 time&#xD;
      periods after dosing: 0~8 h and 8~24 h. The total urine output will be recorded, and some&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected in each time period to analyze and detect the urine drug&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo safety follow-up from Day 29 to Day 85.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;Sentinel cohort&quot; design is used in each cohort: each cohort will be administered in two batches, the first 2 subjects will receive RBD1016 or placebo respectively, and safety assessment will be done on D8±1. After safety is confirmed through SRC assessment, the remaining 6 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive RBD1016 or placebo in a ratio of 5:1. SRC will assess the safety after all the subjects in each cohort complete the 28-day safety observation and the subjects may proceed to the next dose cohort with permission.&#xD;
Only after all the subjects in the previous dose cohort have completed the safety assessment by SRC (observed for 28 days) may the next dose cohort be initiated with permission.</description>
