  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of patients who undergo liver surgery to remove bowel cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to the liver (metastases) develop disease recurrence and die from the disease. The&#xD;
      EMT2 study (NCT03428477) is a clinical trial of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA, investigating&#xD;
      whether patients who EPA ethyl ester remain free of disease recurrence for longer than those&#xD;
      taking placebo. Recent data suggest that the anti-cancer effect of EPA may result from&#xD;
      changes to the microbiota (gut bacteria) which lead to an improved anti-cancer response by&#xD;
      the immune system. This study will collect biospecimens (stool, urine, blood, tumour tissue)&#xD;
      from participants in the EMT2 trial in order to interrogate the microbiome and immune&#xD;
      mechanisms associated with EPA treatment, in relation to participant survival. Insights from&#xD;
      this study will identify those most likely to benefit from treatment, leading to more&#xD;
      targeted, personalised use of EPA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advance in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), it remains the&#xD;
      second most common cause of cancer-related death in the US and the UK. The majority of deaths&#xD;
      from CRC are related to distant metastases, predominantly to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are observational and laboratory data supporting the notion that the omega-3&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has anti-CRC activity. These include a&#xD;
      phase 2 'window of opportunity' randomised, placebo-controlled trial of EPA provided before&#xD;
      surgery for resection of CRC liver metastasis (called the EMT study). A signal that EPA&#xD;
      improved progression-free and overall survival after liver surgery provided the rationale for&#xD;
      the EMT2 trial, which is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of the&#xD;
      effect of EPA (started before surgery but continued post-operatively) on CRC recurrence and&#xD;
      survival after surgery for resectable liver metastases [ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03428477 and&#xD;
      EudraCT Number: 2016-000628-24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism(s) by which EPA might influence post-operative survival are not well&#xD;
      understood. Recent data support the idea that the anti-CRC benefit of EPA may be mediated by&#xD;
      modulating the intestinal microbiota and ameliorating tumour-permissive immunosuppressive&#xD;
      mechanisms, including inhibition of the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as reduced synthesis of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators such as prostaglandin (PG) E2 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). Mice fed&#xD;
      with a high-EPA-containing diet demonstrate 1) increased abundance of gut bacteria, such as&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera that support the host anti-tumour immune response&#xD;
      and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, and 2) decreased abundance of&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing bacteria that trigger chronic inflammation and can promote&#xD;
      CRC. These data support a hypothesis that a prebiotic effect of EPA abrogates intra-tumoural&#xD;
      immunosuppression and ameliorates systemic inflammation to improve survival of CRCLM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMT2 trial participants are ideally placed to provide biospecimens that can be analysed in&#xD;
      order to understand the mechanism(s) of action of EPA given that the laboratory data can&#xD;
      eventually be linked to the clinical outcomes from the trial. Biospecimens can be obtained&#xD;
      without interference with the EMT2 trial protocol. Stool, urine, and blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained 1) after EMT2 trial randomization, before starting EPA or placebo, 2) just before&#xD;
      surgery, and 3) at 6-monthly intervals thereafter, plus liver metastases tumour tissue during&#xD;
      surgery. Using these biospecimens, the microbiome and immune pathways altered by EPA will be&#xD;
      investigated in relation to participant survival. Mechanistic insights about the anti-CRC&#xD;
      activity of EPA from the biospecimen collection project will maximize the knowledge and&#xD;
      insights gained from the EMT2 trial and its participants, thereby leading to personalized use&#xD;
      of EPA, which will be targeted at those most likely to benefit.&#xD;
