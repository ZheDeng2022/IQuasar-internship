    <textblock>
      Spinal anaesthesia is the anaesthetic technique of choice of patients undergoing cesarean&#xD;
      delivery due to its rapid onset, good reliability and good efficacy. However, the inadequate&#xD;
      or failed spinal anaesthesia can occur. The previous literatures revealed incidence of failed&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia was as high as 0.5-6%. Failure of spinal anaesthesia leads to numerous&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal consequences. Those failed spinal anaesthesia patients required general&#xD;
      anaesthesia with endotracheal tube which may cause several complications such as hypoxia,&#xD;
      difficult intubation, failed intubation and pulmonary aspiration. Also, a recent network&#xD;
      meta-analysis showed general anaesthesia decreasing neonatal Apgar score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factors that associated with failed spinal anaesthesia in cesarean delivery has been&#xD;
      studied. The amount of local anaesthetic, needle type, patients' body mass index (obesity),&#xD;
      and experiences of the anaesthetist performing spinal block influenced the failure of spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia. The details and factors of failed spinal anaesthesia in our hospital was scarce.&#xD;
      It has not yet been published in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to reveal the factor associated with failed spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia in cesarean delivery. We conduct the retrospective case-control study to&#xD;
      elucidate the involving factors.&#xD;
