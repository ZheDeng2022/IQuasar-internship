  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized single-blind interventional trial to test the effectiveness of an electronic&#xD;
      medical record-based best practice alert recommending evidence-based medical therapies versus&#xD;
      usual care in inpatient adult patients presenting with heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the major cause of healthcare expenditure, morbidity, and mortality in&#xD;
      the United States. HF is the primary diagnosis for hospital discharge in ~1 million and a&#xD;
      secondary diagnosis in ~2 million hospitalizations annually in the US. In fact, inpatient&#xD;
      admissions account for more than half of HF healthcare expenditure. However, data from&#xD;
      several registries over the last three decades has failed to see use of these evidence- based&#xD;
      therapies at levels noted in clinical trials, despite aggressive guideline recommendations&#xD;
      and promotion by thought leaders in the field. It remains unclear as to why many patients&#xD;
      with HF reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are not on evidence-based therapies especially post&#xD;
      hospital discharge and why the percentages are consistent across national registries over&#xD;
      time. Whether the gap between clinical trial use and real-world practice is due to a lack of&#xD;
      knowledge or providers making individualized decisions about their patients is unclear. A&#xD;
      simple way to test this hypothesis is to examine whether electronic health record (EHR) based&#xD;
      &quot;best practice advisories&quot; (BPAs) can increase use of evidence based therapies. If found to&#xD;
      be effective, these low cost interventions can be rapidly applied across large healthcare&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of a BPA alert system that informs&#xD;
      providers about evidence-based medical therapy for the treatment of HFrEF versus usual care&#xD;
      (no alert) in the inpatient setting.&#xD;
