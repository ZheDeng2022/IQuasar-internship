    <textblock>
      Rationale: Childhood cancer survivorship attracts attention globally, because successes in&#xD;
      treatment have led to increasing number of survivors who reach adulthood, in which&#xD;
      survivorship issues affecting health-related quality of life (HRQoL) become prominent. Most&#xD;
      paediatric patients are treated intensively with irradiation and/or chemotherapy, which put&#xD;
      them at risk for early and/or late adverse medical and psychosocial events. In contrast, much&#xD;
      less is known about adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients, diagnosed between 18-39&#xD;
      years, who, with an 80% chance to survive, also have a long life ahead. AYA cancer patients,&#xD;
      much more than children, suffer from delay in diagnosis, lack of centralization of care,&#xD;
      ageadjusted expertise, and AYA follow-up care. AYAs typically present with a rare tumour:&#xD;
      either with a paediatric malignancy (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, paediatric brain&#xD;
      tumours), a more typical tumour of AYA age (e.g. Hodgkin's disease, germ cell cancer,&#xD;
      melanoma, thyroid cancer) or with an adult tumour at unusual young age (e.g.&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, lung, breast carcinomas). Next to these differences in epidemiology, the&#xD;
      tumour biology, developmental challenges (e.g. forming relationships, becoming financially&#xD;
      independent, having children) and treatment regimens differ between AYAs and children, and&#xD;
      therefore findings derived from childhood cancer survivors cannot be extrapolated to AYAs.&#xD;
      Furthermore, novel treatments with targeted agents or immunotherapy are more likely to be&#xD;
      administrated to AYAs compared to children. Finally, a rare group of incurable AYA cancer&#xD;
      patients will survive for many years, for whom health outcome and supportive care&#xD;
      intervention data are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, so far, the identification of AYA cancer patient subgroups that might be more&#xD;
      susceptible to poor health outcomes has not been systematically addressed. The role of&#xD;
      sociodemographic and treatment-associated risks, external exposures (e.g. lifestyle) and host&#xD;
      factors (e.g. genetic, biological, physiological); or combinations of influences for impaired&#xD;
      (agespecific) health outcomes, remains largely unknown. Understanding who is at risk and why&#xD;
      will support the development of evidence-based AYA prevention, treatment and supportive care&#xD;
      programs and guidelines, in co-creation with AYA cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the prevalence, risk factors and mechanisms of impaired health outcomes&#xD;
      (short- and long-term medical and psychosocial effects and late effects) over time among a&#xD;
      population-based sample of AYA cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, observational cohort study Study population: All AYAs diagnosed&#xD;
      (18-39 years at primary diagnosis) with cancer (any type) within the first 3 months after&#xD;
      diagnosis (eligibility window of 1 month to ensure all eligible AYA cancer patients can be&#xD;
      included) in one of the participating centres (or treated in one of these centres) in The&#xD;
      Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main outcomes are medical (e.g. second tumour; survival;&#xD;
      fertility) and psychosocial (e.g. distress) health outcomes. Other study parameters&#xD;
      (covariates/moderators/mediators) are characteristics of the individual (e.g. age, sex,&#xD;
      cultural background, partner status, educational level, occupation, tumour type, disease&#xD;
      stage, body composition, comorbid conditions, coping style), characteristics of the&#xD;
      environment (e.g. cancer treatment, lifestyle), and genetic and biological factors (e.g.&#xD;
      family history of cancer, stress and inflammation markers (e.g. cortisol, IL-6), microbiome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: On an individual level, patients who participate are asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires on an annual basis for at least 10 years. All sample collections will take&#xD;
      place at three time points: 0-3 months after diagnosis (baseline), 2 and 5 years; except&#xD;
      blood for DNA analyses which will only take place at baseline. The collection of blood, hair&#xD;
      and faeces at three occasions is minimally invasive and the risks of blood draws, hair and&#xD;
      fecal sampling are negligible. All safety measures and procedures will be performed according&#xD;
      to local guidelines. Patients will not experience direct benefit from participation in the&#xD;
      COMPRAYA study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By participating, patients will contribute to a better insight in the prevalence of impaired&#xD;
      medical and psychosocial (age-specific) health outcomes in AYA and evidence on factors&#xD;
      associated with these health outcomes. This will lead to better and more personalized cancer&#xD;
      care and supportive care tools for future AYA cancer patients.&#xD;

After linear transformation, all scales and single item measures range in score from 0-100. A higher score on the functional scales and global QoL means better functioning and HRQoL, whereas a higher score on the symptom scales means more complaints.</description>

        All AYA cancer patients, diagnosed at age 18-39 years in one of the participating&#xD;
        hospitals,receive an invite within the first 3 months after diagnosis (eligibility window&#xD;
        of 1 month to ensure all eligible AYA cancer patients can be included) and will be asked to&#xD;
        complete the COMPRAYA questionnaires on an annual basis up to 10 years after diagnosis&#xD;
        (again with a window of 2 months before and after). Collection of clinical data and samples&#xD;
        (e.g. faeces, hair and blood) will be done at baseline, 2, and 5 years after diagnosis.&#xD;
        Questionnaire data collection is guaranteed by the PROFILES registry and patients will give&#xD;
        informed consent for linkage with registry data, which makes long-term follow-up possible.&#xD;
