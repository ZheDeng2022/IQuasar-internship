  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study is a two-stage, serial cohort dose escalation and expansion study of a&#xD;
      single 30-minute (IV) infusion of HBI-3000 for the conversion of patients with recent-onset&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage A is open label and all patients will receive HBI-3000. In each of three dose cohorts,&#xD;
      up to 10 patients will receive HBI-3000 by IV infusion (30 minutes). Three different dose&#xD;
      levels are planned to be administered serially, lowest to highest, with assessment of safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy prior to proceeding to the next dose level group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Stage A, the iDMC will recommend up to two doses of HBI-3000 to be further explored&#xD;
      in Stage B. Stage B is a serial, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled cohort of&#xD;
      two different doses of HBI-3000, with a dose decision after the first cohort. Stage B will be&#xD;
      powered to show a difference between HBI-3000 and placebo in conversion rate at each of the&#xD;
      two dose levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-stage study in patients with AF of recent onset:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage A is open label and all patients will receive HBI-3000. In each of three dose cohorts,&#xD;
      up to 10 patients will receive HBI-3000 by IV infusion (30 minutes). For each dosing cohort,&#xD;
      sentinel dosing is planned. Each patient may enroll only once in the study, will be enrolled&#xD;
      into only one dose cohort and receive only a single dose treatment. In Stage A, three&#xD;
      different dose levels are planned to be administered serially, lowest to highest, with&#xD;
      assessment of safety, tolerability, and efficacy prior to proceeding to the next dose level&#xD;
      group. The actual dose levels may be modified, and additional dose levels may be considered&#xD;
      based on the observed results at each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage B is the randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled part of the study. Study drug&#xD;
      for Stage B patients is either HBI-3000 or placebo. Two cohorts will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially, lowest dose level first, with safety, efficacy, and available PK results&#xD;
      evaluated by the Sponsor and iDMC prior to enrolling patients in the next/higher dose cohort.&#xD;
      The dose level for the second cohort may be adjusted following interim review of results in&#xD;
      the first cohort. Patients will be randomized to receive a single IV infusion of HBI 3000 or&#xD;
      placebo over 30 minutes. In each of the dose cohorts, sequentially enrolled patients will be&#xD;
      randomized at 2:1 ratio so that 40 patients will receive HBI 3000 infusion and 20 patients&#xD;
      will receive placebo infusion. Each patient may enroll only once in the study, will be&#xD;
      enrolled into only one dose cohort and receive only a single dose treatment.&#xD;
