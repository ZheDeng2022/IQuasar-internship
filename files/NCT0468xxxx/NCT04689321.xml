    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that use of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer&#xD;
      (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Brain Neoplasm (QLQ-BN20) has tremendously&#xD;
      contributed to insight into the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of brain tumor&#xD;
      patients, certain items of the questionnaire have raised issues, and new treatments have been&#xD;
      introduced, with different toxicity profiles not covered by the current measure. These&#xD;
      observations have led to the recognition that a revision of the QLQ-BN20 is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to update the current EORTC QLQ-BN20 questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire - Brain Neoplasm (QLQ-BN20) brain tumor module was developed and validated in&#xD;
      1996, with a phase IV validation in 2010. The aim of this module was to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of the tumor and its treatment on symptoms, functions and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQoL) of brain tumor patients, both in clinical trials and clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unpublished systematic review conducted by our group revealed that since the publication&#xD;
      of the QLQ-BN20 in 1996, there has been an increase in the use of this questionnaire, not&#xD;
      only in glioma patients for whom this questionnaire was developed, but also in meningioma&#xD;
      patients, patients with brain metastases or groups with mixed types of brain tumors. The use&#xD;
      of the QLQ-BN20 showed an increase over time: from 20 publications in the period 1996-2006,&#xD;
      to 98 publications in the period 2007-2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the reasons for updating the current QLQ-BN20 questionnaire is that were have&#xD;
      encountered limitations in the use of specific items. For example, the item referring to the&#xD;
      occurrence of seizures results in an underestimation of the true prevalence of seizures. In&#xD;
      previous clinical studies it was shown that 30-60% of the brain tumor patients experience&#xD;
      seizures. In contrast, large randomized controlled trials using the QLQ-BN20 to determine&#xD;
      seizure occurrence showed prevalences of only 6 to 14 percent. This is probably due to the&#xD;
      time frame that is used for this item, i.e. the 'last week'. Although seizures are frequent,&#xD;
      they often do not occur weekly. With the current response format, detection of seizures is&#xD;
      difficult and this should be taken into account in the revision of the QLQ-BN20&#xD;
      questionnaire. Second, several items show severe floor-effects. Probably the most important&#xD;
      reason to revise the current QLQ-BN20 questionnaire is because major advances in the&#xD;
      treatment of brain tumors have been made in the last 20 years. Compared to 20 years ago, when&#xD;
      the QLQ-BN20 was developed, current standard treatment (multimodal treatment including&#xD;
      surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) is different and treatments have a different toxicity&#xD;
      profile. Moreover, new treatment opportunities are currently explored and include targeted&#xD;
      treatment and immunotherapy. These types of treatment bring new toxicities, e.g. eye, skin&#xD;
      and endocrine function problems. The current brain tumor module lacks sufficient coverage of&#xD;
      domains that are affected by current and new treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, despite the fact that use of the QLQ-BN20 has tremendously contributed to insight into&#xD;
      the quality of life of brain tumor patients, several observations have led to the recognition&#xD;
      that a revision of the QLQ-BN20 is warranted. Therefore, the aim of this project is to update&#xD;
      the current EORTC QLQ-BN20 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The overall aim of this study is to update the current EORTC QLQ-BN20 questionnaire for&#xD;
      use in brain tumor patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The methods for this prospective study will follow the EORTC Quality of Life&#xD;
      Group guidelines for updating existing modules, including a literature review, interviews&#xD;
      with patients and health care professionals (for the identification of items relevant to&#xD;
      current/new treatments (phase I)), creation of a revised item list (phase II), and&#xD;
      psychometric pilot testing (phase III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Semi-structured interviews with 27 patients and 6 healthcare professionals to&#xD;
      identify relevant issues for brain tumor patients (these issues are identified with a&#xD;
      systematic literature review and have to reflect the patients' functioning and well-being,&#xD;
      such as symptoms / impairments, activities in daily life and participation restrictions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Construction of a comprehensive item list with items that are relevant for brain&#xD;
      tumor patients (including construction of items, and translations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: The draft item list resulting from phase II will be pretested in 108 patients from&#xD;
      at least 6 countries in 4 main European regions and Asia (Netherlands, Germany, Italy, United&#xD;
      Kingdom, Switzerland, Croatia, Jordan and Japan). The primary aim of pretesting the module is&#xD;
      to identify and solve potential problems (phrasing, sequence questions) and to identify&#xD;
      missing or redundant items. Second, preliminary psychometric testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire resulting from phase III will subsequently be field-tested in a large,&#xD;
      international group of patients in order to determine its acceptability, reliability,&#xD;
      validity, responsiveness and cross-cultural applicability. This is currently not part of the&#xD;
      study protocol, but will commence after phase III is successfully completed.&#xD;
