    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each subject must need at least 1 restoration in a vital posterior tooth&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have given written consent to participate in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Replacement of defective restorations (i.e. fractured, stained, unaesthetic) with or&#xD;
             with-out caries are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be available for the required follow-up visits over 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restored teeth must have occlusal contact with opposing teeth or restored teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restoration width should be equal to or greater than 1/3 the distance from buccal to&#xD;
             lin-gual cusp tips&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  75% of the restorations Class II (minimum) and 25% Class I&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each Class II will have at least one proximal contact&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  75% in molars (minimum) and 25% in premolars&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All restored teeth must have at least one occlusal contact in habitual closure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have 20 or more teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If they have an allergy to ingredients of the materials under investigation (monomers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not meet all inclusion criteria above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have severe medical complications (organ transplants, long term antibiotic or steroid&#xD;
             treatment, cancer or are immunocompromised) or disabilities meaning they may not be&#xD;
             able to tolerate the time required to complete the restorations or to provide adequate&#xD;
             oral hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have xerostomia either by taking medications known to produce xerostomia or those with&#xD;
             radiation-induced xerostomia or Sjogren's syndrome - as dry mouth increases tooth and&#xD;
             restoration wear as well as the development of caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have teeth with advanced or severe periodontitis, rampant caries or poor oral hygiene&#xD;
             which may require extraction of the teeth to be restored&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present with any systemic or local disorders that contraindicate the dental procedures&#xD;
             included in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have unstable occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have severe grinding/bruxing or clenching or need TMJ-related therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have tooth with exposed pulp during preparation or caries removal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Teeth that are non-vital or that exhibit signs of pulpal pathology for restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Teeth that require cuspal build-ups involving more than one cusp&#xD;
