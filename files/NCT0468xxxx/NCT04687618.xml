  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen treatment is common in babies born early (preterm) and requiring intensive care.&#xD;
      Having too much or too little oxygen can increase the risk of damage to the eyes and lungs,&#xD;
      and contribute to death or disability. Preterm infants because of their immaturity experience&#xD;
      episodes of low oxygen levels. The low oxygen episodes are primarily due to pauses in their&#xD;
      breathing (Apnoea of prematurity) and immaturity of their lung. These episodes persist for&#xD;
      weeks to months. The lower the gestation at birth the longer the duration of these events.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that these episodes of low oxygen saturations especially if frequent and&#xD;
      prolonged is associated with poor developmental outcome, severe eye disease and lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the oxygen delivery is manually adjusted when infant has low oxygen&#xD;
      saturation. However previous studies have shown despite the best efforts the oxygen level can&#xD;
      only be maintained less than half of the time and nearly a one-fifth of the time infant&#xD;
      spends in low oxygen levels and nearly one-third of the time in high oxygen levels. With&#xD;
      advancement in the neonatal care, preterm infants tend to spend more time on non invasive&#xD;
      respiratory support. Now it is possible to maintain oxygen level in target range by using&#xD;
      automatic control of oxygen delivery on non invasive support. With the proposed study, we&#xD;
      would like to study the efficacy of automatic control of oxygen delivery in reducing the time&#xD;
      spent in very low and high oxygen levels when infants are on non invasive respiratory support&#xD;
      namely High Flow Nasal Cannula support.&#xD;

      Supplemental oxygen remains by far the most commonly used 'drug' in neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      units. The goal of oxygen therapy is to maintain normal oxygenation while minimizing&#xD;
      hypoxemia and hypoxemia. Preterm infants are particularly vulnerable to oxygen toxicity and&#xD;
      oxidative stress leading to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD), and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). It's also well known that preterm infants&#xD;
      experience hypoxic events which are primarily linked to cardiovascular instability and apnea&#xD;
      of prematurity. These events vary as the infant matures. Martin R et al showed in their study&#xD;
      that these hypoxic events peaked around 2-4 weeks and decreases by 6-8 weeks in preterm&#xD;
      infants . Exposure to prolonged and frequent hypoxemic episodes has been associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality . Prolonged hypoxic events (Saturation less than 80% for&#xD;
      more than 1 minute) have been associated with severe ROP and impaired neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcome in survivors . Very high oxygen levels are equally harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral oxygen saturation monitoring is standard of care in infants admitted to neonatal&#xD;
      unit. Traditionally oxygen saturation (SpO2) targeting is carried out by manual adjustment of&#xD;
      fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) by the caregiver based on the monitored oxygen saturation.&#xD;
      However, in practice this is only partially achieved during routine care[6]. Hagadorn et al&#xD;
      conducted a study in 14 centers and showed that preterm infants under 28 weeks' gestation&#xD;
      receiving oxygen spent on average only 48% of the time with SpO2 within the prescribed target&#xD;
      range, about 36% of the time above and 16% of the time with SpO2 below the target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants have frequent fluctuations in SpO2 due to their cardio-respiratory&#xD;
      instability requiring frequent adjustments of FiO2 . Consequently, these particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable infants spend significant time with SpO2 outside intended range and are often&#xD;
      exposed to extremes of hypoxemia and hyperoxaemia. The automatic oxygen control system&#xD;
      continuously monitors the oxygen saturation and adjusts the oxygen delivery to maintain&#xD;
      oxygen saturation within the target range. The safety, feasibility and efficacy of this mode&#xD;
      of oxygen control have already been established. Automated control of FiO2 significantly&#xD;
      improves compliance of oxygen saturation targeting and significantly reduces exposure to&#xD;
      hypoxemia as well as hyperoxaemia. Automatic control of oxygen delivery is available in both&#xD;
      invasive and non-invasive mode of ventilation. The HFNC Therapy is a common mode of&#xD;
      non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants. Oxygen Assist Module (OAM) is a system&#xD;
      of automatic oxygen control available in the HFNC (Vapotherm Precision Flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study looking at the efficacy of automated oxygen control with HFNC support mostly&#xD;
      have been a crossover model and the study duration less than 48 hours . As previously&#xD;
      mentioned, preterm infants experience hypoxic events for few weeks before cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      maturation is established. Hence, it's important to study these events over a longer period&#xD;
      of time. The objective of this randomized control trial is to evaluate the efficacy of OAM&#xD;
      (Automatic oxygen Control) in reducing the extremes of oxygen saturations in preterm infants&#xD;
      (&lt;80% and &gt;98%) through the entire period of HFNC respiratory support.&#xD;

    <description>The target oxygen saturation (SpO2) value will to be determined and set by the clinician according to specific patient needs. The target SpO2 in preterm infants is 90-95% with alarm limits at 89-96%. In automatic control of oxygen, the OAM automatically increases or decreases the FiO2 (oxygen delivery) setting on the Vapotherm Precision Flow based on pulse oximetry readings of the OAM. The target saturation will be set at 93% and the FiO2 will be adjusted by OAM to maintain the target saturation. The automated FiO2 setting can be overridden for a clinician pre-set period of time (30-120 sec) by simply manually adjusting the FiO2 on the Precision Flow. Automated control resumes after the clinicians pre-set period of time (30-120 sec) based on the current SpO2 and FiO2. The OAM utilizes a feedback control algorithm that receives a patient's oxygen saturation value from a build in pulse oximetry device (Masimo SET OEM - normal sensitivity, averaging time window set at 8 seconds).</description>
