  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tendon injuries are the most common injuries in sports. They are difficult to treat and cause&#xD;
      prolonged absence and decreased athlete performance. Proximal hamstring tendinopathy (PHT) is&#xD;
      one of them. First described by Puranen and Orava in 1988 as hamstring syndrome. This injury&#xD;
      is most common in the active population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHT is a chronic degenerative injury that is produced by mechanical overload and repetitive&#xD;
      stretch. Risk factors include overuse, poor lumbopelvic stability and relative weakness of&#xD;
      the hamstring muscles. The phenomenon manifests itself with deep pain in the ischial&#xD;
      tuberosity area and projection to the posterior thigh, pain during prolonged sitting, pain&#xD;
      during hip flexion and knee extension and pain that increases or arises during running,&#xD;
      especially during the swing phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors are divided into internal (systemic and biomechanical) and external factors.&#xD;
      Internal factors associated with systemic characteristics, include advanced age, sex,&#xD;
      obesity, genetics, inflammation and autoimmune conditions, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and drug&#xD;
      use. The external factors, which are more modifiable, are those that depend on the patient's&#xD;
      external environment and include training errors such as increasing training volume and / or&#xD;
      intensity too quickly and insufficient recovery that cause an overload on the tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PHT two conditions are considered provocative - energy storage, an action that is typical&#xD;
      in the late swing phase while running and repetitive movements that cause compressive forces&#xD;
      of the tendon on ischial tuberosity. Compressive forces increase as the hip or trunk flex&#xD;
      which explains why training errors such as an increase in volume or intensity of the training&#xD;
      and non-gradual change in training type, such as hurdle or hills training, are considered to&#xD;
      be factors involved in PHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHT treatment options include physiotherapy, shock waves, Platelet rich plasma (PRP) and&#xD;
      surgical treatment. Non-surgical treatments for tendinopathy includes gradual loading of the&#xD;
      tendon under the supervision of the level of pain. The load on the tendon causes an increase&#xD;
      in collagen synthesis and an increase in the stiffness and capacity of the tendon which&#xD;
      ultimately helps return the athlete to function and reduces the level of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the injury mechanism is common among runners and athletes from various endurance&#xD;
      disciplines (medium and long distance runners, triathletes, etc.) the phenomenon and its&#xD;
      treatment has not been sufficiently studied within this population.&#xD;
