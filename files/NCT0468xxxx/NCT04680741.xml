    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a smart phone based application (the App) that will&#xD;
      allow patients to record their attendance at 12-step meetings. The smart phone application is&#xD;
      an investigational (experimental) application that works by allowing patients to check in to&#xD;
      meetings and tracks their location. This application uses features available in smartphone&#xD;
      technology and will be tested on a small scale in order to ascertain interest and benefit in&#xD;
      a controlled manner. The initial phase of this process is a test of concept, which poses the&#xD;
      question of whether individuals in an office-based addiction treatment program will utilize&#xD;
      the application to check in and out of meetings, and answer a brief questionnaire delivered&#xD;
      via the app at the end of a meeting. In this phase, investigators will set the standard&#xD;
      recommendation as attendance at a minimum of three meetings per week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for addiction disorders has shown efficacy, but compliance with treatment is often&#xD;
      a problem. Monitoring compliance in treatment is a difficult endeavor that is currently&#xD;
      reliant on urine drug screens, monitoring of automated state pharmacy reporting systems, and&#xD;
      requiring signature documentation of attendance at twelve-step meetings. These three methods&#xD;
      are far from fool-proof and urine monitoring and signature documentation of meeting&#xD;
      attendance are notoriously falsified by patients through a wide array of strategies. There is&#xD;
      opportunity is to develop a smartphone application-based intervention protocol that will&#xD;
      monitor individual's compliance with recommended attendance at prescribed twelve-step&#xD;
      meetings. Investigators have partnered with Open Health Network to develop this application&#xD;
      and currently have a working prototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are engaged in the twelve-step process have higher rates of continued sobriety&#xD;
      as compared to patients who do not attend or are not engaged in the process. People with&#xD;
      addiction have increased sobriety rates if they are accountable to someone outside of&#xD;
      themselves. Therefore, investigators encourage patients to attend meetings frequently, have a&#xD;
      sponsor, and actively work through the twelve steps. A sponsor is an individual who has been&#xD;
      participating in a twelve-step facilitation program and has been sober for a minimum of one&#xD;
      year. Leveraging technology to hold individuals accountable for participating in these&#xD;
      meetings will improve their continued sobriety. A systematic review of available smartphone&#xD;
      apps for alcohol and drug abuse, published in 2019, concluded that most did not incorporate&#xD;
      evidence based addiction treatment. Furthermore, some apps promoted harmful drinking or&#xD;
      substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are interested in developing an application for mobile devices that will&#xD;
      document 12-step meeting attendance in a way that is more reliable than the typical sign in&#xD;
      sheet. This research study is a small trial that is designed to prove our concept and gather&#xD;
      information for future development of the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be asked to download the application to their smart phone. These&#xD;
      patients will be asked to use the application for a period of 90 days. At each of patients'&#xD;
      usual meetings investigators will ask patients to check in and check out of the meeting via&#xD;
      the App. At the conclusion of this study patients may be invited to participate in a focus&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

An item asking whether or not the meeting was helpful (yes / no). 7-item simplified ecological assessment designed for a 10-second snapshot of patients' mental and physical health status. It is visual analog scale of 0 to 10 on Mood (very poor - excellent), anxiety (very anxious - calm), stress (very stressed - relaxed), sleep (insomnia - full night), decision making (Brain fog - clarity), exercise (None - &gt;90 minutes). The scale was developed by Open Health Network investigator and has not been validated. Each score will be tracked for changes over time but there won't be composite scores.</description>
