      Background: Rigid thoracoscopy is the gold standard tool for diagnosing exudative pleural&#xD;
      effusion but sometimes it is difficult to obtain sufficient biopsies using the conventional&#xD;
      forceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study evaluated the efficacy, safety and diagnostic value of a modified&#xD;
      technique using cryoprobe to obtain pleural biopsies during thoracoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a single center prospective study in patients who will undergo rigid&#xD;
      thoracoscopy using conventional rigid forceps followed by a cryoprobe from the same site&#xD;
      after injection of subpleural mixture of adrenaline and xylocaine. Biopsies will be reviewed&#xD;
      by an independent pathologist; any complications will be recorded, and all patients will be&#xD;
      followed up post procedure.&#xD;

      circulating nurse outside the sterile field and a medical worker&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Thoracoscope:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rigid thoracoscope: (Karl Storz GmbH &amp; Co., Germany) will be used .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments for rigid thoracoscopy included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A metallic trocar with multifunctional valve with insufflation stopcock, 11mm in&#xD;
           diameter and autoclavable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 10 mm straight forward telescope 0º with angled eyepiece with a 6 mm working channel&#xD;
           (26038AA, K. Storz-Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Forceps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotational biopsy forceps with connector pin for uni-polar coagulation will be used. They are&#xD;
      5 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Cryo-Equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cryo-equipment consists of a cylinder containing cryogen stored under high pressure, a&#xD;
      console (cryo-machine) that controls the flow of cryogen and a catheter with a cryoprobe at&#xD;
      one end to freeze target tissue.The thoracoscopist will use a foot pedal to regulate the flow&#xD;
      of the cryogen through the catheter from the cylinder to the cryoprobe. The cryo-machine&#xD;
      available is ERBOCRYO CA, Tubingen, Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Flexible Cryoprobe:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A flexible cryoprobe with a diameter of 2.4 mm was used to collect the pleura by firmly&#xD;
      attaching it to the biopsy site for (10 - 30seconds) (ERBE, technikGmBH, Tubingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Rigid Cryoprobe:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rigid cryoprobe will be used and the same steps were adopted as in case of using flexible&#xD;
      Cryoprobe(ERBE, technikGmBH, Tubingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Transbronchial Needle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trans-bronchial needle with 1.8 mm diameter will be used to inject subpleural mixture of&#xD;
      lidocaine 2%and epinephrine diluted by normal saline 9% to facilitate pleural biopsy using&#xD;
      cryo technique (Aspiration needle ENDO-FLEX, Voerde, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Phases of medical thoracoscopy :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Patient positioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient lay on the healthy side with the diseased side up , the arm will be raised over&#xD;
      the head and a pillow will be placed on the table under the patient's flank to widen the&#xD;
      targeted intercostal spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Selecting the point of entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The point of entry will be determined near the mid-axillary line within the axillary triangle&#xD;
      (bounded anteriorly by the inferior edge of pectoralis major muscle, posteriorly by the&#xD;
      anterior edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle, cranially by the axillary apex and caudally&#xD;
      down to the level of diaphragmatic insertion). The point of entry will be usually determined&#xD;
      by ultrasonography and most commonly it is in the fifth, sixth or seventh intercostal spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Anaesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical thoracoscopy in the current study will be done under local anaesthesia with moderate&#xD;
      sedation . In some cases, general anesthesia will be applied if patients refuse local&#xD;
      anesthesia and moderate sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For local anaesthesia, the following steps will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The previously marked site of entry will be palpated with the index and middle fingers&#xD;
           of one hand .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between the two fingers, a syringe (small bore, 27 gauge) will be filled with 1ml of 2%&#xD;
           lidocaine (Debocaine®) will be used for intradermal injection to produce a small bleb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The local anaesthetic (10-15 ml of 2% lidocaine) in a larger bore syringe will&#xD;
           infiltrate subcutaneously and in the intercostal muscles down to the parietal pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The path of the needle will be perpendicular to the chest wall ensuring that the needle&#xD;
           has not penetrated a vascular structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the location of the parietal pleural, about 8-10 ml of lidocaine will be infiltrated.The&#xD;
      caudal rim of the upper rib will be infiltrated to anaesthetize the intercostal nerve as well&#xD;
      as the periosteum of the rib itself then a further lidocaine depot of about 8-10 ml will be&#xD;
      then injected around the cranial rim of the lower rib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Performance of rigid thoracoscopy will be done using rigid scopes through single-port&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 10-15 mm horizontal incision will be made at the pre-determined point of entry ,&#xD;
           parallel to and in the middle of the selected intercostal spaces&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blunt dissection will be performed through the subcutaneous space, the intercostal&#xD;
           muscles and the parietal pleura using a haemostat .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the parietal pleura is opened, the index finger will be introduced through this&#xD;
           opening to examine the pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trocar is held with its head in the operator's palm and the extended index finger on&#xD;
           its shaft in a position that limited the depth of insertion for safety's sake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The movement of air in and out of the pleural space should be heard during patient's&#xD;
           respiration. Furthermore, pressure equilibrium with the atmosphere is established .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trocar will be removed, leaving the cannula in place then the pleural fluid will be&#xD;
           aspirated by a suction catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rigid scope will be then introduced through the cannula to gain access to the inside&#xD;
           of the pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pleural space will be visualized by the thoracoscope video-transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After removal of the pleural fluid, a systematic exploration of the chest cavity will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of fine adhesions , mechanical separation will be possibly done using the&#xD;
           forceps or the scope itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of vascular adhesions or thick fibrous bands, electrocautery forceps will be&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy techniques: thoracoscopic pleural biopsies are usually taken from the suspected&#xD;
      parietal pleural lesions using the rigid forceps. They are taken against a rib to minimize&#xD;
      the risk of vessel or nerve injury. Those biopsies will be taken using single-port&#xD;
      single-instrument rigid technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two techniques for the rigid forceps will be applied in the current study, first &quot;punch&#xD;
      biopsy&quot; technique and second &quot;strip biopsy&quot; technique where the parietal pleura is grasped&#xD;
      and gently pulled toward the operator then pulled sideways and in shearing motion, a &quot;strip&quot;&#xD;
      of pleura could be isolated. In certain occasions, large &quot;several centimeters long&quot; specimens&#xD;
      may be obtained .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five to ten biopsies of suspicious pleural lesions will be taken. In cases of suspected&#xD;
      malignancy , 10-12 parietal pleural biopsies from different locations will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another biopsy technique will then be applied after subpleural injection of the diluted&#xD;
      mixture of epinephrine and lidocaine 2% using transbronchial needle till subpleural raising&#xD;
      and bleb is formed, then introduction of the cryoprobe (either the flexible or the rigid ) to&#xD;
      be attached to the biopsy site then the operator uses the cryo-machine pedal for delivering&#xD;
      the freezing effect through the cryoprobe for at least (10 - 30) seconds then grasping the&#xD;
      cryoprobe with the attached pleural biopsy will be done, The tissue attached to the tip of&#xD;
      the cryoprobe will be spontaneously thawed in normal saline at room temperature, three to&#xD;
      five biopsies of suspicious pleural lesions were taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No biopsies will be taken from the anterior costoparietal pleura for fear of bleeding&#xD;
      secondary to injury of the internal mammary artery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest tube insertion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chest tube will be connected to a thoracic drainage device. chest x-ray will be then&#xD;
      performed, and the patient will be discharged and scheduled for follow-up. Days till chest&#xD;
      tube removal will be calculated and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. The follow-up of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will be done following the procedure to detect any complications till discharge of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be carried out by chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Grading for Fat cells and crushed cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the measurement of the quantity of fat cells and crushed cells will be done as follows , if&#xD;
      there will be no presence was marked as negative and if less than 5% of the biopsy will be&#xD;
      marked as + and if 5-25% of the biopsy will be marked as ++ and if more than 25% it will take&#xD;
      +++ in both limbs of the cryo and forceps techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Post-procedure complications Post-procedure complications will be recorded with the&#xD;
      followings;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Local site ''wound'' infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pneumothorax/ incomplete lung expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bleeding.&#xD;
