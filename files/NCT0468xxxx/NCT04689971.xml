  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large population-based study has shown that the prevalence of painful diabetic neuropathy&#xD;
      (PDN) is around 21%, and painful symptoms are more prevalent in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, females, and Asians. PDN is characterized by symmetrical lower limb paresthesiae,&#xD;
      dysesthesiae, lancinating pains and allodynia, with nocturnal exacerbation. PDN cause sleep&#xD;
      disturbance and reduce quality of life. The international guidelines advocate a range of&#xD;
      therapies for symptom relief. The therapeutic efficacy for all recommended medications is at&#xD;
      best around 50% pain relief and is limited due to unwanted side effects. Apart from&#xD;
      peripheral and central alterations, metabolic alterations such as increased glycemic influx,&#xD;
      and elevated plasma methylglyoxal levels have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PDN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several treatment options for PN are available, including pharmacological,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological, and alternative options. Patients suffering from severe and disabling&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g. NeP) may require guideline treatments like pregabalin, duloxetine, or&#xD;
      gabapentin initially until the symptoms are under control. These medications can&#xD;
      symptomatically relieve NeP; however, they do not address the underlying cause. Other options&#xD;
      such as neurotropic B vitamins (B1, B6, and B12) do not only target the symptoms, but also&#xD;
      improve nerve health and contribute to nerve regeneration. The B vitamins are commonly used&#xD;
      for PN treatment in clinical practice worldwide, this treatment option is most suitable&#xD;
      before the patient suffers from chronic NeP. However, co-treatment with neurotropic B&#xD;
      vitamins is also appropriate in NeP patients, to ensure the restoration of nerve health.&#xD;

      This was randomized clinical trial, active comparator, open label, controlled study from the&#xD;
      period of November 2020 - November 2021 at Bethesda Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were 60 painful diabetic neuropathy patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Each subject had been followed up from the first day of medication administration&#xD;
      until 8 weeks after medication administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval number ((kosong)) was obtained from Health Research Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      Bethesda Hospital Yogyakarta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Add on oral vitamin B combination (B1, B6, and B12) to standard treatment in patients with&#xD;
      painful diabetic neuropathy is more effective in reducing pain and neuropathic symptoms in 8&#xD;
      weeks of treatment compared with standard treatment, b. Add on oral vitamin B combination&#xD;
      (B1, B6, and B12) to standard treatment in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy is as&#xD;
      safe as standard treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain impact on daily life as measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from its baseline value. Visual analogue scale is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal or vertical line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. The scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100). The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Change in pain impact on daily life as measured by Numeric Pain Scale from its baseline value. Numeric pain scale is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. Higher scores indicating greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Change in pain impact on daily life as measured by Brief Pain Inventory from its baseline value. The Brief Pain Inventory evaluates a patient's pain experience through a number of different scales. There are line drawings of the front and back of a human body on which patients mark the location of their pain. Patients are asked to list the treatments or medications that they are using and how much relief they have provided in the past 24 hours. In addition, patients fill out 11 different numeric rating scale that ask about pain intensity (ranging from 0 to 10) and the effect of the pain on their ability to function during various activities of daily living. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>
