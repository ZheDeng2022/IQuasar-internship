  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different methods of anesthesia for CTR surgery. Procedural sedation will allow&#xD;
      rapid recovery and fewer complications than regional or general anesthesia (GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts have been made in the past to use additives with propofol to reduce its dose.&#xD;
      Ketofol (ketamine/propofol combination) was used for procedural sedation and analgesia.&#xD;
      Ketamine and propofol administered in combination have offered effective sedation for spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia and for gynecologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiovascular procedures in all age&#xD;
      groups. The opposing hemodynamic and respiratory effects of each drug may enhance the utility&#xD;
      of this drug combination, increasing both safety and efficacy and allowing reduction in the&#xD;
      dose of propofol required to achieve sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol alone had a significantly greater number of apnea with desaturation (SpO2 &lt; 90%)&#xD;
      episodes. Further, it has been shown that during colonoscopies, propofol in combination with&#xD;
      fentanyl provided similar patient satisfaction with shorter recovery times even at lower&#xD;
      depths of sedation as compared to propofol. The addition of fentanyl to propofol has been&#xD;
      shown to result in better operator feasibility with no difference in recovery time, cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, or complications as compared to the use of propofol only for sedation.&#xD;

      Sample size: assuming that the sedation using modified Ramasy sedation score was 6±0.01 in&#xD;
      ketofol group versus 5.38±0.87 in fenofol group so the sample will be 56 patients, 28&#xD;
      patients in each group using OPENEPI at power 80 and CI 95 A computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      table divided patients into 2 equal groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group (K) (n=28): patients will receive IV ketofol (0.5 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg&#xD;
           propofol) as bolus injection over 5 minutes in the same syringe then infusion of 0.05&#xD;
           mg/kg/min propofol increased or decreased rate of infusion according to achieve sedation&#xD;
           response by modified Ramasy sedation score of ≤ 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group (F) (n=28): patients will receive IV fenofol (1 µg/kg fentanyl and 1 mg/kg&#xD;
           propofol) as bolus injection over 5 minutes in the same syringe then infusion of 0.05&#xD;
           mg/kg/min propofol increased or decreased rate of infusion according to achieve sedation&#xD;
           response by modified Ramasy sedation score of ≤ 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The depth of sedation will be assessed by modified Ramsay sedation&#xD;
