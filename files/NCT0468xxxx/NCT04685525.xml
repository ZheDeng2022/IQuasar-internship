  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if this specific Mycobiome Supporting Diet (MSD&#xD;
      diet) can help reduce gut inflammation during post-transplant period. The MSD is an special&#xD;
      diet which will be explained in detail by a dietician that works by supporting the body's&#xD;
      good gut bacteria and fungi.&#xD;

      This is a non-randomized cohort study. Participants will be on a specific diet for 4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to transplant and 10 days after transplant, and will then be asked to fill out several&#xD;
      questionnaires during this period to see if this diet is easy and simple to follow. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be weekly while participants are outpatient and once admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital, participants will need to fill it on the last day (10 days after stem cell&#xD;
      infusion). Participants will also be requested to provide fecal swab samples which we will&#xD;
      test for bacteria and fungi. A total of 3 samples will be taken at different time points&#xD;
      during this study.&#xD;

    <description>MSD adherence feasibility measured by percent of participants with at least 2 out of 3 assessments marked &quot;more than half the time&quot; on compliance questionnaire. The questionnaire includes a multiple choice questions about adherence to diet (4 levels, from 'not at all' to 'the whole time'), a multiple choice question identifying barriers to adherence, and 8 yes/no questions about medication use and symptom experience. The MSD diet will deem feasible if at least 80 percent of participants showed adherence defined by 2 out of 3 assessment marked &quot;more than half the time&quot;.</description>
