      This proposed pilot study will assess if the Patch Technology system will increase adherence&#xD;
      in patients with cystic fibrosis followed at the UTHSCSA Cystic Fibrosis Center.&#xD;

      This trial will follow patients' adherence with their current medication regimen and will not&#xD;
      impact the medications they are prescribed. Patients will be enrolled during a regularly&#xD;
      scheduled Cystic Fibrosis Clinic visit. When participants receive their reminder calls for&#xD;
      the clinic visit, they will be asked to bring their prescribed vitamins in the pharmacy&#xD;
      dispensed bottle with them. During the clinic visit, the study will be reviewed, and consent&#xD;
      will be obtained. After enrollment, patients will complete a survey indicating their&#xD;
      understanding of the reason for taking vitamins/genetic modulators, the importance they place&#xD;
      on taking the medications, self-reported adherence to the therapies, and reasons for being&#xD;
      non-adherent. Participants will indicate which pharmacies they receive the vitamins and&#xD;
      modulators from, and how they obtain the refills (E.g., Does the patient call for refills?&#xD;
      Does the pharmacy send a reminder text/email/phone call or are medications auto refilled?)&#xD;
      During the first visit, directions on how to download the Patch App and scan the QRS code&#xD;
      will be sent to the subject/parent. Subjects/parents will enter their recommended dose of&#xD;
      Trikafta and vitamin in the Patch App. Patients will be taught how to place the Patch Cap in&#xD;
      the lid of their vitamin bottle. They will be given the option of entering data for a &quot;buddy&quot;&#xD;
      who will also get a reminder when they are due to take their medications if medications are&#xD;
      not documented as taken in a specified time window. Data which will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      are age (&lt; 18 years of age, &gt; 18 years of age), gender, insurance status, Education level&#xD;
      (parent education level if patient &lt; 18 years of age), marital status if patient &gt; 18 years&#xD;
      of age, weight/BMI/FEV1 at enrollment, concomitant medications, and vitamin A and E levels&#xD;
      measured within the previous year. Once the patient is enrolled, the study team will contact&#xD;
      the pharmacies from which the patient gets the vitamins and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor&#xD;
      and will review the refill history over the past 6 months. The study staff will calculate the&#xD;
      Medication Possession Ration (MPR) equal to the number of pills the patient would have based&#xD;
      on their refill history/number of pills needed to take medication as prescribed. Over the&#xD;
      next 3 months, patients will take their medications and this activity will either be logged&#xD;
      via the Patch Cap electronically to the Patch App or the patient will enter the data every&#xD;
      time they take the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on the Patch App. This information will&#xD;
      simultaneously be tracked in the Patch Hub by Patch Technologies personnel. At the end of&#xD;
      three months, patients will return to clinic for their routine quarterly visit. Patients will&#xD;
      be surveyed about ease of use of the Patch Cap and the PatchRx App, as well as estimating&#xD;
      their adherence. The study team will obtain the refill history for vitamins and&#xD;
      elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor for the previous 3 months as reported by the pharmacy and&#xD;
      calculate the MPR. Patch Technologies will provide adherence data collected through the Patch&#xD;
      App to the PI at the end of the study.&#xD;
