      To evaluate the feasibility of subantimicrobial -dose (SD) doxycycline to improve outcomes of&#xD;
      nonsurgical management of lateral elbow tendinopathy via matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#xD;
      inhibition as well as evaluate if participants will be compliant to with prescribed&#xD;
      medication and exercise treatment. Our working hypothesis is that patients with lateral elbow&#xD;
      tendinopathy will be receptive to treatment with SD-doxycycline and compliant with the&#xD;
      prescribed treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      : Lateral elbow tendinopathy is a common condition among athletes and the general population.&#xD;
      It can result in significant disability and time loss from work. Despite traditional&#xD;
      nonsurgical treatment, symptoms often persist for more than 6 months. Second-line treatments,&#xD;
      such as platelet rich plasma injections and extracorporeal shock wave therapy, have limited&#xD;
      evidence and are often cost-prohibitive. There remains a need for additional cost-effective&#xD;
      nonsurgical treatment for lateral elbow tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of subantimicrobial -dose (SD) doxycycline to improve&#xD;
      outcomes of nonsurgical management of lateral elbow tendinopathy via matrix metalloproteinase&#xD;
      (MMP) inhibition as well as evaluate if participants will be compliant to with prescribed&#xD;
      medication and exercise treatment. Our working hypothesis is that patients with lateral elbow&#xD;
      tendinopathy will be receptive to treatment with SD-doxycycline and compliant with the&#xD;
      prescribed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will enroll 25 otherwise healthy males and females ages 18-60 with ≥ 6&#xD;
      weeks of symptomatic lateral elbow tendinopathy. Subjects will receive doxycycline 20 mg BID&#xD;
      (twice a day) for 12 weeks. Usual care will also be provided with a home exercise program and&#xD;
      a counterforce brace. The proportion of eligible patients who elect to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be tracked as a measure of receptiveness. Biweekly logs will be collected to&#xD;
      monitor for treatment side effects and track compliance. Patient reported outcomes will&#xD;
      include quick Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand score (qDASH) and Patient-Rated&#xD;
      Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Ultrasound tendinopathy&#xD;
      grade and grip strength will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks. Blood will be drawn to&#xD;
      assess MMP activity and collagen production/connective tissue anabolism at baseline and 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study will provide the necessary data to design a phase two-a trial of a&#xD;
      safe, low-cost adjuvant treatment for a common condition treated by sports medicine and&#xD;
      primary care physicians. If found to be beneficial for lateral elbow tendinopathy,&#xD;
      SD-doxycycline may have utility in other types of tendinopathy as well.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The plan for achieving the specific aims is to first assess patient receptiveness by screening patients with symptomatic lateral elbow tendinopathy for eligibility and tracking the proportion of eligible patients who decline participation in the study due to not wanting to take an extended course of SD-doxycycline. 25 subjects will given SD-doxycycline and have the tendinopathy grade measured by ultrasound. The medication will be prescribed for 12 weeks during which time logs will be used to track compliance and monitor side effects. This will be done in combination with usual care, which includes a home exercise program, a counterforce brace, and over-the-counter pain medication to use as needed. Clinical effectiveness outcomes will include patient reported outcomes, ultrasound tendinopathy grade, grip strength, and markers of MMP activity and collagen production/connective tissue anabolism.</intervention_model_description>
