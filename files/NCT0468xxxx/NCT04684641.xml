  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study with primary objective of looking whether YPT-01 phage therapy&#xD;
      reduces sputum bacterial load in cystic fibrosis subjects with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, study evaluates the safety profile of phage therapy in this patient population.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-site study of&#xD;
      Yale Phage Therapy (YPT) 01 in cystic fibrosis subjects with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa&#xD;
      airway infections. The study has 2 parallel arms of phage therapy and placebo, with all study&#xD;
      materials GMP-manufactured. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of inhaled (nebulized) phage therapy YPT-01. Clinically stable subjects who have confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of CF with PsA in sputum cultures on at least two occasions within past year, and&#xD;
      in sputum at screening visit, will be recruited into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open-label extension is available for subjects in the placebo group to receive YPT-01&#xD;
      following completion of blinded portion of the study.&#xD;
