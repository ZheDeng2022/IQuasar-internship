      evaluate preventive and therapeutic effects of Rebamipide gargle on reducing incidence of&#xD;
      oral mucositis in comparison with benzydamine HCL mouthwash.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is a common and potentially dangerous complication of anticancer treatment.&#xD;
      Inflammation and ulcerations of the oral mucosa make swallowing and, thereby, eating and&#xD;
      drinking, difficult or even impossible, leading to anorexia and weight loss(Araújo et al.,&#xD;
      2018) .There is a serious risk of infections and even sepsis, particularly in&#xD;
      immune-ompromised patients. OM is associated with severe pain, affects the quality of life,&#xD;
      and often requires reduction or suspension of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, thereby&#xD;
      decreasing the relative dose intensity, which may worsen prognosis (Shumsky et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzydamine hydrochloride is a widely used drug in dentistry , a non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug, has shown topical anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anaesthetic and&#xD;
      antimicrobial effects and is used to attenuate inflammatory conditions like radiation&#xD;
      -induced oral mucositis or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (Nithin, et al.,2018). In&#xD;
      addition to this, Benzydamine HCL is available on the Egyptian market and its price is&#xD;
      economical .Rebamipide is a drug used for the treatment of gastritis and gastric ulcer. The&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the anti-ulcer and cytoprotective effects of rebamipide have been&#xD;
      reported to include an effect on prostaglandin E2 synthesis via COX-2 expression (Udagawaet&#xD;
      al ., 2003), up-regulation of growth factors and their receptors such as EGF and HGF&#xD;
      ,induction of mucus secretion ,anti-free radical effects and inhibition of the production of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-α (Yasuda et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different treatment options and drugs have been tested in OM, only some of which exhibited&#xD;
      clinical relevance such as oral cryotherapy, keratinocyte growth factor and amino acids&#xD;
      enriched diets. Therefore, there is a clear requirement for new approaches to the prevention&#xD;
      and effective treatment of OM (Mallick, Benson, &amp; Rath, 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019 a meta-analysis performed by Akagi and his colleagues (Akagi et al., 2019) showed&#xD;
      that gargling treatment with Rebamipide is superior to placebo for the development of&#xD;
      mucositis and stomatitis due to chemo-radio-therapy, especially for severe cases of Grade 3&#xD;
      or higher. However, in order to confirm these trials, further well-designed analyses are&#xD;
      needed, and evaluation of adverse events in observational studies are also required.&#xD;
