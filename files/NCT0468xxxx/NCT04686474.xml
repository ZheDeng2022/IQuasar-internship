    <textblock>
      Prepare an ointment from Azadirachta indica leaves extract and its apply on palmer arsenical&#xD;
      keratosis patient, for 12 weeks. After intervention, effect of the ointment will be observed&#xD;
      by measuring the nodule (before and after apply the ointment)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Arsenicosis or arsenic toxicity caused by prolong ingestion of contaminated groundwater by&#xD;
      inorganic arsenic (more than 0.05 mg/liter). It is the severest natural calamity widespread&#xD;
      specially in Bangladesh where 61 districts out of 64 are affected. The commonest and earliest&#xD;
      feature of arsenicosis is skin involvement like keratosis, melanosis and skin carcinoma.&#xD;
      Keratosis of the palm and soles reduce the working ability of the patient's and affect their&#xD;
      socio-economic condition. There is no specific treatment for keratosis. Short-term&#xD;
      improvement may occur by using some topical keratolytic like salicylic acid, propylene&#xD;
      glycol, eating some dietary supplementation like vitamin A, C, E, zinc, folic acid and&#xD;
      foodstuffs like corn, spinach but symptoms recure after stoppage of these treatments. Also,&#xD;
      these treatments require longer duration which ultimately affects patient adherence.&#xD;
      Azadirachta indica leaves contain flavonoids, quercetin, azadirachtin, nimbin, steroids,&#xD;
      alkaloids, phenolic compounds and other biologically active compounds that have&#xD;
      anti-proliferative, anticarcinogenic, antioxidative and immunostimulant effects. For this&#xD;
      reason, a study named &quot;Effect of ethanol extract of leaves of Azadirachta indica on palmer&#xD;
      arsenical keratosis: A single-blind trial&quot; was done in the Department of Pharmacology,&#xD;
      Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, which was found effective . So, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the identified compound on moderate to severe&#xD;
      arsenical keratosis which will be isolated from A. indica leaves extract. After IRB&#xD;
      clearance, 35 patients with moderate to severe arsenical keratosis will be collected based on&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria from the arsenic affected area, located at Kamalla Union of&#xD;
      Muradnagar Upazilla, Comilla. The study will be quasi-experimental study. Included patients&#xD;
      will be informed about the purpose of this study, as well as harmful and beneficial effects.&#xD;
      Informed written consent, detail history, clinical examination, photographs of the palm and&#xD;
      sole and nail samples will be collected before starting recruitment to confirm arsenicosis.&#xD;
      For identification of isolated compounds present in the A. indica leaves, thin layer&#xD;
      chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectrometry will be done. Cytotoxic&#xD;
      effects of the A. indica leaves extract will be assessed by using brine shrimp bioassay. The&#xD;
      ointment will be prepared from A. indica leaves extract and supplied to the patient at an&#xD;
      interval of 2 weeks. Each patient will be advised to apply the ointment, with a clean&#xD;
      fingertip by rubbing gently in the morning and night for 12 weeks. Regular monitoring will be&#xD;
      done through phone calls and during a follow-up visit at the field level, about improvement&#xD;
      and side effects of the ointment. Clinical improvement will be assessed by measuring the&#xD;
      keratotic nodular size with the help of slide calipers. Statistical analysis will be done by&#xD;
      paired t-test.&#xD;
