  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centers, single-arm, open label, Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of CD7 CAR T cells in subjects with relapsed or refractory T-cell&#xD;
      leukemia/lymphoma. Fifty subjects will be enrolled. CD7 CAR T cells will be given once&#xD;
      intravenously at one dose (1×106, with an allowance of ± 20%) in patients received previous&#xD;
      HSCT donor-derived CAR T cells. Patients who received fresh donor derived CD7 CAR T cells&#xD;
      were given initial dose of 1×106, with an allowance of ± 20%. The dose levels may be adjusted&#xD;
      during the study based on the specific number of cells on the day of fresh CAR T cells&#xD;
      infusion, due to at this time all the patients have completed lymphodepleting, so we adopt&#xD;
      the allowance of ±20% for each group of absolute infusion cells. And patients who were lower&#xD;
      than the designed dose group were also given infusion, but they will be either assigned to&#xD;
      the lower dose group or exclude from safety analysis.&#xD;
