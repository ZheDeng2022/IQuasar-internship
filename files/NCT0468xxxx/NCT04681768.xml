  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. 20-30 % of all breast cancer&#xD;
      patients are faced with advanced disease, comprising both locally advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      (LABC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). 80% of MBC cases are diagnosed as hormone receptor&#xD;
      (HR) positive disease. The main systemic treatment options for these women include endocrine&#xD;
      therapy (ET). The need of over-coming de novo or acquired resistance to ET in metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer has led to the integration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into combined ET of MBC.&#xD;
      Abemaciclib represents a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 which has&#xD;
      been granted approval by the European Medical Association (EMA). In two phase III trials&#xD;
      Abemaciclib has been shown to double treatment efficacy in terms of PFS prolongation, to&#xD;
      improve ORR and to prolong overall survival. At the same time, it has been shown that side&#xD;
      effects of the drug are well manageable and QoL of patients under Abemaciclib is maintained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Against the above discussed background there is a clear rationale to further collect real&#xD;
      world data confirming that the use of endocrine based therapy in metastatic breast cancer is&#xD;
      beneficial for the patient cohort with symptomatic visceral metastases and high tumor burden.&#xD;
      Data recently presented, showed that Abemaciclib in combination with Letrozole leads to&#xD;
      substantial reduction in tumor size after only two cycles of therapy. Since Abemaciclib is&#xD;
      the only CDK4/6-inhibitor that can be given &quot;steady state&quot; without a &quot;one-week-off&quot;-period&#xD;
      and since there has been beginning evidence that Abemaciclib is penetrating the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier in patients with brain metastases, it seems reasonable to choose Abemaciclib in&#xD;
      combination with endocrine therapy for an observational study whose objective will be to&#xD;
      collect efficacy data within clinical routine on Abemaciclib in combination with endocrine&#xD;
      therapy within a cohort of ERpos/HER2neg breast cancer patients with symptomatic visceral&#xD;
      metastases or high tumor burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDH-levels above 400 U/l as well as abnormal levels of breast cancer specific tumor markers&#xD;
      CA 15-3 and CEA have been proven to correlate with disease extent in metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      and thus can be used to identify metastatic breast cancer patients with high tumor burden.&#xD;
      Recently it could be shown that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) bares greater correlation with&#xD;
      changes in tumor burden than CA 15-3 and can provide the earliest measure of treatment&#xD;
      response in women with metastatic breast cancer. This warrants further research to evaluate&#xD;
      ctDNA as a tool for measuring early tumor response in MBC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational research part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the era of personalized cancer therapy, testing for genetic alterations has become an&#xD;
      essential tool in clinical practice. It allows clinicians to identify patients who are most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from molecularly targeted treatments. Currently, evaluation of response to&#xD;
      targeted drugs is largely based on imaging (CT or MRT), an approach unable to reveal&#xD;
      mechanistic details on individual treatment effects. Sequential biopsies of tumors and their&#xD;
      molecular analysis could yield additional information, but repetitive sampling of tissue that&#xD;
      is representative and adequate in quantity and quality is rarely feasible, especially in the&#xD;
      metastatic disease setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid biopsies (LBs) represent a minimally-invasive alternative of great potential in this&#xD;
      setting. Although recent technical advances allow very sensitive detection of LB-based tumor&#xD;
      biomarkers, only few LB assays have yet entered into clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood plasma samples from patients treated with Abemaciclib will be analyzed to identify&#xD;
      predictive cell-free (cf) DNA-based biomarkers as indicators for treatment efficacy and early&#xD;
      detection of resistance. To this end, cfDNA will be screened for mutations using a targeted&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing panel (AVENIO ctDNA Expanded Kit, Roche). This panel is covering a&#xD;
      total of 192 kb and consists of 77 genes, including those currently in the US National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines as well as emerging biomarkers currently being&#xD;
      investigated in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each plasma sample, concentration of cfDNA as well as presence and allelic frequencies of&#xD;
      tumor mutations will be measured. Additionally, associations with progression-free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival will be evaluated using Cox regression models. Clinical variables will&#xD;
      be used as covariates in multivariable regression models to evaluate the independence of the&#xD;
      LB-based biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the investigators hope to identify minimally invasive LB-based biomarkers for&#xD;
      serial monitoring of metastatic breast cancer patients. These biomarkers could add to the&#xD;
      prediction of therapy response as well as the early detection of therapy resistance towards&#xD;
      endocrine therapy and Abemaciclib.&#xD;
