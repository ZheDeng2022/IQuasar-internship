  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the most common neurological disease leaving one third dead and one third with&#xD;
      permanent impairment despite best medical treatment. The aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      investigate why patients differ in how they benefit from neurorehabilitation by collecting&#xD;
      clinical, electrophysiological, imaging and laboratory data in the acute phase of stroke as&#xD;
      well as later on during rehabilitation and after 90 days. Following a closed-loop approach&#xD;
      the data is analyzed by a machine learning algorithm to create a personalized&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation strategy.&#xD;

      Clinical tests: Each subject will be assessed using the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS): The NIHSS is part of the usual highly&#xD;
      standardized stroke workup. It consists of 15 items which can be scored with 0 to 4 points&#xD;
      maximum. It is used to measure stroke severity as well as impairment and to detect&#xD;
      improvement or deterioration of the patient. A high score corresponds to a severe stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMA for UE and sensory system: The FMA for the UE and the sensory system describes the&#xD;
      sensory-motor impairment of the arm after stroke. It consists of 66 items for the motor&#xD;
      function of the UE and 24 items for the sensory function scored from 0 to 2. A high score&#xD;
      corresponds to high function. It is not part of the usual stroke workup. The change of the&#xD;
      FMA for UE after 90 days compared to the first score obtained on the stroke unit during the&#xD;
      acute phase of the stroke event will serve as the primary endpoint of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder abduction finger extension (SAFE) score: To calculate the SAFE score shoulder&#xD;
      abduction and finger extension is measured using the classification of the British Medical&#xD;
      Research Council (MRC). The MRC scale scores muscle strength from 0 (no movement) to 5&#xD;
      (normal power). The scores are added up producing a value from 0 to 10. A score of 5 or more&#xD;
      predicts a good or excellent outcome after stroke affecting the UE. It is not part of the&#xD;
      usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grip strength: The grip strength can be quantified using a dynamometer. The best out of three&#xD;
      trials counts. It is not part of the usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bells test: The Bells test assesses neglect by requesting the subjects to cross all the bells&#xD;
      (n = 35) which are mixed with distractors. Missing 5 bells counts as evidence for neglect. It&#xD;
      is not part of the usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aphasie-Schnelltest (AST): The AST is a short test for patients with acute aphasia scored&#xD;
      from 0 to 31 and inspecting comprehension, talking, reading, and writing. A low score&#xD;
      reflects severe aphasia. It is not part of the usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mRS: The mRS is a widely used test to determine impairment and dependency after stroke on a&#xD;
      scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) over 1 (symptoms but no disability), 2 (slight&#xD;
      disability), 3 (requires help, but can walk without assistance), 4 (cannot walk without&#xD;
      assistance), 5 (bedridden, severe disability, requires constant nursing) to 6 (death). It is&#xD;
      part of the usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barthel Index (BI): Like the mRS the BI is part of the usual stroke workup. It measures&#xD;
      abilities of daily living. The items can be scored from 0 to 15 points maximum, adding up to&#xD;
      0 to 100 points. A high score reflects high independency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action Research Arm Test (ARAT): The ARAT assesses the range of activity of the UE after&#xD;
      stroke. It consists of the subscales grasp, grip, pinch and gross movements which are scored&#xD;
      from 0 (no movement) over 1 (movement only partially possible), 2 (movement possible but only&#xD;
      with great difficulty or needing much time) to 3 (normal movement), adding up to 57 points&#xD;
      maximum. A score with less than 10 points reflects severe impairment. It is not part of the&#xD;
      usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke Specific Quality Of Life scale (SS-QOL): The SS-QOL measures health related quality of&#xD;
      life. It consists of 49 items which are scored from 1 to 5, adding up to 29-245 points. A&#xD;
      high score reflects high quality of life. It is not part of the usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI): The BDI is a depression screening tool consisting of 21&#xD;
      items which are scored from 0 to 3, adding up to 0 to 63 points. A high score reflects high&#xD;
      possibility of depression, the threshold for a diagnosis of depression is 10. It is not part&#xD;
      of the usual stroke workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the clinical tests described above clinical data (e. g. vital parameters,&#xD;
      medication etc.) will be collected. In the Universitätsklinikum Tübingen (UKT) this data will&#xD;
      be retrieved automatically from the clinic system. In the rehabilitation facilities number&#xD;
      and duration of therapies as well as independent training of the patient will be documented&#xD;
      and classified according to the type of neurorehabilitative training (e. g., with or without&#xD;
      equipment). In addition, therapy-influencing co-factors like support by relatives are&#xD;
      registered using a questionnaire with a scale from 0-3 (never/very poor to daily/very good).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory workup: Routine laboratory workup as part of the usual stroke workup will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging: For each subject neuroimaging is acquired. If possible and meaningful, MRI is&#xD;
      conducted including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), fluid attenuated inversion recovery&#xD;
      (FLAIR) and a Magnetic Prepared-Rapid Gradient Echo (MP-Rage) sequence. The first two&#xD;
      sequences are part of the usual stroke workup, the MP-RAGE sequence is added to obtain a 3D&#xD;
      anatomical data set for exact assessment of the localization and volume estimation of the&#xD;
      stroke lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI images will be acquired at a 1,5 or 3 Tesla MRI scanner in the neuroradiological&#xD;
      department of the UKT. The patient is placed in the scanner with earplugs and an emergency&#xD;
      ball. Visual and verbal contact to the patient is maintained from the control room. Before&#xD;
      scanning, patients are always evaluated by a medical doctor for MRI contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an MRI is neither meaningful nor available or there are contraindications, a cranial&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) in the neuroradiological department will be performed. CTs are part&#xD;
      of the usual stroke work-up, there will be no additional scanning apart from what is&#xD;
      clinically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI (fMRI): fMRI measures the blood-oxygenation-level dependent effect e. g.&#xD;
      corresponding to specific task like moving the hand (task-related fMRI). Resting-state MRI&#xD;
      determines functional brain networks of synchronized neural activity while the subject is&#xD;
      resting (i.e. not performing a task). Resting-state fMRI and task-related fMRI will provide&#xD;
      information about functional and effective connectivity, respectively. fMRI is not part of&#xD;
      the usual stroke workup and requires additional scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fMRI images will be acquired at a Siemens 3 Tesla MRI scanner in the MRI Research Center&#xD;
      of Tübingen (Department Biomedizinische Magnetresonanz, Prof. Dr. phil. nat. Dipl.-Phys.&#xD;
      Klaus Scheffler, Hoppe-Seyler-Str. 3, 72076 Tübingen). The patient is placed in the scanner&#xD;
      with earplugs and an emergency ball. Visual and verbal contact to the patient is maintained&#xD;
      from the control room. No drugs or contrast agents are used during fMRI examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the task-related fMRI the patient will be asked to perform stereotypical whole-hand fist&#xD;
      closings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated by a medical doctor for MRI contra-indications and need to give&#xD;
      written informed consent before the scan. The investigators do not consider dental retainer&#xD;
      wires over four teeth at most a contraindication. However, subjects will be informed&#xD;
      additionally about current scientific consent and instructed to press the emergency ball in&#xD;
      the unexpected case of heating of the retainer wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG: Resting-state EEG will be obtained using a 21-channel or 64-channel gel filled sintered&#xD;
      ring electrode EEG cap (EasyCap, Munich, Germany) using the same optically isolated amplifier&#xD;
      as described above (MEGA NeurOne Tesla, Kuopio, Finland). EEG will be recorded with eyes&#xD;
      closed and eyes open for three minutes each in the same session in which the TEP and MEPs&#xD;
      (described below) are acquired. EEG will always be performed before TMS (needed for TEPs and&#xD;
      MEPs). If epileptic potentials are detected in EEG indicating an increased risk of seizure in&#xD;
      the patient, TMS will not be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrooculography (EOG): Eye movements will be recorded from additional bipolar channels&#xD;
      using the same optically isolated amplifier as for electromyography (EMG) and EEG recordings&#xD;
      (MEGA NeurOne Tesla, see above). The EOG data will be used to aid EEG artefact rejection from&#xD;
      eye movements and as a behavioral readout in saccade and decision tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS: TMS is a technique which evokes action potentials in cortex with a spatiotemporal&#xD;
      precision of millimeters and milliseconds. Conventional TMS stimulators (Mag &amp; More, Munich,&#xD;
      Germany, Research 100; Magstim 200 als BiStim bzw. 1-4 Quadripulse Option; Magstim Super&#xD;
      Rapid Plus) and EEG compatible coils will be used. Experiments will be MRI-guided, using a&#xD;
      TMS navigator system (Localite GmbH) to map the exact individual stimulation sites. Subjects&#xD;
      will be seated on a comfortable reclining chair with both arms relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG/MEP: Surface EMG will be obtained through an optically isolated battery powered biosignal&#xD;
      amplifier (MEGA NeurOne Tesla, see above) using bipolar electrodes from hand muscles (first&#xD;
      dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis extensor capri radialis muscles). MEPs are&#xD;
      executed with pre-innervation of the target muscle or - if not possible - the contralateral&#xD;
      side and maximum stimulator output (if required) to determine if the patient is MEP- or MEP+&#xD;
      (at least 50 μV peak-to-peak amplitude in the target muscle in at least 5 out of 10&#xD;
      consecutive trials). In case of MEP-, a paired-pulse protocol is conducted, which increases&#xD;
      the probability to evoke a MEP and consecutively re-classify the subject as MEP+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG/TEP: TEPs will be recorded with a TMS-compatible gel filled sintered ring electrode EEG&#xD;
      cap with at least 64 channels (EasyCap, Munich, Germany) using the same optically isolated&#xD;
      amplifier as described above (MEGA NeurOne Tesla, see above). During the EEG recordings at&#xD;
      least 100 trials of single TMS pulses are applied to the motor hotspot of the ipsilesional M1&#xD;
      with a randomly jittered inter-trial interval of 7-8.0 s with 80% resting motor threshold&#xD;
      (RMT). RMT is defined as stimulus intensity needed to evoke MEPs of 50 μV peak-to-peak&#xD;
      amplitude in the target muscle in at least 5 out of 10 consecutive trials and will be&#xD;
      determined for ipsilesional and contralesional M1. If no MEPs are detectable from the&#xD;
      ipsilesional M1, the investigators will use the contralesional M1 for determining RMT and&#xD;
      stimulator output and anatomical landmarks like the hand knob for locating the hotspot. To&#xD;
      avoid auditory evoked potentials from the clicking noise of the coil patients will wear&#xD;
      earplugs. Bone conductions is prevented by placing a thin layer of plastic film between the&#xD;
      TMS coil and the EEG cap.&#xD;

        We aim to include all patients with acute stroke affecting the UE (FMA less than 50) on our&#xD;
        SU. Other symptoms like aphasia or neglect are no reason for exclusion since we intend to&#xD;
        include as many patients as possible to capture the whole spectrum of stroke from mild to&#xD;
        severe. Especially the last case, the inclusion of severely affected patients, is of utmost&#xD;
        importance in our view. Due to their grave impairments they have the greatest need for&#xD;
        neurorehabilitation; at the same time, this group of patients is the most vulnerable&#xD;
        because of their preexisting comorbidities and conditions coming with immobility e. g.&#xD;
        pneumonia. A personalized treatment would meet their need for intense rehabilitation while&#xD;
        providing enough recreation time since unnecessary, ineffective rehabilitation could be&#xD;
        omitted.&#xD;
