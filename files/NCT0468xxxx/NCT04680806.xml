      This randomized clinical trial evaluated the recurrence rates of physiological gingival&#xD;
      pigments during 24 months follow-up and the patient perceptions after the ablative&#xD;
      depigmentation using two laser wavelengths; Diode 940 nm and Er,Cr:YSGG 2780 nm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aim to compare the clinical outcomes, the rate of repigmentation, and the patient&#xD;
      perceptions after laser-assisted gingival depigmentation with diode 940 nm and Erbium,&#xD;
      chromium-doped yttrium, scandium, gallium and garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) 2780 nm. Two pigmentation&#xD;
      index were used to compare between the treatment outcomes of using Diode laser or Er,Cr:YSGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The depigmentation procedure essentially involves ablation of epithelial layer of buccal&#xD;
      gingiva containing melanin pigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty healthy patients (22 males and 38 females, aged 21 to 43 years) who presented with a&#xD;
      chief complaint of having dark-brown to black gingival hyperpigmentation between April 2015&#xD;
      and September 2018. Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups (30 patients each).&#xD;
      Randomization was carried out using randomization table; by a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization list (SPSS v23.0) with allocation ratio 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients were selected according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection was done by a dental specialist who was blinded about the provided treatment.&#xD;
      Data collections included the clinical examination at baseline and follow up appointments. To&#xD;
      achieve blinding, three calibrated external experts, blinded to the provided treatment&#xD;
      classified the degree of gingival pigments and gingival topography according oral&#xD;
      pigmentation index (DOPI) and melanin pigmentation index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The periodontal surgery was performed by a periodontist specialised in laser dentistry. The&#xD;
      periodontist did not interfere with the treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics and statistical analysis was done by an external expert using SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics software(SPSS v23.0) . Nonparametric tests, Kruskal-Wallis test was used to&#xD;
      compare between the two groups according the time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who did not show in all the study follow up's appointments were dropped from the&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were asked to evaluate the procedure by using a self-administered questionnaire. The&#xD;
      patients were recalled after 1 week, 1 month, 12 months and 24 months.&#xD;

The procedure was performed completely without anesthesia with the laser tip at angulation ~30° and distance of ~1 mm from the gingival tissue. The laser tip was advancing in scanning movement from in the cervical-apical direction in all pigmented areas. The following settings was used to achieve hemostasis in case of the bleeding was present (tip 600 μm, 30 millijoule /pulse, average power 1.5 W, frequency 50 Hz, pulse duration 700 µs, energy density 28.7 J/cm2, water 10%, and air 20%).</description>
