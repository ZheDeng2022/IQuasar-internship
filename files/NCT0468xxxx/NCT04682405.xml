    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that prophylactic E-selectin inhibition via administration of&#xD;
      uproleselan during melphalan conditioning will reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM) patients undergoing auto-transplant, as assessed via diarrhea severity&#xD;
      scoring per CTCAE v5.0, while potentially increasing chemosensitivity of malignant MM cells&#xD;
      to high-dose melphalan.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of uproleselan (GMI-1271) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, prior sterilization&#xD;
             procedure, abstinence, etc.) prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation and for 12 weeks after the completion of the study. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Should a man who is participating in the&#xD;
             study become aware that he has impregnated a partner, he must inform his treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A history of other malignancy with the exception of malignancies for which all&#xD;
             treatment was completed at least 2 years before registration and the patient has no&#xD;
             evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active signs or symptoms of CNS involvement by malignancy (lumbar puncture not&#xD;
             required). Prior history of CNS involvement is acceptable, if patient has completed&#xD;
             treatment for CNS involvement with documented treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to uproleselan (GMI-1271)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to uproleselan or melphalan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active infection with hepatitis A, B (e.g., HBsAg positive), or C (e.g.,&#xD;
             anti-HCV positive), or human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled acute life-threatening bacterial, viral, or fungal infection-Myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within 6 months of uproleselan/placebo dosing, or subject has current&#xD;
             significant cardiovascular disease, such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, hemodynamic instability, or any Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease&#xD;
             as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical, psychiatric, or other condition which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, unfavorably alters the risk-benefit of subject participation, is likely&#xD;
             to interfere with trial completion, assessments, or interpretation of trial results,&#xD;
             or otherwise would make the subject an inappropriate subject for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective contraception during the&#xD;
             trial and for 12 weeks following the last dose of uproleselan/placebo. Women who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to trial entry and follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status (&gt;28U/L)&#xD;
             will be considered NOT of childbearing potential. Highly effective contraception&#xD;
             includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence with a male partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before uproleselan/placebo. In&#xD;
                  case of oophorectomy alone, the subject would be eligible only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to Screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the trial, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BOTH of the following forms of contraception consistently used together:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Injected, transdermal, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or&#xD;
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure&#xD;
                       rate &lt;1%) with the exception of intrauterine devices, which are excluded due&#xD;
                       to the risk of infection and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with or without spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Men who are sexually active and not willing to use condoms during the trial&#xD;
                       and for 12 weeks following the last dose of uproleselan/placebo, unless they&#xD;
                       have undergone vasectomy for sterilization (at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
                       Screening), are excluded from trial participation.&#xD;
