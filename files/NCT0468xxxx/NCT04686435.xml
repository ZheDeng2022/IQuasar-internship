      In a longitudinal cohort project, the objective is to evaluate general prognostic and&#xD;
      individual risk factors for long lasting shoulder pain, with a specific focus on evaluation&#xD;
      of the association between metabolic syndrome and tendinopathy, while simultaneous adjusting&#xD;
      for other potential prognostic candidate variables (PROGRESS Theme I-II).&#xD;

      The VHS Cohort is a prospective cohort trial evaluating a wide range of patient reported and&#xD;
      clinical prognostic factors, attained prior to initiation of treatment, among shoulder&#xD;
      patients referred for diagnostic evaluation at the specialized shoulder unit at Vejle&#xD;
      Hospital, Denmark. The department receives approximately 2000 new patients each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to medical examination, patients will be asked to fill in a baseline questionnaire, and&#xD;
      from the electronic patient record, a range of different clinical factors will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, patients will be asked to answer questionnaires on patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Five years after inclusion into the trial, work affiliation&#xD;
      will be retrieved from registries in order to evaluate association between shoulder disorders&#xD;
      and work affiliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the VHS Cohort Project is to evaluate general prognostic and individual risk&#xD;
      factors for long lasting shoulder pain. A specific focus is evaluation of the association&#xD;
      between metabolic syndrome and rotator cuff tendinopathy while simultaneously adjusting for&#xD;
      other potential prognostic candidate variables (PROGRESS Theme I-II). In a subsequent cohort&#xD;
      (VHS Cohort Project II), the objective will be to develop a prognostic model for the&#xD;
      treatment effect of Rotator Cuff Related Shoulder Pain (RCRSP) (PROGRESS Theme III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VHS Cohort Project I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the risk of consistent pain one year after diagnosis among patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with: RCRSP; Rotator cuff lesions (conservatively treated); Acromioclavicular osteoarthritis&#xD;
      and Adhesive capsulitis (PROGRESS Theme I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the risk of consistent pain one year after surgery for: subacromial&#xD;
      Decompression OR Rotator Cuff lesion (PROGRESS Theme I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the risk of consistent pain one year after diagnosis in patients with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome compared to patients without metabolic syndrome, with particular emphasis&#xD;
      on patients diagnosed with RCRSP while simultaneously adjusting for other potential&#xD;
      prognostic candidate variables (PROGRESS Theme II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significantly more patients with RCRSP have metabolic syndrome than patients diagnosed&#xD;
           with other shoulder-specific diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significantly more patients with metabolic syndrome and diagnosed with RCRSP are&#xD;
           classified as non-responders to treatment than patients with other shoulder specific&#xD;
           diagnoses 52 weeks after initial medical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significantly more shoulder patients with metabolic syndrome report multiple&#xD;
           musculoskeletal pain sites than shoulder patients without metabolic syndrome at first&#xD;
           medical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: From clinical examination findings and patient reported information identify the&#xD;
      strongest individual predictors of prognostic value for persistent shoulder pain and&#xD;
      disability one year after initial medical examination in patients with rotator cuff related&#xD;
      pain syndrome (RCRSP) (Diagnostic codes: DM75.1; DM75.1A; DM75.1B; DM75.4; DM75.5; DM75.8;&#xD;
      DM75.9) treated conservatively with either exercise, corticosteroid injection, or a&#xD;
      combination of the two, while simultaneously adjusting for other potential prognostic&#xD;
      candidate variables (PROGRESS Theme II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: From clinical examination findings and patient reported information identify the&#xD;
      strongest individual preoperative predictors of prognostic value for persistent shoulder pain&#xD;
      and disability one year after surgery for patients receiving SubAcromial Decompression (SAD)&#xD;
      surgery (Procedure code: KNBH51), while simultaneous adjusting for other potential prognostic&#xD;
      candidate variables (PROGRESS Theme II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: From clinical examination findings and patient reported information, identify the&#xD;
      strongest individual predictors of five-year work participation rates.&#xD;
