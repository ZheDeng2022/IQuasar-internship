  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Variety of physical therapy treatments have been used after open abdominal surgery to improve&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary and physical function as well as to reduce the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      pulmonary complications. This study intends to determine the effect of early physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions on post-operative recovery profile, post-operative ileus and incisional pain&#xD;
      following abdominal hysterectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is randomized controlled trial which will be conducted at in-patient gynecology&#xD;
      department of Pakistan Railway hospital. This study would include total of 42 participants&#xD;
      divided into two groups with 21 participants in each group calculated through OpenEpi&#xD;
      (CI=95%Power=80%). Individuals will be screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      and allocated randomly into two groups through sealed envelope method. Experimental group&#xD;
      will receive early physical therapy interventions including patient education, ambulation,&#xD;
      in-bed exercises, deep breathing exercises, connective tissue manipulation and TENS during&#xD;
      the first 3 post-operative days following abdominal hysterectomy. While the control group&#xD;
      will receive patient education and early ambulation during the first 3 post-operative days&#xD;
      following abdominal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative recovery will be assessed on 3rd post-operative day. Intensity of pain will be&#xD;
      measured on baseline and 3rd post-operative day. The effect of intervention on post-operative&#xD;
      ileus will be measured by monitoring each participant's time to tolerance of oral diet, first&#xD;
      passage of stool and flatus&#xD;
