  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether genicular artery embolization&#xD;
      (GAE) is an effective way to treat knee pain from osteoarthritis. Pain from arthritis is&#xD;
      often due to underlying inflammation in the joint. The inflammation is associated with&#xD;
      increased abnormal blood flow going to the specific area of pain. If the investigator can&#xD;
      reduce the blood flow, the inflammation can be reduced and the pain can be controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GAE procedure is an experimental procedure to decrease the blood flow (embolize) to the&#xD;
      specific region of the knee that is causing the pain. This will be done by infusing&#xD;
      microscopic spheres into the specific blood vessel (genicular artery) supplying the area of&#xD;
      pain in the knee. This is done through a procedure which is called an angiogram, which is&#xD;
      done entirely through a pinhole at the creased of the thigh, using twilight (conscious)&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already completed an initial trial at UCLA, and shown that this&#xD;
      procedure is safe and effective. The purpose of this new trial is to compare outcomes of&#xD;
      people undergoing the GAE procedure to those who do not undergo the procedure. A total of 100&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled, and 2/3 of the patients will be randomly selected to undergo the&#xD;
      GAE procedure. 1/3 will not undergo the procedure. This is known as a randomized trial.&#xD;
      During the trial, all subjects will also get MRIs and fluid withdrawn from their knee joints&#xD;
      at various timepoints in order to precisely figure out how the procedure works on a closer&#xD;
      (microscopic) level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial to compare outcomes of GAE versus&#xD;
      observation, and to identify biomarkers and imaging endpoints that change in response to GAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be considered enrolled in the study once they have provided informed consent&#xD;
      and have been determined to meet all eligibility criteria. A total of 100 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the double-arm study and will be followed for 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a screening period in which patient eligibility is determined. Once&#xD;
      eligibility is confirmed, subjects will then be randomized to GAE or observation in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio. Group sample sizes of 67 and 33 achieve approximately 85% power to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis of no difference in KOOS between groups when the population mean difference is 9.7&#xD;
      (50 from observation and 40.3 from GAE arm) with a standard deviation for both groups of 15&#xD;
      and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.050 using a two-sided two-sample equal-variance&#xD;
      t-test. All study subjects will undergo the initial procedures, consisting of a history and&#xD;
      physical exam, dynamic contrast-enhanced knee MRI, blood serum and joint aspiration with&#xD;
      biochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment arm, subjects will undergo GAE with Embozene microspheres (100 micron)&#xD;
      (Varian Medical Systems). Observation group will not receive the GAE procedure at baseline.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be at 3 months (± 2 weeks), 6 months (± 2 weeks), 12 months (± 2&#xD;
      weeks), and 24 months (± 2 weeks) post-procedure. At these visits, subjects will complete the&#xD;
      KOOS score, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, undergo a directed physical examination,&#xD;
      and report any new adverse events (AEs). At 6 months of follow-up, all subjects will also&#xD;
      undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced knee MRI, and serum and joint aspiration with biochemical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, subjects in the observation group will have the option to crossover to the GAE&#xD;
      treatment arm. Subjects in the crossover group will then undergo GAE, with follow up at 3&#xD;
      months (± 2 weeks), 6 months (± 2 weeks), 12 months (± 2 weeks), and 24 months (± 2 weeks)&#xD;
      post-GAE.&#xD;

    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire is a commonly used instrument to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problems. The original KOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain (9 questions), Symptoms (7 questions), Function in daily living (ADL) (17 questions), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) (5 questions) and knee related Quality of Life (QoL) (4 questions). On this scale, 100% indicates no problems and 0% indicates extreme problems</description>

    <description>The MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) score is a semi-quantitative whole joint morphologic assessment of knee joint tissues in 14 subregions. Assessments are based on presence of Bone Marrow Lesions within the subregional volume (scale of 0-3, where none=0 and &gt;66%=3), articular cartilage loss (scale of 0-3, where none=0 and &gt;75%=3), presence of osteophytes in 12 of the 14 regions (scale of 0-3, where none=0 and large=3), Hoffa's synovitis and synovitis-effusion (scale of 0-3, where normal=0 and capsular distention=3), meniscus extrusion grading (scale of 0-3, where &lt;2mm=0and &gt;5mm=3), meniscus morphologic features present (Y/N; signal, tear, maceration, cyst, hypertrophy): ligaments and tendons (scale of 0-1, where normal=0 and complete tear/abnormality=1), and periarticular features = present or not (Hunter et al, 2011 Osteoarthritis Cartilage, 19:990-1002).</description>

    <description>Embozene is a medical device made by Boston Scientific approved in the United States for the treatment of hypervascular tumors and arteriovenous malformations. It consists of thousands of microscopic spheres that are injected into the artery in the knee going to the region of pain. One of the causes of pain in the setting of knee arthritis is increased blood flow going to the specific area of pain. The goal of this procedure is to decrease the blood flow (embolize) to the specific region of the knee that is causing your pain. This is done by infusing Embozene particles into the specific blood vessel (genicular artery) supplying the area of pain in the knee.</description>
