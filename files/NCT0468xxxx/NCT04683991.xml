  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratinized mucosa, which is composed of free gingiva and attached gingiva, is a barrier&#xD;
      against bacterial invasion in oral cavity and provides good tissue sealing for periodontal&#xD;
      environment. When the keratinized mucosa is insufficient, it is difficult to maintain the&#xD;
      long-term stability of the implant, which is not conducive to the peri-implant health. It is&#xD;
      generally believed that enough keratinized mucosa width is beneficial to reduce plaque&#xD;
      accumulation and reduce the incidence rate of peri-implant diseases. In recent years,&#xD;
      clinicians have gradually recognized that the thickness of keratinized mucosa plays an&#xD;
      important role in maintaining the peri-implant health. Some researchers found that the&#xD;
      thickness of mucosa is very important to maintain the aesthetic effect of implant&#xD;
      restoration, and when the thickness of mucosa around the implant is less than 2mm, alveolar&#xD;
      bone absorption will occur to maintain a stable biological width. A meta-analysis showed that&#xD;
      when the thickness of the keratinized mucosa around the implant was greater than 2mm, the&#xD;
      amount of marginal bone loss was significantly reduced (- 0.8mm, P &lt; 0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is considered that autogenous soft tissue graft is the most reliable technology to augment&#xD;
      keratinized mucosa. Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) is a mucogingival surgery&#xD;
      that transplant autologous free connective tissue under the pedicled semi thick flap to&#xD;
      augment keratinized mucosa. It can effectively increase the thickness of soft tissue, cover&#xD;
      the exposed implant, and reconstruct the interdental papilla. It is the gold standard for&#xD;
      peri-implant soft tissue agumentation. Keratinized mucosal thickening surgery may be done&#xD;
      prior to the surgical phase, after the surgical phase, before loading, or even after loading.&#xD;
      It is believed that keratinized mucosal thickening at the same time of implantation can&#xD;
      effectively reduce the possibility of mucosal recession after implantation, reduce the amount&#xD;
      of marginal bone absorption in the process of osseointegration, which is conducive to&#xD;
      maintaining the long-term stability of the implant. For the sake of clear clinical vision and&#xD;
      convenient operation, clinicians often choose to thicken the keratinized mucosa during the&#xD;
      secondary operation, and also obtain good postoperative effect. However, after the completion&#xD;
      of the final repair, the keratinized mucosa thickening surgery increases the difficulty of&#xD;
      operation and the technical requirements for the operator. In clinical practice, it is rarely&#xD;
      selected to perform keratinized mucosal thickening at this time. At present, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of timing on the outcome of soft tissue augmentation is still debated, and,&#xD;
      most importantly, a direct comparison between simultaneous and staged procedures remains&#xD;
      underexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this clinical trial is to prospectively compare the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      simultaneous versus delayed timing of soft tissue augmentation by SCTG placement around&#xD;
      single implants, by evaluating the peri-implant marginal bone level change and soft tissue&#xD;
      change, so as to provide reference for the formulation of clinical treatment plan and the&#xD;
      selection of the best operation time.&#xD;
