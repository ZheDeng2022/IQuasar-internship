      This trial compares two different second generation supraglottic airway devices (AuraGain and&#xD;
      I-gel) used as a conduit for bronchoscopic tracheal intubation during continuous oxygenation&#xD;
      in order tο determine time to successful tracheal intubation and ease of use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized controlled trial in the Department of Anesthesiology, Copenhagen&#xD;
      University Hospital Nordsjællands Hospital-Hillerød Denmark. The study is approved by the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee, capital region of Denmark. The aim of the study is to compare bronchoscopic&#xD;
      tracheal intubation during continuous oxygenation through the AuraGain and I-gel supraglottic&#xD;
      airway device. One hundred patients will be randomly allocated into two groups, group A&#xD;
      (AuraGain) and group B (I-gel). Study outcomes are time to tracheal intubation confirmed by&#xD;
      capnography as well as anesthesiologists reports of ease of use. Twenty-five&#xD;
      anesthesiologists participates in this study, and are allocated four patient each. In random&#xD;
      order, each physician will perform two bronchoscopic tracheal intubations with each SGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative setting, a complete anesthetic evaluation will be performed, including a&#xD;
      detailed airway assessment determining predictors for difficulties of face mask ventilation,&#xD;
      insertion of SGA and tracheal intubation. Participants are scheduled to undergo elective&#xD;
      surgery under general anesthesia. Before induction, all patients will be preoxygenated with&#xD;
      100% oxygen. After induction, rocuronium 0.6mg/kg will be used to facilitate neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade. Sufficient face mask ventilation will be performed before intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: AuraGain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time is measured from when the anesthesiologist reaches for the AuraGain LMA until the mask&#xD;
      is placed and adequate ventilation is confirmed by capnography. The AuraGain LMA will be used&#xD;
      as conduit for bronchoscopic intubation during continuous oxygenation, and time is measured&#xD;
      until placement of the tracheal tube verified by capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: I-gel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time is measured from when the anesthesiologist reaches for the I-gel LMA until the mask is&#xD;
      placed and adequate ventilation is confirmed by capnography.The I-gel LMA will be used as&#xD;
      conduit for bronchoscopic tracheal intubation during continuous oxygenation, and time is&#xD;
      measured until placement of the tracheal tube verified by capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups (A and B) up to two attempts of SGA placement and up to three attempts of&#xD;
      tracheal intubation are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of an emerging unpredicted difficult airway and a concurrent unsuccessful SGA&#xD;
      placement, the difficult airway algorithm, DAS, UK will be followed. Video- assisted&#xD;
      laryngoscopy will be the first option.&#xD;
