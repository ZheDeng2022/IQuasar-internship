      Background and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will perform this study to reveal the clinical meaning of fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      diarrhea, and impaired cognitive functions that are often expressed verbally in healthcare&#xD;
      professionals who are exposed to fluoroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent, 84 samples will be included in the study. For&#xD;
      operating room employees who meet the criteria determined before and after the operation;&#xD;
      mini-mental state examination, weight, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure value, VAS&#xD;
      score for headache, radiation exposure time on fluoroscopy device, Rad measurement with the&#xD;
      help of personal dosimeter before and after surgery, and total time in the operating room&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;

      Background and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, operations under fluoroscopy are performed at increasing rates with the aim of&#xD;
      increasing case management and surgical success. Due to this increasing exposure to&#xD;
      radiation, it is important to show that fluoroscopy has an impact on employees not only&#xD;
      annually but also daily. The researchers will perform this study to reveal the clinical&#xD;
      meaning of fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and impaired cognitive functions that are often&#xD;
      expressed verbally in healthcare workers who are exposed to fluoroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent; 84 samples consisting of orthopedic surgery and&#xD;
      anesthesia residents and orthopedic operating room nurses between the ages of 18-60 who do&#xD;
      not have cardiological, neurological and psychiatric diseases, have had fluoroscopic&#xD;
      operations lasting more than 2 hours, wear protective scopy gowns and collar during surgery,&#xD;
      will be included in the study. The total number of samples required for the study will be&#xD;
      reached by taking repeated measurements on consecutive days from the same sample group, but&#xD;
      not on the same day. For operating room employees who meet the criteria determined before and&#xD;
      after the operation; mini-mental state examination, weight, heart rate, non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure value, VAS score for headache, radiation exposure time on fluoroscopy device, Rad&#xD;
      measurement with the help of personal dosimeter before and after surgery, and total time in&#xD;
      the operating room will be recorded. This prospective study will be executed between December&#xD;
      2020 and June 2021.&#xD;

Any score of 24 or more (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment.)</description>

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&#xD;
The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a widely used test of cognitive function among the elderly; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills.</description>
