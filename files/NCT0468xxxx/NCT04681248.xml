      An Expanded Access Protocol for use of DKN-01 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a intermediate-size Expanded Access Protocol (EAP). Patients who were receiving&#xD;
      DKN-01 in a parent study at the time of completion of the parent study, and are, in the&#xD;
      opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor, suitable candidates for continued study drug&#xD;
      treatment are eligible for participation in the current EAP. In this EAP, all patients will&#xD;
      receive DKN-01 at the same dose and schedule as at the time of completion of the parent&#xD;
      study. Furthermore, patients who received DKN-01 in combination in the parent study will&#xD;
      continue to receive the same combination agent at the same dose and schedule in the EAP.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Receiving DKN-01 in a parent study and, in the opinion of the Investigator and Leap,&#xD;

             parent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion, demonstrated acceptable tolerability of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion, is receiving clinical benefit from treatment with&#xD;
             DKN-01, either as monotherapy or in combination with another treatment in the parent&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion, demonstrated acceptable compliance with study drug and&#xD;
             the study procedures in the parent study and is willing and able to comply with all&#xD;
             procedures in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After consultation with the Medical Monitor, DKN-01 may be continued for a patient who&#xD;
             has met the criteria for Progressive Disease (PD) but, in the Investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             is receiving clinical benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men and women of child-producing potential, the use of effective contraceptive&#xD;
             methods during the study and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug&#xD;

          -  Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to the initiation of any study-required&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following characteristics will be ineligible for study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unresolved toxicity that meets the study treatment discontinuation or study&#xD;
             withdrawal criteria from the parent study at the time of transition to this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Permanent discontinuation of DKN-01 in the parent study due to toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder or other&#xD;
             conditions at the time of transition to this study that could interfere with subject's&#xD;

             opinion of the investigator or Leap Medical Monitor or designee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has experienced Progressive Disease (PD) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
