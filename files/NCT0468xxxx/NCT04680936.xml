  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is an enthesopathy seen in 1-2% of the population aged&#xD;
      30-65 years, which can occur in the lateral epicondyle origo of the extensor carpi radialis&#xD;
      brevis and longus muscles, after frequently repetitive activities and can lead to limitations&#xD;
      in the daily life activities of the patients. The diagnosis is made by anamnesis and clinical&#xD;
      examination, cases that last more than 3 months are defined as chronic lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;
      Treatment options are analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hand-wrist splints,&#xD;
      eccentric strengthening exercises for forearm muscles and wrist dorsiflexors, injection&#xD;
      therapies, physical therapy agents such as therapeutic ultrasound, ESWT(extracorporeal&#xD;
      shockwave therapy), low-level laser therapy, and surgery. Prolotherapy is a treatment method&#xD;
      that is performed with repetitive injections of a small amount of irritant or sclerosing&#xD;
      solutions such as hypertonic dextrose, phenol-glycerin-glucose, or sodium morrhuate and aims&#xD;
      to activate the healing process by increasing the blood flow around the damaged tendinopathy&#xD;
      or enthesopathy area with the effect of these solutions. Hypertonic dextrose solutions in&#xD;
      concentrations ranging from 12.5-20% are frequently used in prolotherapy. Prolotherapy can be&#xD;
      done with ultrasound guidance or by determining anatomical landmarks. The injection is&#xD;
      applied to the annular ligament, lateral epicondyle, and supracondylar area where the forearm&#xD;
      extensor muscles adhere. Injection side effects and complications are pain, bruising, muscle&#xD;
      spasm, nerve or vessel damage at the injection site. Based on previous studies, the low dose&#xD;
      of dextrose solutions (1%, 5%, and 10%) may have a similar effect with fewer side effects&#xD;
      than higher concentrations of dextrose solutions (15%, 20%, 25%) and the low dose may have&#xD;
      fewer cell damage. Thus, it may be possible to apply an effective treatment method with fewer&#xD;
      side effects in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Also, in this study, the effect of&#xD;
      inflammation created by injection of saline in one group and the inflammatory, proliferative&#xD;
      and angiogenic effects of dextrose injected in other groups at different concentrations on&#xD;
      the treatment outcome will be compared.&#xD;

      brevis and longus muscles, after frequently repetitive activities and can lead to limitations&#xD;
      in the daily life activities of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is made by anamnesis and clinical examination, cases that last more than 3&#xD;
      months are defined as chronic lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options are analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hand-wrist splints,&#xD;
      eccentric strengthening exercises for forearm muscles and wrist dorsiflexors, injection&#xD;
      therapies, physical therapy agents such as therapeutic ultrasound, ESWT(extracorporeal&#xD;

      effect of these solutions. Hypertonic dextrose solutions in concentrations ranging from&#xD;
      12.5-20% are frequently used in prolotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dextrose is an ideal proliferant agent due to its ability to dissolve in water, exists in the&#xD;
      blood chemically, and to led safely apply to more than one place. It is known that hypertonic&#xD;
      dextrose solutions dehydrate the cells in the injection area, cause local tissue trauma,&#xD;
      attracts granulocytes and macrophages to the damaged area, and triggers healing. Prolotherapy&#xD;
      can be done with ultrasound guidance or by determining anatomical landmarks. The injection is&#xD;
      applied to the annular ligament, lateral epicondyle, and supracondylar area where the forearm&#xD;
