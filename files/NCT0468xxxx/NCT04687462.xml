  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty(TKA) is a successful orthopedic surgery with excellent clinical&#xD;
      outcome and survival. However, there are concerns about patient satisfaction in previous&#xD;
      reports, and dissatisfaction rate of 15-30% is reported in clinical outcomes(PROMs) of some&#xD;
      studies. Therefore, for improving the patient's outcome and satisfaction after total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty, it is necessary to change the design of the conventional total knee&#xD;
      arthroplsaty implant. The knee is a joint structure with several dynamic functions, and not&#xD;
      only the skeletal structure but also the soft tissue balance plays an important role in the&#xD;
      function of the knee joint. New implants are being developed to overcome the limitations of&#xD;
      conventional TKA implant, including the Exult total knee system (Exult; Corentec). Exult&#xD;
      implant has 1mm thickness variance of polyethylene insert, which is different from the&#xD;
      conventional total knee systems. This new total knee system has been shown in experimental&#xD;
      studies to produce nearly normal knee movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical results of this more specific variance of polyethyelen insert thickness total&#xD;
      knee implant system are insufficient, and there is also a lack of comparative studies with&#xD;
      conventional total knee arthroplasty implant. The purpose of this study is to compare&#xD;
      outcomes between 1-mm thickness variance polyethylene insert total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      system(Exult, total knee system, Corentec) and conventional 2-mm thickness variance&#xD;
      polyethylene insert total knee arthroplasty system(Lospa total knee system, Corentec) in the&#xD;
      same patients. This study is a randomized controlled study in patients undergoing both knee&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty in a day. Radiologic parameter, patients preference and clinical&#xD;
      results was investigated in both knee of same patients who received TKA during minimum 2 year&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-centered, randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing bilateral total knee replacement arthroplasty(TKRA) for both knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      will receive written consent from the patient through informed consent before the surgery.&#xD;
      Among the patients undergoing total arthroplasty for both knee joints, only patients who have&#xD;
      agreed with written consent will receive the surgery. In one patient who has been decided to&#xD;
      be erolled for the stedy, we will set one knee joint as the experimental group, and the other&#xD;
      knee joint as the control group. The experimental group will undergo TKRA using Exult total&#xD;
      knee system and the control group will get TKRA using Lospa total knee system. The researcher&#xD;
      performing the surgery can know which instruments are used for each knee joint according to&#xD;
      the random number table assignment result, but the subjects undergoing surgery will be&#xD;
      conducted as a single blinded study where it is not possible to know which instruments are&#xD;
      used for each side.&#xD;
