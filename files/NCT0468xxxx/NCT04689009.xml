  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective,randomized controlled study on the speed of healing, life quality&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of the treatment with a blue light medical device (EmoLED) versus&#xD;
      existing Standards Of Care (SOC) for patients with leg ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of LUCE - &quot;Leg Ulcers Standards of Care Enhancement&quot; clinical trial is to verify the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of a portable battery-powered device blue LEDs based. This study aims to&#xD;
      compare the existing SOC (consisting in two visits per week) to a protocol that requires only&#xD;
      one visit per week, during which the EmoLED treatment is administered in addition to the&#xD;
      current therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to register a difference in efficacy between EmoLED Group and SOC Group, in&#xD;
      terms of &quot;healing rate&quot;, intended as a reduction of the wound area, but also as a progress,&#xD;
      in a broad sense, of the overall clinical situation of the lesion, in terms of pain and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Endpoint- The primary endpoint is the comparison of the outcomes in terms of healing rate of&#xD;
      lesions treated with SOC (SOC Group) versus lesions treated with EmoLED (EmoLED Group), on&#xD;
      week 16th.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 80 patients will be recruited (40 patients per group), following these&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects suffering from venous and mixed skin ulcers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of a lesion &lt; 100 cm² of area and &lt; 1 cm in depth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women ≥ 18 years old;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient must be able to understand the aims of the clinical trial and provide&#xD;
           informed consent in writing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronicity of the lesion: at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who participated in clinical trials about skin ulcers healing during the&#xD;
           previous month;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are not able to understand the aims of the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with pressure ulcers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with diabetic foot ulcers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with circumferential leg ulcer (due to the difficulties in analysing the&#xD;
           pictures);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with clearly infected ulcers or with systemic infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with ulcers caused by critical ischemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a self-harm past that can purposely alter the process of healing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with psychiatric disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy or breast feeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with neoplasms or other diseases involving the use of cytostatic or&#xD;
           immunosuppressive drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with limited lifespan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with photosensitizing illnesses or that take photosensitizing drugs. All&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria must be satisfied before recruitment. Any concomitant&#xD;
           phar-macological therapy must be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Medical and surgical procedures- The lesions will be cleansed with saline solution and, if&#xD;
      necessary, surgical debridement will be performed with the most suitable method. At this&#xD;
      point, if patient is included in EmoLED Group, the EmoLED treatment starts. After EmoLED&#xD;
      application (EmoLED Group) or after cleansing (SOC Group), a polyurethane foam dressing will&#xD;
      be applied on the lesion. In case of clinical signs of infection, a silver dressing will be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then an elasto-compressive double layer dressing of the limb with cohesive fixation bielastic&#xD;
      la-tex-free bandage will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment with EmoLED, in addition to the SOC, will be performed during each visit for 60&#xD;
      seconds on each 5 cm diameter sub-area of the selected lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of multiple lesions matching with both inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be&#xD;
      all treated following the same protocol, depending on the group to which the patient belongs;&#xD;
      in this case the Principal Investigator will fill out a data-collection form and take&#xD;
      pictures just of the le-sion with the wider area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Follow up procedure- The patient is called upon to go to the follow-up check after 4 weeks&#xD;
      from the healing or, other-wise, from the end of the trial (16 weeks). The follow-up visit&#xD;
      will be used to confirm the occurred healing and verify the absence of relapses and/or&#xD;
      undesirable effects (if the wound appeared completely healed) or to value the healing&#xD;
      progress for the unhealed lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EmoLED is CE marked as a phototherapy device for the treatment of skin lesions. It is&#xD;
      intended for use by medical personnel in a hospital or outpatient setting. The patients'&#xD;
      demographic consists of individuals with skin lesions that are at least 16 old, regardless of&#xD;
      their ethnicity. EmoLED is conceived and designed to treat chronic and acute lesions of the&#xD;
      skin by healthcare professionals such as doctors and nurses; in particular the EmoLED&#xD;
      treatment is part of the wound bed preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EmoLED treatment is additional to the conventional therapy consisting in the lesions&#xD;
      cleansing and dressing with conventional or advanced medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blue light emitted by the device interacts with the endogenous chromophores of the skin&#xD;
      triggering reactions that lead to the activation of certain cellular pathways. In particular,&#xD;
      the wavelength emitted by the device is absorbed by Protoporphyrin IX present in Cytochrome&#xD;
      C, an essential protein for cellular respiration at the mitochondrial level. The energy&#xD;
      absorbed is used by the cell to increase the production of ATP, a fundamental molecule for&#xD;
      all the processes involved in tissue repair. In addition, blue light is able to stimulate the&#xD;
      production of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) through the excitation of flavins and&#xD;
      flavoproteines. Nowadays, multiple evidence has been produced about how ROS can be considered&#xD;
      signal transducers of numerous cellular pathways. This consideration validates the evidence&#xD;
      that ROS (at physiological concentrations) are crucial for multiple cellular functions such&#xD;
      as differentiation, proliferation, migration and contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A way through which EmoLED can act in tissue repair is the chain of mitochondrial electronic&#xD;
      transport. EmoLED in particular can act on the last two complexes that contain Cytochrome C,&#xD;
      that is sensitive to visible light in the range of emission of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting effect is the strengthening of this process and the increase in ATP production,&#xD;
      related to the development of a proton gradient dependent on the electron transport chain.&#xD;
      The increase of ATP production determines an increment of the available energy for the cell&#xD;
      that can intensify its metabolic activity, a necessary process during the repair of an injury&#xD;
      that involves activation of different cell types and an additional energy effort for the&#xD;
      organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device has been designed and set to deliver a power density of about 7 J/cm2 in an&#xD;
      acceptable treatment time for both doctor and patient: 60 seconds for each circular area of 5&#xD;
      cm diameter that needs to be treated. The choice of the duration of the treatment was also&#xD;
      made on the basis of what is stated in literature on thermal damage: the treatment induces a&#xD;
      temperature between 45 and 50ºC in the treated area, ideal condition to stimulate the&#xD;
      reversible and physiological phenomena that are wanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be submitted to the Ethical Committee of each investigator hospital for&#xD;
      approval and in any case will be performed according to the GCP, the Helsinki Declaration and&#xD;
      the Italian laws and requirements in the matter of human clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator (PI) or their delegate selects the enrolled patients on the basis&#xD;
      of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. Once the patient's correspondence with&#xD;
      the study's criteria has been verified, the PI or their delegate asks the patient for consent&#xD;
      to use the EmoLED treatment device, and briefly explains the characteristics of the device,&#xD;
      the expected effect, the possible trial-related risks, the guarantees to protect the&#xD;
      confidentiality of the collected information. The PI asks the patient if they are interested&#xD;
      in participating, leaving them twenty-four hours to decide. If the patient manifests their&#xD;
      interest to participate in the study, during their next visit they will sign the Informed&#xD;
      Consent and will decide whether to inform their family doctor of their participation in the&#xD;
      study. The patient must give their availability to return to the structure every week for the&#xD;
      trial observation time, including the follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the Informed Consent, subscribed by the patient and by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      and a copy of the study information will be given to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key data and lesion's pictures of each patient will be collected in the Data Collection&#xD;
      Form, following the enrollment and the signing of the Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOC Group: (32 treatments are planned during 16 weeks, 2 times per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EmoLED Group: (16 treatments are planned during 16 weeks, 1 time per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters used to define the study result will be based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographic images of lesions treated with EmoLED and control lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Collection Form filled by the medical staff during the visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic-organizational impact survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey on the usability of the device (SUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of pain through VAS scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters of the Data Collection Form are acquired on paper, and conserved in both paper&#xD;
      and digital form; the pictures of the lesion are acquired and kept in digital form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each visit, a picture of the lesion will be taken so that the process of healing can&#xD;
      be valued also in a visual way.Each picture will be named with the patient code and the date&#xD;
      of the visit. In case of multiple lesions matching with both inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, they will be all treated following the same protocol, depending on the group of&#xD;
      treatment, but only the lesion with the wider area will be registered; to distinguish the&#xD;
      area of interest, the perilesional tissue will be labelled with single-use permanent markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Form:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data Collection Form is unique for each patient and includes: Clinical Section, Quality&#xD;
      Life Section and Economic Section. The Clinical Section contains identification code of the&#xD;
      patient, date of birth, sex, etiology of the ulcer, any eventual concurrent disease, any drug&#xD;
      therapy (in terms of active substances), ulcer's date of onset, date of entry to the&#xD;
      facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the form is organized as a matrix where the row represents the measurable&#xD;
      parameters for each time of observation (reported in column).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator marks with an &quot;X&quot; the chosen value for each parameter and the most suitable&#xD;
      description. The Principal Investigator will also fill a check list, for each visit, to&#xD;
      ensure that also the pain level has been measured and that the picture of the lesion has been&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a &quot;Notes&quot; section to register information not planned at first, that might be&#xD;
      helpful during the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last part of the Data Collection Form is about follow-up visit. The Data Collection Form&#xD;
      is already completed with the patient's recruitment code and the group they belong to, so&#xD;
      that the allocation to the EmoLED Group and the SOC Group is random. The allocation sequence&#xD;
      of the group is generated by Matlab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each visit, the patient will be asked to rate their current pain level (VAS scale 0-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality section survey will be administered on the first and last visits, and also every&#xD;
      4 weeks. In detail, standard questionnaires as the EQ-5D2 and the Wound-Qol3 will be&#xD;
      administered, both available and validated in Italian language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific questionnaires for recognition of costs (Economic section) will be administered to&#xD;
      patients and their primary caregiver (if present) during the first visit, with the aim of&#xD;
      identifying the resources absorbed by the patients (and their caregivers) treated in the two&#xD;
      different approaches. The consumption of resources will be measured by gathering information&#xD;
      about the quantification of direct health costs (visits, hospitalizations, emergency&#xD;
      healthcare, medications etc…), direct non-health-related costs (informal medical assistance,&#xD;
      transportation and accommodation costs for each visit etc..) and indirect costs (productivity&#xD;
      loss for both the patient and the caregiver/s) and also by taking into account both the costs&#xD;
      associated with the adherence to the treatment, taking the first visit as a reference&#xD;
      parameter, and the costs related to complications and events associated with the ulcer that&#xD;
      determined the need for treatments/ exams and/or medical evaluations. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator will be given also a questionnaire to determine the costs incurred by their&#xD;
      facility for handling patients with leg ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires meant to value customer satisfaction, complexity and helpfulness of EmoLED&#xD;
      device will be administered to doctors and to healthcare personnel involved in the treatment&#xD;
      at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image Acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 16 weeks of the trial, during each visit a picture of the lesion will be taken, so&#xD;
      that the process of healing can be valued also in a visual way. Each picture will be named&#xD;
      with the patient code and the date of the visit. The quantitative analysis about the size of&#xD;
      the lesions through the collected pictures will be performed at certain time points: at the&#xD;
      beginning, in the middle and at the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The image analysis is made through an appropriate analysis algorithm that measures the area&#xD;
      of the lesion (mm²). The lesion must be fully and frontally framed to obtain an optimal&#xD;
      analysis.The ruler with patient's ID code and date must appear in every picture. It is&#xD;
      important that the ruler is placed straight and in-focus to have the scale reference. If&#xD;
      there is a wide lesion that needs more than one picture it's advisable to locate several&#xD;
      markers around the lesion and take photos of adjacent areas, including at least two visible&#xD;
      markers of the previous picture, to have the complete image of the lesion through a&#xD;
      sequential photo array.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staff participating in the study is trained on the correct use of the device and&#xD;
      accessories, as well as on the correct execution of the clinical protocol and on the&#xD;
      compilation of the related forms. In any case, the EMOLED staff is always available to the&#xD;
      team for any clarification or doubt during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to promote a more homogeneous operation between the various centres, joint training&#xD;
      sessions are organized and documents which serve as guidelines for the most critical passages&#xD;
      or the ones which require particular attention, such as recording, saving and transmitting&#xD;
      data, are prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid bias during the procedure of allocation in groups of patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the study, it should be noted that the randomization grid is not distributed to the&#xD;
      investigators: instead, paper folders are distributed containing the data collection forms.&#xD;
      The progressive patient ID is on the outside of the folders, while on the inside a label is&#xD;
      placed with the assignment of the patient to one of the two groups (SOC or EmoLED treatment),&#xD;
      which reflects the randomization grid. These folders are closed through an adhesive label&#xD;
      with the signature of the Head of Clinical Affairs of the sponsoring company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that satisfy all the inclusion criteria, both hospitalised and outpatient, will&#xD;
      be considered for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be used a standard procedure to value patients that includes the anamnesis evaluation&#xD;
      and a physical examination. A total of 80 subjects will be recruited, 40 per arm at the&#xD;
      facilities involved in the clinical study. Each one of the four sites involved will enroll 20&#xD;
      patients.Since this is a multicentric investigation with competitive recruitment the number&#xD;
      of patients per site can vary, depending on the recruitment capability of each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has signed the informed consent, the Principal Investigator enters the data&#xD;
      in the Enrollment Registry, checking all the inclusion and exclusion criteria; if all&#xD;
      criteria are met, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known or predictable factors that may impair outcomes and interpretation of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A different therapy standard between participating centers and/or within the same center can&#xD;
      lead to very variable outcomes between one patient and another, all other conditions being&#xD;
      equal. This problem is tackled by indicating in detail the therapy to be followed depending&#xD;
      on the type of lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An incorrect recording of photographic images does not make it possible to determine the area&#xD;
      of the lesion via software. This problem is tackled by providing precise instructions on the&#xD;
      correct use of the tools available for the retrieval of images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuity of patients can affect recovery times. Before recruiting a patient, the doctor&#xD;
      ensures that the patient is available to go, with the required timing, to the clinic, for the&#xD;
      scheduled visits. This fact is underlined several times when providing study information to&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interruption and withdrawal of subjects from the clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who miss the visits for two consecutive weeks, before/until the 14th week, and the&#xD;
      patients who miss the visits for one week, after the 14th week, will be reached by phone by&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator to assess their availability to go on with the study; in the event&#xD;
      that the patient does not intend to continue with the visits at the centre, they will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.Also, the patient who will turn out to be absent for more than half&#xD;
      of the sessions will be excluded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the resignation or withdrawal from the study by a patient, their data collection&#xD;
      form will be identified, scanned and archived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient withdraws from the study, the PI or his delegate records the event in the&#xD;
      Patient Identification Register and on the Data Collection Form and stores all documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring plan of the clinical investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To guarantee the conformity with ICH/GCP guidelines, the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC)&#xD;
      will be responsible for the study to be carried out in full observance of the Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures, of the Protocol and other written instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main responsibilities of the CRC are to ensure adherence to the Protocol, to make sure&#xD;
      that the data are accurately and fully registered and reported and to verify that the&#xD;
      Informed Consent was obtained and registered for each subject before the beginning of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRC will keep in touch and meet the Principal Investigator on a regular basis throughout&#xD;
      the whole duration of the study. The CRC will be allowed to check the various documents (Data&#xD;
      Collection Forms, CRF and other related documents containing original data) related to the&#xD;
      study in order to verify the conformity with the Protocol and to ensure the accuracy of&#xD;
      recorded data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance, control procedures, data management and record-keeping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the information gathered during the Study will be considered strictly confidential. The&#xD;
      patients' consent to the registration of personal data will be requested at the time of&#xD;
      recruitment; nevertheless the data collection forms will contain the Identification Code of&#xD;
      the patient and their date of birth only. In order to guarantee the correct traceability of&#xD;
      all parties involved, the number of the Study and the naming of the Center will be included&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the Study, all data will be archived using the appropriate safety measures at&#xD;
      the Coordinating Site for a minimum of ten years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient withdraws their consent to data processing, they will be immediately destroyed&#xD;
      to ensure total confidentiality, in addition each investigator will keep a copy of the&#xD;
      study's documentation for at least two years after its conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator builds and is responsible for the updating and custody of the&#xD;
      Patient Identification Register or Enrollment Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient Identification Register includes personal data of patients who agreed to take&#xD;
      part in the study, the identification number assigned to the patient, their illness,&#xD;
      indication of the eventual exclusion from the recruitment with its justification and date of&#xD;
      recruitment.The patient code is constituted by a three-digit number: the first one indicates&#xD;
      the center's number, as stated in this protocol, and the other two are sequential numbers,&#xD;
      starting from 01. Only the PI and, at their discretion, the members of their team have&#xD;
      knowledge of the identities of patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all the information in our possession and physical characteristics and performances&#xD;
      of the device that do not suggest the possible occurrence of and adverse event, it is taken&#xD;
      into consideration the possibility that said event could take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morbid condition of each patient will be monitored the whole time of the study. During&#xD;
      each visit any sign manifested by the patient will be carefully observed; in fact, the&#xD;
      subject will be encouraged to report any symptom with direct questions, such as: &quot;How have&#xD;
      you been feeling since our last visit?&quot;. They will also be prompted to spontaneously report&#xD;
      any adverse events that occurred during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any significant clinical anomaly encountered over the course of the study will be monitored&#xD;
      and observed until its normalisation, or until it will be clinically explainable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If during the procedure an unfavourable eventuality is reported, it shall be considered as an&#xD;
      Adverse Event, if Serious Adverse Event or not it will be decided according to customary&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up for subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects that withdrew from the experimentation after the treatment with the device&#xD;
           under study for any reason,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects who present Adverse Events up until thirty days from the last visit or the&#xD;
           last follow-up check (whichever of the two eventualities is the latter),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the subject who still present Adverse Events upon completion of the study will be&#xD;
           monitored until the test results are not back to baseline, or is no longer expected from&#xD;
           them to change, or until the investigator does not determine that those results are no&#xD;
           longer clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics- Calculation of the sample size: 80 patients will be recruited during the study;&#xD;
      they will be randomized 1:1 to the SOC Group and the EmoLED Group. In the SOC group, which&#xD;
      follows the standard treatment, patients will be visited twice a week. The EmoLED Group will&#xD;
      undergo medical examination once a week; in this case, therapy will consist in the standard&#xD;
      treatment plus EmoLED treatment. This sample size is sufficient to compare the average rate&#xD;
      of the injured area reduction, considering Student-T test for the comparison between&#xD;
      independent samples, by establishing α = 0.05, power level (1-β) = 0,8, under the assumption&#xD;
      to have an area reduction rate after 16 weeks amounting to 50% in SOC Group (control group),&#xD;
      a difference of 20% between EmoLED Group (experimental group) and SOC Group, a standard&#xD;
      deviation of averages equal to 50% of the mean values and a bilateral hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The average rate of reduction of the injured area between the two&#xD;
      groups will be compared using the Student-T-test, the quality of life in both groups at the&#xD;
      baseline, after 16 weeks and the difference with the baseline will be compared using&#xD;
      Student-T-test for independent samples. Linear regression models will be used to value the&#xD;
      differences between the groups to exclude any confounding factors. Due to the usually&#xD;
      asymmetrical nature of cost distribution, the comparison of the costs related to the&#xD;
      treatment and control group, in both the NHS and society perspective, will be made using the&#xD;
      non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Generalized linear regression models will be used to&#xD;
      value the differences between the groups to eliminate any confounding factors. The&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of both treatments in the time frame of the study (16 weeks) will be&#xD;
      valued by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and expressed in terms&#xD;
      of incremental costs for &quot;quality adjusted years (QALY). Extrapolations of results about the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness that simulate longer time-frames will be made considering decision-making&#xD;
      models (e.g. Markov models) and eventually including the data gathered during the study with&#xD;
      literary data and/or evidence from other studies.&#xD;
