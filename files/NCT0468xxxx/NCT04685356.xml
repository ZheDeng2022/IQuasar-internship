  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality in very preterm infants has decreased significantly over the past twenty years.&#xD;
      However, neuromotor, behavioral and cognitive development disorders are more common in these&#xD;
      children born before 33 weeks of gestation as compared to term born infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These neurodevelopmental disorders include difficulties with self-regulation, tone, posture&#xD;
      or poor quality movements as well as inadequate responses to sensory simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-hospital discharge follow-up and interventionsof children born very preterm ares very&#xD;
      heterogeneous in France. They are mainly carried out in a rehabilitation center, based on&#xD;
      caregivers whereas IBAIP is carried out at home and family centered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early interventions during hospitalization or after discharge appear potentially of great&#xD;
      interest in improving the neurodevelopemental outcome of the very preterm infants. Several&#xD;
      early interventions have been developed and evaluated in other countries. These interventions&#xD;
      are designed to be used early in life, mainly during the first 3 years of life, and are based&#xD;
      on brain plasticity and intense synaptogenesis during this period of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBAIP (Infant Behavior Assessment and Intervention Program) was developed on the same&#xD;
      theoretical foundations as the NIDCAP (Neonatal Individualized Development Care and&#xD;
      Assessment Program). IBAIP consists of providing the child and his family with an&#xD;
      intervention, at home, starting just before hospital discharge up to a 6 months corrected&#xD;
      age. .The aim of IBAIP is to support developmental functions including infant's&#xD;
      self-regulation and focus on improving the responsiveness of parents' infant interactions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This program consists of providing intervention, by a IBAIP trained and certified healthcare&#xD;
      professional, with the child and his family, starting a few days before hospital discharge&#xD;
      and continuing at home until the corrected age of 6 months. It focuses on the child's&#xD;
      behaviors and consists of assisting the family in its interactions with the child so that&#xD;
      these are adapted and responsive to the child's development needs over time through repeated&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster randomization will be used meaning the centers are randomized, not the individual&#xD;
      patients. The centers will be randomized before the inclusion of patients in order to allow&#xD;
      the physiotherapists or psychomotor therapists to be trained and certified to the IBAIP&#xD;
      before the start of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Upon discharge from hospital, follow-up as part of standard care (control group)&#xD;
      with at least 1 medical consultation per month during the first 6 months or according to the&#xD;
      IBAIP program (experimental group) with one intervention in the week before discharge from&#xD;
      hospital and at home after hospital discharge, with1 session once a month up to 6 months&#xD;
      corrected age (i.e. 6 to 8 sessions) in addition to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: At 6 months corrected age, parents' response to the PSI (Parenting Stress Index)&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: At two years corrected age :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the development quotient obtained on the BSID-III scale during a&#xD;
           consultation with a neuro-psychologist.&#xD;

    <description>The IBAIP intervention program consists of providing an intervention with the child and their family, at home, upon discharge from hospital and up to a corrected age of 6 months. Interventions therefore take place at the early stage of the child's brain development. The intervention is performed by a IBAIP-trained and certified physiotherapist or psychomotor therapist trained , at the rate of one session per month over a period of approximately 6 to 8 months (6 months of corrected age). The session takes place in the child's usual living environment, at home, in the presence of at least one of the parents. It focuses on the child's behaviors and consists of assisting the family in its interactions with the child so that these are adapted and responsive to the child's development needs over time through repeated interventions.</description>
