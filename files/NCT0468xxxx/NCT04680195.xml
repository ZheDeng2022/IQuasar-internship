  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) is the main secondary toxic injury after pelvic&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Hematochezia is the most common symptom for more than 80% of CRP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical treatment is the first choice to the treatment of CRP to avoid the occurrence of&#xD;
      serious complications. Conventional oral medication for the treatment of bleeding CRP is very&#xD;
      few and has little effect. At present, no oral medication has been found to significantly&#xD;
      alleviate and control refractory bleeding of CRP. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to&#xD;
      screen out a drug that is more effective, safe and highly compliant for the treatment of&#xD;
      hemorrhagic CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory, immune regulation, anti-angiogenesis and other effects.&#xD;
      For the patients of CRP with intractable bleeding, a prospective, open clinical trial will be&#xD;
      carried out to observe the safety and effectiveness of thalidomide in treating hemorrhagic&#xD;
      CRP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is an essential therapeutic tool for pelvic malignancies such as uterine cervix,&#xD;
      uterine corpus, prostate, testicular, urinary bladder and rectal cancers. According to&#xD;
      reports, the estimated number of new cases of malignant pelvic tumors in China in 2015 alone&#xD;
      exceeded 500,000. Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) is an unavoidable and commonly observed&#xD;
      side effect, occurs 3 months later and in 5-20% of patients after pelvic malignancy&#xD;
      radiation. Hematochezia is the most common symptom for more than 80% of CRP patients, which&#xD;
      is a persistent, irreversible and progressive symptom, and will probably give rise to anemia.&#xD;
      In clinic, the treatment for intractable bleeding of CRP is very difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical treatment is the first choice to the treatment of CRP to avoid the occurrence of&#xD;
      serious complications. Conventional oral medication for the treatment of bleeding CRP is very&#xD;
      few and has little effect. At present, no oral medication has been found to significantly&#xD;
      alleviate and control refractory bleeding of CRP. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to&#xD;
      screen out a drug that is more effective, safe and highly compliant for the treatment of&#xD;
      hemorrhagic CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory, immune regulation, anti-angiogenesis and other effects. A&#xD;
      large number of studies have shown that thalidomide can be used to treat Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis, radiation cystitis, etc., and it can treat moderate to severe of IBD&#xD;
      patients can inhibit inflammatory response, improve clinical symptoms, promote intestinal&#xD;
      mucosal repair. Further, recent studies have proved that thalidomide can be used to treat&#xD;
      intestinal bleeding due to vascular dysplasia. And a case report from Gut described that&#xD;
      refractory bleeding of CRP of a 78-year-old woman were significantly alleviated after taking&#xD;
      thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, for the patients of CRP with intractable bleeding, a prospective, open clinical&#xD;
      trial planed to carry out to observe the safety and effectiveness of thalidomide in treating&#xD;
      hemorrhagic CRP.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life of the patient was evaluated by the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire composed of multi-item scales and single items that reflect the multidimensionality of the quality-of-life. It incorporated five functioning subscales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), nine symptom subscales (pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, insomnia, financial difficulties), and one global quality of life subscale, and the scores were ranged 0 to 100. Higher scores for functional subscales and global quality of life subscale indicated the better functional status and quality of life. But the higher scores for symptom subscales indicated the poorer quality of life.</description>
