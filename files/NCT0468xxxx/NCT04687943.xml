      This study was conducted between November 2017 and January 2021 with 126 patients who applied&#xD;
      to Konya Training and Research Hospital Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation outpatient clinic&#xD;
      with complaints of elbow pain and were diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis, who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and did not meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral epicondylitis diagnosis will be made according to clinical criteria. For the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of Lateral epicondylitis, if there is resistant wrist extension and pain by&#xD;
      pressing the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, Lateral epicondylitis will be diagnosed.&#xD;
      Other pathologies that may present with elbow pain will be ruled out. Detailed stories of all&#xD;
      participants will be taken and detailed physical examinations will be made. Sociodemographic&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics of the participants will be determined by questions such as age,&#xD;
      gender, height, weight, educational status, employment status and income level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      126 patients diagnosed with Lateral epicondylitis will be divided into 3 groups. Totally 15&#xD;
      sessions of peloid therapy for 42 patients in 1 group for 3 weeks, 5 days a week, 2 sessions&#xD;
      of muscle and fascia correction techniques for 3 weeks in the second group, and 3 sets per&#xD;
      day for 42 patients in the third group for 3 weeks. You will be given a home exercise program&#xD;
      with 10 repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the home exercise program will be shown to both groups. Cold application: At the&#xD;
      beginning of each treatment, gel ice packs are wrapped with a moist towel and placed around&#xD;
      the elbow joint for 15 minutes. will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PELOID therapy; PELOIDs are naturally and indigenous to the hot springs; They are used in&#xD;
      clinics or packaged at home.In the local peloid application, as the effects of heat; increase&#xD;
      in blood flow, decrease in peripheral vein tone, increase in heart rate and heart rate,&#xD;
      slight increase in systolic blood pressure, decrease in diastolic pressure, increase in cell&#xD;
      division, decrease in viscosity in skin fluids, warm analgesia, increased elasticity in&#xD;
      tendons, ligaments and fascia, general sedation, hormonal stimulation (stress hormones,&#xD;
      pituitary adrenal cortex and medulla), adaptive effect, elongation of collagen tissue.&#xD;
      Vasodilation occurs in the deep parts of the body with the stimulation formed in the parts of&#xD;
      the body that come into contact with the peloid, and vasodilation occurs in the deep parts of&#xD;
      the body. In addition, hot applications have an anti-inflammatory effect in chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. As a result of the studies done, with PELOID therapy; it has positive effects&#xD;
      on the symptoms and functional capacity of osteoarthritis; It has significant positive&#xD;
      effects on parameters such as the number of painful and swollen joints, morning stiffness,&#xD;
      and subjective pain in inflammatory rheumatic diseases; It has been observed that combined&#xD;
      therapies are more successful than single treatments, and with the repetition of the&#xD;
      treatments, adaptation to work increases, workday loss and treatment costs decrease. Hot&#xD;
      peloid is applied to the area as a 1.5-2 cm thick layer. The surface of the application area&#xD;
      is covered with a material that provides transparent impermeability, the temperature of the&#xD;
      mixture is maintained and it is covered with a towel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PELOID therapy was applied to our patients at a temperature of 45 degrees for 20 minutes on&#xD;
      the elbow. At the end of the application (20 minutes later), the peloid layer is removed and&#xD;
      discarded again not to be used. The treatment area is cleaned with soft cloths soaked in hot&#xD;
      water. The patient is 10-15 minutes. the session is completed by resting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio Taping Application: In addition to classical physiotherapy, kinesio taping was&#xD;
      applied to the second group; Lateral epicondylitis taping, consisting of muscle technique and&#xD;
      fascia correction techniques, will be performed.Theoretically, it is thought to increase the&#xD;
      space between the skin and muscles by raising the skin, relieving this pressure on neural and&#xD;
      sensory receptors formed in the tissue due to any reason and supporting the increase of blood&#xD;
      and lymph circulation. This effect seen in the circulatory system reduces edema and&#xD;
      inflammation and accelerates tissue healing. The reduction in inflammation provides a&#xD;
      reduction in pain. Activating the gate control mechanism and the pattern inhibitory&#xD;
      mechanisms through mechanoreceptors are also accepted as other mechanisms of pain reduction.&#xD;
      When the pain reduction by taping is explained according to the gate control theory; The band&#xD;
      reduces the inputs transmitted from the nerve fibers to the nociceptors. Convulsions seen on&#xD;
      the skin after tape application raise the skin and reduce painful stimuli by decreasing the&#xD;
      pressure on subcutaneous nociceptors. Stretching the skin and applying pressure to the skin&#xD;
      stimulate the cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Proprioceptive sensation can be increased by the&#xD;
      ability of these mechanoreceptors to change joint motion information.Belt applications can be&#xD;
      named as I, Y, X, rake, net or ring depending on their appearance. Type of tape to be&#xD;
      applied; It varies according to the technique, the stage of the disease, the length of the&#xD;
      muscle, the application area and the targeted treatment. Since I and Y strips are used to&#xD;
      reduce pain and edema, they are the most common application methods. Y-strips are also used&#xD;
      to surround the muscle to facilitate or suppress movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The X-strip method is generally used in cases where the origo and insertion of the muscle&#xD;
      changes due to movements or when they are stretched to the maximum, the lengths of which vary&#xD;
      greatly and involve the double joint. The rake shape is used especially for reducing edema&#xD;
      and for lymph drainage. The web shape created by modifying the rake (fan) shape is used in&#xD;
      highly mobile joints such as elbow joints. In order to prevent skin discomfort, the beginning&#xD;
      and end regions of the tape should not be stretched during the applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesiology tape application is applied with different degrees of tension according to the&#xD;
      treatment purpose. The amount of stretching; Maximum stretching (100%), submaximal stretching&#xD;
      (75%), moderate stretching (50%), light stretching (25%), very light stretching (10-15%) and&#xD;
      no stretching. A total of 6 sessions of kinesio taping will be applied 2 sessions per week.&#xD;
      The tapes will remain on the tissue for 48 hours and patients will be asked to remove the&#xD;
      tape before coming for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Exercise Program: Patients will be given a home exercise program consisting of eccentric&#xD;
      strengthening exercises and stretching exercises, which are planned to increase resistance&#xD;
      every week. To the patients; for forearm pronation-supination with wrist extensors&#xD;
      Strengthening exercises will be taught and a home exercise program will be started as 3 sets&#xD;
      of 10 repetitions per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will be evaluated at the beginning of the treatment, in the 3rd week after the&#xD;
      treatment and in the 4th week after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the evaluations; Pain intensity and pain localization with 0-10 point Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS), 0-10 point pain questioning with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during one, maximum&#xD;
      grip, Arm-Shoulder and Hand Distortion Questionnaire (Arm Disabled, Shoulder and Hand) (DASH)&#xD;
      and function and disability, Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire (PRFEQ) finds the&#xD;
      pain and functions of the arm in a 1-week period, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) will be used&#xD;
      in life course. . Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm); Jamar Hand Dynamometer for pain&#xD;
      intensity and pain localization; Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm) for maximum hand grip&#xD;
      strength; Arm-Shoulder and Hand Injury Questionnaire (Arm, Shoulder and Hand Barriers (DASH)&#xD;
      Questionnaire) to ensure the level of pain during maximum hand grip; Patient-Based Forearm&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (Patient-Graded Forearm Assessment Questionnaire (PRFEQ)) for&#xD;
      function and disability; To learn the pain and functions of the arm in a 1-week period, Short&#xD;
      Form-36 (SF-36); It has been used for life continues.&#xD;
