    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 1-13% of all&#xD;
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). According to most studies MINOCA patients&#xD;
      seem to have a more favorable prognosis compared to the obstructive AMI ones, but face a&#xD;
      significant risk for recurrent events of angina. It has been demonstrated that sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system (SNS) overdrive during the acute phase of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has&#xD;
      a deleterious impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and this is the reason why&#xD;
      contemporary treatment strategy of ACS aims towards the inhibition of SNS mechanisms. In the&#xD;
      setting of MINOCA, however, data are scarce regarding the prognostic role of SNS activation&#xD;
      and the concomitant utility of a similar therapeutical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of SNS in cardiovascular prognosis&#xD;
      of MINOCA patients. In the same context, this study is the first, to the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, registry where the working diagnosis of MINOCA will be confirmed with cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational cohort study with a prospective follow-up of 18 months enrolling all&#xD;
      patients aged 38-85 years old who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of MINOCA. Patients will&#xD;
      receive treatment according to the latest guidelines and consensus documents. Assessment of&#xD;
      SNS will include calculation of indices of heart rate and blood pressure variability, as well&#xD;
      as the measurement of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) during the first 14 days&#xD;
      following the event. Follow-up will include a phone contact at 3, 6 and 12 months to record&#xD;
      potential primary endpoints and a clinic visit at 18 months to reassess clinical and lab&#xD;
      parameters and record primary and secondary endpoints. Definition of primary endpoints&#xD;
      includes hospitalization for new onset of ACS, heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack, cardiovascular death or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints include the burden&#xD;
      of arrythmias estimated from 24hr ECG recording, recurrent angina assessed via Seattle Angina&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SAQ) and the general health condition and quality of life (QoL) assessed using&#xD;
      SF-12 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study are expected to reveal the prognostic role of SNS assessment in&#xD;
      patients with MINOCA with a potential clinical implication in a treatment approach towards&#xD;
      the inhibition of SNS mechanisms.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 1-13% of all&#xD;
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). According to most studies MINOCA patients&#xD;
      seem to have a more favorable prognosis compared to the obstructive AMI ones, but face a&#xD;
      significant risk for recurrent events of angina. MINOCA consists a clinical entity&#xD;
      characterized by a heterogeneous and poorly understood pathophysiological substrate (plaque&#xD;
      disruption, coronary epicardial and microvascular spasm, thromboembolism, thrombophilia,&#xD;
      spontaneous dissection, myocardial bridges, microvascular dysfunction), whereas current data&#xD;
      leave significant knowledge gaps regarding the risk stratification and the proper&#xD;
      therapeutical approach of these patients. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overdrive during&#xD;
      the acute phase of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an expected reflex mechanism aiming to&#xD;
      maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that it has a deleterious&#xD;
      impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and this is the reason why contemporary&#xD;
      treatment strategy of ACS aims towards the inhibition of SNS mechanisms. In the setting of&#xD;
      MINOCA, however, data are scarce regarding the prognostic role of SNS activation and the&#xD;
      concomitant utility of a similar therapeutical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of SNS in cardiovascular&#xD;
      prognosis of MINOCA patients. Furthermore, investigators will assess relations between&#xD;
      various SNS parameters and clinical characteristics of these patients, as well as other&#xD;
      indices of cardiovascular function (biomarkers, imaging). In the same context, this study is&#xD;
      the first, to the investigators' knowledge, registry where the working diagnosis of MINOCA&#xD;
      will be confirmed with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational cohort study with a prospective follow-up of 18 months enrolling all&#xD;
      patients aged 35-85 years old who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of MINOCA, on the condition&#xD;
      that CMR does not reveal findings compatible with a diagnosis of myocarditis or Takotsubo.&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment according to the latest guidelines and consensus documents.&#xD;
      During hospitalization, a complete medical history will be recorded and all basic clinical&#xD;
      and lab parameters will be collected. Assessment of SNS will include calculation of indices&#xD;
      of heart rate and blood pressure variability derived from 24hr monitoring using validated&#xD;
      devices, as well as the measurement of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) during the&#xD;
      first 14 days following the event. Follow-up will include a phone contact at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months to record potential primary endpoints and a clinic visit at 18 months to reassess&#xD;
      clinical and lab parameters and record primary and secondary endpoints. Definition of primary&#xD;
      endpoints includes hospitalization for new onset of ACS, heart failure, stroke or transient&#xD;
      ischemic attack, cardiovascular death or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      the burden of arrythmias estimated from 24hr ECG recording, recurrent angina assessed via&#xD;
      Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the general health condition and quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      assessed using SF-12 questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sympathetic tone estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Α. MSNA. After patient's stabilization the test will be performed and the derived data will&#xD;
      be the number of bursts per min and the average bursts per 100 beats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure monitoring. Heart rate variability will be&#xD;
      analyzed via Kubios software for short-term and long-term heart rate variability. Blood&#xD;
      pressure short-term variability will be expressed as SD, wSD, ARV, CV, time rate of BP&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data analysis, SPSS 24.0 software will be used. Continuous parametric data will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean and SD. For categoric parametric data results will be presented in means of&#xD;
      frequency and percentage. Comparisons between categoric parameters will be done with test x2.&#xD;
      Comparisons between the mean values for continuous parameters with normal distribution will&#xD;
      be done via unpaired student's test. Comparisons between categoric parameters will be done&#xD;
      with Mann Whitney U test. Normal distribution will be checked with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Correlation analysis will be done via Pearson Phi coefficient or Spearman Rho. Statistically&#xD;
      significant will be differences with p value &lt; 0.05. Evaluation of correlations between&#xD;
      selected variables and cardiovascular events and mortality will be via Kaplan Maier curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY LIMITATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study will include MINOCA patients irrespective of the underlying pathophysiological&#xD;
           mechanism. This is the result of the inablity of most centers to perform intravascular&#xD;
           imaging (IVUS, OCT) on a routine basis and the tendency to avoid spasm provoking&#xD;
           procedures during coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although most data will be recorded during the acute/hospitalization phase, the time&#xD;
           frame of MSNA and CMR is expected to vary according to the clinical state of the&#xD;
           participants and the technical capabilities of the centers. However, an effort will be&#xD;
           made not to overlap the 14 days time limit proposed by the majority of investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CMR will be take place in different centers thus some extent of interobserver&#xD;
           variability is expected. However results will be reassessed by a single investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESTIMATED RESEARCH OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be the first registry, to the investigators' knowledge, that will record data of&#xD;
           SNS activation in patients will CMR-confirmed MINOCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results of the present study are expected to reveal the prognostic role of SNS&#xD;
           assessment in patients with MINOCA with a potential clinical implication in a treatment&#xD;
           approach towards the inhibition of SNS mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Furthermore, assessment of correlations between parameters of cardiac function and CMR&#xD;
           imaging with the level of SNS activation will provide a valuable insight towards the&#xD;
           elucidation of the potential role of SNS overdrive during the acute phase of MINOCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Last but not least, follow up assessment will provide information regarding the&#xD;
           long-term incidence of persistent or recurrent angina as well as the impact of MINOCA in&#xD;
           future quality of life, sentimental state and general health status.&#xD;
