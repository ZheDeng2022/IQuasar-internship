    <textblock>
      The BENEFIT-03 Clinical Study is a first in human, prospective, multi-center, single-arm,&#xD;
      interventional feasibility study to be conducted in Australia. The purpose of the BENEFIT-03&#xD;
      study is to collect initial safety and effectiveness data on the BIOTRONIK Prospera™ SCS&#xD;
      (Spinal Cord Stimulation) System with HomeStream™ Remote Management. Enrolled participants&#xD;
      will complete a SCS trial period per the standard of care utilizing the BIOTRONIK Resilience&#xD;
      percutaneous SCS trial leads and the BIOTRONIK Prospera™ External Pulse Generator (EPG).&#xD;
      Following a successful trial period, participants will be implanted with a permanent&#xD;
      BIOTRONIK Prospera™ Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG). Implanted participants will be&#xD;
      followed for 24 months post-implant with in-office visits and remote management visits.&#xD;

To be classified as a responder, a participant must achieve a reduction in overall pain intensity of at least a 50% from baseline, assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</description>
