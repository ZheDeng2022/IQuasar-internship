  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VILT-502 study is Non-interventional Study(United States)/Low-intervention Clinical Trial&#xD;
      (Canada) of Viltolarsen administered intravenously once weekly for 10 years to boys with DMD&#xD;
      who complete the NS-065/NCNP-01-202 study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VILT-502 study is an open-label, single-arm study to assess the long-term safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of viltolarsen, an exon skipping therapy for the treatment of DMD. Patients who&#xD;
      complete the Phase II long-term extension study and meet the additional inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria of the present protocol will be invited to enroll. Viltolarsen will be&#xD;
      administered through weekly IV infusions, at the study site or at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VILT-502 study will be conducted as a non-interventional study in the US, and as a&#xD;
      low-intervention clinical trial in Canada where viltolarsen is not yet commercially&#xD;
      available, owing to differences in the stage of regulatory approval in the two countries.&#xD;

    <description>The Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL) scale is a specifically designed for assessing upper limb function in ambulant and non-ambulant patients with DMD. It consists of 22 items subdivided into shoulder level (6 items), mid-level (9 items) and distal level (7 items) dimension. The item ranges from score 0 -no useful hand function -to score 6 full shoulder abduction.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Patient completed the NS-065/NCNP-01-202 study and was judged by the investigator as&#xD;
             appropriate to participate in the VILT-502 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient and parent or legal guardian are willing and able to comply with scheduled&#xD;
             visits, study treatment administration plan, and study procedures.&#xD;
