  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patterns of reflex locomotion described by Vojta contain all the basic patterns necessary&#xD;
      for gait, which can be observed as partial patterns during normal postural ontogenesis in the&#xD;
      first year of life. These patterns are triggered throughout life regardless of age, so they&#xD;
      can be activated both in healthy subjects and in the presence of neurological pathology in&#xD;
      adult patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In reflex locomotion, there is a coordinated and rhythmic activation of the entire skeletal&#xD;
      muscles and different circuits of the central nervous system are stimulated. The motor&#xD;
      reactions that are triggered regularly and cyclically due to pressure stimuli, from certain&#xD;
      starting positions, are completely reproducible and as often as desired, even in the newborn&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the movements that appear in the development of the human being in grasping, turning,&#xD;
      crawling, standing up and walking, are therefore visibly stimulated. They are, according to&#xD;
      Prof. Vojta, present even in children of a developmental stage, in which they do not&#xD;
      spontaneously yet possess these capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the therapeutic application of reflex locomotion, those muscular functions used&#xD;
      unconsciously and necessary for spontaneous daily motor skills are activated in the patient,&#xD;
      especially in the spine, but also in the arms and legs, hands and feet and in the face.&#xD;

    <description>In Vojta therapy, the therapist selectively presses certain areas of the body, with the patient lying prone, - supine or - lateral. These types of stimuli, in humans of any age, provoke automatically and without their own initiative, that is, without the active voluntary collaboration of the person</description>

    <description>Reflex locomotion is activated by the &quot;reflexogenic&quot; pathway. In context with reflex locomotion, the term &quot;reflex&quot; does not represent the mode of neuronal control, but rather refers to defined, &quot;automatic&quot; and always equal motor responses produced by external stimuli, applied therapeutically.</description>
