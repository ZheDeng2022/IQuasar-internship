  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conduct a pilot randomized control to assess the preliminary efficacy of IPROACTIF, an&#xD;
      occupational therapist-delivered primary care intervention for aging and chronic disease&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IPROACTIF intervention is based on the premise of preventing the physical and cognitive&#xD;
      decline that is associated with aging and chronic disease. The 12-week intervention includes&#xD;
      a comprehensive assessment of ADL functioning and ten intervention sessions addressing&#xD;
      disease management, physical activity and executive functioning. This pilot randomized&#xD;
      control trial will compare whether patients who receive IPROACTIF perform better than usual&#xD;
      care patients on physical functioning, self-efficacy for chronic disease management, physical&#xD;
      activity levels, executive functioning, health-related quality of life, and participation in&#xD;
      life roles and activities.&#xD;

    <description>12 weekly sessions. First two sessions focus on comprehensive assessment of physical and executive functioning, assessment of home safety and accessibility, assessment of ADL/IADL competence and performance in context; information in these areas is used by the interventionist to collaboratively identify three patient-centered goals. Goal planning is followed by 10 treatment sessions. Treatment sessions focus on chronic disease education, problem solving issues related to disease management by modifying daily routines, recommendations for embedding physical activity in everyday tasks, and environmental modifications or activity adaptations to increase ADL/IADL independence.</description>
