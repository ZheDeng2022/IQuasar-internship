  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general purpose of this study is to examine whether the dual mobility cup (Novae® Serf)&#xD;
      reduces the number of hip dislocations after total hip replacement, both early dislocation&#xD;
      (≤1 year) and late dislocation (&gt;1 year) after primary THR compared with a conventional cup&#xD;
      design (Trabecular MetalTM Modular Acetabular System).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery with THR for arthritis and other hip disorders has long been one of the most&#xD;
      successful orthopedic surgical treatments. The majority of the patients gain pain relief and&#xD;
      experience improved hip function. In 2017, a total of 10,691 THRs were implanted in Denmark&#xD;
      (annual report 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip dislocation is a known complication after THR. It is a painful condition which may have&#xD;
      far-reaching consequences for the patient, who may experience both physical and mental&#xD;
      discomfort. Ultimately, multiple hip dislocations may result in reoperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, the incidence of hip dislocation is reported at 2-6 %, and a more recent&#xD;
      review reports a risk of 0.5-10 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, recurrent hip dislocation is the cause of 21 % of the reoperations per year&#xD;
      according to The Danish Hip Arthroplasty Register. According to the British National Joint&#xD;
      Registry (NJR) and the Australian register (AOANJRR), hip dislocation is the cause of 15.5 %&#xD;
      and 21 %, respectively, of the reoperations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best method to avoid reoperation due to instability is to choose the correct implant for&#xD;
      the individual patient and thereby spare the patient of having to endure a painful&#xD;
      complication and yet another procedure. There are multiple risk factors for instability after&#xD;
      THR, and increased use of dual mobility cups (DMC) is already documented.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient reported outcome measure: European quality of life 5 dimensions (EQ-5D 5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be scored with EQ-5D 5L preoperatively and at 1,5 and 10 years. It consists of 5 dimensions ranging from 1-5, with 1 being the best in each dimension. It also consist of a visual analog scale ranging from 0-100, 100 being the best imaginable health, The EQ VAS describes the respondents current overall health. Data will be showed as changes in health over time showing responses at baseline and at follow up or as frequencies and proportions reported by dimension and level.</description>

    <time_frame>1, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be scored with OHS at baseline and at 1, 5 and 10 years. OHS is a patient-recorded outcome measure designed to assess the outcome of hip replacements. Its a score between 0-48 with 48 being the best.</description>
