    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. Patients who fulfill all inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study, be neurologically evaluated and will go&#xD;
      through EEG recordings while listening to an auditory cognitive assessment tool and&#xD;
      preforming tasks. EEG recordings will be analyzed using proprietary computational analyses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One of the major problems in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders, is the&#xD;
      lack of cost effective and reliable tools to assess neurodegeneration on a large scale at a&#xD;
      very early stage. Although current imaging methods give a clear image of the brain atrophy&#xD;
      involved in neurodegenerative disorders, there are deficiencies prohibiting their usage for&#xD;
      prevention-scanning of large high-risk population such as high price, long set-up time and&#xD;
      the need for trained personnel to conduct the test. Therefore, the development of a reliable&#xD;
      tool to assess brain neurodegeneration, associated with cognitive decline independent of&#xD;
      personal interpretation and/or variance between clinicians and between medical facilities&#xD;
      would be highly valuable. This tool would allow the healthcare team to make appropriate&#xD;
      treatment decisions that could aid in neurodegenerative disease prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Neurosteer system provides objective neurological biomarkers using a wearable easy-to-use&#xD;
      affordable system. The system facilitate the capture and interpretation of EEG data with only&#xD;
      a single patch of electrodes, attached on the subject's forehead. Neurosteer examination&#xD;
      includes completing auditory tasks while measuring brain activity with the device. The data&#xD;
      is analyzed using machine learning methods to produce biomarkers, enabling a report of the&#xD;
      patient's activity in real time and offline. The examination is easy to preform and can be&#xD;
      conducted in every clinic or in patients' homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, clinical staff will identify potential subjects and will examine the&#xD;
      eligibility of subject according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research staff will&#xD;
      inform the patient on study's objective and design. Patients will sign the Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form (ICF). Research staff will set up an initial assessment session using the Neurosteer&#xD;
      system. In this session the patient will listen to the auditory assessment battery and&#xD;
      perform tasks. The patient will be re-examined in the same experimental setting over the next&#xD;
      7 days and at least 1 day later. Level of cognition will be assessed by Neurosteer&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;

    <measure>Correlation Between Cognition Level Changes as Evaluated by Current Clinical Tools (i.e. MMSE) and the Neurosteer Technology.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition level changes will be evaluated by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and by the Neurosteer system (single channel EEG recording during cognitive auditory tasks). Pearson correlation will be calculated using the mean activity of the EEG variables and each individual MMSE score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reproducibility of the pilot study results.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In a previous pilot study on a similar population of 50 subjects, biomarkers A0 and ST4 were found to be significantly correlated with MMSE score.The aim of this study is to further validate these results.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inter-patient variability between two consecutive measurement sessions.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>One limitation in the pilot study was high variability among subjects. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate within-patient variability. For this purpose, subjects in this study will undergo two consecutive assessments over a period of one week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differentiation between subjects who are at risk for cognitive decline and cognitively healthy subjects.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In the pilot study, biomarkers A0 and ST4 showed significant ability to differentiate between the group of seniors with cognitive decline and the group of cognitively healthy seniors. The aim of this study is to differentiate between subjects that are at risk for cognitive decline and the cognitively healthy subjects.</description>

    <description>The system is composed of hardware and software modules that facilitate the capture and interpretation of electrophysiological data as well as enable viewing the processed data in real time and offline. An electrode patch is attached on the subject's forehead to capture the electrophysiological signal. The signal is sent via low energy Bluetooth to an EEG Monitor. The signal is then sent via Wi-Fi to the cloud where the data is stored on a HIPAA compliant server. Data analysis performed in the cloud transforms the electrophysiological signal into easily readable data of brain activity, which is accessible via any web interface</description>
