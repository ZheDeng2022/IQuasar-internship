  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin ulcer is a common disease with complicated etiopathogenes, which makes it hard to be&#xD;
      cured. It has been reported that photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be used to treat skin ulcers&#xD;
      which were caused by different diseases. However, PDT is an expensive treatment and patients&#xD;
      always experience obvious pain during or after the treatment, which hinders the application&#xD;
      of PDT in skin ulcer. Our previous study found that PDT using a low concentration of&#xD;
      5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) could promote the healing of skin ulcer without obvious adverse&#xD;
      reactions, which suggests us that low concentration ALA-PDT might be an efficient and cost&#xD;
      effective treatment in skin ulcer. To further investigate the use of low concentration&#xD;
      ALA-PDT in skin ulcer, we plan to recruit patients with skin ulcers caused by different&#xD;
      diseases, and divide these patients into different groups according to their causes of&#xD;
      disease, and then treat them using low concentration ALA-PDT to observe the healing process&#xD;
      of skin ulcer. This study could further optimize and promote the use of low concentration&#xD;
      ALA-PDT in skin ulcer.&#xD;
