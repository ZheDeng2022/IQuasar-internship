      An Open Label, 3-arm, Randomised Phase II Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy of&#xD;
      Ponatinib in Combination With Either Chemotherapy or Blinatumomab With Imatinib Plus&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) develops when a certain type of immature bone marrow cell&#xD;
      called a lymphoblast becomes malignant, resulting in uncontrolled growth and suppression of&#xD;
      normal blood cell development. Leukemic blast cells accumulate in the bone marrow and blood&#xD;
      and may involve other organs such as the central nervous system (CNS). The most frequent&#xD;
      subtype of ALL observed in adults is caused by a genetic aberration called a Philadelphia&#xD;
      (Ph) chromosome and is thus referred to as Ph+ ALL. In this type of ALL, a gene called BCR&#xD;
      and a gene called ABL are fused by a process known as translocation. This leads to formation&#xD;
      of an atypical gene called BCR-ABL and formation of a protein known as the BCR-ABL&#xD;
      oncoprotein. This protein, a so-called tyrosine kinase, activates and disrupts many signaling&#xD;
      pathways in the cell and is directly responsible for the development of Ph+ ALL, which is one&#xD;
      of the most aggressive types of leukaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for Ph+ ALL were much improved by a family of drugs called tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKI), which bind to - and block the activity of - the BCR-ABL kinase. The first&#xD;
      of these drugs to be developed is called imatinib (brand name glivec), which has become a&#xD;
      standard component of therapy for Ph+ ALL worldwide, usually combined with steroids and/or&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy typically used for ALL. In the vast majority of patients, this&#xD;
      treatment is initially able to reduce the burden of the disease to a very low level (complete&#xD;
      remission). Unfortunately, the leukemic cells eventually become resistant to imatinib,&#xD;
      causing the disease to reappear (relapse). A commonly observed mechanism of resistance to TKI&#xD;
      is the development of mutations in the BCR-ABL gene, as a result of which the drug can no&#xD;
      longer bind to the kinase, leading to its reactivation. For this reason, stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation from a sibling or unrelated donor is considered the most effective treatment&#xD;
      to achieve cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last couple of years, 2nd generation TKI (Dasatinib and Nilotinib) which are more&#xD;
      active than imatinib have been tested in clinical trials in patients with Ph+ ALL. Although&#xD;
      these newer TKI show activity towards mutated BCR-ABL not inhibited by imatinib, the same&#xD;
      basic mechanisms of resistance apply to these drugs, and they have not been shown to result&#xD;
      in substantially longer survival than imatinib. In particular, a BCR-ABL mutation known as&#xD;
      T315I has been recognized to cause resistance to all approved 1st and 2nd generation TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a highly potent 3rd generation TKI called ponatinib has been developed and is&#xD;
      the only approved TKI shown to be active against the T315I and all other resistance&#xD;
      mutations. Initial studies combining ponatinib with chemotherapy have shown excellent&#xD;
      response rates and promising survival in adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL.&#xD;
      However, in this group of patients ponatinib has not yet been directly compared with any of&#xD;
      the other drugs, and there may be a moderately increased risk of vascular and cardiac adverse&#xD;
      events, such as heart attacks, strokes or thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on existing data, ponatinib shows great promise for treatment of Ph+ ALL, but its&#xD;
      superiority over standard imatinib-based therapy in terms of long-term efficacy and safety&#xD;
      need to be proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the main purpose of this trial to determine whether ponatinib is superior to imatinib&#xD;
      when combined with the same chemotherapy that is considered a standard for elderly patients&#xD;
      with Ph+ ALL. The study hypothesis is that a greater proportion of patients in the ponatinib&#xD;
      arm will achieve a deep (molecular) response, and that survival without leukemia relapse will&#xD;
      be superior. The side effects, safety and tolerability of the two treatment regimens will&#xD;
      also be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second trial question will explore whether chemotherapy can be omitted from the treatment&#xD;
      regimen by replacing it with an immunotherapy drug called blinatumomab. This is a type of&#xD;
      antibody that activated the patient´s own immune cells (T-cells) and directs them to the&#xD;
      leukaemia cells, which are then destroyed. This type of treatment has been very effective in&#xD;
      patients with ALL that did not respond or returned after other types of therapy, and has been&#xD;
      approved in the EU and USA as salvage therapy for ALL. By combining two very different types&#xD;
      of targeted therapy, the TKI ponatinib and the antibody blinatumomab, we hope to deliver&#xD;
      highly effective therapy for Ph+ ALL while eliminating the toxicity of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to compare these treatments, patients will be randomly assigned to the three&#xD;
      treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio, i.e. the likelihood to be assigned to each of the treatment&#xD;
      groups is the same. Overall duration of study treatment will be 2 years, followed by&#xD;
      treatment with the TKI alone.&#xD;
