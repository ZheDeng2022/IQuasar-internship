      A multicenter, open, single-arm phase I dose exploration and phase II extended study was&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and primary&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open, single-arm Phase I/II clinical study, which is divided&#xD;
      into two research parts, namely phase I dose exploration study and phase II dose extension&#xD;
      study. In the phase I dose exploration study, the safety, tolerance and PK characteristics of&#xD;
      FCN-011 in patients with advanced solid tumors were determined, the MTD of oral fCN-011 was&#xD;
      determined, and the RP2D of FCN-011 in the phase II clinical study was determined, and the&#xD;
      efficacy of FCN-011 was preliminarily evaluated. The phase II dose extension study evaluated&#xD;
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of continuous oral ADMINISTRATION of FCN-011 in&#xD;
      patients with inoperable NTRK fusion and advanced stage III or IV solid tumors, as well as&#xD;
      the characteristics of population pharmacokinetics (PopPK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 35-82 patients were enrolled in this study, 15-24 patients were expected to be&#xD;
      enrolled in the phase I study, and 20-58 patients were expected to be enrolled in the phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
