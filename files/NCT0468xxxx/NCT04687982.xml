  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional non-randomized trial. The duration of study will be 47 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After haploidentical transplantation, patients without complications, mainly a GVHD ≥ grade&#xD;
      2, will receive mDLI. mDLI consists of donor lymphocytes infusion, harvested by apheresis the&#xD;
      day before the day planned for infusion (or up to -7 days) as outpatient basis in the Day&#xD;
      Hospital using a cell separator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mDLIs preparation will be performed using a CliniMACS® (Miltenyi). A CD45RA-depletion&#xD;
      Product LineTM from Miltenyi, including disposable reagents and devices, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned number of mDLI is 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Day +50 (+/- 7 days) from allogenic transplant, 1st mDLI 5x105CD3+/kg of recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 4-6 weeks after 1st DLI, 2nd mDLI 1x106CD3+/kg of recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 4-6 weeks after 2nd DLI, 3rd mDLI 5x106CD3+/kg of recipient. Day +50 was chosen as the&#xD;
           starting time-point because at that time over two thirds of all acute GvHD episodes have&#xD;
           already occurred in the absence of DLI (internal data, median +49 after bone marrow, +27&#xD;
           after peripheral stem cells); acute GvHD will thus be less likely a confounding factor.&#xD;
           The choice of a maximum number of 3 mDLIs is based on the relatively narrow time&#xD;
           interval where outcome improvement is expected, that is mainly in the first 6 months&#xD;
           after haplo-HSCT. The planned doses are those mainly used in conventional DLIs during&#xD;
           haplo-HSCT setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping infusion rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If GvHD ≥ Grade 2 or relapse occurs, mDLIs will not be administered at any time and patient&#xD;
      will be permanently discontinued from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any severe adverse event (SAE) occurs after the first mDLI, the administration of mDLI&#xD;
      will be interrupted for a maximum of 6 weeks until event resolution. If the SAE does not&#xD;
      resolve after 6 weeks from last mDLI infusion, patient will be permanently discontinued. At&#xD;
      any time, the experimental treatment may be stopped according to clinical judgement or&#xD;
      patient's willing.&#xD;
