  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a gap in the literature about the feasibility and implementation of parent-led&#xD;
      support groups for parents who have children or adolescents with eating disorders. In this&#xD;
      study, we will be observing the experiences of 40 parents in Ontario who will virtually&#xD;
      participate in one of 3 parent-led support groups for parents of children and youth with&#xD;
      eating disorders. Parents will be expected to attend the virtual sessions twice a month over&#xD;
      the course of six months. We hope to evaluate the acceptability, cost, and parental outcomes&#xD;
      of the parent-led support groups via surveys before, during, and after the study, as well as&#xD;
      using a post-study interview.&#xD;

    <measure>Cost</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Carer Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Carer Burden will be assessed using the Eating Disorders Symptom Impact Scale (EDSIS) - a 24 item measure examining the impact of symptoms on parents' lives. Minimum score is 0, maximum score is 96. A higher score indicates that the child's eating disorder symptoms are having a greater impact on their parent (more burdensome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Carer Needs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Carer Needs will be assessed using the Carers Needs Assessment Measure (CaNAM), a 47-item questionnaire examining information received about eating disorders, support received from other people and organizations, support for self, and areas where help is needed. The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 64. A higher score indicates that the carer has received sufficient information and support for themselves and their child.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parental Self Efficacy and Collaboration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parental self-efficacy and collaboration will be assessed using the Patient and Carer Collaboration Scale -C (PACCS), a 33-item questionnaire examining constructs such as hope, self-care and compassion, externalization of the eating disorder, and boundaries. Each question is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100, where higher values indicate positive collaboration with their child and higher parental self efficacy.</description>
