      This project proposes to assess if Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) assisted cycling&#xD;
      can improve the cycling ability, muscle strength, cardiovascular health, quality of life,&#xD;
      self perception and functional mobility of adolescents with CP better than a volitional&#xD;
      cycling program or a non-intervention control group.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To compare the effects of 8-weeks of FES-assisted cycling training on improving&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, walking function, self-motivated exercise/recreation,&#xD;
      self-perception and functional mobility and quality of life of adolescents with spastic CP&#xD;
      with marginal walking ability (Gross Motor Function Classification System Levels II - IV) vs.&#xD;
      8-weeks of volitional cycling training and a non-intervention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the effects of 8-weeks FES-assisted cycling training on changes in cycling&#xD;
      ability of adolescents with spastic CP with marginal walking ability vs. 8-weeks of&#xD;
      volitional cycling training and a nonintervention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To elucidate the mechanisms for potential improvements in cycling ability after&#xD;
      8-weeks of FES-assisted or volitional cycling training of adolescents with spastic CP and&#xD;
      marginal walking ability.&#xD;

    <description>FES will be applied via surface electrodes placed over bilateral quadriceps muscles. FES-stimulation will be ramped from sensory level (the level at which the individual feels a cutaneous sensation from the stimulation) to the maximum-tolerated level using a closed loop system controlled by computer software Subjects will exercise at home, three times per week, with FES on for 8 weeks with a goal of attaining 30 minutes of continuous cycling per session. If the individuals are unable to cycle for 30 continuous minutes, rest breaks will be provided with a goal of cycling for a total of 30 minutes. The length of each session will be approximately 45 minutes, with 15 minutes of set-up and 30 minutes of cycling.</description>

    <ipd_description>The proposed experiments will generate data for publications in high quality peer reviewed journals. We will also present our findings at national meetings of neurorehabilitation scientists and clinicians and neuroscience and motor control meetings. To have the most impact, it is important that we present our findings to both clinicians and scientists, therefore, in addition to these standard approaches, we will seek out regular opportunities to present both the rationale and results of our work to local and regional clinicians as well as local and regional stroke support groups.</ipd_description>
