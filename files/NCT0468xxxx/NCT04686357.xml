  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the endometrium has been traditionally considered free of bacteria, recent studies&#xD;
      have documented the presence of an endometrial microbiome. The uterine microbiome can be&#xD;
      defined as Lactobacillus-dominated (&lt;90% Lactobacillus spp.) or non-Lactobacillus-dominated&#xD;
      (&lt;90% Lactobacillus spp. with &gt;10% of other bacteria). The presence of a pathogenic&#xD;
      microbiota in endometrium was associated with significant decrease in implantation,&#xD;
      pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy and live birth rates. Some of these pathogens microorganisms can&#xD;
      also produce infection and inflammation that may lead to chronic endometritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the endometrial microbiome can be investigated with the EMMA test and the most&#xD;
      known pathogens related with chronic endometritis can be detected with the ALICE test,both of&#xD;
      them developed by Igenomix group. Our goal in this project is to investigate at what extent,&#xD;
      if any, the analysis of the endometrial factor, at a microbiome level, in patients at their&#xD;
      first IVF cycle improves their clinical outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some authors have reported the existence of an endometrial microbiota present in healthy&#xD;
      woman and different from that in the vagina. It is well known that the presence of pathogens&#xD;
      (such as Gardnerella and Streptococcus) in the endometrium is related with infertility,&#xD;
      pregnancy loss, premature rupture of membranes and preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another factor which has an impact on infertility is Chronic Endometritis (CE). It consists&#xD;
      of a persistent inflammation of the endometrial mucosa and its prevalence in infertile&#xD;
      patients has been estimated to be between 2.8 and 39%, although this percentage can reach up&#xD;
      to 50 and 60% in patients with miscarriages and repeated implantation failure, respectively.&#xD;
      The most common cause of CE is bacterial infection, but the traditional methods of diagnosis&#xD;
      (histology, hysteroscopy and microbial culture) often give discordant results between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on all mentioned above, two molecular tests have been respectively developed by&#xD;
      Igenomix (an international company that provides leading advanced services in reproductive&#xD;
      genetics and infertility) to assess endometrial microbiome: EMMA (Endometrial Microbiome&#xD;
      Metagenomic Analysis) and ALICE (Analysis of Infectious Chronic Endometritis). EMMA test&#xD;
      analyses and quantifies all the bacteria present in the endometrium, showing the main&#xD;
      bacterial genera present in significant amount in an endometrial sample; while ALICE test&#xD;
      quantifies the amount of pathogens more often causing CE (Enterococcus spp.,&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia and Klebsiella), Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp.,&#xD;
      Mycoplasma spp., and Ureaplasma spp.), Chlamydia and Neisseria, also in an endometrial&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project aims to investigate in a randomized way the potential improvement on the&#xD;
      clinical outcome of Chinese infertile patients at their first IVF cycle considering a&#xD;
      personalized diagnosis and treatment (when applicable) of their endometrial microbiome status&#xD;
      with the EMMA/ALICE. To do that, only the outcomes of the first single embryo transfers&#xD;
      performed after the inclusion of each patient will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a 30% of possible drop-outs, a total of 1018 patients will be recruited (509&#xD;
      randomized in each group). They will be allocated on a balanced way (assigned by chance like&#xD;
      the flip of a coin) in one of the two arms described below. Reproductive outcomes (defined&#xD;
      following The International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, 2017) will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data exported from the source documents will be duly codified and treated in order to protect&#xD;
      the clinical and personal information of participants in accordance with the current local&#xD;
      legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the statistical analysis performed on the data, as well as the procedures, will be&#xD;
      registered in a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be developed during the&#xD;
      study and before starting data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of this data is planned once 50% of the recruitment has been achieved.&#xD;
      Besides and at that same moment, the study will be overseen by an independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the statistical procedures will be done systematically by both, intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis (ITT) and per protocol analysis (PP). The ITT analysis will include all randomized&#xD;
      patients recruited and assigned to one of the two groups after biopsy collection and before&#xD;
      randomization. The PP analysis will be applied to those patients who adequately follow the&#xD;
      protocol assigned according to their group and in whom the transfer of the good quality&#xD;
      blastocyst is performed.&#xD;
