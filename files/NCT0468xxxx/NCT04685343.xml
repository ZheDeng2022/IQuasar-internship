  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use primary dysmenorrhea (PD; menstrual pain without an identified organic&#xD;
      cause) as a model to examine biomarkers associated with menstrual and non-menstrual bodily&#xD;
      pain in adolescent girls, ages 14-18. Participants will undergo extensive phenotyping&#xD;
      including pain inhibition testing and multimodal neuroimaging to obtain indices brain&#xD;
      structure and function at baseline and 12 months later. Menstrual pain severity and&#xD;
      non-menstrual bodily pain will be assessed monthly for 24 months. Aims of the study are: 1)&#xD;
      to identify the central mechanisms of PD using measures of pain inhibition and brain&#xD;
      structure and connectivity of sensorimotor, default, emotional arousal, and salience&#xD;
      networks, 2) to determine deficits in pain inhibition and alterations in brain structure and&#xD;
      network connectivity that predict the one-year developmental trajectories of menstrual pain&#xD;
      and non-menstrual bodily pain, and 3) to identify the dynamic relationship between&#xD;
      alterations in pain inhibition and brain structure and connectivity with symptom change in&#xD;
      menstrual pain and non-menstrual bodily pain. We hypothesize that deficits in endogenous pain&#xD;
      inhibition and alterations in brain structure, connectivity, and function of regional&#xD;
      networks will be positively associated with menstrual pain severity ratings at baseline and&#xD;
      predict the trajectory of menstrual and non-menstrual bodily pain over 2 years. The results&#xD;
      are expected to identify specific mechanisms and characteristics that predict the transition&#xD;
      from acute/cyclical pain to persistent or chronic pain, which will support the development of&#xD;
      therapies to prevent the transition from recurrent to chronic pain in adulthood.&#xD;
