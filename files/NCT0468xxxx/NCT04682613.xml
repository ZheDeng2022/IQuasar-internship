  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster-Randomized Clinical trial, which includes the development and activation of an&#xD;
      intervention program among young adolescents and their teachers. Study hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      intervention program will yield improvement in adolescents whose teachers participated in the&#xD;
      program, in comparison with the adolescents whose teachers weren't involved in the&#xD;
      intervention. Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the&#xD;
      participants before, after, and three months after the completion of the program. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good psychometric qualities. The&#xD;
      study protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board. Parents of all&#xD;
      student participants in the intervention and in the control group, as well as teachers&#xD;
      involved in the program, received information about the program and the study and were asked&#xD;
      to provide informed consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early adolescent (10-13 years) is characterized by hormonal changes and accelerated&#xD;
      physiological growth. Significant risk factors for the physical and mental health of children&#xD;
      and adolescents include, among other things, disordered eating patterns, overweight and&#xD;
      reduced physical activity, low self-esteem and negative body image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;In Favor of Myself&quot; is a preventive intervention program. The program's primary goal is to&#xD;
      increase adolescents' self-esteem and to prevent negative self-image and body image, as well&#xD;
      as to development media literacy. In this study, the investigators will focus on the &quot;Young&#xD;
      In Favor of Myself &quot; program, designed for ages 10-12, grades 5 and 6, and its main goal is&#xD;
      the development of self-care behaviors, media literacy, positive self-esteem, and body-image.&#xD;
      To increase the effect of &quot;Young In Favor of Myself &quot; program, on the adolescents, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed a teacher component as an addition to the school-based&#xD;
      intervention, usually delivered by college students. The study will first assess the&#xD;
      teachers' influence on the program, and then evaluate the difference in adolescent outcomes&#xD;
      from the program with or without this supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the participants&#xD;
      (both teachers and adolescents) before, after, and three months after the completion of the&#xD;
      program. The questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good psychometric&#xD;
      qualities. The study protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board.&#xD;
      Parents of all participants, in the intervention and in the control group, as well as&#xD;
      teachers involved in the program, received information about the program and the study and&#xD;
      were asked to provide informed consent.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Sociocultural Attitudes towards Appearance Questionnaire-4, Affects by Media subscale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured three times over six months: at baseline, at program termination (immediately after last session), and three months after the completion of the program, measuring a change in scores</time_frame>
    <description>The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (Schaefer et al., 2015). The investigators included the Media subscale, including 4 items. Items are rated on a 5-point scale: (1) always, (2) often, (3) sometimes, (4) rarely, (5) never. The total score is based on computing the average. A higher score indicates higher pressure from the media to change one's look.&#xD;
The scale will only be used in the child questionnaire, not in the teacher version.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured three times over six months: at baseline, at program termination (immediately after last session), and three months after the completion of the program, measuring a change in scores</time_frame>
    <description>Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965)- 10 items. Scoring involves a method of combined ratings. Low self-esteem responses are &quot;disagree&quot; or &quot;strongly disagree&quot; on items 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and &quot;strongly agree&quot; or &quot;agree&quot; on items 2, 5, 6, 8, 9. Two or three out of three correct responses to items 3, 7, and 9 are scored as one item. One or two out of two correct responses for items 4 and 5 are considered as a single item; items 1,8, and 10 are scored as individual items; and combined correct responses (one or two out of two) to items 2 and 6 are considered to be a single item.&#xD;
The scale will only be used in the child questionnaire, not in the teacher version.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Body Esteem Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured three times over six months: at baseline, at program termination (immediately after last session), and three months after the completion of the program, measuring a change in scores</time_frame>
    <description>Body Esteem Scale- This questionnaire examines self-esteem of body and physical appearance and consists of 3 subscales: appearance (10 items), weight (8 items) and attribution 187 to others (5 items). Items are rated on a 5-point scale: (1) never, (2) rarely, (3) sometimes, (4) 188 often, and (5) always. A higher score indicates higher body-esteem (Mendelson, Mendelson, &amp; White, 2001) The scale will be used in both the child and teacher questionnaire versions.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Child- Eating Disorder Examination- Questionnaire (Ch-EDE-Q8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured three times over six months: at baseline, at program termination (immediately after last session), and three months after the completion of the program, measuring a change in scores</time_frame>
    <description>Child Eating Disorder Examination- Questionnaire short version (EDE-Q8). The items are rated on a 6-point scale: (1) never, (2) rarely, (3) sometimes, (4) often, (5) usually, and (6) always. EDE-Q provides assessment of eating disorder psychopathology related to anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED). (Kliem et al, 2016) The scale will only be used in the child questionnaire, not in the teacher version.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Advertising Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured three times over six months: at baseline, at program termination (immediately after last session), and three months after the completion of the program, measuring a change in scores</time_frame>
    <description>The Advertising scale contains 1 item- Identification of strategies used by media. This question is reflected as a protective factor. It contains 8 different strategies which participants choose from: higher number of strategies identified indicate better media literacy. (Golan et al., 2013).&#xD;
The scale will only be used in the child questionnaire, not in the teacher version.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Self-Care behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured three times over six months: at baseline, at program termination (immediately after last session), and three months after the completion of the program, measuring a change in scores</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by Prof. Moria Golan and assessed in previous research. Includes 14 items which are rated on a 4-point scale: (1) never, (2) rarely, (3) sometimes, (4) always. Items are summed, and higher scores indicate higher self-care behaviors. This questionnaire was designed to assess self care behaviors in adolescents.&#xD;
The scale will only be used in the child questionnaire, not in the teacher version.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured three times over six months: at baseline, at program termination (immediately after last session), and three months after the completion of the course, measuring a change in scores</time_frame>
    <description>The CD-RISC is based on Connor and Davidson's operational definition of resilience, which is the ability to &quot;thrive in the face of adversity.&quot; The scale includes 25 items, from 5 sub-scales:&#xD;
Personal competence, high standards, and tenacity Trust in one's instincts, tolerance of negative affect, and strengthening effects of stress Positive acceptance of change and secure relationships Control Spiritual influences Scoring: Scoring of the scale is based on summing the total of all items, each of which is scored from 0-4. For the CD-RISC-25, the full range is therefore from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. (Connor KM, Davidson JRT. Depression and Anxiety 2003; 18: 71-82).&#xD;
The scale will only be used in the teacher questionnaire, not in the child version.</description>
