  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study wants to develop advanced imaging methods to more accurately characterize&#xD;
      prostate cancer or solid tumor aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study involves [18F]DCFPyL positron emission tomography and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (PET/MRI)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational imaging study to evaluate the value of multimodal [18F]DCFPyL&#xD;
      positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) for solid tumor&#xD;
      characterization and disease staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit, and 1-3 study Multimodal [18F]DCFPyL PET/MRI visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two cohorts of participants will be enrolled in this study: primary prostate cancer&#xD;
           patients and patients with known or suspected solid tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma,&#xD;
           glioma, clear cell renal carcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 135 people will take part in this research study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The PET dye used in this study is called [18F]DCFPyL. [18F]DCFPyL is not approved&#xD;
                by the U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA). This means [18F]DCFPyL can only be&#xD;
                used in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The PET/MRI scanner was approved by the U.S. FDA.&#xD;

    <measure>Scan-rescan repeatability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate statistical significance using a multilevel analysis to accommodate the nested structure of the data (longitudinal correlated data). Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to assess for differences in each imaging parameter across visits. Spearman rank correlation will be used to test the correlation between [18F]-DCFPyL binding as measured by standardized uptake values (SUV) and Ktrans or SUV and cerebral blood flow (CBF). The false discovery rate will be used to adjust for multiple testing.</description>
