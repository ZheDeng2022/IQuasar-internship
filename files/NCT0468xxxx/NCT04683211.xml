      Iodine supplementation during pregnancy is recommended by the high health authority and by&#xD;
      the World Health Organization during pregnancy. We would like to know if this supplementation&#xD;
      is prescribed in a manner consistent with the recommendations in women diagnosed with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes.&#xD;

      Physiological iodine requirements are increased in pregnant women, from 150 μg / day to 250&#xD;
      μg / day. The iodine intake is assessed by the iodine concentration in the urine, the target&#xD;
      of which in pregnant women is ioduria between 150 and 250 μg / l. The general French&#xD;
      population is not deficient in iodine according to the national nutrition health study in&#xD;
      2006-2007, with a median ioduria of 136 μg / l (therefore greater than 100 μg / l) for all&#xD;
      elderly adults aged 18-74. However, according to French studies, the median ioduria of&#xD;
      pregnant women is between 50 and 100 μg / l, which suggests a moderate iodine deficiency. To&#xD;
      maintain euthyroidism, the mother must increase her T4 production by 40- 50% (10-150%), which&#xD;
      requires an additional iodine intake of 150-250 μg / d The thyroid contains a reserve of&#xD;
      iodine, but this is depleted during pregnancy in the absence of supplementation. Our study&#xD;
      therefore aims to assess the amount of iodine supplementation prescribed in pregnant women&#xD;
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes because this group of patients benefit from early&#xD;
      specialized care for their pregnancies.&#xD;
