  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In chronic diseases such as rheumatic diseases, it is important to direct the treatment of&#xD;
      the disease and to evaluate the disease perception in terms of the course of the disease. As&#xD;
      a result of this study, this questionnaire, which will help us gain information about the&#xD;
      perception of the disease specific to rheumatic diseases, will be translated into Turkish.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease perception is the cognitive aspect of the disease state. Although they experience the&#xD;
      same disease in a certain period of their lives, the methods of meeting the disease and&#xD;
      coping with the disease differ. Patients try to explain their illnesses in the light of their&#xD;
      personal experiences, knowledge, values, beliefs and needs. People create cognitive models to&#xD;
      explain and predict events in the outside world. Patients also develop similar patterns of&#xD;
      symptoms of transient or long-term disease. Leventhal et al. suggested that patients formed&#xD;
      their own coping mechanisms with these cognitive models and developed the self-regulation&#xD;
      theory. According to this theory, people create schemas about illness and life-threatening&#xD;
      situations in their minds with the information presented to them from concrete and abstract&#xD;
      sources. These cognitive models also include beliefs about treatment and control of the&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified more than 200 musculoskeletal diseases,&#xD;
      the most common being rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The biopsychosocial model has&#xD;
      been drawing attention in rheumatological rehabilitation in recent years. This model&#xD;
      acknowledges that the experiences and symptoms of the disease are affected by biological,&#xD;
      psychological and social factors. The dysfunction is not only related to the severity of the&#xD;
      disease, but also to how the disease is perceived. The patient's beliefs and perceptions&#xD;
      about his illness show how the illness affects him both physically and emotionally. Disease&#xD;
      perception is based not only on symptoms but also on disease-related consequences, concerns,&#xD;
      and past illness experiences of the patient. Recent studies emphasize the importance of&#xD;
      disease perception in explaining the difference in treatment outcomes in chronic diseases,&#xD;
      including rheumatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was planned to determine the validity and reliability of the Disease Perception Scale in&#xD;
      Rheumatic Diseases due to the importance of treatment in rheumatic diseases and the&#xD;
      evaluation of disease perception in terms of the course of the disease.&#xD;

    <measure>1) Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>The first test is made when the patient is directed by the physician. Seventh day after test, re-test is made. For test-retest, the questionnaire will be repeated 7 days apart.</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ has sub-sections that evaluate the inadequacy index (20 questions), pain (one question) and global health status (one question). The last week is questioned in the survey.There are 8 sections: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 2 or 3 questions for each section. Scoring within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). For each section the score given to that section is the worst score within the section, i.e. if one question is scored 1 and another 2, then the score for the section is 2.</description>

    <measure>2) Nottingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>The first test is made when the patient is directed by the physician. Seventh day after test, re-test is made. For test-retest, the questionnaire will be repeated 7 days apart.</time_frame>
    <description>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) is a measurement tool that evaluates the health problems of individuals and how these problems affect their daily activities.The questionnaire is divided into two parts. The first parts comprises 38 questions in six categories: sleep, physical mobility, energy, pain, emotional reactions, and social isolation. This first section is weighted to reflect how severe an impact the respondent thinks their health is having on the above areas of life. The second part of the NHP is made up of seven statements about areas of life that are commonly affected by health: paid employment, jobs around the house, social life, personal relationships, sex life, hobbies and interests, and holidays. Scores on the NHP can range from 0 i.e. no distress to 100 i.e severe distress.</description>

    <measure>Rheumatic Disease Illness Perception Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The first test is made when the patient is directed by the physician. Seventh day after test, re-test is made. For test-retest, the questionnaire will be repeated 7 days apart.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire consisting of 11 questions that evaluates the cognitive and emotional perception of the disease in individuals with rheumatic disease. The cause and consequences of the disease, the extent to which the patient understands his / her illness, and the emotional changes in the course of the disease and the disease are questioned.</description>
