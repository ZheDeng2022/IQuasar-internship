  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilonidal sinus disease is an acquired disorder of the natal cleft and its incidence is&#xD;
      reported as 6 in 100,000. Although there are many opinions regarding the treatment of&#xD;
      pilonidal sinus disease in the literature, surgery is the main treatment method. Regardless&#xD;
      of the treatment protocol, this disease has a certain risk of recurrence. Therefore, the&#xD;
      ideal treatment procedure for the pilonidal disease should be simple to perform, should allow&#xD;
      patients to return earlier to work, should be associated with minimal pain, and should&#xD;
      minimize financial cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenol application into the pilonidal sinus is an additional nonoperative adjunct to&#xD;
      treatment. This method is typically used after all hair and debris have been removed or&#xD;
      curetted from the sinus, and it helps to eliminate granulation tissue and further debris&#xD;
      formation. The injection is followed by hair control and strict hygiene. The use of phenol&#xD;
      causes an intense inflammatory reaction which destroys the epithelial lining, and care should&#xD;
      be taken to protect the surrounding skin. Pain is intense and may require inpatient admission&#xD;
      for pain control but success rates have been reported to range from 60% to 95%. However, it&#xD;
      is difficult to know which patients can expect enough benefit from phenol application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the factors affecting the outcomes of patients with the&#xD;
      pilonidal disease treated with crystallized phenol and to evaluate long-term recurrence rates&#xD;
      of pilonidal disease treated with crystallized phenol.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phenol application into the pilonidal sinus is an additional nonoperative adjunct to&#xD;
      treatment. This method is typically used after all hair and debris have been removed or&#xD;
      curetted from the sinus, and it helps to eliminate granulation tissue and further debris&#xD;

      for pain control but success rates have been reported to range from 60% to 95%. However, it&#xD;
      is difficult to know which patients can expect enough benefit from phenol application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the procedure will be performed on an outpatient basis and the treatment&#xD;
      procedure will be performed in the prone position. Previously shaved sacrococcygeal area will&#xD;
      be cleaned with an antiseptic solution and local anesthesia will be achieved using 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine (1:100,000 adrenaline). After sinuses are dilated with a mosquito clamp; hair,&#xD;
      debris, and granulation tissue will be removed from the sinus tracts using a curved surgical&#xD;
      forceps and the tracts will be curetted using a straight curette. Following the protection of&#xD;
      the skin surrounding the sinus openings with a pomade and the perianal area with a sponge,&#xD;
      the sinus cavity will be sclerosed using crystallized phenol. Crystallized phenol will be&#xD;
      inserted into the sinus tract from the dilated sinus opening with a clamp until the tract is&#xD;
      full. This procedure will repeat twice and each phenol particles will remain in sinus about&#xD;
      one minute, and then will be removed by applying pressure. Consequently, the procedure will&#xD;
      be completed after dressing and the patient will be sent home by prescribing an analgesic&#xD;
      pill (paracetamol 500 mg) to use only when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients are divided into two groups: (1) those successfully treated and (2) those&#xD;
      with treatment failure, descriptive statistics will be presented as the means +/- standard&#xD;
      deviations (SDs), medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), and frequencies (%). Examinations&#xD;
      of normal distribution assumptions for continuous variables will be visually assessed with&#xD;
      quartile-quartile plots and histograms and confirmed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Associations&#xD;
      between variables will be evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U and Student's t tests (for&#xD;
      continuous variables) or Pearson's chi-square and Fisher exact tests (for categorical&#xD;
      variables), where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of treatment success with demographics, symptom duration, and pilonidal sinus&#xD;
      features such as the number and location of the sinuses, the amount of hair inside the sinus,&#xD;
      the volume of the sinus tract, and the length of sinus tract will be analyzed with logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis. First, each covariate will be analyzed in a univariate model, and all&#xD;
      variables with p-value less than 0.20 will be included in the final multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression model to determine independent factors. Odds ratios (ORs) of statistically&#xD;
      significant predictors will be presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). P values lower&#xD;
      than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
