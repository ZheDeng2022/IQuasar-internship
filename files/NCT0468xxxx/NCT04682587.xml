  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess how dose reductions or treatment interruptions related to axitinib can be&#xD;
      implemented to manage and resolve adverse events occurring among patients with advanced renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma treated with first-line axitinib in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab&#xD;

      The specific objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe incident adverse events (AEs) experienced among patients with advanced RCC who&#xD;
      received first-line axitinib in combination with immuno-oncology (IO) therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type and seriousness of AEs (ie, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, palmar plantar&#xD;
           erythrodysesthesia [hand-foot syndrome]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients who experienced repeated AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from treatment initiation to AE onset, overall and by type and seriousness of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients with advanced RCC who developed incident AEs while receiving first line&#xD;
      axitinib in combination with IO therapies, characterize and describe management strategies&#xD;
      for AEs, stratified by type and seriousness of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients who used each of the following management strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No action for axitinib and IO therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No action for axitinib, but treatment modification for IO therapy (ie, treatment&#xD;
           interruption, treatment discontinuation);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axitinib dose reduction, but no action for IO therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axitinib treatment interruption, but no action for IO therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axitinib treatment discontinuation, but no action for IO therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axitinib dose reduction, and treatment modification for IO therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axitinib treatment interruption, and treatment modification for IO therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axitinib treatment discontinuation, and treatment modification for IO therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average axitinib dose reduction (absolute and percentage change), where applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of treatment interruption, where applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the frequency of and time to AE resolution (from AE onset and initiation of management&#xD;
      strategy, separately) among patients with advanced RCC who developed incident AEs while&#xD;
      receiving first-line axitinib in combination with IO therapies according to different&#xD;
      management strategies implemented, stratified further by type and seriousness of AEs, as&#xD;
      allowed by sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above objectives will also be conducted for repeated AEs of the same type&#xD;
