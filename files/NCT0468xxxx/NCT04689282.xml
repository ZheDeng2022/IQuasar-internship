  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed an innovative proof-of-concept trial designed to provide data&#xD;
      as to whether the speech difficulties in children with developmental dysphasia (DD) are&#xD;
      improved with intranasal inhalations of bioactive factors (BF), produced by macrophages of M2&#xD;
      phenotype (M2-BFs). The rationale for this approach is the ability of central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) to repair and the important role of macrophages in the regulation of this process. It&#xD;
      was found that type 2 macrophages (M2) have anti-inflammatory and neurorestorative potential,&#xD;
      in contrast to pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects of М1 cells. The influence of M2 is&#xD;
      largely realized through the production of a wide spectrum of bioactive factors (cytokines,&#xD;
      chemokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, microvesicles etc) that inhibit inflammation,&#xD;
      protect neurons from apoptosis, stimulate neurogenesis, the growth and remyelination of&#xD;
      axons, the formation of new synapses and activate angiogenesis. This study uses M2-BFs, as&#xD;
      therapeutic tool, and intranasal administration focusing on nose to brain transport, as a&#xD;
      mode of delivery. Expected clinical effects in treated children: improvement of speech&#xD;
      understanding, word formation, grammatical structure of speech and formation of coherent&#xD;
      speech.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroinflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of any damage to the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) profoundly affecting the ability of neural cells to survive and to&#xD;
      regenerate. Macrophages play a key role in the regulation of neuroinflammation, but their&#xD;
      role is ambiguous. In fact, macrophages can both induce neuronal and glial toxicity and&#xD;
      promote tissue repair. The opposite effects of macrophages are largely due to their&#xD;
      plasticity and functional heterogeneity. Thus, classical pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1)&#xD;
      are tissue-destructive, while anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages mediate tissue repair. In&#xD;
      addition, M2 predominantly induce the Th2 response, which is particularly beneficial in CNS&#xD;
      repair. Using low serum conditions the investigators have generated M2-like macrophages and&#xD;
      evaluated their phenotypic and functional features [1]. The data indicate that M2, in&#xD;
      contrast to pro-inflammatory M1, produced significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-18, IL-12), chemokines (IL-8, monocyte&#xD;
      chemoattractant protein 1-1) and Th1/Th2-cytokines (interferon-γ, IL-2, IL-4) coupled with a&#xD;
      high IL-10 level. M2 were capable of producing neurotrophic (brain-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
      factor, insulin-like growth factor-1), angiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor), and&#xD;
      other growth factors (erythropoietin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, basic fibroblast&#xD;
      growth factor, epidermal growth factor) with neuroprotective and regenerative activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and clinical efficacy of intrathecal&#xD;
      administration of M2 in children with severe cerebral palsy [2, 3] and in nonacute stroke&#xD;
      patients [4]. Moreover, intranasal delivery of M2 macrophage-derived soluble products reduces&#xD;
      neuropsychological deficit in patients with cerebrovascular disease [5]. Given this data, the&#xD;
      investigators expect that intranasal administration of the M2-BFs (Bioactive Factors) will&#xD;
      reduce the severity of speech disorders in children, including improving speech&#xD;
      understanding, sensorimotor speech level, word formation skills, as well as the formation of&#xD;
      the grammatical structure of speech and coherent speech. Of note, intranasal administration&#xD;
      of M2 soluble factors allow to delivery bioactive agents to brain through the olfactory and&#xD;
      trigeminal ways across brain-blood barrier.&#xD;
