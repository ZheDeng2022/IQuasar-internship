      There are two specific aims in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine if melatonin results in a higher grade of clinical response than&#xD;
      does placebo in children with functional dyspepsia (FD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: treatment of FD with melatonin will result in a higher grade of clinical response&#xD;
      than will treatment with a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the relationship between changes in sleep and improvement in pain in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with functional dyspepsia receiving melatonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be no association between improvement in pain and improvement in sleep&#xD;
      in children with functional dyspepsia receiving melatonin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent abdominal pain is present in a significant proportion of the pediatric population&#xD;
      at large. Often times, no clear organic cause for pain will be found, and these children are&#xD;
      diagnosed with functional abdominal pain. Of the children with functional abdominal pain,&#xD;
      many are classified as having functional dyspepsia (FD). Functional dyspepsia is defined as&#xD;
      persistent or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen (above the&#xD;
      umbilicus) that is unrelated to a change in stool frequency or form and not exclusively&#xD;
      relieved by defecation. There have been only a few placebo controlled trials of medications&#xD;
      in children with abdominal pain and none in children specifically with functional dyspepsia&#xD;
      and uninvestigated mucosal inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence suggesting that melatonin plays a role in pain modulation.&#xD;
      Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and is recognized for its regulation of sleep and&#xD;
      circadian functions. Less widely recognized is melatonin's production in other parts of the&#xD;
      body; such as in the digestive system and in immune cells including mast cells. The total&#xD;
      amount of melatonin in the digestive system exceeds that of the pineal gland and blood.&#xD;
      Within the digestive tract, melatonin is produced in the enterochromaffin cells. It exerts&#xD;
      both excitatory and inhibitory effects on the enteric nervous system as well as possessing&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. In a rat model of reflux esophagitis,&#xD;
      melatonin demonstrated multiple effects on the esophageal mucosa. These included decreased&#xD;
      lipid peroxidation (oxidative degradation of lipids in cell membranes which leads to cell&#xD;
      damage), replenished superoxide dismutase and glutathione (improved defense of the mucosa),&#xD;
      and decreased expression of T helper 1 cytokines (pro-inflammatory cytokines) while not&#xD;
      altering anti inflammatory cytokines. These effects may account for the reduction in pain in&#xD;
      adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and dyspepsia during a trial of melatonin therapy.&#xD;
      In a study of adults with IBS in association with sleep disturbances, patients were given&#xD;
      melatonin 3mg or placebo at bedtime for two weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the group&#xD;
      who received melatonin had significantly lower mean abdominal pain scores while sleep&#xD;
      parameters were not influenced. In a study of adults with functional dyspepsia, twelve weeks&#xD;
      of melatonin (5 mg taken at bedtime) resulted in 56.6% of patients having complete resolution&#xD;
      of symptoms and 30% having partial improvement, while only 6.7% of the patients who received&#xD;
      placebo experienced any improvement in symptoms. Melatonin has not been previously studied in&#xD;
      children with abdominal pain. Evaluation of its effects is warranted as melatonin would be a&#xD;
      very safe and inexpensive alternative treatment.&#xD;
