      This Expanded Access Program will allow clinicians to use sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with serious or immediately life-threatening complicated urinary&#xD;
      tract infection due to quinolone-nonsusceptible uropathogens where there are no satisfactory&#xD;
      oral alternatives to use as step-down therapy after receiving an initial course of effective&#xD;
      intravenous therapy. The recommended dose of sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid 500 mg/ 500 mg&#xD;
      is one bilayer tablet orally twice daily, taken with food whenever possible. No dose&#xD;
      adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. Duration of therapy will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the prescribing clinician, depending on the type of infection being treated and&#xD;
      the response to therapy, and is expected to be less than ten days total.&#xD;
