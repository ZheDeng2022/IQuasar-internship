    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the glucose control and hypoglycemic prevention effect of&#xD;
      using continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS) in patients with type 1 diabetes. This is a&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled, single-center clinical study. Patients will randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to either CGMS or conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) group. After 12 weeks&#xD;
      of applying the CGMS sensors, the improvement of parameters collected from the CGMS will be&#xD;
      estimated in comparison with data collected from the SMBG.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will randomized 1:1 to either continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS) or conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) group. After the randomization, patients in CGMS group will given education on how to use the device and check the result using the smart phone. The data collected from the sensors were computed to generate the respective ambulatory glucose profiles so as to determine the total numbers of scans conducted during the study period.</description>
