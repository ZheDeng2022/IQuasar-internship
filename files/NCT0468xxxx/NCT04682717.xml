  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of hemodynamic aberrations during anesthesia on adverse outcomes is an&#xD;
      important clinical issue. There is evidence that hypotension and hypertension during general&#xD;
      anesthesia are independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients having both&#xD;
      noncardiac and cardiac surgery.One of the intervals of general anesthesia during which&#xD;
      hypotension is prevalent is the period after the induction of anesthesia but before the onset&#xD;
      of surgical stimulation. This period is particularly prone to decreased vigilance with regard&#xD;
      to hemodynamic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistically significant predictors of hypotension 0-10 min after anesthetic induction&#xD;
      included: ASA III-V, baseline MAP &lt;70 mm Hg, age &gt; or =50 years, the use of propofol for&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia, and increasing induction dosage of fentanyl.While the potential&#xD;
      preoperative factors associated with hypotension 5-10 min after the induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      in patients with ASA I-II included baseline MAP 70 mm Hg, age &gt; 50 years, use of propofol&#xD;
      during induction, and magnitude of fentanyl dose during induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfusion index (PI) is a relatively new parameter estimating the pulsatility of blood in the&#xD;
      extremities, calculated using infrared spectrum as part of plethysmography waveform&#xD;
      processing. It is a simple,cost-effective and non-invasive method of assessing peripheral&#xD;
      perfusion determined by the percentage of pulsatile to non-pulsatile blood flow in the&#xD;
      extremities. PI indicates the status of the microcirculation which is densely innervated by&#xD;
      sympathetic nerves, and therefore, is affected by multiple factors responsible for&#xD;
      vasoconstriction or vasodilatation of the microvasculature.It is an indicator of systemic&#xD;
      vascular resistance (SVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PI is said to be useful in monitoring depth of anesthesia, hypothermia, successful epidural&#xD;
      placement in parturients, adequate relief from ureteric obstruction, response to fluid&#xD;
      therapy in critically ill and intraoperative patients and adequacy of circulation in&#xD;
      newborn.The value of PI is inversely related to the vascular tone, though not in a linear&#xD;
      fashion. Therefore, vasodilatation reflecting higher baseline PI has been associated with&#xD;
      reductions in blood pressure (BP) following spinal anesthesia.The resting SVR can influence&#xD;
      incidence and severity of post-spinal hypotension in parturients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been established that a positive correlation between pre-anesthetic plethysmographic&#xD;
      variability index (PVI) and reduction in BP following induction of anesthesia using propofol&#xD;
      in healthy adults, that is, higher PVI was associated with more mean arterial pressure (MAP)&#xD;
      reductions. Similarly, a significant proportion of hypotension after induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      with propofol can be attributed to the baseline SVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mehandale SG. and Rajasekhar P. underwent A prospective observational study on fifty adults&#xD;
      for the use of Perfusion index as a predictor of hypotension following propofol induction and&#xD;
      revealed that a baseline PI &lt;1.05 predicted incidence of hypotension at 5 min with&#xD;
      sensitivity 93%, specificity 71%, positive predictive value (PPV) 68% and negative predictive&#xD;
      value (NPV) 98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the hypothesised was that it is possible to define a threshold baseline value of PI that&#xD;
      predicts hypotension based on individual's pre-induction SVR in patients &gt; 65 years old&#xD;
      following anesthetic induction with propofol and fentanyl as multifactorial risk for&#xD;
      postinduction hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cut-off value of baseline PI below which hypotension at 5 min post induction could be&#xD;
      predicted will be the primary outcome, while positive and negative predictive values at 15&#xD;
      minutes will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Hemodynamic parameters will be recorded at 1-min intervals till 10 min after intubation. Hypotension will be defined as a drop in SBP to &lt;30% of baseline or absolute MAP &lt;60 mmHg. MAP &lt;55 mmHg (severe hypotension) will be treated immediately by rapid intravenous fluid administration (10 ml/kg) and ephedrine sulphate 6 mg IV boluses. Bradycardia will be defined as HR &lt;50 bpm or decrease by more than 30% below baseline value, whichever will be lower and will be treated with atropine 0.6 mg IV boluses. The incidence of hypotension will be calculated in 2 sets - 5 min after induction of anesthesia (effect of induction agent) and first 15 min after induction (effect of induction process and endotracheal intubation).</description>
