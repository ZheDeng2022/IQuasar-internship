  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: The aim of the present study was to analyse the effects of training performed on a&#xD;
      rotating, motorised platform (the Huber/SpineForce device from LPG Systems, Valence, France)&#xD;
      intended to reduce the risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: any patient 1) benefiting from a physiotherapy rehabilitation program at the CHU&#xD;
      Liège, CNRF, Belgium; 2) presenting a pathological situation justifying functional&#xD;
      rehabilitation with HUBER 360®; 3) presenting any pathology not constituting an exclusion&#xD;
      criterion; 4) giving informed consent to research will be include in this 8-week&#xD;
      interventional trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: randomized open-label trial. Patients will be randomized into the intervention group&#xD;
      (HUBER trainig, 45 minutes of training, twice a week during 8 weeks) or in the control group&#xD;
      (standard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: the effect of the training will be measured on the Time-Up-and-Go test, on the&#xD;
      Short-Physical performance battery test and on quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>HUBER is an isometric strengthening device. It consists of an oval motorized platform, which performs rotating, oscillatory movements with a controlled amplitude and speed.&#xD;
Intervention will consist of 2 sessions of HUBER per week. Each session lasts approximatively 30 minutes. The intervention is 8 weeks long.</description>

    <description>The HUBER® device consists of an oval motorized platform, which performs rotating, oscillatory movements with a controlled amplitude and speed. It also comprises, two large handles with force sensors, mounted on a movable column. Its originality is based on its capacity to capture simultaneously the subjects' balance, core stability, core strength and total body strength; and adapt the training accordingly. Indeed, the platform interferes with the balance of the patient who must continually adjust his/her posture by exerting isometric pushing and pulling efforts with the arms. As a result, the device provides postural and muscle adaptation with visual feedback. Due to the constant adaptation of the device, it is thought to enhance muscular strength and improve neuromuscular coordination simultaneously.</description>
