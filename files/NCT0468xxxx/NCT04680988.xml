      This is a randomized, open-label, 3-arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      SHR-1210 alone or with SHR-1020 versus physician's choice chemotherapy in recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic cervical cancer patients. All enrolled patients will be randomly divided into 3&#xD;
      groups and receive treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity，any criterion&#xD;
      for stopping the study drug or SHR-1210 treatment for up to 2 years.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open-label, 3-arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      SHR-1210 alone or with SHR-1020 versus physician's choice chemotherapy in recurrent or&#xD;

      groups and receive treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity，any criterion&#xD;
      for stopping the study drug or SHR-1210 treatment for up to 2 years.The primary study&#xD;
      hypotheses are that the combination of SHR-1210 plus SHR-1020 is superior to SHR-1210 or&#xD;
      physician's choice chemotherapy with respect to: 1) Progression free survival(PFS) in&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients(SHR-1210+SHR-1020 versus SHR-1210；2) Overall&#xD;
      survival(OS) in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients(SHR-1210+SHR-1020 versus&#xD;
      Physician's choice chemotherapy).&#xD;
