  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 216 patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS will be randomized&#xD;
      at approximately 30 sites. Patients will be randomly assigned to either Auxora at one of&#xD;
      three dose levels or one of three placebo volumes to maintain the double-blind. Study drug&#xD;
      infusions will occur every 24 hours for three consecutive days for a total of three&#xD;
      infusions. Patients will remain hospitalized as per standard of care and once discharged will&#xD;
      be asked to complete a daily meal diary and return for a Day 30 safety assessment. It is&#xD;
      recommended that patients randomized in the study should not be discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      until solid food is tolerated, abdominal pain has resolved or been adequately controlled, and&#xD;
      there is no clinical evidence of infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      and tolerability of three different dose levels of Auxora in patients with acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      and accompanying SIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 216 patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into one of 4 groups using a computer&#xD;
      generated randomization scheme accessed through an interactive voice/web response system&#xD;
      (IXRS). Randomization will be first stratified by gender (male or female) and then by risk&#xD;
      for organ failure in the gender subgroups (higher or lower). Higher risk for organ failure is&#xD;
      defined by the presence of both an elevated hematocrit (HCT ≥44% for men or ≥40% for women)&#xD;
      and hypoxemia (imputed PaO2/FiO2 ≤360). Lower risk for organ failure is defined by the&#xD;
      absence of either or both an elevated hematocrit and hypoxemia. The PaO2/FiO2 will be&#xD;
      determined using an arterial blood gas or imputed using pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have received a Screening CECT of the abdomen/pancreas before being&#xD;
      randomized into the study. CECTs performed as standard of care may be used as the Screening&#xD;
      CECT but must have been performed in the 12 hours before Consent or after Consent and before&#xD;
      Randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Start of First Infusion of Study Drug (SFISD) should occur within 8 hours of the patient&#xD;
      or LAR providing informed consent. Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive 2.0 mg/kg of&#xD;
      Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized&#xD;
      to Group 2 will receive 1.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a&#xD;
      total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 3 will receive 0.5 mg/kg of Auxora&#xD;
      intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to&#xD;
      Group 4 will receive emulsion without any active pharmaceutical ingredient. Patients in Group&#xD;
      4 will receive one of three randomly assigned dose volumes, 1.25 mL/kg, 0.625 mL/kg, or&#xD;
      0.3125 mL/kg, which will be administered intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total&#xD;
      of three doses. The dosing will be based on actual body weight obtained at the time of&#xD;
      hospitalization or screening for the study. As described in the pharmacy manual, the upper&#xD;
      limit of the volume of Auxora and volume of Placebo that will be administered will be 156.25&#xD;
      mL. The sponsor, investigators and patients will be blinded to the assigned group. In the&#xD;
      event of a medical emergency, investigators will be able to receive the treatment assignment&#xD;
      if required to provide optimal care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all 4 groups, a study physician or appropriately trained delegate will perform&#xD;
      assessments at screening, at the baseline assessment, immediately prior to the SFISD, and&#xD;
      then every 24 hours until 240 hours after the SFISD, or until discharge if earlier. If&#xD;
      patients remain hospitalized at Day 12, assessments will then be performed every 48 hours&#xD;
      starting on Day 12 until Day 28, or until discharge if earlier. Patients discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital before Day 25 will return at Day 30 (+5 days) to perform the Day 30 assessments. If&#xD;
      patients are discharged on Days 25-29, the Day 30 assessments may be performed prior to&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive another CECT of the abdomen/pancreas at the Day 30 (±5 days) visit. All&#xD;
      CECTs performed as standard of care after randomization and before the Day 30 CECT will also&#xD;
      be captured. A blinded central reader will read the Screening, Day 30, and any standard of&#xD;
      care CECTs obtained between randomization and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete the modified American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (mGCSI-DD) worksheet at the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, at 96 hours, 168hours, Day 14 and Day 21 (for patients who remain hospitalized on&#xD;
      these days), on the day of discharge, and daily at bedtime after discharge until the Day 30&#xD;
      visit. Patients who are discharged on Days 25-29 will not complete the mGCSI worksheet after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that all patients randomized in the study should receive care consistent&#xD;
      with the 2018 American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Technical Review of&#xD;
      the Initial Medical Management of Acute Pancreatitis. Patients should receive local standard&#xD;
      of care (SOC) for the management of other medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with acute pancreatitis, the AGA strongly recommends early oral feeding (within&#xD;
      24 hours) rather than keeping the patient nil per mouth (Nil per Os, NPO). Patients&#xD;
      randomized into the study, therefore, will be offered a low fat, ≥500-calorie solid meal at&#xD;
      each mealtime after the infusion of the first dose of study drug if alert and not on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. If the patient does not wish to eat the solid meal when offered or is&#xD;
      unable to tolerate the solid meal, they should then be offered a liquid meal. The same&#xD;
      approach should occur at each subsequent mealtime. When patients eat a solid meal, it should&#xD;
      be recorded if they ate ≥50% of the meal and if they either vomited or experienced an&#xD;
      increase in abdominal pain in the two hours after eating a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also recommended that all patients randomized in the study should not be discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital until solid food is tolerated, abdominal pain has resolved or been&#xD;
      adequately controlled, and there is no clinical evidence of infection. Tolerating solid food&#xD;
      is defined as eating ≥50% of a low fat, ≥500-calorie solid meal without an increase in&#xD;
      abdominal pain or vomiting. If the patient is not tolerating either solid or liquid meals,&#xD;
      tube feedings should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All protocol required laboratory testing, except biomarker and PK samples, will be performed&#xD;
      at the local laboratory. Results from the biomarkers and PK blood samples collected as part&#xD;
      of the protocol and being tested at a central lab will not be available to assist the PI or&#xD;
      treating physician in managing the patient.&#xD;
