  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study with a medical device that bears the CE mark (approval for marketing&#xD;
      in the EU) and is applied within its intended use. It is a prospective, single-centre,&#xD;
      single-arm, open-label, observational post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study using the&#xD;
      &quot;Colon Hydromat&quot; system for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy. The patients will be&#xD;
      treated according to the clinical routine and in accordance with the current IFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to confirm safety and performance (effectiveness) of colon hydrotherapy&#xD;
      as bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Colonic irrigation is regarded as a substitute for&#xD;
      standard oral colonic purgative solutions for colonoscopy preparation, especially for&#xD;
      patients, who cannot tolerate oral preparations or want to have alternatives because they&#xD;
      have experienced the current oral preparations as a burdensome process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is intended to answer the question, if the colon hydrotherapy&#xD;
      (colonic irrigation with the &quot;Colon Hydromat&quot;) works in real-life practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonic irrigation is regarded as a substitute for standard oral colonic purgative solutions&#xD;
      for colonoscopy preparation. The advantage of colonic irrigation is that there is no&#xD;
      unpleasant taste, it avoids the discomfort of diarrheic episode and there is no need to drink&#xD;
      a large volume of water or fluids. The patient will receive the bowel irrigation with the&#xD;
      &quot;Colon Hydromat&quot; directly before colonoscopy, at the same day. Aim of this study is to&#xD;
      confirm performance (effectiveness), in terms of an adequate bowel preparation and safety of&#xD;
      the &quot;Colon-Hydromat&quot;, as alternative bowel cleansing device prior to colonoscopy. The primary&#xD;
      performance (effectiveness) endpoint for this study is the colonic cleanliness, defined as&#xD;
      overall quality of bowel cleansing as measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS).&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoints for this study are adverse device events (ADE) and serious&#xD;
      adverse device effects (SADE), product and procedure related.&#xD;

        All patients (men and women) who are planned for a colonoscopy and where anorectal colonic&#xD;
        irrigation with the specula can be performed, will be included into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The colonic irrigation is regarded as alternative bowel preparation to oral preparations,&#xD;

             or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  want to have alternatives because they have experienced the current oral preparations&#xD;
             as a burdensome process, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  had an inadequate colon cleansing following traditional oral preparation, in order to&#xD;
             complete the colonoscopy at the same day.&#xD;
