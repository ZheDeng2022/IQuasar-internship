      The purpose of this implementation science study is to determine whether Deliberative Loops&#xD;
      are effective in increasing providers' adherence to the non-cavitated caries component of the&#xD;
      American Dental Association's pit-and-fissure sealant evidence-based clinical practice&#xD;
      guideline. The investigators use a stepped wedge design to randomly assign dental clinics to&#xD;
      the Deliberative Loop intervention. In a Deliberative Loop, stakeholders receive background&#xD;
      information, participate in a facilitated discussion, and share their views with leadership.&#xD;
      The Deliberative Loop intervention is designed to help stakeholders form informed opinions;&#xD;
      in this study, stakeholders will be forming informed opinions about the implementation&#xD;
      interventions they think will increase their clinic's adherence to the guideline. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that compared with the pre-intervention period, following the&#xD;
      intervention, providers will place or treatment plan sealants for significantly more occlusal&#xD;
      non-cavitated carious lesions.&#xD;

      non-cavitated carious lesions (NCCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All persons employed by Kaiser Permanente Northwest or Permanente Dental Associates and who&#xD;
      work in a Kaiser Permanente Northwest dental clinic at any level [e.g., part time, full time]&#xD;
      will be eligible to participate in the study. This includes both service providers and&#xD;
      front-of-the-house staff, approximately 1,200 employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Stage III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites include the 16 general dental clinics of Kaiser Permanente Northwest. All&#xD;
      clinics are located within the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated time from when the study opens to enrollment until completion of data&#xD;
      collection is 16 months. It will take approximately one to two months for each individual&#xD;
      participant to complete all study-related tasks, depending on how soon after the introductory&#xD;
      session the Deliberative session can be scheduled.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will give background information to the stakeholders before they engage in the Deliberative session.&#xD;
Stakeholders from a given clinic will come together for a Deliberative session (i.e., facilitated conversation), enabling them to hear the full range of perspectives held by their fellow colleagues and to share their own perspective regarding how best to implement the guideline in small-group discussions.&#xD;
Following the Deliberative session, each stakeholder will have the opportunity to record their opinions regarding possible implementation interventions. The investigators will share these opinions with the clinic's decision-makers to help guide their decision-making about which implementation interventions to deploy. If a stakeholder happens to be absent the day of their clinic's Deliberative session, they will still have the opportunity to complete the survey.</description>
