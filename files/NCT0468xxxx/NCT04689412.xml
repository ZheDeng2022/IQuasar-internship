  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As most of the upper airways infections (UAI) leading to wheezing are secondary to viral&#xD;
      triggers, the possible antinflammatory and antiviral role of resveratrol has been suggested&#xD;
      in several studies, both in vitro and in vivo. However, its efficacy has been studied only&#xD;
      when evaluating upper respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim to define new approaches in patients with recurrent wheezing triggered by UAI we&#xD;
      have performed a prospective observational study to evaluate the efficacy of a short-course&#xD;
      of intranasal resveratrol, administered for 7 days at the beginning of UAI, when compared to&#xD;
      standard nasal lavage with 0.9% saline solution, in terms of reduction in wheezing episodes.&#xD;

      Patients Patients were selected from those referring to our centre for recurrent wheezing in&#xD;
      the previous year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of at least 8 episodes of wheezing in the previous October-March period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative skin prick test (SPT) for the most common allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age less than 6 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitization to food allergens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitization to perennial allergens or to tree pollen allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of atopic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were enrolled during visit 1, from April to August 2018, and were instructed to&#xD;
      record symptoms of upper and lower airways during the wash-out period of September. During&#xD;
      visit 2 at the end of September patients were randomized into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group 1: patients treated with 0.9% saline solution daily nasal lavage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group 2: patients treated with 0.9% saline solution daily nasal lavage and a 7-days&#xD;
           therapy with nasal resveratrol, from the beginning of upper airways symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed from September 2018 to the end of March 2019, with visit 3 and 4&#xD;
      after two (end of November) and four months (end of January). Follow-up ended with visit 5 at&#xD;
      the end of March. All patients were instructed to register in specifically designated charts&#xD;
      the number of days with symptoms of upper airways inflammation and the recurrence of&#xD;
      wheezing. As predictive index of disease severity, parents were instructed to register both&#xD;
      days with oral corticosteroids administration (OCA) and with hospitalization need, as ER&#xD;
      occurrence or admission to paediatric wards. All patient were instructed to treat each&#xD;
      wheezing episode with inhaled salbutamol and, if wheezing persisted, with oral prednisolone&#xD;
      once a day, according to guidelines (Gina 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin prick tests The sensitization status of each patient was assessed by performing skin&#xD;
      prick tests (SPTs) with a standard panel of environmental (Stallergenes, Antony, France) and&#xD;
      food allergens (Lofarma, Milan, Italy). Positivity of SPT was established according to the&#xD;
      guidelines of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology. The standard panel&#xD;
      of allergens included Phleum pratense, Parietaria judaica, Juniperus ashei, Olea europaea,&#xD;
      Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Alternaria tenuis, cat and dog epithelium; milk, egg, peanut,&#xD;
      tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat plus a positive (histamine 10 mg/mL) and a&#xD;
      negative (normal saline) control. Wheals were contoured with a soft pen and transferred onto&#xD;
      cellotape. A skin reaction of 5 mm was considered the threshold for positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical symptoms, rescue medication and severity evaluation During the evaluation period,&#xD;
      patients filled in daily diary cards to record days with symptoms involving the upper&#xD;
      (sneezing, rhinorrhoea, itching and nasal blockage) and lower airways (cough, dyspnoea and&#xD;
      wheezing), the use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) and the days of hospitalization when&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
