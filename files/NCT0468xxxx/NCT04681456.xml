  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect and analyze long term safety and efficacy outcomes of patients undergoing&#xD;
      radiotherapy for non-melanoma skin cancer. A target of 400 VMAT-treated sites is set which is&#xD;
      estimated to be identified in approximately 350 participants. Participants referred for&#xD;
      radiotherapy for the management of non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Registry will collect information on key clinical indications and patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes to assess the safety and efficacy of VMAT radiotherapy. Data that will be collected&#xD;
      includes baseline data of demographic, relevant medical history, photographs, treatment&#xD;
      schedule, and treatment outcomes. Data may be collected retrospectively in regard to previous&#xD;
      relevant medical history, prior treatments and outcomes as well as prospectively, including&#xD;
      treatment schedule and treatment outcomes of radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry aims to assess the safety and outcomes of treatment for up to 5 years. This&#xD;
      Registry will be the first of its kind in the US and will provide a basis for a number of&#xD;
      potential research publications. The Registry will also give insights into treatment delivery&#xD;
      and potentially facilitate future improvements in patient care.&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited based on their potential eligibility to receive VMAT&#xD;
        widefield radiotherapy treatment of their NMSC. The RO will assess if the condition is&#xD;
        suitable for VMAT treatment, and if so, will discuss the Registry with the participant.&#xD;
