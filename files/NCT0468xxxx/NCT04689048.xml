  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spread of cancer to the brain is referred to as brain metastases. Brain metastases are a&#xD;
      common complication of cancer. This study is being done to determine whether the use of a new&#xD;
      imaging agent, 18F-fluciclovine, is able to detect which patients are responding to radiation&#xD;
      therapy. In addition, this study will look at the changes of the treated brain metastases&#xD;
      using this imaging agent over time.&#xD;

    <description>In total, three 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT brain scans (pre-, interim-, and post-treatment) will be performed according to the study calendar. Generic name is Axumin and will be administered as an intravenous bolus. May administer diluted or undiluted. The maximum volume of undiluted 18F-fluciclovine is 5 mL. After administration, flush with normal saline to ensure full delivery of the dose.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a standard 5 millicuries dose of 18F-fluciclovine intravenously as a bolus injection. They will be required to fast for at least four hours prior to 18F-fluciclovine injection. Patients will be positioned for PET/CT brain imaging and will be injected with 18F-fluciclovine immediately prior to PET data acquisition. PET data will be collected in list mode up to 25 minutes post-injection. PET images will be reconstructed in two ways: as a standard static image of data acquired between 10 to 20 minutes post-injection, and as a dynamic series of four 5-minute frames between 5 to 25 minutes post-injection to allow for motion assessment and correction and time-dependent observations.</description>
