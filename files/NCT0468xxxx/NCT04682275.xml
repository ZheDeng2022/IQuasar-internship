    <textblock>
      There is a relationship between depression and periodontal disease. This relationship may be&#xD;
      double-sided. A psychological state such as anxiety, depression, body image, and self-esteem&#xD;
      may be affected from the symptoms of periodontal disease.&#xD;

      Background: Depression is a multifactorial disease characterized by a variety of symptoms.&#xD;
      Individuals with psychiatric disorders seem to be more prone to periodontitis. However&#xD;
      periodontal disease and depression can be considered bidirectional risk factors. Periodontal&#xD;
      diseases can also be an effect on depression. The purpose of the present study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the gender-related differences in the relationship between periodontal diseases and&#xD;
      depression in male and female adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: The study population consisted of 339 subjects. Two groups were formed&#xD;
      from these patients: 171 females with periodontal disease (71 subjects with gingivitis, 100&#xD;
      subjects with periodontitis); 168 males with periodontal disease (72 subjects with&#xD;
      gingivitis, 96 subjects with periodontitis). Clinical periodontal and psychological measures&#xD;
      were performed on females and males group.&#xD;

    <description>The differences in depression level between females and males. Depression level was determined using the Beck Depression Inventory.&#xD;
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) consists of 21 items. Each of the 21 statements is scored from 0 to 3. The total score allows the classification of depression severity. Scores less than 10 indicates lack of the depression. The scores between10-16 indicate minimum depression, the scores between17-29 indicate moderate depression, scores greater than 30 indicate severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Probing pocket depth</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Probing pocket depth (PPD) was measured for determining the severity of the disease and clinical outcome. High probing pocket depth shows more severe periodontal disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gingival index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The differences in gingival index scores between females and males. The gingival index was recorded for determining and classifying gingival status. The Gingival Index (GI) scores each site on a 0 to 3 scale, with 0 being normal and 3 being severe inflammation characterized by edema, redness, swelling, and spontaneous bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The differences in plaque index scores between females and males. Plaque index (PI) was recorded for determining and classifying oral hygiene status. The Plaque Index (GI) scores each site on a 0 to 3 scale with 0 being no plaque in the gingival area and 3 abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the gingival margin and adjacent tooth surface.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding on probing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The differences in bleeding on probing scores between females and males. Bleeding on probing (BOP) has been used to diagnose the presence of periodontal diseases, and it is a reliable indicator of gingival inflammation. It is useful in providing either positive predictive values or negative predictive values that illustrate disease progression. A positive predictive value indicates the percentage of people who both exhibit BOP and are correctly diagnosed with progressive periodontal diseases. A negative predictive value indicates the percentage of people whose BOP test results show no bleeding and no active disease progression.</description>
