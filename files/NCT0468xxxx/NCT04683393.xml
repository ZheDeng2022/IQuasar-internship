  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the markers of frailty in a &quot;real world&quot; population of MM&#xD;
      patients, and to monitor changes to those markers throughout treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
      Clinical, physical and biological parameters will be collected by interviewing the patients&#xD;
      via questionnaires, physical tests and blood analyses. All these will be done during routine&#xD;
      visits of the patients' care pathway, minimising the impact on patient lifestyles. The&#xD;
      patients will then be stratified according to the geriatric assessment into 3 groups (fit,&#xD;
      non-fit, frail) and the changes to these parameters will be compared within these 3 groups&#xD;
      throughout the treatment and the follow-up phase for a minimum of 24 months. The markers of&#xD;
      frailty will also be measured in a group of healthy subjects and the results will be compared&#xD;
      with those of patients with MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characterisation of markers of frailty will be a starting point to develop strategies to&#xD;
      reduce the causes of frailty, hence it will reduce the treatment-related toxicity, improve&#xD;
      quality of life and eventually the outcome for patients with MM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to characterize the markers of frailty in a population of MM patients in a&#xD;
      &quot;real world&quot; setting. The clinical approach to the patients (i.e. treatment schedule, number&#xD;
      of appointments in the hospital, invasive procedures) will not be changed compared to&#xD;
      patients not enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore measures of frailty in MM patients: the aim is to assess if any of the proposed&#xD;
      parameters and markers of frailty (e.g. biomarkers of cellular senescence and organ damage,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, physical tests such as gait speed and hand grip test) are associated&#xD;
      with frailty status, defined according to the GA, at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor frailty (defined by GA) and those markers of frailty (MoF) over time and&#xD;
           evaluate treatment effects on frailty and MoF: this will explore the relationship&#xD;
           between the markers of frailty and the tumor. Moreover, this will allow the study to&#xD;
           assess if the frailty score at baseline is static or can be modified, in particular to&#xD;
           observe whether frailty is improved in patients responding well to the treatment without&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the relationship of parameters and biomarkers of frailty with:&#xD;
           treatment-related toxicity, treatment discontinuation, response to treatment, PFS and OS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the predictive role of GA in the &quot;real world&quot; setting: the GA has been&#xD;
           assessed in 3 clinical trials in more than 800 patients, but no data are available on&#xD;
           the &quot;real world&quot; population where frail patients are more frequently encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the MoF in patients with MM with the healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relation of frailty and quality of life (QoL): in elderly and frail MM&#xD;
           patients the QoL is one of the most important (if not the most important) objective for&#xD;
           treatment. Investigators will investigate if the QoL perceived by the patient relates to&#xD;
           the frailty assessment and how this varies over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples collected at baseline and throughout the study will also be stored for&#xD;
      future studies to allow a prompt evaluation of novel biomarkers identified in the future, and&#xD;
      therefore to accelerate the validation of these biomarkers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed or relapse/refractory patients with multiple myeloma including&#xD;
             non-secretory multiple myeloma. If patients are at diagnosis, they need to have a&#xD;
             myeloma defining events (MDE) as reported in Appendix B. If they are at relapse they&#xD;
             need to meet the criteria for relapse as per Appendix C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients due to start any anti-myeloma treatment irrespectively from the line of&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled in other clinical trials can be enrolled in this study. Patients&#xD;
             will not attend the hospital more frequently if enrolled in this study. In fact all&#xD;
             the assessment, tests and questionnaires will be done whilst the patients are&#xD;
             attending the hospital for routine appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for healthy subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 50 years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MGUS or sMM without MDE&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving ongoing treatment for MM with the exclusion of steroids (maximal&#xD;
             dose of Dexamethasone 160 mg in last 2 weeks or equivalent) and radiotherapy for&#xD;
             spinal cord compression (SCC). The reason for this exclusion is that the baseline&#xD;
             measurements need to be done before starting a proper line of chemotherapy and not in&#xD;
             the middle of a treatment in order to be comparable between patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient received allogeneic stem cell transplant at any stage of treatment. The reason&#xD;
             being that some markers (i.e. telomere length) can consistently change following an&#xD;
             allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for healthy subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of past or present cancer requiring treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy&#xD;
