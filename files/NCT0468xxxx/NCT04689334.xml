  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general surgery residency program was initiated in 2013 between Istanbul Medeniyet&#xD;
      University and Benadir University. A formal training program was established that covered&#xD;
      3-year theoretical and practical training that would form the structure of academic, clinical&#xD;
      and technical criteria by evaluating all the requirements of the surgical residency training.&#xD;
      A resident logbook was prepared to track exam results, practices, knowledge and skill status&#xD;
      that the residents achieved in the training process. Candidates who graduated from medical&#xD;
      school and were successful in the multiple-choice exam consisting of basic and clinical&#xD;
      sciences were accepted to the program each year in different numbers according to the&#xD;
      capacity. From the initiation, 16 surgeons -9 in 2016, 3 in 2017 and 4 in 2018- graduated&#xD;
      from the program. This study was designed after the last resident group graduated and worked&#xD;
      as an attending surgeon at least for a year.&#xD;

      The data were collected from graduates who were working as surgeons in Somalia to reveal the&#xD;
      features and numbers of elective, emergency, trauma, and non-general surgical interventions&#xD;
      performed in a month. A questionnaire consisting of pathology, type and numbers of&#xD;
      interventions performed in one month by graduate surgeons (GS), including general surgery and&#xD;
      other specialties, was prepared.&#xD;
