      Aims and objectives. To examine and compare the effects of hot and cold compresses&#xD;
      administration on muscle cramps, fatigue, and comfort in hemodialysis (HD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Muscle cramps and fatigue are common complications in HD patients and reduce&#xD;
      patient comfort. Among the nursing interventions stated for the management of these&#xD;
      complications in the literature, hot and cold therapy are remarkable. To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, the present study is the first research up to date that examined and compared the&#xD;
      effects of hot and cold compress administrations on abovementioned complications in HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted in two hemodialysis centers&#xD;
      between February and October 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The study sample consisted of 69 patients, stratified and randomly allocated to two&#xD;
      intervention groups and placebo group. For patients of each group, the implementation of the&#xD;
      study continued for four weeks, 12 HD sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis (HD) is a common renal replacement therapy used in the treatment of End-Stage&#xD;
      Renal Disease (ESRD) worldwide. Although HD is a life-saving treatment for people with ESRD,&#xD;
      it causes some acute and chronic complications. Muscle cramps and fatigue are two of the most&#xD;
      common complications in HD, and these also cause reducing comfort. Management of&#xD;
      complications in HD patients and ensuring an optimal comfort level are pivotal for nurses.&#xD;
      According to the literature, recommended nursing practices for the management of cramps in HD&#xD;
      patients include hot and cold therapy methods. Besides, preventing cramps can improve comfort&#xD;
      by reducing fatigue. Therefore, this study aimed to examine and compare the effects of hot&#xD;
      and cold compresses administration on muscle cramps, fatigue, and comfort in hemodialysis&#xD;
      (HD) patients.&#xD;

    <description>Throughout the hemodialysis treatment, the patients were monitored in terms of cramp development and cramp development was recorded in the follow-up chart (CEFC). This chart was created by the researcher through literature review. Each involuntary contraction session in the legs of the patients was evaluated as an episode.</description>
