  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is an important means to prolong the survival time of advanced breast cancer. As&#xD;
      a new type of microtubule inhibitor, eribulin has a unique mechanism of action. Compared with&#xD;
      single drug chemotherapy, it can improve the overall survival time of 2.5 months, increase&#xD;
      the clinical benefit rate by 5 times, and the tolerance of eribulin is good. Therefore, the&#xD;
      guidelines at home and abroad recommend eribulin for the rescue of advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, up to now, there is no large sample data on the efficacy of eribulin combined with&#xD;
      anti HER2 targeted therapy in HER2 + metastatic breast cancer, and the efficacy of combined&#xD;
      immunotherapy in triple negative metastatic breast cancer. Moreover, as a newly marketed&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug in China, the efficacy and safety data of eribulin in Chinese population&#xD;
      are relatively lacking. Therefore, we plan to include different types and line numbers of&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer patients based on the Chinese population through real-world research,&#xD;
      and receive the treatment regimen containing eribulin respectively. In HR + / her2-mbc, we&#xD;
      use eribulin monotherapy; in HER2 + MBC, we use eribulin + anti HER2 targeted therapy; in&#xD;
      TNBC, we use eribulin + immunotherapy / chemotherapy, The efficacy and safety of eribulin&#xD;
      were evaluated.&#xD;
