      The objective of this study is to assess the effect Spinal Cord Stimulators have toward&#xD;
      improving vascular changes of diabetes mellitus in patients eligible for SCS placement based&#xD;
      on their condition of painful diabetic neuropathy; we will evaluate improving their&#xD;
      disability and quality of life, improving micro-circulatory changes induced by Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus (DM), improving macro-circulatory changes induced by DM and improving arterial&#xD;
      stiffness of the vessels of the lower extremity.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, pilot study to investigate a preventative modality, spinal cord&#xD;
      neuromodulation, that would contribute to reversing the physiologic changes that occur in the&#xD;
      lower extremities of diabetic patients. Patients who have been diagnosed with DM type II for&#xD;
      at least 1 year and refractory painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower&#xD;
      extremities who are scheduled to receive a spinal cord stimulator may be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study pending eligibly for all other criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility and consent have been confirmed, each subject will go through a baseline&#xD;
      visit where data will collected through a series of questionnaires, a clinical and&#xD;
      psychological evaluation by a licensed professional. Subjects will be asked to come back for&#xD;
      a series of vascular test prior to their device implantation. This vascular testing will be&#xD;
      done at the vascular lab at the University of Chicago Medical Center by trained vascular&#xD;
      physicians and techs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any study related procedures, all subjects must first sign the approved ICF. This&#xD;
      will be performed by the PI or an approved member of the study staff who has been delegated&#xD;
      by the PI do so and in a private setting with ample time given to the subject to review and&#xD;
      ask any questions regarding the study. Once the ICF has been signed, a copy will be given to&#xD;
      the subject and the original will be placed in their research or medical chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the ICF has been complete, demographic data such as name, age, gender will be collected.&#xD;
      Along with demographic information, we will collect medical, surgical and medication history&#xD;
      for each subject at the initial baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the Spinal Cord Stimulator procedure, all patients enrolled in the study will undergo&#xD;
      baseline vascular testing. The following test will be performed on each subject. Subjects&#xD;
      will only go through this portion of the study if they receive pre-certification by their&#xD;
      insurance for their SCS procedure. Below is a list of tests that will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Flow mediated arterial dilation and by measuring pedal and digital level waveforms and&#xD;
           pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Doppler flowmetry (Laser Doppler flowmetry if available) by Duplex Scan of lower&#xD;
           extremities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ankle Brachial Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pulse Pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Peripheral vascular compliance of the lower extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
           SCS Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SCS procedure is being done as part of the subject's clinical care. The subject&#xD;
           would be receiving this procedure, even if they do not agree to participate in this&#xD;
           study. All patients will have 2 temporary SCS trial leads placed transcutaneously and&#xD;
           tunneled to limit the risk for infection. At the end of the trial interval, patients&#xD;
           will repeat the vascular testing at 2 weeks post-op at the time just prior to device&#xD;
           removal, as well as complete the clinical evaluations as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SCS waveform used will be consistent and similar for all patients enrolled; at 1&#xD;
           week, study will allow minor SCS waveform modifications to recapture stimulation, but&#xD;
           waveforms will be maintained within established parameters in accordance with device&#xD;
           used. All patients will attempt to complete the 2 weeks trial; early removal will be&#xD;
           performed for the following situations: intolerable pain with stimulation (increase pain&#xD;
           &gt;4 points from baseline), infection, neurological deficit (sensory of motor), patient&#xD;
           request. Leads will be pulled 2 weeks after placement and patients will be seen 1 week&#xD;
           after the leads are pulled. At that time, patient will exit the study and can choose&#xD;
           definitive implantation if satisfied with the trial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Questionnaires and Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
           At various time intervals, all subjects will be asked to complete a series of&#xD;
           questionnaires and assessments. These questionnaires are intended to evaluate their&#xD;
           quality of life, pain levels, patient satisfaction, functional capacities and mental&#xD;
           health. All questionnaires are validated and have been chosen for a specific study&#xD;
           endpoint. Below is the list of questionnaires and a brief description of each one. For&#xD;
           more specific details on when each will be administered, please refer to the schedule of&#xD;
           events (Appendix A).&#xD;

&#xD;
                o Assesses both the subject's intensity and quality of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication Quantification Scale III (MQS-III) o Used to quantify medication regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study consists of 5 total clinic visits. Subjects will be asked to come back prior&#xD;
           to their temporary SCS placement for a series of vascular testing. If the subject's&#xD;
           insurance does not pre-certify them for the trial SCS procedure, the vascular testing&#xD;
           will not be completed and they will be withdrawn from the study. For specific detail in&#xD;
           what each visit entails, please refer to the study SCHEMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Below are the list of visits and when they occur.&#xD;
