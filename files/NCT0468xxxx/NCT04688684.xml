  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The latest available data from the Department of Health of Abu Dhabi show that cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease is the leading cause of death among both the non-national and national populations of&#xD;
      the emirate of Abu Dhabi. This trend has not improved over time despite concerted efforts.&#xD;
      Particularly striking is that cardiovascular disease was listed as the cause of death in over&#xD;
      39% of those over the age of 45. In those aged over 60 years of age, this causes more deaths&#xD;
      than the combined effect of the second, third and fourth leading causes of death, cancer,&#xD;
      respiratory diseases, and infectious disease, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey of the Middle East and North Africa showed that eating an unhealthy diet was the&#xD;
      leading risk factor for cardiovascular deaths and estimated that this pattern of eating&#xD;
      accounted for 72% of cardiovascular deaths in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In particular,&#xD;
      the low consumption of whole grains was responsible for 22% of these deaths in the UAE. Other&#xD;
      risk factors included high levels of processed meat, red meat, and sugar sweetened beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies done in the UAE show that despite knowledge of healthy diet and exercise practices,&#xD;
      barriers exist to lifestyle change. For example, a study of patients in the UAE with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes showed only 3% of the surveyed population of 390 patients in the UAE met numerous&#xD;
      guidelines' recommendations for 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 90&#xD;
      minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. The reasons given by the participants in that&#xD;
      study for not exercising included cultural reasons (29.2%), &quot;exercise is boring&quot; (20.3%), and&#xD;
      lack of family support (4.1%). Despite availability and access to individual appointments&#xD;
      with dieticians based in primary health centers, rates of obesity, overweight, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors have not improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a trial: To the investigators' knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of&#xD;
      family based lifestyle interventions led by a health coach and supported by technology such&#xD;
      as fitness trackers and smartphone applications to track dietary intake. In the setting of&#xD;
      the traditional culture of the nationals of the UAE (called Emiratis), family based&#xD;
      interventions that specifically address cultural and religious beliefs and practices and&#xD;
      accommodate family obligations may have a greater benefit than individual dietician visits.&#xD;
      There may also be greater adherence to physical activity and health eating habits if the&#xD;
      family commits to this lifestyle together.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Non-communicable diseases overtook infectious diseases as the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in the past century, and despite concerted efforts, continue to result in the deaths of&#xD;
      millions worldwide each year. Despite methodological challenges, a growing body of literature&#xD;
      gives mixed evidence that links these diseases with modern lifestyles, which include an&#xD;
      increased intake of calorie-dense nonnutritive foods combined with a lack of physical&#xD;
      activity leading to obesity (1,2) and overweight (3) which increases the risk of developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (4, 5) as well as cancer (6). These trends are mirrored in the country&#xD;
      of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as in the specific location of this clinical&#xD;
      trial, the emirate of Abu Dhabi (7, 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing knowledge The latest available data from the Abu Dhabi Department of Health show&#xD;
      that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among the population of the&#xD;
      emirate of Abu Dhabi (7, 8). This trend has been stable over time despite concerted efforts.&#xD;
      Particularly striking is that CVD was listed as the cause of death in over 39% of those over&#xD;
      the age of 45. In those over 60 years of age, CVD outweighs the combined effect of the&#xD;
      second, third and fourth leading causes of death, cancer, respiratory diseases, and&#xD;
      infectious disease, respectively. (7) A survey showed that a sub-optimal diet was the leading&#xD;
      risk factor for cardio-metabolic disease (CMD) deaths and estimated that this accounted for&#xD;
      72% of CMD deaths in the UAE. In particular, the low consumption of whole grains was&#xD;
      responsible for 22% of CMD deaths in the UAE. Other risk factors included high levels of&#xD;
      processed meat, red meat, and sugar sweetened beverages (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies done in the UAE show that despite knowledge of healthy diet and exercise, barriers&#xD;
      exist to lifestyle change. A survey of patients in the UAE with type 2 diabetes showed only&#xD;
      3% met numerous guidelines' recommendations for 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic&#xD;
      activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week (9). The reasons given for not&#xD;
      exercising included cultural reasons (29.2%), &quot;exercise is boring&quot; (20.3%), and lack of&#xD;
      family support (4.1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite access to appointments with dieticians in primary health centers on an individual&#xD;
      basis, rates of obesity, overweight, and CVD risk factors have remained stable. In the&#xD;
      setting of the traditional culture of the nationals of the UAE (Emiratis), family-based&#xD;
      interventions that specifically address cultural and religious norms and accommodate family&#xD;
      obligations may have a greater benefit than individual-centred appointments. There may be&#xD;
      greater adherence to physical activity and healthy eating habits if the family commits to&#xD;
      this new lifestyle together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a trial: To the investigators' knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of&#xD;
      family-based lifestyle interventions led by a health coach in the UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a trial: To the investigators' knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of&#xD;
      family based lifestyle interventions led by a health coach and supported by technological&#xD;
      aids such as fitness trackers and smartphone applications to track dietary intake. In the&#xD;
      setting of the traditional culture of the nationals of the UAE, family based interventions&#xD;
      that specifically address cultural and religious mores and accommodate family obligations may&#xD;
      have a greater benefit than individual dietician visits. There may also be greater adherence&#xD;
      to physical activity and health eating habits if the family commits to this lifestyle&#xD;
      together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparators The current practice in Kanad Hospital is to refer individual overweight and&#xD;
      obese Emiratis to dieticians for co-management. A 1:1 age and sex matched control group will&#xD;
      be selected from consecutive patients attending the dietician clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to assess the superiority of the Emirates Heart Health Program (EHHP)&#xD;
      intervention over current usual practice, and if proven superior, can guide future practice,&#xD;
      health insurance coverage and allocation of government resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Research hypothesis: The Emirates Heart Health Program (EHHP), a family based diet&#xD;
      and exercise intervention using a family health coach with technological aids, has additional&#xD;
      benefit in reducing cardiovascular risk factors when compared to the current usual management&#xD;
      of obese and overweight patients in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to determine if the EHHP is superior to usual current practices in&#xD;
      reduction of weight and BMI in obese and overweight Emiratis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to determine in obese and overweight Emiratis, if the EHHP is superior&#xD;
      to usual current practices in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing HDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: Study recruitment will take place in the outpatient clinics of Kanad Hospital&#xD;
      in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This center serves a region of 766,900&#xD;
      with a patient population that is 30% Emirati (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis Trial design The EHHP is designed as a nonrandomized, controlled,&#xD;
      unblinded single-center superiority trial with two parallel groups. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed as individual randomization with a 1:1 age and gender matched allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions For the intervention group, a health coach will deliver a 16 session program&#xD;
      with weekly teaching sessions and discussion that will take place in the family's home. These&#xD;
      teaching sessions have been contextualized from the DPP material to suit local culture and&#xD;
      customs and translated from English to Arabic. The material for each session follows a set&#xD;
      structure and is largely scripted for standardization. The health coach will review each&#xD;
      participant's weight, dietary logbook, and exercise records weekly and provide additional&#xD;
      support as needed. Measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and blood samples will occur&#xD;
      in the primary health center at study enrollment, at 8 weeks into the intervention, and at&#xD;
      the conclusion of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age and gender matched controls from the same hospital's dietician practice will be followed&#xD;
      for the same period of time, and outcome measures from both the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups will be compared at the conclusion of the intervention to assess for a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DPP, on which the EHHP is based, is a flexible, individualized program that allows each&#xD;
      participant to follow the preference according to individual needs. For example, participants&#xD;
      that are completely sedentary at study enrollment are advised to gradually and consistently&#xD;
      increase physical activity with the goal of performing 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic&#xD;
      exercise by the end of the intervention, rather than starting at some preset amount of&#xD;
      exercise in week 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health coach will be monitoring each participant's attendance of the weekly teaching&#xD;
      sessions, offering make up teaching as needed on an individual basis while encouraging&#xD;
      participation in the family's efforts at adhering to the program. The health coach will also&#xD;
      be monitoring each participant's progress in increasing physical activity and making healthy&#xD;
      dietary choices. Each participant will be encouraged to ask for help, advice, and support&#xD;
      from the health coach during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with diabetes, hypertension, or other comorbid conditions will be encouraged to&#xD;
      continue any individual treatment plans under the ongoing care of the primary physician and&#xD;
      specialists. Participants are advised that medications may need to be adjusted by the&#xD;
      preexisting care team in case weight loss results in significant changes in blood sugar or&#xD;
      blood pressure. As long as the participant agrees to continue in the study, enrollment in the&#xD;
      study will be continued; the only criteria for stopping the intervention will be withdrawal&#xD;
      of participant consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies performed in the UAE have faced the challenge of retention of participants&#xD;
      during the study period. Similar challenges exist for the usual care of obese and overweight&#xD;
      patients as loss to follow up with the dietician and obesity clinic team is quite common. The&#xD;
      health coach is the primary measure that will improve adherence and participant retention, as&#xD;
      the therapeutic relationship is established. The investigators have selected an initial&#xD;
      health coach who speaks Arabic, has worked in this country for over thirty years as a medical&#xD;
      interpreter within the government health system, is familiar and fluent in local customs and&#xD;
      practices, and has a degree in psychology. In addition, the health coach has experience in&#xD;
      working with this patient population as a clinical care coordinator, who is typically&#xD;
      responsible for arranging and reminding patients of follow up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary outcome measure The primary outcome measure is the difference between the&#xD;
      two treatment arms in the proportion of participants that achieve a weight loss of 7% from&#xD;
      each individual's baseline weight. This aligns with the American Diabetes Association&#xD;
      guidelines on the management of diabetes, as it is associated with a clinically significant&#xD;
      improvement in glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors. Weight is also a recognized&#xD;
      goal of the anticipated participants and easily measured and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures include the absolute and relative change pre and post intervention in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total cholesterol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HDL cholesterol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LDL cholesterol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triglycerides&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant timeline The primary outcome in this study is change in weight and the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are changes in blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid parameters. These will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline in eligible family members after enrollment and informed consent. Age&#xD;
      and gender matched controls will be assigned based on consecutive individuals presenting to&#xD;
      the hospital's dietician. The sixteen sessions will then be delivered with inter-session&#xD;
      coaching and follow up. After completion of the final session, the participant will have&#xD;
      repeat weight and blood pressure measurement, along with a repeat blood draw to assess the&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c and lipid parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was calculated on the basis of the primary hypothesis, i.e that&#xD;
      the EHHP intervention would result in a statistically significant greater proportion of&#xD;
      participants achieving a 7% or greater reduction in body weight when compared to age and&#xD;
      gender matched patients undergoing usual care in the same clinic. Therefore, the study has&#xD;
      been powered to detect a 7% difference in weight using a two sided significance level of 5%&#xD;
      and a power of 80%. The more conservative drop-out rate of 50% reflecting the past corporate&#xD;
      experiences of the investigation team has been assumed. This resulted in an anticipated&#xD;
      allocation of 214 patients in each arm of the trial. (ClinCalc, Rosner B., Fundamentals of&#xD;
      Biostatistics. 7th ed. Boston, MA: Brooks/Cole; 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adaptive interim analysis will be performed after the results for the primary endpoint are&#xD;
      available for 107 participants in each arm of the trial, which is 50% of the calculated&#xD;
      required sample size. The following type I error rates and decision boundaries are specified:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall one sided type I error rate: 0.025 Boundary for the one-sided p-value of the first&#xD;
      stage for accepting the null hypothesis within the interim analysis: a0 = 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-sided local type I error rate for testing the null-hypothesis within the interim&#xD;
      analysis: a1 = 0.01012 If the trial will be continued with a second stage after the interim&#xD;
      analysis, the results of the interim analysis can be taken into account for a recalculation&#xD;
      of the required sample size. If the sample size recalculation leads to the conclusion that&#xD;
      more than 300 patients are required in the intervention arm, the study will be stopped as the&#xD;
      relative benefit is judged to be of minor importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will be recruited from Kanad Hospital based on the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, participant interest and consent. The hospital dietician will then identify for&#xD;
      each enrolled participant a consecutively presenting age and sex matched patient seen in&#xD;
      their dietician practice for enrolment in the matched control group. Screening and&#xD;
      recruitment will continue until the required sample size is reached or the grant expires,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. Participants will be allowed to keep the activity tracker at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation Due to the limited timeframe of the grant and the limited resources available to&#xD;
      the investigators, it is not possible to compare family units undergoing the intervention&#xD;
      directly with family units undergoing the usual care of receiving individual visits with the&#xD;
      dietician and obesity clinic team. In addition, variation in the size of the family units&#xD;
      makes a family to family comparison impractical. Therefore, it was decided to pursue a&#xD;
      strategy of assigning individual age and gender matched controls to each study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a positive result is obtained, additional funding and health coaches could be requested to&#xD;
      allow for the assessment of similar sized families in the interventional and control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible or practical to blind the&#xD;
      participants in the interventional and control arms, as the participants in the&#xD;
      interventional arm will be meeting and being coached in family meetings, whereas individuals&#xD;
      in the control group will be having individual appointments with the dietician without health&#xD;
      coaching support and without being supplied activity trackers for personal use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the health coach will only be working with the study participants in the&#xD;
      interventional arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performing the clinical portions of the study as care providers (enrolment&#xD;
      and ordering the appropriate labs) will be un-blinded to the allocation (AK, KC, NH);&#xD;
      however, those performing the statistical analyses and assessing the outcomes (RDG, SS, JN,&#xD;
      MSH, AK, IB) will be blinded to the allocation by de-identifying both study participants and&#xD;
      the corresponding age and sex matched controls. This de-identified database will be&#xD;
      administered by JK along with the health coach. Those assessing the outcomes will then be&#xD;
      supplied with this de-identified data which will be separated into groups (interventional and&#xD;
      control arms) as well as for potential sub-group analysis based on age, sex, initial BMI,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Primary outcome Weight: Increased weight is associated with significant&#xD;
      reversible risk factors for cardiovascular disease and as such the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association guidelines for the management of prediabetes and diabetes recommend lifestyle&#xD;
      changes to achieve a weight reduction of 7% in obese and overweight patients. Weight will be&#xD;
      measured in the hospital outpatient clinic at enrollment (baseline) and after the study&#xD;
      intervention. The clinic which will provide biometric and lab measurements is part of the&#xD;
      government ambulatory care system, which is accredited by the Joint Commission International&#xD;
      (JCI), and as such has appropriate and internationally accepted protocols for the calibration&#xD;
      of the scales used in the clinic according to the manufacturers' recommendations. It is&#xD;
      customary for a staff nurse to measure the patient's weight at each clinic visit, and this&#xD;
      data is stored in the electronic medical record. Each study participant will also have access&#xD;
      to a scale within the home for weekly weight measurements, which will allow the health coach&#xD;
      to monitor participants' weight as well as to provide any needed individualized support. The&#xD;
      age and gender matched control patients will have weight data reviewed and recorded at the&#xD;
      times nearest to the matched study participant. The ongoing relationship between the health&#xD;
      coach and study participants is expected to be protective of retention in the interventional&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in cases of study discontinuation or withdrawal, the data for the intervention&#xD;
      participants will be classified under intention to treat, i.e, the data of those in the&#xD;
      intervention arm who do not complete the intervention will still have be considered as for&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes In addition to the primary outcome described above, the secondary outcomes&#xD;
      of blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid parameters will also be obtained in the clinic&#xD;
      at enrollment (baseline) and after completing the intervention. The blood pressure is&#xD;
      measured by an automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer which undergoes routine calibration&#xD;
      as explained above. The laboratory tests are performed by a single accredited laboratory. The&#xD;
      control patients will again have blood pressure measurements and appropriate lab data&#xD;
      reviewed and recorded at the times nearest the matched study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm will be compared against the control arm for significant differences in&#xD;
      both the primary and secondary outcomes. The T-test will be used for continuous outcomes. For&#xD;
      subgroup analyses, linear regression will be employed, examining the residual to assess model&#xD;
      assumptions and goodness-of-fit. For all tests, 2 sided p-values will be used with α &lt;= 0.05&#xD;
      level of significance. P-values will be reported to four decimal places with p-values less&#xD;
      than 0.001 reported as p &lt; 0.001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of analysis Primary outcome Weight: Greater reduction than control in % reduction from&#xD;
      baseline weight (T-test) Secondary outcomes Systolic blood pressure: Greater reduction than&#xD;
      control in % reduction from baseline systolic BP (T-test) Diastolic blood pressure: Greater&#xD;
      reduction than control in % reduction from baseline diastolic BP (T-test) Hemoglobin A1c:&#xD;
      Greater reduction than control in % reduction from baseline Hgb A1c (T-test) Total&#xD;
      cholesterol: Greater reduction than control in % reduction from baseline total cholesterol&#xD;
      (T-test) HDL cholesterol: Greater increase than control in % increase from baseline HDL&#xD;
      (T-test) LDL cholesterol: Greater reduction than control in % reduction from baseline LDL&#xD;
      (T-test) Triglycerides: Greater reduction than control in % reduction from baseline&#xD;
      triglycerides (T-test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring Data will be reported to the Kanad Hospital Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (KHREC), which is independent of the study organizers and the University of the United Arab&#xD;
      Emirates. This committee is responsible for establishing the ethical nature of all research&#xD;
      involving human subjects within Kanad Hospital and monitoring the progress of each approved&#xD;
      study, and stopping any study that has concerns regarding ethical matters or participant&#xD;
      safety. During the time of recruitment, interim analyses will be supplied confidentially to&#xD;
      KHREC along with any additional requested data. Currently, an interim analysis is planned&#xD;
      when recruitment reaches 50% of the calculated sample size (i.e 107 study participants);&#xD;
      however, the frequency of the interim reports will be ultimately be determined by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. After review of the interim data, the Ethics Committee will advise the&#xD;
      investigators if the effect of the intervention has been proved to be significantly different&#xD;
      from the controls beyond a reasonable doubt. If this occurs, the study will be completed&#xD;
      prior to the anticipated study date. Due to the anticipated benign nature of the intervention&#xD;
      and the stringent oversight supplied by KHREC, a dedicated Data Monitoring Committee is not&#xD;
      needed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms Since this is a nonpharmacological study, no significant risk of harm is anticipated.&#xD;
      Each study participant will continue separately under the care of the primary care physician.&#xD;
      As part of the informed consent, each participant is aware that any medications are taken for&#xD;
      hypertension or diabetes may need to be adjusted if the clinical situation changes due to&#xD;
      weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event, for the purposes of the study, will be defined as any occurrence of a&#xD;
      potentially or actually negative nature with respect to the participant's health. The most&#xD;
      likely adverse event would be hypoglycemia in those participants who may be taking certain&#xD;
      medications for diabetes. The study team considered excluding patients on medications for&#xD;
      diabetes from the trial, but ultimately decided to retain these patients in order to assess&#xD;
      the real world effect of the package of interventions on the overweight and obese&#xD;
      populations. The potential for adverse effects is highlighted in the informed consent form,&#xD;
      along with the contact information for the principal investigator (JK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health coach has been made aware of the symptoms of hypoglycemia, and which medications&#xD;
      place participants at risk. The coach is aware of the standard response to hypoglycemia, and&#xD;
      will educate any participants on the identified high risk medications on how to initially&#xD;
      manage hypoglycemia, as well as the need to follow up with the primary physician or emergency&#xD;
      services after the initial management phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each session, the health coach will ask the participants who are present if any problems&#xD;
      were encountered, and any potential adverse events will be reported to the principal&#xD;
      investigator for further investigation. This report will include the nature of the adverse&#xD;
      event, severity, and potential causes. Severe events or events that cannot be attributed to&#xD;
      other causes other than the study intervention will be reported to the Ethics Committee&#xD;
      within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Eligible individuals will be asked to invite family members to participate together&#xD;
      in the study. These family members will then undergo screening for eligibility as well.&#xD;
      Interested individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will then read the informed consent&#xD;
      either in English or Arabic. Any questions or concerns will be addressed by one of the&#xD;
      investigators in either English or Arabic, with translation as needed. All of the&#xD;
      investigators are medical doctors and experienced researchers. Once this process is&#xD;
      completed, and all questions and concerns are addressed, those who are interested in&#xD;
      participating will be enrolled upon signing the informed consent form in the appropriate&#xD;
      language (English or Arabic). One of the inclusion criteria is the ability of each potential&#xD;
      participant to give informed consent for enrollment in the trial; if there is any concern on&#xD;
      the investigators' part regarding the capacity of that individual to give consent, that&#xD;
      person will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The biometric and lab data will be stored as usual in the participants'&#xD;
      electronic medical record, which is access restricted, password protected, and otherwise&#xD;
      safeguarded by the information technology team of Kanad Hospital. Participants' data will not&#xD;
      be released outside of the study without individual written permission, except as requested&#xD;
      for monitoring purposes by KHREC or as legally required by local or national government&#xD;
      authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to data Only those investigators who perform clinical duties at the involved hospital&#xD;
      will have access to the original pre and post-intervention biometric and lab data via the&#xD;
      participants' electronic medical record. Once the data has been de-identified, all of the&#xD;
      investigators will have access to de-identified biometric and lab data. The health coach and&#xD;
      investigators will have access to the data supplied by each participant on a weekly basis,&#xD;
      which includes but is not limited to weight, caloric intake, minutes and type of exercise,&#xD;
      and correspondence. This access will be discontinued after the aggregate data has been&#xD;
      analyzed and published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary and post-trial care All Emiratis who are eligible for this study have comprehensive&#xD;
      health insurance which will cover, at no cost to the participant, any needed medical care. No&#xD;
      additional compensation is anticipated or required due to benign nature of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this study provide evidence of a clinically significant benefit to those who underwent&#xD;
      the study intervention, the age and gender matched controls will be contacted at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study and invited to receive the same intervention at the discretion of&#xD;
      Kanad Hospital&#xD;
