  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social cognition is an individual's ability to perceive, process, understand, and react to&#xD;
      other individuals in a social situation. Social cognition is impaired in individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, including difficulty recognizing others' emotions. A promising treatment&#xD;
      avenue for emotion recognition problems in individuals with schizophrenia is continued&#xD;
      practice with various facial expression recognition training programs. First degree relatives&#xD;
      of someone with schizophrenia are considered at familial high risk (FHR) for the illness,&#xD;
      because of its high level of heritability. It is therefore critical to explore if these&#xD;
      emotion recognition training programs could also benefit people at FHR. In this current&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to explore the social-cognitive profiles and their neural&#xD;
      correlates in FHR individuals. The investigators also aim to explore the potential efficacy&#xD;
      of an emotion recognition intervention to improve this ability in FHR individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will complete a battery of social cognitive tests as well as an fMRI scan to&#xD;
      explore the neuronal correlates underlying lower social cognitive functioning observed in FHR&#xD;
      individuals. FHR youth will be randomized into either a 4-session emotion recognition&#xD;
      training exercise program on iPad or an active control training program on iPad that includes&#xD;
      commercial games and control emotional attention bias training.&#xD;
