  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The orifices of all inguinal and ventral (including Spigelian) hernias were carefully&#xD;
      recorded at the beginning of laparoscopy (n=201) of other reason (cholecystectomy,&#xD;
      fundoplication) in 2003-5. The patients with occult hernias (n=43) were followed-up 15 years&#xD;
      to find out what percentage of hernias would become symptomatic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective laparoscopic study of 201 consecutive adult patients operated in&#xD;
      2003-5. There were 133 females and 68 males with a mean age 53 Â± 14 years. The index&#xD;
      laparoscopic operation included 104 cholecystectomies, 55 fundoplications, 36 diagnostic, 5&#xD;
      appendectomies and one insertion of peritoneal catheter. A careful clinical examination of&#xD;
      the groin and ventral region was performed on everybody and all patients with clinical&#xD;
      hernias were excluded. Laparoscopic exploration of the inguinal region was considered safe&#xD;
      and did not greatly increase the operative time. All patients were informed that hernial&#xD;
      orifices would be explored during laparoscopy, and a written consent was asked prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Permission to repair large hernias (&gt; 1 cm) was also obtained before laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were followed-up 15 years to find out, what percentage of occult, symptomless&#xD;
      inguinal and ventral hernias were later operated because of harmfull symptoms.&#xD;
