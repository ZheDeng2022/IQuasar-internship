  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study in patients with resectable and borderline resectable&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study intervention involves molecular profiling Purity Independent Subtyping of Tumors&#xD;
      (PurIST) subtyping of pretreatment Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS/FNA)&#xD;
      samples to determine pancreatic cancer subtype. Neoadjuvant therapy is directed based on the&#xD;
      molecular subtype (classical vs. basal). Patients with classical subtype will receive a&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX) and patients with basal subtype will receive an&#xD;
      alternative standard therapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel).&#xD;
