  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain is a common affection due to ageing, sedentarism and intense exercise&#xD;
      practice causing acute and chronic injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this trial is to prove efficacy of a natural topical composition&#xD;
      containing Arnica montana, Hypericum perforatum, Calendula officinalis, Melaleuca sp. and&#xD;
      menthol in pain management in adults with acute or chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial will include 200 patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, 100 in the intervention group receiving the topical formula and 100 in&#xD;
      the placebo group, who will receive a similar formula without active ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The products will be applied topically twice daily for 14 days in areas with moderate or&#xD;
      severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are immediate and long-term pain alleviation, stiffness perception joint&#xD;
      mobility, and general recovery perception.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Well-being is understood as the absence of limitations or debilitating conditions that make&#xD;
      impossible to enjoy a full and satisfactory life. Among these limitations, a reduced or&#xD;
      impaired motility because of painful and inflammatory processes (acute and chronic), can&#xD;
      greatly disturb a vital and optimistic attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain affects between one-third and one-half of the population only in the UK, and&#xD;
      around 20.4% in the US. It is likely to increase with population ageing and tends to be more&#xD;
      common in women. Ageing is translated in an increase in the incidence and span of chronic&#xD;
      illnesses, including osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, lower back pain, non-arthritis joint pain&#xD;
      or carpal tunnel syndrome, among others. In addition, muscular and joints pain unrelated to&#xD;
      any specific disease also tends to appear with age. Beyond that, current lifestyle frequently&#xD;
      involves stressful jobs, eventful agendas and non-stop activity either in professional or&#xD;
      leisure time. These facts extend the prevalence of chronic pain to younger segments of the&#xD;
      population and to people not affected by previous disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary lifestyle and computer-based jobs represent a common cause of muscular contractures&#xD;
      and pain, especially in the back and neck areas. Another important contributor to chronic&#xD;
      pain is perceived stress and anxiety response systems. As an emergent antagonist phenomenon,&#xD;
      increasing awareness of a healthy lifestyle has entailed a rise in the popularity of physical&#xD;
      exercise in the last decades. As an example, the number of running events finishers in the&#xD;
      U.S. stabilized in 2014 at almost 20 million people, with figures having been on the rise for&#xD;
      the previous 25 years. The popularization of exercise programs such as CrossFit illustrate&#xD;
      that the trend is directed not only towards a rise in practice, but also in intensity. Thus,&#xD;
      the increase in the practice of high-intensity physical activity and the alternation between&#xD;
      sedentary and exercise periods involve an increase in inflammatory and acute painful&#xD;
      episodes, being tendinitis and joint lesions the major problem, followed by sprains or&#xD;
      bruises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacological management of these conditions involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs), local corticosteroids, acetaminophen, chondroitin sulfate or even opioids.&#xD;
      These are effective drugs but with serious side effects in some cases, especially in the&#xD;
      long-term utilization. Severe drawbacks related to the prolonged utilization of these drugs&#xD;
      include drug ineffectiveness, toxicity of certain agents, hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      hemorrhage, nauseas and even fatal outcomes including death and suicide. Importantly,&#xD;
      increased abuse of painkillers has been reported in several countries, exceeding tobacco&#xD;
      consumption and being considered a public health problem. Furthermore, the use of painkillers&#xD;
      should be avoided in sensitive population groups including children and pregnant women, who&#xD;
      are equally exposed to sustained or acute pain episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative solutions of greater safety but equivalent rapid relief and recovery&#xD;
      effectiveness are a necessity. In this sense, the most useful approach are natural products,&#xD;
      without tolerability concerns, compatible with other interventions and providing a rapid&#xD;
      effect. These generalize access to effective treatment to both patients and physiotherapy&#xD;
      professionals. Considering the well-established beneficial effects of physiotherapy in&#xD;
      handling chronic pain, professionals need effective and safe solutions that they can use&#xD;
      without concerns of side effects or pharmacological interactions, since they may not have&#xD;
      access to the full medical record of the patients. In turn, the ability of handling&#xD;
      self-treatment without concern increases the quality of life in patients suffering from&#xD;
      pain-involving conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the use of a topical cream composed by natural extracts with&#xD;
      complementary and synergistic effects for pain management. Menthol reduces pain and increases&#xD;
      blood flow, warming up the muscle and enhancing absorption of the rest of the extracts.&#xD;
      Arnica montana reduces pain, has anti-inflammatory effects and potentiates tissue repair.&#xD;
      Hypericum perforatum provides anti-inflammatory effect and drives tissue regeneration and&#xD;
      scarring. Calendula officinalis reduces swelling and distension, boosts healing of mild&#xD;
      injuries and prevents infection. Finally, Melaleuca alternifolia complements the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect and acts as a natural preservative due to its potent antimicrobial&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The synergistic combination of these natural ingredients may provide a convenient solution&#xD;
      for the management acute or chronic pain. The aim of this study is to assess the benefits of&#xD;
      the topical formulation in reducing musculoskeletal pain, both as an immediate relief of pain&#xD;
      and as a solution for injury recovery.&#xD;
