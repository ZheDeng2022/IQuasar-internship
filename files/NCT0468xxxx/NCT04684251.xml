  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemorrhoidal disease is amongst the most common rectal conditions causing significant&#xD;
      distress to the affected patients. Current surgical techniques for the treatment of internal&#xD;
      haemorrhoids are associated with several drawbacks and sometimes high recurrence rates. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new minimally invasive&#xD;
      technique that is based on blocking the arteries that feed the haemorrhoids and thus&#xD;
      potentially leading to a decrease in their size. A recently published paper with 14 patients&#xD;
      showed good results in terms of safety(Vidal et. al.). Despite the promising preliminary&#xD;
      evidence, there is still a need for more studies and additional data. Furthermore, at the&#xD;
      current time, there are no studies assessing quality of life changes post embolisation for&#xD;
      these patients and the investigators hope to evaluate this important aspect of treatment as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide the investigators with results regarding the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      arterial embolisation for advanced haemorrhoid disease. This will be the first study to&#xD;
      provide data on short and long term efficacy (in terms of re-bleeding and re-operation rates)&#xD;
      as well as to provide evidence on the effect of this novel treatment on quality of life. This&#xD;
      study will also be the largest study to date and if successful will pave the way for a large&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial comparing the gold standard surgical treatment to the&#xD;
      embolisation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The embolisation of haemorrhoid vessel is not an experimental technique and it has been used&#xD;
      in the past in cases of uncontrollable hemorrhoidal- related bleeding with good results and&#xD;
      without morbidity. However, this is the first time that the investigators will use this&#xD;
      technique as a first line treatment for haemorrhoids and part of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of this approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, prospective, single arm and single centre trial to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of haemorrhoid embolisation. Patients with advanced hemorrhoidal disease (grade&#xD;
      II-IV) will be identified through the colorectal clinic with a recruitment target of 24&#xD;
      patients. The duration of patient participation in this study is 24 months. During this time&#xD;
      the patient will have to attend 4 appointments (including the treatment session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases in this study will be performed as day case procedures. The patients will be&#xD;
      admitted to the interventional radiology day unit in the morning, where a standard&#xD;
      pre-assessment will take place. The main intervention will be the embolisation of their&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal arteries. The embolisation will be performed using a standard approach with a&#xD;
      right femoral puncture and after inserting a 5 Fr introducer sheath. The inferior mesenteric&#xD;
      artery will be catheterized using a Simmons catheter (radiofocus-Terumo). The superior rectal&#xD;
      arteries will be then catheterized with a rapid transit microcatheter Progreat microcatheter&#xD;
      (Radiofocus-Terumo) and then embolised with a number of coils. The arteries will be packed&#xD;
      with coils until there is complete blood flow stasis within the target artery bilaterally.&#xD;
      The technical success of the procedure will be assessed by achieving stasis of blood flow&#xD;
      distally to the site of the embolisation. This will be assessed fluoroscopically. CE marked&#xD;
      coils will be used for the embolisation of the arteries feeding the haemorrhoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure, patients will be discharged to their usual place of residence after&#xD;
      6 hours of observations in the interventional radiology day unit. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed up in the colorectal clinic after 3 months, 12 months and 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Resolution of symptoms 1 year after operation is the primary endpoint. This will be assessed with a previously validated patient questionnaire of bowel function (Nyström et. al.). Five questions about haemorrhoidal symptoms will be appended while retaining the structure of the questionnaire. Patients will also submit a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire (SF-12 Form). Questionnaires will be completed before the operation, at 3, 12 and 24 months follow-up.</description>

The pain experienced during most of the day and a peak pain will be recorded straight after the procedure and using a ten point visual analogue scale (VAS) (0, no pain; 10, worst pain imaginable). Side effects and potential complications related to the procedure will be documented in the case report form.</description>

    <description>The treatment arm will undergo the intervention with embolisation of their hemorrhoidal arteries. The embolisation will be performed using a standard right femoral puncture and after inserting a 5 Fr introducer sheath. The inferior mesenteric artery will be catheterised using a Simmons catheter (radiofocus-Terumo). The superior rectal arteries will be then catheterized with a rapid transit microcatheter Progreat microcatheter (Radiofocus-Terumo) and embolised with coils. The treatment will include the use of fluoroscopy for which the radiation protection department of Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has been consulted. The technical success of the procedure will be assessed fluoroscopically by achieving stasis of blood flow distally to the site of the embolization. CE marked coils will be used for the embolisation of the arteries feeding the haemorrhoids.</description>
