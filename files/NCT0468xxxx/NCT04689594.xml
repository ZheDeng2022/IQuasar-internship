        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who plan to undergo ESD for the treatment of superficial esophageal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients aged &gt;=20 years at the time of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with no clinical metastasis (cN0M0) by cervical to abdominal CT&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with an endoscopically diagnosed depth of wall invasion remaining in the&#xD;
             epithelium (EP) or lamina propria mucosae (LPM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a tumor diagnosed as &gt;=50% and &lt;100% of circumference, and with&#xD;
             prediction that resection circumference will be &gt;=75% and &lt;100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a tumor the major axis is &lt;=50 mm, and with prediction that a major axis&#xD;
             of a resection will be &lt;=80 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If the patient has multiple lesions, the circumference of all minor lesions other than&#xD;
             the one lesion with the largest circumference (major lesion) must be &lt;50%. However, if&#xD;
             it is predicted that the major axis of the mucosal defect is &gt;80 mm due to treating&#xD;
             the major and minor lesions and assembling ulcers after the treating, the patient is&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma (including high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia)&#xD;
             as confirmed by biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients whose lesion is confirmed to be localized in the thoracic esophagus (lesions&#xD;
             in the cervical esophagus or abdominal esophagus will be excluded). The location of&#xD;
             the lesion will be determined by endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who have not received pretreatment for esophageal cancer. Treatment by ESD&#xD;
             for superficial esophageal cancer for which the depth of wall invasion has been&#xD;
             assessed to remain in the epithelium (EP) or lamina propria mucosae (LPM) is not&#xD;
             included in the definition of pretreatment. However, patients who have a scar due to&#xD;
             previous ESD in the major or minor lesions will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with an ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients in whom a commonly used endoscope with a tip diameter of 8.9 mm can pass&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with a dysphagia score of 0&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients whose laboratory values within 28 days before enrolment meet all of the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
