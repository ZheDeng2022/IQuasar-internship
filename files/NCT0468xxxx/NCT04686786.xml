    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to Week 61 (follow up period)</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs will include abuse-related adverse events (AEs) and AEs related to medication handling irregularities (MHIs). The number of Participants With TEAEs and TESAEs will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Changes in Vital Sign Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 57 or early termination (ET)</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs will be measured with the participant in a sitting/semi-recumbent position after 5 minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Changes in Physical and Neurological Examination Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 57 or early termination (ET)</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Positive Response to Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 61 (follow up period)</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation (SI) on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; The scale identifies SI severity and intensity, which may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit suicide. C-SSRS SI severity subscale ranges from 0 (no SI) to 5 (active SI with plan and intent).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Positive Response to Modified Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment - Benzodiazepines (mCIWA-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 54 up to Week 61</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment - Benzodiazepines (mCIWA-B) is a sensitive instrument to measure withdrawal under conditions where there is a taper of medication (rather than abrupt discontinuation). It consists of 17-items that monitor the type and severity of BZD withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, fatigue, appetite, and sleeplessness. The total score ranges from 1 to 68 with higher scores indicating more severe withdrawal.</description>

&#xD;
          -  A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a&#xD;
             nonsterilized male partner must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception from signing of informed consent through 30 days post last dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant with a pregnant or a nonpregnant partner of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use a condom during treatment and until the end of relevant systemic&#xD;
             exposure in the male participant for 94 days following the last dose with the&#xD;
             investigational medicinal product (IMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are capable of giving signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are able, in the opinion of the investigator, to understand the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who, in the judgment of the investigator, experienced poor tolerability&#xD;
             to the IMP during the double-blind trial or whose safety assessments resulted in new&#xD;
