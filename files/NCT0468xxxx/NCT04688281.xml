  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Medicurtain®, an antiadhesion&#xD;
      barrier in patients who underwent In Situ Decompression for single level and unilateral&#xD;
      herniated lumbar intervertebral disc. Subjects were randomly assigned either into&#xD;
      Medicurtain® treatment group or control group. Adhesion formations between the two groups at&#xD;
      12 weeks after surgery were compared by using MRI-applied scar score, ODI (Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability Index) and VAS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blind, parallel-controlled trial. A subject&#xD;
      aged between 20~70 years old who was reserved for In Situ Decompression for single level and&#xD;
      unilateral herniated lumbar intervertebral disc considered to be eligible for study entry.&#xD;
      Subject screening was conducted at Visit 1 (screening period) to determine study based on the&#xD;
      results of the examination for the spine surgery. Subject who met the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were randomly assigned into either the treatment and control group at Visit 2&#xD;
      (Baseline: 0day) and received the defined treatment according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct evaluation of the level of adhesion around surgical area was analyzed by measuring&#xD;
      peridural fibrosis and scar score through MRI (Total MRI scar score). Jeffrey S. Ross et al.&#xD;
      reported that in evaluating scar in disc region, MR has been used by many researchers and&#xD;
      shows 96% accuracy in identifying scar in disc region. Also measuring the level of fibrosis&#xD;
      in surgical wounds through MRI scar score has already been widely used in many large-scale&#xD;
      studies and shows almost perfect conformity degree I inter-and intra-observer reading&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore based on literatures, this study measures the level of adhesion in surgical wounds&#xD;
      through MRI scar score, which has been validated and widely used in similar studies. Using&#xD;
      MRI 3 months after surgery, the level of scar in lumbar spinal column is evaluated. All MRI&#xD;
      images should be evaluated by one radiologist unless the randomization of the treatment group&#xD;
      and control group is revealed. Peridural fibrosis is evaluated on the improved and unimproved&#xD;
      state of axial T1-weighted image contrast. In MR image evaluation, location of peridural&#xD;
      fibrosis to 5 consecutive axial sections that are 4mm thick around the intervertebral disc is&#xD;
      recorded; these 5 levels are divided into quadrant which are divided by 2 straight lines&#xD;
      vertical to the center of thecal sac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degree of peridural fibrosis is scaled by scar grading scale in 0~4 point range according to&#xD;
      the dimension of the quadrant filled with scar. Record the scar score of each quadrant of 5&#xD;
      levels (total of 20 grades-scar score method). The measured scar scores of the&#xD;
      investigational device group and control device group are compared and evaluated with total&#xD;
      of 20 scores on each quadrant of 5 levels (Total MRI score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks (2 weeks±3days) of the index surgery, following tests were performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the subject's condition and adverse events at before signing on the informed consent&#xD;
      and after the surgery. The investigation device is composed of mainly Sodium Hyaluronate(HA)&#xD;
      and Hydroxyethylstarch(HES) which were degraded in the liver and excreted from the kidney,&#xD;
      therefore, it is included liver and kidney function test and blood coagulation test since&#xD;
      abnormal function of blood coagulation can increase adhesion around the surgical wound area.&#xD;
