  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative mental health effects of war exposure and displacement are pervasive, but many&#xD;
      displaced persons and refugees in low-and-middle income countries lack access to&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments. Community lay-therapists are a promising solution for the global&#xD;
      mental health field. However, in spite of results from randomized-control trials, no research&#xD;
      to-date has examined the external validity of community-led lay-therapist effectiveness. In&#xD;
      this exploratory study, longitudinal data at three time points were collected from 28&#xD;
      Arabic-speaking displaced persons (nineteen women and nine men, ages 18-57) seeking mental&#xD;
      health services from the Jiyan Foundation: a non-profit founded and based in Kurdish Iraq.&#xD;
      Lay therapists trained in evidence-based treatments upon being hired operated largely&#xD;
      independently of supervision from foreign clinicians. Participants in weekly psychotherapy&#xD;
      completed the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist (PCL-5) and the Psychological Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at baseline, one month, and three months, as well as a modified measure&#xD;
      assessing traumatic exposure, purpose-in-life, and a modified Afghan Daily Stressors Scale at&#xD;
      baseline to assess for moderators of change over time.&#xD;
