  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      81 overhead athletes with Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD) will be included in&#xD;
      this study. Participants will be randomly divided into 3 different groups of 26 people. In&#xD;
      each group will be applied posterior shoulder stretching exercises (PSSE) performed with&#xD;
      different Muscle Energy Techniques (MET).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post Isometric Relaxation Group (PIRG) participants will perform a PSSE with post isometric&#xD;
      relaxation (PIR) technique, Isolytic Stretching Group (ISG) participants will perform a PSSE&#xD;
      with isolytic stretching technique and Static Stretching Group Group (SSG) participants will&#xD;
      perform a PSSE with static stretching technique. All exercises will be performed in the&#xD;
      modified cross-body position. Subacromial space and posterior capsule thickness will be&#xD;
      measured using a 7-12 MHz linear transducer with USG (LOGIQ e Ultrasound, GE Healthcare,&#xD;
      USA). Athletes' GIRD results and rotational ROM measurements will be measured and recorded&#xD;
      using a bubble inclinometer (Fabrication End Inc, New York, USA). The upper extremity&#xD;
      functional performance of the athletes will be evaluated with the Functional Throwing&#xD;
      Performance Index (FTPI). Evaluations will be repeated tree times before, after the&#xD;
      stretching exercise and 30 minutes later and the effects of different muscle energy&#xD;
      techniques (MET) will be compared. Investigators hypothesized PSSE made with different MET&#xD;
      techniques have different effects on Acromio-Humeral Distance, posterior capsule thickness,&#xD;
      rotational ROM measurements and performance on overhead athletes with GIRD and the effects of&#xD;
      MET would be superior to static stretching.&#xD;

    <description>Athletes will be positioned in a modified cross-body position. They will be asked to actively bring their underlying arm in the direction of horizontal adduction up to the physiological barrier barrier. The participants will be asked to perform an isometric contraction for 5 seconds in the horizontal abduction direction with 20% of the maximum muscle strength. After the relaxation, the arm will be moved towards horizontal adduction and 15 seconds active-assistive stretching will be applied. Participants will be given a 5-second rest period between contractions. This stretching exercise will be applied in 5 repetitions for one session.</description>

They will be asked to actively bring their underlying arm in the direction of horizontal adduction up to the physiological barrier barrier. The participants will be asked to perform a contraction in the horizontal abduction direction with 20% of the maximum muscle strength. When the muscle contraction occurs, the arm will be moved quickly in 2-4 seconds towards horizontal adduction and 15 seconds active-assistive stretching will be applied. Participants will be given a 5-second rest period between stretches. This stretching exercise will be applied in 5 repetitions for one session.</description>
