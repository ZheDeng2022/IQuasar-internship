  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been shown to offer numerous health benefits and be particularly important in&#xD;
      preventing weight gain or regain for people with obesity. Exercise guidelines can be&#xD;
      difficult to interpret and apply independently and do not address specific exercise&#xD;
      limitations in individuals with obesity. The exercise monitoring system proposed in this&#xD;
      study might provide a new method to meet aerobic exercise guidelines independently with&#xD;
      reduced risk of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise monitoring system controls, in real-time, the intensity of an exercise session&#xD;
      consisting of treadmill walking. During treadmill walking, the exercise monitoring system&#xD;
      will instruct participants to increase or decrease how much participants raise their knees&#xD;
      and swing their arms while maintaining a smooth contact with the ground, based on real-time&#xD;
      readings of the participants' heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, each participant will perform a control and an experimental training&#xD;
      session. Both training sessions will include four blocks of 7 minutes of treadmill walking&#xD;
      alternated with three periods of rest (3 min). In the control session, participants will&#xD;
      monitor the intensity of exercise independently using a standard heart rate monitor and&#xD;
      control it by adjusting their walking speed. In the experimental session, each participant&#xD;
      will follow the exercise monitoring system instructions displayed on a TV, and treadmill&#xD;
      walking speed will be set at a comfortable walking speed. Target heart rates of 40% and 60%&#xD;
      HRR will be used as the exercise intensities in both training sessions. The investigators&#xD;
      will examine energy expenditure, heart rate, and kinematic measures under control and&#xD;
      experimental conditions. The goals of this clinical trial are to determine the effect of&#xD;
      exercising with the exercise monitoring system in individuals with obesity. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the experimental session will result in higher total energy cost and&#xD;
      efficiency than the control session; and in lower heart rate error, tibial positive peak&#xD;
      accelerations and feedback errors than the control session. The investigators will also&#xD;
      compare the effect of the exercise monitoring system between active and sedentary individuals&#xD;
      with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will inform proposals for larger interventions that will focus on&#xD;
      1) testing different types of obesity and osteoarthritis, 2) adding a resistance-training&#xD;
      component, and 3) integrating a diet intervention.&#xD;
