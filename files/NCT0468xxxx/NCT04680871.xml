  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clinically validate noninvasive, continuous, temperature&#xD;
      parameter of an in-ear temperature sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this performance evaluation, a minimum of 105 subjects will be enrolled with 30% to&#xD;
      50% of the subjects (minimum of 32 subjects) will be febrile, a minimum of 99.5°F (37.5°C).&#xD;
      The Reference will be a validated Reference Clinical Thermometer for Sublingual Temperature.&#xD;
      Test device will be the in-ear temperature sensor adjusted mode temperature sensor (Device&#xD;
      Under Test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to take 1-3 months to complete for this subject population for final&#xD;
      validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple developmental phases may be conducted and will be reviewed for readiness for&#xD;
      continuation to validation. If modifications are warranted, the initial data sets will be&#xD;
      used for algorithm development. The full validation set will be collected independent of&#xD;
      developmental data sets.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will sit for 20 to 30 minutes. The subject may be covered with a blanket. At the end of the wait period, a homogeneous temperature will be taken from both thermometers. The subjects will be disconnected from the devices and excused.&#xD;
The study is expected to take 30 minutes to an hour for each normal temperature subject.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Induced Febrile Subjects</arm_group_label>
    <description>Heating of the body will be created using multiple heating devices. A vapor barrier will cover the entire body of the subject from the base of the neck down, including the feet. The purpose of the vapor barrier is to prevent evaporative cooling during the heating period. Subjects will then sit in an infrared sauna. Electric heating pads will be placed on the back, torso, and/or feet. Finally, a nylon cape will be placed over the body from the base of the neck to the floor and a head covering will be placed on the head. (See Figure 2 for reference)&#xD;
During the Warming period (approximately 90 minutes) the sublingual temperature will be raised to a minimum of 99.5°F (as determined by the Reference Clinical Thermometer). A febrile temperature will be recorded from both thermometers.</description>
