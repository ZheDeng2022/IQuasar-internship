  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, first-in-human, open-label study of JAB-8263, this study has two parts:&#xD;
      solid tumor dose escalation and expansion study and hematology tumor dose escalation and&#xD;
      expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two parts will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) and assess the DLT of JAB-8263 in treatment with patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      and hematology tumors separately. 30 subjects each will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JAB-8263 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the highly conserved bromodomain pockets of the&#xD;
      bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      JAB-8263 as a single agent to adult subjects with advanced malignant tumors. To assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of JAB-8263 To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PDc).To evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of JAB-8263&#xD;
