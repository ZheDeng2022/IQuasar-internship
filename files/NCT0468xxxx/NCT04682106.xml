    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY3493269 in&#xD;
      healthy participants. The blood tests will be performed to check how much LY3493269 gets into&#xD;
      the bloodstream, how long the body takes to eliminate it and how body handles LY3493269. The&#xD;
      study will last up to approximately 71 days for each participant, including screening&#xD;

          3. Participants who are healthy as determined through medical evaluation including&#xD;
             screening medical history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population&#xD;
             or clinical research unit (CRU), or results with acceptable deviations that are judged&#xD;
             to be not clinically significant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have venous access sufficient to allow blood sampling as per the protocol.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
