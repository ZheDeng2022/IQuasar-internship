    <textblock>
      Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most common cause of food allergies in children with&#xD;
      incidence estimated as 2% to 7.5% in the first year of life and is characterized by an&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction to milk proteins, Formula and exclusively breast-fed babies can develop&#xD;
      CMPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunologic mechanism behind the development of CMPA is not yet clear. However, it is&#xD;
      clear that CMPA is caused by IgE- as well as non-IgE-mediated immune reactions, IgE-mediated&#xD;
      CMPA is better described and it is typically immediate, type 1 hypersensitivity (minutes to 2&#xD;
      hours after consumption of cow's milk) while non IgE- mediated CMPA is delayed, type 4&#xD;
      hypersensitivity. a diverse range of symptoms of variable intensity in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of immediate and delayed reactions to the same allergen may occur in the same&#xD;
      patient, symptoms and signs related to CMPA may involve many different organ systems, mostly&#xD;
      the skin and the gastro- intestinal and respiratory tracts. The involvement of two systems&#xD;
      increases the probability of CMPA, whereas some symptoms are more likely to be present in&#xD;
      infant with a positive test for CMP-specific IgE (eg, angioedema, atopic eczema); however,&#xD;
      there is a large overlap. The same symptoms may appear in CMP IgE-positive and IgE-negative&#xD;
      patients, particularly in infant with gastrointestinal manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in unselected infants with CMPA show that approximately half of them have atopic&#xD;
      eczema, and 25% to 50% are affected by some gastrointestinal tract involvement whereas other&#xD;
      clinical manifestations are less common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to accurately diagnose CMPA to avoid the consequences of either under- or&#xD;
      overdiagnosis, skin prick test and serum specific IgE tests are helpful for diagnosis, mainly&#xD;
      in IgE-mediated forms . On the other hand, in cases of CMPA with gastrointestinal chronic&#xD;
      signs and symptoms, skin prick test and specific IgE tests are usually negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the reason why the only reliable method of diagnosis in such cases is a food&#xD;
      challenge that need to be done in hospital and could be also dangerous, this explain why&#xD;
      there is a growing interest to find new biomarkers for diagnosis and follow up.Eosinophil&#xD;
      cationic protein (ECP) is a cytotoxic protein released from eosinophils upon activation the&#xD;
      measurement of ECP levels can be used as a non invasive indicator to detect active&#xD;
      inflammation in the body.&#xD;
