    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether advising parents to apply emollient&#xD;
      (moisturiser) to their child's skin for the first year of life in addition to best practice&#xD;
      infant skin care advice can prevent or delay the onset of eczema in high-risk children, when&#xD;
      compared with a control group who are given the best practice infant skin care advice only.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A diagnosis of eczema between 12 and 24 months of age (defined as meeting the United Kingdom (UK) Working Party Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis).</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To reflect the chronicity of eczema, these criteria refer to signs and symptoms present over the past year. Applying the criteria at 24 months of age will therefore detect eczema present only between the ages of 12 and 24 months, thus excluding transient eczematous rashes which are common in the first year of life and often reported by parents as &quot;eczema&quot; but less likely to be true atopic eczema</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of parental report of eczema between birth and 24 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>

Any parental report of a clinical diagnosis of eczema. Completion by parents of UK Working Party Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis at 12 and 24 months.</description>

    <description>First parental report of a clinical diagnosis of eczema. First topical corticosteroid and /or immunosuppressant prescription for eczema.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of other allergic diseases using parental reports, allergic sensitization and confirmed diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parental reported wheezing and allergic rhinitis between 12 and 24 months. Parental report of a clinical diagnosis of food allergy at 12 and 24 months. Parental report of food allergy at 12 and 24 months. Parents will be specifically questioned about cow's milk, egg, peanuts, and other nuts plus &quot;any other food&quot;.&#xD;
Allergic sensitisation at 24 months to any of the following common allergens: milk, egg, peanut, cat, grass pollen, house dust mite.&#xD;
Confirmed diagnosis of food allergy at 24 months to milk, egg, peanut or 'any of milk, egg or peanut'. The diagnosis is derived from a combination of parental report, allergic sensitisation and food challenge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of eczema with EASI eczema severity scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using eczema area and severity index (EASI) at 24 months. The area score is recorded for each of four regions of the body: head and neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. The area score is the percentage of skin affected by eczema for each body region. The scores given are from 0-6 where a score of 0 is given when the percentage of skin affected by eczema in the region is 0%, and a score of 6 is given when 90-100% of the region is affected by eczema. The severity score is recorded for each of the four body regions for four signs: redness, thickness, scratching and lichenification. Scores are given from 0-3 where a score of 3 is for most severe signs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of eczema with POEM eczema severity scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using patient oriented eczema measure (POEM) at 12 and 24 months. The scores given are from 0-28, where a score of 28 is for the most severe.</description>
