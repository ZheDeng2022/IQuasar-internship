  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      L-glutamine has been approved in the US to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD) in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. The purpose of this&#xD;
      single-center, open-label, phase 4 study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics&#xD;
      and safety of L-glutamine in patients with SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with a mutation in the β-hemoglobin gene that results&#xD;
      in abnormal polymerization of hemoglobin. Polymerization of hemoglobin causes the red blood&#xD;
      cell to sickle, leading to a cascade of events which cause acute complications for SCD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-glutamine has been approved in the US to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD) in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this single-center, open-label, phase 4 study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety of L-glutamine in patients with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 SCD patients and 4 healthy volunteers will receive weight-based dosing of L-glutamine for 3&#xD;
      weeks. Doses will be changed weekly: 0.1 g/kg administered twice daily during week 1, 0.3&#xD;
      g/kg administered twice daily during week 2, and 0.6 g/kg administered once daily during week&#xD;
      3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of L-glutamine in&#xD;
      SCD patients compared with healthy volunteers.&#xD;
