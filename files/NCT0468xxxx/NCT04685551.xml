  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed intervention centers on improving survivorship outcomes among African American&#xD;
      and Latinx cancer survivor and caregiver dyads. As a result, there will be four major&#xD;
      outcomes. First, as a result of partnership with minority social institutions (e.g. faith&#xD;
      leaders), we will develop an in-depth culturally sensitive curriculum and survivorship care&#xD;
      plan for Cancer Survivorship and Caregiver Leaders Aimed for Minority Populations (CSC&#xD;
      LAMPs). Second, we will increase knowledge and skills by evaluating a comprehensive cancer&#xD;
      survivorship training program designed for underserved health professional students. Third,&#xD;
      the implementation of this program will improve survivorship outcomes among African American&#xD;
      and Latinx cancer survivors with advanced stage cancer and their caregivers. Lastly, this&#xD;
      study will build sustainability for underserved minorities with the training of 30 future&#xD;
      healthcare providers as a valuable community resource for improving cancer survivorship&#xD;
      outcomes. The long-term outcomes of the CSC LAMPs program will generate workforce capacity&#xD;
      and diversity in cancer-based clinical practice, research, and community advocacy for&#xD;
      underserved minority cancer survivors and caregivers.&#xD;
