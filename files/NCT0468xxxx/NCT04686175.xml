    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of INZ-701, an&#xD;
      ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) enzyme replacement therapy, for&#xD;
      the treatment of ENPP1 Deficiency (including Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy&#xD;
      Type 1 [GACI] and Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets Type 2 [ARHR2]).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INZ-701 is an ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy in development for the treatment of ENPP1 Deficiency (including Generalized Arterial&#xD;
      Calcification of Infancy Type 1 [GACI] and Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets Type&#xD;
      2 [ARHR2]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, first-in-human (FIH), first-in-patient&#xD;
      (FIP), and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study followed by a long-term open-label extension&#xD;
      period conducted in adults with ENPP1 Deficiency. It is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple ascending doses of&#xD;
      INZ-701. The goal of the study is to identify a safe, tolerable dose that restores inorganic&#xD;
      pyrophosphate (PPi) to therapeutically effective levels in ENPP1 Deficiency to be used in&#xD;
      further clinical development. Exploratory endpoints for the Extension Period of the study&#xD;
      will include evaluations of skeletal, vascular, and physical function as well as patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation consists of a Screening Period, a 32-day Dose Evaluation Period, and a&#xD;
      48-week Extension Period following completion of the Dose Evaluation Period,&#xD;

          7. Concurrent participation in another non-Inozyme clinical study and/or receipt of any&#xD;
             other investigational new drug within 5 half-lives of the last dose of the other&#xD;
             investigational product or from 4 weeks prior to the first dose of INZ-701, whichever&#xD;
             is longer, or use of an investigational device, through completion of participation in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Last symptoms from a COVID-19 vaccination within 14 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
