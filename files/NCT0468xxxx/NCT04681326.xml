  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing emergency surgery for peritonitis are at increased risk of abdominal&#xD;
      wall-related complications. In patients with peritonitis the risk of incisional hernia (IH)&#xD;
      is extremely elevated. The incidence of IH in patients operated with peritonitis is up to 54&#xD;
      %, compared with an incidence of 11-26 % in the general surgical population. Moreover, up to&#xD;
      24.1 % of patients with peritonitis undergoing emergency laparotomy may develop fascial&#xD;
      dehiscence. The evaluation of quality of life of patients with IH showed lower mean scores on&#xD;
      physical components of health-related quality of life and body image. The prophylactic mesh&#xD;
      implantation demonstrated to reduce the incisional hernia rate in patients undergoing&#xD;
      vascular or bariatric procedures. However, the intraperitoneal non absorbable mesh&#xD;
      implantation in infected fields is generally considered at least of doubtful safety because&#xD;
      of the theoretical increased risk of chronic mesh infection and enterocutaneous fistula. Most&#xD;
      incisional hernias develop during the first three months after surgery, which represents the&#xD;
      critical period for the healing of transected muscular and fibrous layers of the abdominal&#xD;
      wall. However, most studies recommended a long-term follow up period of up to at least 5&#xD;
      years for midline abdominal incisions to determine the real incisional hernia rate. The&#xD;
      midline abdominal incision is preferred in abdominal surgery, as it provides wide and rapid&#xD;
      access compared other incisions. However, the incidence of incisional hernias is higher&#xD;
      following midline abdominal incisions than in other abdominal incisions. In emergency surgery&#xD;
      the midline incision in the majority of cases is a necessity. Several factors affect the&#xD;
      process of wound healing: surgical site infection, poor surgical technique, and&#xD;
      patient-related factors (i.e. peritonitis, old age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies, hepatic cirrhosis, jaundice, renal impairment, malignancy, cardiac disease,&#xD;
      chest problems, previous abdominal incisions, steroid therapy). Data about the use of&#xD;
      biological prosthesis in infected fields are scarce and derive principally from case reports&#xD;
      and case series. However, indications about their use and usefulness in infected fields have&#xD;
      been recently published by the Italian Biological Prosthesis Working Group (IBPWG). A&#xD;
      previously published prospective observational study evaluated the efficacy of implantation&#xD;
      of biological prosthesis in high risk patients in order to reduce the incidence of incisional&#xD;
      hernia. This study suggested the efficacy of this kind of prosthesis in reducing incisional&#xD;
      hernia rate in patients with multiple risk factors. A recently published meta-analysis showed&#xD;
      as the use of biological prosthesis in ventral hernia repair resulted in a lower infectious&#xD;
      wound complication rate but in an similar recurrence rate. These results supports the&#xD;
      application of biological prosthesis in high risk patients. One recent systematic review&#xD;
      evaluated the positive effect on incisional hernia rate of the prophylactic mesh positioning&#xD;
      in high risk patients. No randomized trials have been published since now about the use of&#xD;
      biological prosthesis in contaminated or infected fields. The rationale of the trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the use of swine dermal collagen prosthesis implanted&#xD;
      preperitoneally as a prophylactic procedure against incisional hernia in patients operated in&#xD;
      urgency/emergency setting in contaminated/infected fields with peritonitis. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to reduce the incidence of incisional hernia from 50% to 20%.&#xD;

    <description>The subcutaneous tissue will be dissociated from the anterior rectum-muscles fascia to allow the positioning of the transfix stitches necessary to the mesh fixation. Successively the retro-muscular rectum muscles plane will be prepared by the separation of the rectum muscles from the posterior rectum-muscles fascia. The mesh will be fixed with at least 8 long-lasting absorbable transfix stitched placed at the cardinal and inter-cardinal points. The prosthesis will be placed with a 5 cm overlap. If the peritoneal plane can be sutured a Jackson-Pratt (JP) 10 suction drain will be placed under the prosthesis. A JP 10 suction drain will always be placed over the prosthesis. Anterior rectum fascia will be closed by emi-continuous monofilament suture with an intermediate- reabsorbable-time suture. Another JP 10 suction drain will be placed over the anterior fascia. No subcutaneous suture. Skin stapler or interrupted stitches will be used to close.</description>
