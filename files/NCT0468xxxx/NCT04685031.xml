      The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Clobetasol ointment with nitroglycerin&#xD;
      ointment on the prevention of superficial phlebitis caused by cannulation. This clinical&#xD;
      trial was conducted on 110 patients admitted to the surgical ward, in three groups of&#xD;
      Clobetasol, nitroglycerin, and control. The data collection tools included demographic&#xD;
      information, information about intravenous treatment and phlebitis measurement scale. In the&#xD;
      intervention groups, after venipuncture, 1.5 cm (about 2 g) of ointment was applied in the&#xD;
      distal part of the Angio catheter and the site was dressed with sterile gauze. In three time&#xD;
      periods of 24, 48 and 72 hours from the time of venipuncture.&#xD;

      Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of clobetasol ointment with&#xD;
      nitroglycerin ointment on the prevention of superficial phlebitis caused by cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Today, more than 80 to 90% of hospitalized patients receive intravenous treatment&#xD;
      during their treatment, and more than 500 million peripheral venous catheters are placed&#xD;
      annually, although cannulation provide numerous benefits in clinical setting, but because of&#xD;
      its invasive feature, it can end in unpleasant outcomes such as phlebitis Method: This&#xD;
      clinical trial was conducted on 110 patients admitted to the surgical ward, in three groups&#xD;
      of clobetasol, nitroglycerin, and control. The data collection tools included demographic&#xD;
      information, information about intravenous treatment and phlebitis measurement scale. In the&#xD;
      intervention groups, after venipuncture, 1.5 cm (about 2 g) of ointment was applied in the&#xD;
      distal part of the Angio catheter and the site was dressed with sterile gauze. In three time&#xD;
      periods of 24, 48 and 72 hours from the time of venipuncture.&#xD;
