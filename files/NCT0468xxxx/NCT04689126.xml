      this study will determine the effect of CBCT examinations on diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      decision making in endodontics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients selected for Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examinations in accordance with&#xD;
      European Commission guidelines ( patients with symptomatic vital teeth or with symptomatic&#xD;
      root filled teeth; patients with suspected dental fracture; patients with suspected external&#xD;
      or internal resorption and for aid in performing any therapeutic intervention ) will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Only patients aged above 18 years will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to the department of endodontics at Post Graduate Institute of Dental&#xD;
      Sciences (PGIDS) Rohtak or any patient from routine opd requiring specialist endodontic&#xD;
      consultation will be thoroughly examined .The examination will consist of a proper medical&#xD;
      history and clinical examination, such as inspection, palpation, probing and percussion of&#xD;
      the area of interest. When appropriate, additional tests such as sensitivity tests (cold and&#xD;
      electric pulp tests) and conventional radiography will be performed. After the initial&#xD;
      examination, patients judged to be in need of CBCT examination will be referred to the&#xD;
      radiology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1(before CBCT examination) Before referral, the examiner will write down the best&#xD;
      available diagnosis and therapeutic plan using clinical examination and conventional&#xD;
      radiography. The radiographs will be carefully viewed for periapical changes, vertical root&#xD;
      fractures, internal or external resorption, perforation or any other radiographic finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2(after CBCT examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the CBCT examination, the previous diagnosis and treatment plan will be considered and,&#xD;
      if needed, a new diagnosis and treatment plan will be made by the same examiner, taking into&#xD;
      consideration all of the data. The examiners will have access to all image reconstructions&#xD;
      performed by the radiologist. These reconstructions will include images in the axial, coronal&#xD;
      and sagittal planes throughout the entire volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3(patient dismissal) As per requirement therapy will be performed on the patients. The&#xD;
      findings of orthograde treatment, explorative surgery, endodontic microsurgery, or extraction&#xD;
      will serve as a gold standard for definitive clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological investigation All intraoral periapical radiographs will be done with at least&#xD;
      two angled (mesial and distal) views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT examination (Kodak CS 9300 Care Stream) done with exposure parameters 85 kilovolt and&#xD;
      5ma isotropic voxels with a size of 90*90*90 microns 5 *5 cm volume FOV Slice thickness will&#xD;
      vary from .9 to 1.3 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images will be viewed on a screen with a resolution of 1280*1024pixels (Dell E19135).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic decision making The diagnosis with periapical radiograph and CBCT will be made as&#xD;
      per following choices&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulp necrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Apical periodontitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. External resorption&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Root fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Non-endodontic diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Others&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic decision making&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plans decided by radiographs and CBCT will be divided into following choices&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wait and watch&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Orthograde endodontics&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Retrograde endodontics&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explorative surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Referral to other specialist&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Others&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inclusion criteria for referring patients to CBCT examination will be in&#xD;
             accordance with current European guidelines and can be grouped as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients in which disease had to be ruled out:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. patients with symptomatic vital teeth otherwise judged healthy (no exposed&#xD;
                       dentin; normal sensitivity pulp tests; no tenderness to palpation or&#xD;
                       percussion; with radiographic apical/marginal periodontal normalcy; and no&#xD;
                       cracks/fractures)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. patients with symptomatic root-filled teeth otherwise judged healthy (good&#xD;
                       quality of root filling that did not need to be revised or completed; no&#xD;
                       tenderness to palpation or percussion; with radiographic apical/marginal&#xD;
                       periodontal normalcy; and no cracks/fractures)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. when conventional radiology failed to demonstrate if a finding was a&#xD;
                       pathological process or a normal anatomical structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients in which suspected disease had to be confirmed:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. suspected dental fractures that could not be demonstrated&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. suspected external or internal resorptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. As an aid in performing the therapeutic intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. in established external or internal resorptions to assist in the approach of&#xD;
                       complex cases&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. before apical surgery when important anatomical structures interfered with&#xD;
                       the surgical approach&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. in diagnosing foreign body structures, their location and, when needed, as a&#xD;
                       guide in the surgical removal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. in understanding tooth anatomy of abnormal teeth in need of endodontic&#xD;
                       treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. in assessing the number and location of root canals after at least one&#xD;
                       unsuccessful attempt to find them under oral microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will not be referred for CBCT examination if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. presented themselves with an accessible previous volume tomography in the region&#xD;
                  of interest. This was, however, not a strict restriction if the examiner judged&#xD;
                  that new and relevant information could be obtained by a new CBCT examination&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. had a definite diagnosis and treatment plan after a complete clinical and&#xD;
                  conventional radiographic examination and therefore did not need a CBCT&#xD;
                  examination. This group represented the vast majority of all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. needed any other special imaging technique for soft tissue assessment such as CT&#xD;
                  or magnetic resonanace imaging.&#xD;
