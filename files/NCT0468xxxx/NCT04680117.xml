    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to extensively characterize the endotypes of&#xD;
      pre-schoolers (0 to 6 years) and school-age children (6 to 12 years) with SA using an&#xD;
      integrated approach, combining a description of their phenotype (asthma symptoms, atopy, and&#xD;
      lung function) associated with histological (airway inflammation and remodelling), immune&#xD;
      (innate and adaptive immunity), metabolomics, and microbiota analyses. This goal shall be&#xD;
      achieved by an unsupervised in-depth analysis of patients requiring bronchial endoscopy, with&#xD;
      bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsy, as part of their clinical assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease affecting approximately 235 million people worldwide, and the&#xD;
      number is rising. Asthma is not just a public health problem for developed countries; its&#xD;
      incidence is also elevated in developing countries. Asthma concerns all age groups, but often&#xD;
      starts in childhood. SA in children is infrequent, affecting 2-5% of the asthmatic paediatric&#xD;
      population. Children with SA experience frequent SA attacks and have a reduced quality of&#xD;
      life . They account for approximately half of the asthma healthcare costs. Asthma has long&#xD;
      been thought to be a single disease but is now considered to encompass various conditions&#xD;
      characterized by the same symptoms (wheeze, cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness),&#xD;
      variable degrees of airflow limitation, and different pattern of inflammation. Recent studies&#xD;
      highlighted the heterogeneity of asthma, and the potential influence of various pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms, including airway inflammation, remodelling, and immune and metabolic pathways in&#xD;
      a specific microbial environment. However, there is very little data concerning the&#xD;
      pathological process, especially in children. Most of the data describing different asthma&#xD;
      endotypes in children are derived from large observational prospective cohorts. Although very&#xD;
      informative, these studies were designed to analyse a small number of easily measured&#xD;
      parameters, mainly lung function and atopy. The complexity of asthma pathogenesis was&#xD;
      therefore underestimated and the individuals' specificities only partially considered. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, children with SA require an endoscopy, with broncho-alveolar lavage fluids&#xD;
      (BALF) collection and bronchial biopsies to exclude a differential diagnosis and assess&#xD;
      airway inflammation and remodelling. This approach also underestimates other components of&#xD;
      the endotypes and results in &quot;one size fits all&quot; management based on high doses of inhaled&#xD;
      steroids and the use of expensive biotherapy, such as anti-IgE therapy. Thus, although&#xD;
      hospital admission and mortality ratesfor asthma decreased until the early 2000's, they have&#xD;
      remained stable over the past 10 years. It is therefore imperative to develop new approaches&#xD;
      that incorporate relevant parameters analysed in the airways. This project proposes an&#xD;
      in-depth analysis, not only of clinical and functional parameters, but also of immune cells,&#xD;
      metabolomic compounds, and microbiota present in the airways of asthmatic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the project is to extensively characterize the endotypes of&#xD;
      pre-schoolers (0 to 6 years) and school-age children (6 to 12 years) with SA using an&#xD;
      integrated approach, combining a description of their phenotype (asthma symptoms, atopy, and&#xD;
      lung function) associated with histological (airway inflammation and remodelling), immune&#xD;
      (innate and adaptive immunity), metabolomics, and microbiota analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This goal shall be achieved by an unsupervised in-depth analysis of patients requiring&#xD;
      bronchial endoscopy, with bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsy, as part of&#xD;
      their clinical assessment. The main hypothesis is that the complementarity of those&#xD;
      approaches will allow investigators to delineate the immune and metabolic pathways and&#xD;
      microbiota involved in children with SA. The secondary objectives are to: (1) cluster all&#xD;
      data obtained to define new patient groups and develop biomarkers that summarise the&#xD;
      different clusters; (2) determine the immune, metabolomic, and microbiota profile of these&#xD;
      children to aid future fundamental research that will focus on dissecting new mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in paediatric asthma; (3) determine whether pre-schoolers and school-age children&#xD;
      with SA share common endotypic features; and (4) establish the basis for the prospective&#xD;
      follow-up of patients to identify endotypes that predict asthma persistence throughout&#xD;
      childhood, severity, and response to treatment.&#xD;
