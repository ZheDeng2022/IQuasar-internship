      This Quality Improvement (QI) project for physician education will build on an existing&#xD;
      platform, CHADIS (Comprehensive Health and Decision Information System; www.CHADIS.com). We&#xD;
      plan to further develop and test innovations that will assist primary care providers (PCPs)&#xD;
      in addressing the serious morbidity of teen substance use during routine check-up visits and&#xD;
      follow up care using a new Module of CHADIS that facilitates guideline-based care. The CHADIS&#xD;
      c-SBI (computer-facilitated Substance screening and provider Brief Intervention) Module will&#xD;
      include pre-visit screening tools that cover substance use and strengths and goals. It will&#xD;
      also include reminders to the patient about their goals and commitments for change and a&#xD;
      teleprompter for interview hints for the PCP. These hints will be aimed at enhancing a&#xD;
      patient focused discussion of individual strengths and barriers related to the teens' goals&#xD;
      in a motivational interviewing style.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary goals of this project are to develop and test an innovative teen substance use&#xD;
      (SU) module in CHADIS integrating the cSBI questionnaire and decision support into CHADIS&#xD;
      along with teen strength and goal data to be called CHADIS-cSBI. The CHADIS-cSBI will&#xD;
      facilitate evidence-based SU screening, severity assessment and initiation of primary care&#xD;
      management and care coordination for any referrals to reduce morbidity, mortality and costs&#xD;
      of SU. Inclusion of strength and goal data is anticipated to foster the doctor-teen&#xD;
      relationship and make SU advice more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Of those who reported any substance use at their annual well-visit, is there a lower&#xD;
           rate of reported use at 3- and 12- months follow-up among those exposed to CHADIS-cSBI&#xD;
           as compared to those who received treatment as usual?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Of those who reported no substance use at their annual well-visit, is there a lower rate&#xD;
           of reported use at 3- and 12- months follow-up among those exposed to CHADIS-cSBI as&#xD;
           compared to those who received treatment as usual? Secondary Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Among all patients, is there are lower rate of reported driving after using or riding with&#xD;
      a driver who has been using substances (risky driving/riding) at 3- and 12-months follow-up&#xD;
      among those exposed to CHADIS-cSBI as compared to those who received treatment as usual? We&#xD;
      will employ a cluster randomized two-group pre-test-post-test design, clustered at the&#xD;
      provider level. Given the nature of the enhanced care and the measurement it is not possible&#xD;
      to randomize at the patient level, and it is not necessary to randomize at the clinic level.&#xD;
      The use of a cluster-randomized design adds complexity, and generally requires larger samples&#xD;
      to achieve sufficient statistical power as compared to simple randomized control trials.&#xD;
      Sample size estimates consider the design effect resulting from a cluster randomized design&#xD;
      as well as other assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 PCPs reporting at least 2 teen well visits per week, either in person or by&#xD;
      telemedicine visit, will be recruited and randomly assigned in equal numbers to the enhanced&#xD;
      care and standard care arms of the study. We will randomize clinicians stratified by whether&#xD;
      they have completed Adolescent Medicine fellowships, as those with Adolescent Medicine&#xD;
      training have been shown to have higher rates of addressing substance use in their practice.&#xD;
      The authors' prior experience showed that, in a trial where the patients were randomized,&#xD;
      individual PCPs being trained to deliver the counseling did not give similar levels of&#xD;
      counseling to intervention and control patients. Their studies also show wide variation in&#xD;
      patient-reported receipt of counseling across participating providers; e.g., within the&#xD;
      intervention group, there was a range from 65%-93% across providers within one site. Such&#xD;
      heterogeneity within a site reduces concern about contamination of practice across providers.&#xD;
      All 12-18 year old patients in the practice will complete pre-visit screens dependent on the&#xD;
      randomization of their own attributed PCP. While there are, in fact, three levels (i.e.,&#xD;
      patient -&gt; practitioner -&gt; practice), we confine the fundamental design herein to two levels&#xD;
      (i.e., patient -&gt; practitioner). Intra-class correlations will be used to adjust sample size&#xD;
      estimates during power analyses, and also used to account for the covariance that is presumed&#xD;
      to exist wherein patients from the same cluster (i.e., PCP) are likely to be more similar to&#xD;
      each other than to patients from other clusters. The study design is depicted by the&#xD;
      following research design notation figure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0 T1 T2 T3 NR O X O O NR O O O&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each line represents the study timeline for an enhanced care group (i.e., first line&#xD;
      represents the CHADIS-cSBI group; second line represents the Standard CHADIS group using&#xD;
      CRAFFT), N: Indicates the groups are nonequivalent (i.e., subjects are not randomly assigned&#xD;
      to treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      R: Indicates the groups are derived from randomly assigned PCPs (i.e., the subjects are&#xD;
      treated by clinicians randomly assigned to a treatment protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      O: Indicates an observation timepoint (i.e., data collection). The first observation (T0)&#xD;
      represents baseline substance use for patients at their well-visit; the second and third&#xD;
      refer to follow-up assessments at 3 and 12 months post-visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X: Indicates the enhanced care (i.e., CHADIS-cSBI) that patients of enhanced care providers&#xD;
      will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, because this will be a Quality Improvement study, and practical utility of the&#xD;
      CHADIS-cSBI enhanced care applies at the practitioner level rather than the patient level, we&#xD;
      will conduct all analyses using Intent to Treat groups, retaining all patients initially&#xD;
      enrolled regardless of participation or compliance.&#xD;
