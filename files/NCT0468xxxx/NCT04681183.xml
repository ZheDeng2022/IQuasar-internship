  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot research study is being performed to learn more about pain and look at how pain&#xD;
      changes brain chemistry and function. The research team would like to learn new information&#xD;
      to better control chronic pain after surgery. This information collected in this research&#xD;
      will be used to plan possible future visits. Participants in this study are being asked to&#xD;
      participate because they are scheduled for an upcoming surgery. The research team would like&#xD;
      to observe them before and after their surgery.&#xD;

      This study is a pilot feasibility study in 30 healthy, preoperative children and young adults&#xD;
      undergoing major surgery with high risk for chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) to characterize&#xD;
      the brain metabolite status of the Anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) and insula in&#xD;
      pre-surgical adolescents and to understand the relationship between metabolite levels and&#xD;
      CPSP. The investigators will also examine whether neurochemical tone in these regions is&#xD;
      related to resting state functional connectivity with other brain regions. Correlations&#xD;
      between differentially methylated CpG sites in genes enriching gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)&#xD;
      and Dopamine-DARPP-32 pathways and Glu/GABA levels in insula/ACC will be analyzed.&#xD;
