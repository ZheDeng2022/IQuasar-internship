  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study RADAR aims at developing a wearable based dysglycemia detection and warning system&#xD;
      for patients with diabetes mellitus using artificial intelligence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has investigated the general potential of data analytics and artificial&#xD;
      intelligence to infer blood glucose levels from a variety of data sources. In this study&#xD;
      patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus will be wearing a continuous glucose meter&#xD;
      (CGM) and a smartwatch for a maximum duration of 3 months in an outpatient setting. The&#xD;
      gathered data will be used to develop a non-invasive and wearable based dysglycemia detection&#xD;
      and warning system using artificial intelligence.&#xD;
