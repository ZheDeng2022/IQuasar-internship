      There are no prospective, randomized studies addressing vaginal penetration restrictions&#xD;
      following mid-urethral slings. There is a single cohort study examining expedited recovery&#xD;
      following vaginal prolapse repair which advised 3-weeks of vaginal penetration restrictions.&#xD;
      This study reported an earlier return to intercourse in the 3-week group than in the&#xD;
      retrospectively collected control group where 6-weeks of restriction were advised. This study&#xD;
      did not evaluate the impact of early versus later return to sexual activity on wound&#xD;
      complications, mesh exposure rates, pain or satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to develop evidenced-based recommendations on post-operative sexual activity&#xD;
      restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to understand if the &quot;standard&quot; 6-week restriction on&#xD;
      vaginal penetration/intercourse after mid-urethral sling affects patient satisfaction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lifetime risk of surgery for stress urinary incontinence in women is 13.6%. Women are&#xD;
      typically instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity and vaginal penetration for 6 weeks&#xD;
      following synthetic mid-urethral sling procedures. The historical rationale behind these&#xD;
      instructions was to prevent disruption of vaginal incisions, promote wound healing, decrease&#xD;
      recurrence risk and prevent complications such as mesh exposure. Very little medical evidence&#xD;
      exists, however, to support these activity restrictions which can have a negative impact on&#xD;
      satisfaction and quality of life. Findings from a single randomized trial challenge standard&#xD;
      activity restrictions following pelvic organ prolapse repair. Participants were given&#xD;
      conservative or liberal postoperative instructions and the liberal group experienced fewer&#xD;
      prolapse and urinary symptoms at 3 months postoperatively; but there was no difference in&#xD;
      satisfaction between groups. This study, however, did not investigate restrictions on vaginal&#xD;
      penetration (both groups adhered to 6-week restrictions) and was not specific to women&#xD;
      undergoing isolated sling procedures. There are no prospective, randomized studies addressing&#xD;
      vaginal penetration restrictions following mid-urethral slings. There is a single cohort&#xD;
      study examining expedited recovery following vaginal prolapse repair which advised 3-weeks of&#xD;
      vaginal penetration restrictions. This study reported an earlier return to intercourse in the&#xD;
      3-week group than in the retrospectively collected control group where 6-weeks of restriction&#xD;
      were advised. This study did not evaluate the impact of early versus later return to sexual&#xD;
      activity on wound complications, mesh exposure rates, pain or satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal models suggest that wound healing occurs much sooner than 6 weeks post-surgery. In&#xD;
      fact, epithelial wounds closed by primary intention typically re-epithelialize in just 24-48&#xD;
      hours. In a mouse-model with full-thickness vaginal injury, there was complete restoration of&#xD;
      mucosal integrity by day 7 without surgical closure of the wound. Epithelial healing over&#xD;
      mid-urethral sling could differ due to a known pro-inflammatory milieu in the setting of a&#xD;
      mesh implant but the rate of epithelial closure over implanted synthetic mesh has not been&#xD;
      specifically described. While earlier vaginal penetration could theoretically increase the&#xD;
      risk of mesh exposure from the known baseline risk of 2-3%, this is unlikely following two&#xD;
      weeks in a low risk population regardless of menopausal status. Vaginal atrophy has been&#xD;
      identified as a risk factor for wound healing complications and vaginal mesh exposure and&#xD;
      could interact with early resumption of intercourse. However, vaginal atrophy can be reversed&#xD;
      with vaginal estrogen therapy and resultant risks mitigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the prevalence of mid-urethral slings for stress incontinence, it is important to&#xD;
      develop evidenced-based recommendations on post-operative sexual activity restrictions. The&#xD;
      purpose of this randomized trial, therefore, is to evaluate the impact of early (2 weeks)&#xD;
      versus standard (6 weeks) removal of vaginal penetration restrictions in sexually active&#xD;
      women undergoing mid-urethral sling procedures on sexual satisfaction and wound&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
