      formation in patients with AFRS To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving overall&#xD;
      symptom severity and quality of life in AFRS To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in&#xD;
      improving sense of smell in patients with AFRS To explore the effect of dupilumab as assessed&#xD;
      by three-Dimensional CT volumetric measurement of the paranasal sinuses To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of dupilumab when administered to patients with AFRS To evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of dupilumab in patients with AFRS To characterize the effect of&#xD;
