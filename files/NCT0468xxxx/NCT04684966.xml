  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD frequently have muscle disorders. Pathogenic mechanisms generate&#xD;
      significant pathophysiological changes in the locomotor muscles structure, leading to&#xD;
      decreased strength, decreased endurance and limited exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is the first choice therapy and training overall lower limb&#xD;
      endurance is a priority. Even if the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation are no longer to be&#xD;
      demonstrated, it is still necessary to optimize the modalities of muscular strengthening. In&#xD;
      fact, it is recommended to associate to this global endurance training a specific&#xD;
      strengthening of the muscles of the lower limbs. Neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) is a&#xD;
      muscular strengthening technique, but this method is not used in usual practice in pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation and often only the quadriceps are concerned. In a pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program, including sessions of NMES of the quadriceps femoris and triceps surae could&#xD;
      increase its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that NMES can improve muscle function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea and&#xD;
      quality of life in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study compared the effects of the combined quadriceps femoris and triceps surae&#xD;
      versus quadriceps alone. The final evaluation showed a greater improvement in exercise&#xD;
      capacity in favour of the combined NMES group. Only two studies with small numbers of&#xD;
      patients evaluated the effect of combined quadriceps femoris and triceps surae NMES in&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation, with encouraging results in terms of functional gain. Further&#xD;
      larger studies seem necessary to evaluate the effects of combined quadriceps femoris and&#xD;
      triceps surae NMES in pulmonary rehabilitation. The objective of the study is to show that&#xD;
      combined quadriceps femoris and triceps surae NMES during a pulmonary rehabilitation program&#xD;
      provides a more significant improvement in exercise capacity compared to a standard pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;

    <description>Randomized intervention in the NMES (GE) group:&#xD;
Patients in the NMES group will receive, in addition to conventional rehabilitation, combined quadriceps femoris and triceps surae NMES.&#xD;
Detail of the NMES :&#xD;
Stimulation is performed in a semi-seated position, biphasic current, 8 channels in total (possibility of 16 electrodes).&#xD;
One device per lower limb of each patient is necessary: 4 electrodes are placed on the quadriceps and 4 electrodes on the triceps, on each lower limb.&#xD;
Stimulation frequency: 50hz.&#xD;
Pulse duration: 400 Î¼s.&#xD;
Contraction time: 6 seconds.&#xD;
Rest time: 6 seconds.&#xD;
The intensity must generate a visible muscular contraction and must be well supported. by the patient.&#xD;
The voluntary contraction accompanies the electrical stimulation.&#xD;
