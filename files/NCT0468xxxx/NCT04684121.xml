    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of Granexin® gel to promote accelerated healing of second-degree&#xD;
      (deep partial thickness) thermal burns.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, within-subject Vehicle&#xD;
      controlled, safety and efficacy trial involving subjects with two comparable (similar body&#xD;
      location, similar burn area and burn severity), noncontiguous deep second-degree thermal&#xD;
      burns of less than 20% TBSA. A total of 30 subjects will have two target burns randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Granexin® gel (200 μM) plus ACTICOAT Flex 3TM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vehicle gel plus ACTICOAT Flex 3TM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures are divided into the following three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (within 36 hours of the time of injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment (daily for 10 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up (Day 10 through Month 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated total duration of a given subject's participation in this study is 12 months.&#xD;
      Screening can occur up to 36 hours prior to Day 0; Screening and Day 0 may occur on the same&#xD;
      day. Treatment period visits occur daily from Day 0 through Day 9, on-site and remotely.&#xD;
      During the treatment period, each subject will be treated with Granexin® gel (200 μM) plus&#xD;
      ACTICOAT Flex 3TM on one target burn and Vehicle gel plus ACTICOAT Flex 3TM on the second&#xD;
      target burn. After Day 9, the subject will return to clinic on Day 10 and be followed-up&#xD;
      (on-site or remotely) every other day thereafter until Day 28, with on-site visits on Days&#xD;
      14, 20, and 28. The subject will then return to the clinic for follow-up visits at Months 6,&#xD;
      9, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed during the study by monitoring adverse events and measuring vital&#xD;
      signs at each on-site visit, electrocardiograms (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
      selected time points before and after treatment with Granexin® gel and Vehicle gel.&#xD;
      Concomitant medications will be reviewed at every visit.&#xD;
