      Sacubitril-valsartan, an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI), currently&#xD;
      marketed for the management of heart failure, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in stage C heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In stage C&#xD;
      HFpEF, sacubitril-valsartan has also been shown to reduce left atrial volume index measured&#xD;
      using echocardiography over a 9 month timeframe. The PARABLE study investigates the&#xD;
      hypothesis that sacubitril-valsartan can provide benefits in terms of left atrial structure&#xD;
      and function as well as left ventricular structure and function in asymptomatic (stage A/B&#xD;
      HFpEF) patients. This is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase II&#xD;
      study design. The patient population will have hypertension and/or diabetes together with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction, elevated natriuretic peptide (NP) and abnormal left atrial&#xD;
      volume index (LAVI, &gt; 28 mL/m2).&#xD;

      Background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effective prevention strategy is critical if the established epidemic of heart failure and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease is to be curbed. This is particularly important in the context of&#xD;
      increasing community prevalence of stage B HFpEF and left ventricular diastolic abnormalities&#xD;
      associated with hypertension and diabetes and requires community diagnostics and targeted&#xD;
      preventative therapies. Individualising risk beyond the presence of established risk factors&#xD;
      can be achieved with NP assessment. Elevated NP in a population with established&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease defines a group more prone to cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and&#xD;
      other cardiovascular events. This can be used to risk stratify asymptomatic populations,&#xD;
      targeting those most likely to need intensive intervention and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prospective, randomised, pragmatic St Vincent's Screening TO Prevent Heart Failure&#xD;
      (STOP-HF) trial [Ledwidge 2013], NP-based screening and collaborative care with general&#xD;
      practice provided a multi-faceted intervention for patients with risk factors for heart&#xD;
      failure. This involved community NP screening, improved use of RAAS modifying therapy,&#xD;
      collaborative care with general practice as well as cardiovascular coaching for patients with&#xD;
      mild elevations of BNP (&gt;50 pg/mL).The intervention reduced stage B and C heart failure, most&#xD;
      of which was preserved ejection fraction, as well as major adverse cardiovascular events&#xD;
      requiring hospitalisation. This first of type study, along with a second study in diabetes&#xD;
      [Huelsmann 2013], indicates that a biomarker driven strategy based on NP screening amongst&#xD;
      stage AB heart failure patients is feasible and has an impact on heart failure and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. These studies have been incorporated into 2017 American Heart&#xD;
      Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines as well as other international&#xD;
      guideline recommendations in heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while successful, the STOP-HF biomarker strategy lacks a specific pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention linked to the screening biomarker, NP. An analysis of the STOP-HF follow-up&#xD;
      study, supports other work showing that the minor C allele of genetic variant rs198389 of the&#xD;
      NPPB gene (in the promoter region) is associated with sustained, elevated circulating levels&#xD;
      of BNP and reduced incidence of left ventricular dysfunction over a five-year follow up&#xD;
      period. These data support the hypothesis that use of LCZ696 to pharmacologically raise NP&#xD;
      could provide cardioprotection in stage A/B heart failure patients. As neprilysin degrades&#xD;
      biologically active NP, LCZ696 increases myocardial cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)&#xD;
      which reduces vascular and myocardial stiffness as well as hypertrophy. This could improve&#xD;
      cardiac structure and performance. NPs also stimulate natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation and&#xD;
      have been shown to have anti-fibrotic and anti-sympathetic benefits, which could augment the&#xD;
      STOP-HF preventative strategy with a specific pharmacological intervention. [Ledwidge 2103,&#xD;
      Phelan 2012, Potter 2006, Gardiner 2007]. Atrial tissue gene expression of BNP in patients&#xD;
      with stage B HFpEF is associated with atrial fibrosis, procollagen expression and presence of&#xD;
      M2 monocyte-derived-macrophage marker CD163 [Watson 2020]. Further analyses of the STOP-HF&#xD;
      follow-up study shows that BNP strongly associates with the presence of atrial&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, an independent predictor of new onset major adverse cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these data could support a role for sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan&#xD;
      alone in favourably modulating vascular compliance, cardiac structure, cardiac function as&#xD;
      well as progression of left atrial structural and functional abnormalities amongst patients&#xD;
      with stage B HFpEF. If left atrial structure and function is also associated with new onset&#xD;
      major adverse cardiovascular events, the intervention could also modulate cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. Finally, new CMRI imaging measures of cardiac function, such as CMR e' have been&#xD;
      developed and will allow full characterisation of the cardiovascular impact of the&#xD;
      intervention, including in subsets of patients with established atrial cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated NP in an at-risk population independently identifies cardiovascular risk, which can&#xD;
      be specifically targeted by LCZ696. In a small proportion of patients (&lt;5%) with&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and elevated NP, significant asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction&#xD;
      will be present and for these RAAS modifying therapy is mandated. However, there is a larger&#xD;
      group of patients with elevated NP who have stage B HFpEF, with or without diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. These patients may have preclinical, or asymptomatic, left ventricular diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction (ALVDD), atrial cardiomyopathy (AC) or both and are at heightened risk for heart&#xD;
      failure and other cardiovascular events [Watson 2020].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in NP in stage B HFpEF, ALVDD and AC is likely a fibro-inflammatory signal,&#xD;
      which in-turn contributes to tissue remodelling, vascular disease, myocardial stiffening and&#xD;
      left ventricular dysfunction. For example, hypertension, a common risk factor for ALVDD, is&#xD;
      associated with an adverse accumulation of fibrous tissue and studies have demonstrated a&#xD;
      strong relationship between ventricular stiffness, myocardial collagen content and plasma&#xD;
      levels of myocardial collagen turnover markers [Hogg 2004, Querejeta 2004]. Cardiac&#xD;
      inflammation, fibrosis and hypertrophy drive the pathophysiology [Gardiner 2007, Martos 2007]&#xD;
      associated with vascular disease, myocardial stiffening, and left atrial as well as left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction. [Phelan 2012, Jannuzzi 2019] Interrupting this pathophysiological&#xD;
      process at an early stage before the development of ventricular dysfunction may prevent or&#xD;
      slow development to heart failure and also have an impact on the development of other&#xD;
      cardiovascular events driven by this pathophysiological process. This may be particularly&#xD;
      important for prevention of the development of a sub-type of stage C HFpEF characterised by&#xD;
      older age, elevated LAVI, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease, which puts patients&#xD;
      at very high risk adverse outcome [Shah 2015]. Importantly, there is currently no specific&#xD;
      disease modifying therapy for these patients, beyond conventional risk factor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, suppressing the RAAS will reduce the pro-fibrotic impact of angiotensin II.&#xD;
      Addition of sacubitril, which reduces degradation of endogenous, cardio-protective NPs, could&#xD;
      reduce pulse pressure, myocardial stiffness and augment the beneficial anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-fibrotic effects of NPs beyond conventional RAAS modifying therapy. The latter may be&#xD;
      mediated through impacts on the innate immune system, fibro-inflammation and&#xD;
      monocyte-derived-macrophages in the myocardium [Watson 2020].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that the interplay between the myocardium and extracellular matrix&#xD;
      (ECM) can now be evaluated via analysis of serum samples of markers of collagen turnover.&#xD;
      [Martos 2007, Querejeta 2007] Altered serum levels of collagen markers (e.g. Collagen 1A1)&#xD;
      and matrix metalloproteinase (e.g. MMP-2 and MMP-9) suggest increased collagen turnover&#xD;
      associated with fibrosis in diastolic heart failure. [Martos, 2007, Ahmed 2006, Nikishimi&#xD;
      2006] Other biomarkers of cardiac structure and function of relevance in ALVDD/AC include&#xD;
      Galectin 3 and ST-2, biomarkers of cardiac remodelling and tissue fibrosis. Finally, cGMP,&#xD;
      which blunts activation pathways and diminishes hypertrophy, fibrosis, cellular toxicity, and&#xD;
      maladaptive remodelling in the myocardium, may also be modulated by sacubitril-valsartan, not&#xD;
      only through inhibition of breakdown of BNP, but also ANP and other vasoactive peptides&#xD;
      [Ibrahim 2019].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In high risk patients with preserved ejection fraction, elevated LAVI reflects increased left&#xD;
      ventricular filling pressures, fibro-inflammation and is a strong, continuous marker of&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction as well as future cardiovascular events. Interventions that could&#xD;
      improve myocardial performance and reduce progression of LAVI and other structural&#xD;
      abnormalities might also help prevent cardiac morbidity and progression to stage B/C HFpEF.&#xD;
      Sacubitril-valsartan has been shown to modulate NP activity and reduce LAVI in comparison&#xD;
      with valsartan in the PARAMOUNT study [Solomon 2012]. The reduction of 2.6 mL/m2 with LCZ696&#xD;
      compared with an increase of 0.3 mL/m2 with valsartan (p=0.007 for difference) from a&#xD;
      baseline of 36 mL/m2 over 36 weeks appears to be clinically significant in these patients&#xD;
      with preserved ejection fraction. However, further work is required to understand the&#xD;
      implications of this result in stage A/B HFpEF, especially using more precisely defined&#xD;
      myocardial structure and function with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI).&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the PARAGON-HF study (Solomon 2019), there was no significant benefit of&#xD;
      sacubitril-valsartan in patients with HFpEF with respect to the primary composite outcome of&#xD;
      hospitalisation and death. The differential effect of sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan&#xD;
      in relation to left ventricular ejection fraction as well as stage B versus C HFpEF requires&#xD;
      further evaluation. No study has evaluated sacubitril-valsartan in patients with stage A/B&#xD;
      HFpEF, elevated natriuretic peptides and abnormal LAVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the PARABLE trial is to assess the impact of sacubitril-valsartan versus&#xD;
      valsartan alone on structural, functional and biochemical abnormalities of the myocardium in&#xD;
      an asymptomatic cohort with preserved ejection fraction, cardiovascular risk factors,&#xD;
      abnormal LAVI and elevated NP (brain type natriuretic peptide [BNP] and/or N-terminal of the&#xD;
      prohormone BNP [NT-proBNP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARABLE tests the hypothesis that sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan alone would result in&#xD;
      beneficial effects on atrial and ventricular structure and function, thereby preventing&#xD;
      progression of cardiac abnormalities in stage B HFpEF.&#xD;
