      The purpose of this preliminary study is to apply AI technology on a sample of infants aged 4&#xD;
      to 18 months to develop an action tracking and recognition algorithm for infant motor&#xD;
      screening and to determine the accuracy of the captured movements during the Alberta Infant&#xD;
      Motor Scale (AIMS) assessment using an experienced physical therapists' assessment results as&#xD;
      the reference.&#xD;

      Background and Purpose. Although there is an increase in the public awareness of early&#xD;
      intervention for children with developmental disorder in Taiwan, the number of children&#xD;
      reported for early intervention by the Ministry of Health and Welfare is limited,&#xD;
      particularly for those aged under two years, outside of hospital settings, and in remote&#xD;
      areas. This has highlighted the need of early screening for infants who are at risk or have&#xD;
      developmental disorders. While motor development has a potential impact on the emergence of&#xD;
      abilities in other domains in children at later age, motor screening may serve as the&#xD;
      cornerstone to help detect signs of developmental dysfunction. Artificial Intelligence (AI),&#xD;
      based on machine learning of big data, may be an alternative for assisting healthcare&#xD;
      professionals to efficiently screen children's development and to help plan for further&#xD;
      diagnostic assessment. The purpose of this preliminary study is to apply AI technology on a&#xD;
      sample of infants aged 4 to 18 months to develop an action tracking and recognition algorithm&#xD;
      for infant motor screening and to determine the accuracy of the captured movements during the&#xD;
      Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) assessment using an experienced physical therapists'&#xD;
      assessment results as the reference. Method. This study will recruit 50 infants (40 preterm&#xD;
      infants and 10 term infants age 4-18 months (corrected age for preterm infants) from the&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Children's Hospital. Each infant will be evaluated by a physical&#xD;
      therapist for their gross motor development during prone, spine, sitting and standing&#xD;
      positions using the AIMS assessment. The whole assessment procedure will be video recorded by&#xD;
      five cameras. The data processing of movement video records will consist of selection of&#xD;
      movement records, establishment of a pose estimation model, and establishment of an action&#xD;
      recognition model. The accuracy of the pose and action recognition model in identifying&#xD;
      infants' movements will be examined using the physical therapist's results as the gold&#xD;
      standard. The results of this study will provide preliminary data to help establish the best&#xD;
      and appropriate action recognition model of infant motor screening for future validation on a&#xD;
      large sample.&#xD;
