      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of OP-724 in liver cirrhosis patients caused by&#xD;
      HIV/HCV co-infection with hemophilia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an uncontrolled, open-label, single-center phase I study in liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      patients caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection&#xD;
      with hemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver cirrhosis patients due to co-infection of HIV and HCV with hemophilia who have a&#xD;
      Child-Pugh classification of A or B are included. OP-724 is intravenously administered twice&#xD;
      a week (4 hours) for 12 weeks as an administration schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 14 days before the administration of the first cycle, the dose planned for the first cycle&#xD;
      will be administered once by continuous intravenous administration for 4 hours, and the&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated from the day of administration to the day after&#xD;
      the administration. If an integrase inhibitor is used in combination as a key drug for&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs, its pharmacokinetics will be evaluated at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose escalation study with 2 doses (cohort 1: 140 mg/m2/4hr (starting dose), cohort 2: 280&#xD;
      mg/m2/4hr) will be conducted, and 3 patients in each cohort will be enrolled. Comprehensively&#xD;
      investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic data after OP-724 administration, and evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of OP-724 administration.&#xD;

    <description>Amount of change from baseline in Child-Pugh Score at 12 weeks after administration. Child Pugh score (scale range 5-15 points, the severity increases sequentially from 5 to 15 points) is obtained by adding the score for each parameter (hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubin, albumin, PT). Based on the total points score (Child-Pugh Score) of each diagnostic parameter shown above, the severity of the disease is classified into Grades A to C shown below.&#xD;
Grade A: 5-6 points -&gt; Compensated cirrhosis&#xD;
Grade B: 7-9 points -&gt; Decompensated cirrhosis&#xD;
Grade C: 10-15 points -&gt; Decompensated cirrhosis</description>

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a scoring system for assessing the severity of chronic liver disease and uses the subject's values for total bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio (INR) for prothrombin time to predict survival. MELD is calculated according to the following formula:&#xD;
* MELD score = 3.78×ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43</description>

Administration method: In the single administration, the safety of concomitant use with the investigational drug and antiretroviral drug will be confirmed and then the cycle administration will be started. For the single administration, at 14 days before the first cycle of administration, the dose planned for the first cycle with continuous intravenous administration for 4 hours will be administrated once. When an integrase inhibitor is used in combination as a key drug for antiretroviral drugs, it should be administered at the same time as the start of investigational drug administration only after the single administration. For the cycle administration, the continuous intravenous administration for 4 hours twice a week is defined as one cycle, and 12 cycles (12 weeks in total) will be performed.</description>
