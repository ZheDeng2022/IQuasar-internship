  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive knee joint loads during walking can contribute to knee osteoarthritis progression.&#xD;
      Changing the rotation of the foot (in-toeing or out-toeing) while walking can lower knee&#xD;
      joint loads and improve pain and function. Telerehabilitation (using video or telephone&#xD;
      communication to delivery rehabilitation) has shown promise in delivering exercise therapy&#xD;
      for knee osteoarthritis, but it is unknown if walking modifications can be delivered using&#xD;
      this method. This study consists of a six-week walking modification program in people with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis. Performance of the modification will be measured using motion capture&#xD;
      and wearable sensors during practice and daily life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loads on the knee joint during walking are related to worsening of knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Changing walking motions to lower these knee joint loads is an emerging management strategy&#xD;
      for knee osteoarthritis. Multiple studies have targeted a change in the position of the foot&#xD;
      relative to the direction of walking (toe-in or toe-out walking) and have shown this walking&#xD;
      modification to lower knee joint loads and improve symptoms (e.g. pain) related to knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis within the context of a walking program. Building off the many studies that&#xD;
      have found telerehabilitation to be an effective method of providing exercise and pain-coping&#xD;
      physical therapy, the investigators will use this method to provide walking modification&#xD;
      treatment. Telerehabilitation (using video or teleconferencing to conduct the physical&#xD;
      therapy appointment) provides a convenient and cost-effective method to work with patients&#xD;
      and coordinate their treatment plan. To monitor progress with learning the walking&#xD;
      modification, the investigators will use a custom sensor shoe that the participants will wear&#xD;
      during daily walking activities over the six-week intervention. Overall, this study will&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a walking modification program delivered&#xD;
      using video- or teleconference.&#xD;

    <description>Change in foot rotation from baseline to each real-world walking bout (represented as a single data file on the sensor module), follow-up, and retention measured via the sensor shoe. Foot rotation is defined as the angle between the long axis of the foot and the walking direction.

    <measure>Compliance with gait modification</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Change in compliance will be estimated by self-reported confidence in performing the gait modification (where 0 = &quot;no confidence&quot; and 10 = &quot;complete confidence&quot;) and will be assessed on a weekly basis within the diary. Acceptable confidence ratings by week 6 are greater than or equal to 7/10. Change will be compared from week 1 to week 6 and week 10.</description>
