  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either ABVD or A2VD chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim PET-CT scan will be performed after 2 cycles of treatment, which will be used to&#xD;
      adapt subsequent treatment. Patients will receive a total of 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      may also receive involved site radiotherapy as consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 5 years after treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either ABVD chemotherapy (doxorubicin,&#xD;
      bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) or A2VD chemotherapy (doxorubicin, brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin, vinblastine and dacarbazine, with growth factor support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients agree, they will have a PET-CT scan after 1 cycle (PET1). The result of this scan&#xD;
      will be blinded and used for exploratory endpoints only. Treatment will not be influenced by&#xD;
      the result of this scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a PET-CT scan after 2 cycles of treatment (PET2) which will be&#xD;
      centrally reviewed. The Deauville score from central review will be used to risk adapt&#xD;
      subsequent therapy as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Deauville score 1-3 will have one further cycle of their randomised&#xD;
           chemotherapy and then enter follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Deauville score 4 will have two further cycles of their randomised&#xD;
           chemotherapy followed by involved site radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Deauville score 5 will be withdrawn from trial treatment. They will have&#xD;
           further treatment at their treating clinician's discretion and will enter follow up for&#xD;
           the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Deauville score 4 on PET2 will have a final PET-CT scan to confirm adequate&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 5 years after completing treatment.&#xD;
