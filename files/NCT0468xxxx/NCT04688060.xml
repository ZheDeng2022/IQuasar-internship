  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most common causes of acquired adult disability. The stroke survivors&#xD;
      have lots of mobility difficulties such as poor standing, decreased walking speed, balance&#xD;
      disturbances, and increased risk of falls (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falling is a major threat to stroke patients for physical injury. Fracture resulting from&#xD;
      falling, could affect the rehabilitation potential and functional recovery (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a stroke, falls are one of the most common medical complications with a 73% incidence&#xD;
      within the six months (4). In addition to physical components, psychological factors related&#xD;
      falling include fear of falling(5). Fear of falling is defined as persisting concern&#xD;
      regarding falling and associated with many negative physical and psychological factors (6,7).&#xD;
      It not only affects a simple health concern, but also avoidance of activities and a loss of&#xD;
      confidence (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the associating factors of fear of falling (FOF) and the correlations between&#xD;
      FOF, functional ambulation category (FAC) and quality of life (QOL) on stroke patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study was a cross-sectional observational study. Each participant was assessed with&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires and examined. Eighty six hemiplegic cronic stroke patients were&#xD;
      recruited from our clinic from March 2018 to December 2020 with informed consent. We divided&#xD;
      the participants into two groups; with fallers and non-fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were stroke duration of 6 months or more follow 3-step commands, were&#xD;
      able to walk 10m with no physical assistance with or without any assistive device, and&#xD;
      scoring ≥3 on Functional Ambulation Category, and physically able to complete the testing&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were other neurologic diagnosesor were medically unstable, lower-extremity&#xD;
      fracture, or other surgical procedures during the last 6 months and were unable to provide&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants signed a written consent prior to participation in the study. The study was&#xD;
      approved by the local institutional review board. The study was conducted in accordance with&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles for human experimentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics and medical history recorded by questionnaire included age,&#xD;
      height, weight, comorbidities, number of medications, use of assistive device, date of stroke&#xD;
      onset, and side of stroke, hemorrhagic or ischemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls history included number of falls during last 6 months or number of falls since the&#xD;
      stroke onset, if stroke was less than 6 months prior. Fear of falling was assessed by asking&#xD;
      subjects if they were afraid of falling (yes, no) and also ranking Falls Efficacy&#xD;
      Scale-International (FES-I)(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also functional ambulation levels, motor functions, spasticity and quality of life were&#xD;
      assessed using Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Brunnstrom staging, Modified Ashworth&#xD;
      scale (MAS), Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS) (2-5).&#xD;

    <description>The FES-1 was used to assess the fear of falling level of participants about falling during indoor or outdoor activities. It has 16 items scored on a four-point Likert scale. The Turkish validated version of the FES-I was used in this study. The total score (sum of the 16 responses) ranging from 16 to 64 points was used for data analysis. A higher score indicates better mobility performance. A cut-off score of 27 points on the 16- item FES-I was used to differentiate high concern for falling from low concern</description>
