  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research we investigate endothelial function in cancer patients who received platinum&#xD;
      based chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate endothelial function in patients with platinum-based&#xD;
      versus non-platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function was evaluated via Angioscan( the apparatus that evaluate the stiffness&#xD;
      of vessels by pulse wave velocity) and serum levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase&#xD;
      (ENOS),endothelin1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with gastrointestinal, ovarian, bladder and brest cancer would be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with malignancies were followed-up from 2 weeks to 3 month after start of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, Medical records and hospital databases were searched for all the patients&#xD;
      treated with different chemotherapy treatment for any kind of cancer.&#xD;
