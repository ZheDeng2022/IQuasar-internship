      The study will evaluate ultrasound guided SEQ block: single puncture combined lumbar erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block and paraspinous sagittal shift (PSSS) quadratus lumborum block when&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: Acetabular fractures represent relatively infrequent traumatic injuries that&#xD;
      can lead to a progressive impairment of hip articular function. Surgical treatment of these&#xD;
      fractures may require extensive surgical dissections and frequently is associated with&#xD;
      significant postoperative pain, delay in rehabilitation, and prolonged hospital stay.&#xD;
      Innervation of the acetabular region is mainly provided by branches of lumbar and sacral&#xD;
      plexuses, in addition to dorsal rami of lumbar nerve roots supplying the tissues to be&#xD;
      dissected during posterior approach for acetabular fractures. Investigators suggest a novel&#xD;
      approach for combined lumbar erector spinae plane block and PSSS quadratus lumborum block for&#xD;
      perioperative analgesia in hip/acetabular surgeries using a single puncture technique (SEQ&#xD;
      block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: The primary aim of this study is to compare the total postoperative opioid&#xD;
      (morphine) consumption after posterior column acetabular surgery when providing ultrasound&#xD;
      guided SEQ block: single puncture combined lumbar erector spinae plane block and paraspinous&#xD;
      sagittal shift (PSSS) quadratus lumborum block versus conventional intravenous morphine&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of this study are; sensory assessment in the block group for (dermatomal&#xD;
      distribution), intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamics; Mean arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) and heart rate (HR), resting visual analogue scale (VAS), dynamic VAS and postoperative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: After obtaining approval from Alexandria university ethics committee, this study&#xD;
      will be carried out starting from November 2020 for 1 year in Alexandria university hospital&#xD;
      on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III patients scheduled for&#xD;
      unilateral posterior wall/column acetabular fractures surgery using posterior approach. The&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will include; Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 kg/m2, pre-existing neurological&#xD;
      deficit, spine deformity, pregnancy/lactation, significant renal or hepatic impairment, known&#xD;
      contraindications to peripheral nerve block (coagulopathy or infection at the site of&#xD;
      injection), or chronic opioid users/abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 2 groups. Group SEQ; patients will receive ultrasound guided&#xD;
      SEQ block preoperatively before the induction of general anaesthesia (GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group MOR; patients will receive GA and analgesia will be based on opioids mainly intravenous&#xD;
      morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the operating room (OR), a multichannel monitor will be attached to patients,&#xD;
      followed by the administration of 2 mg midazolam IV after securing an IV cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group SEQ: SEQ block is a combination of paraspinous sagittal shift (PSSS) quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      (QL) block and erector spinae plane block (ESPB). Before the induction of GA in group SEQ,&#xD;
      patients will lay laterally on the healthy side with the fracture side independent, a&#xD;
      curvilinear ultrasound transducer (2-5 MHz) (Sonosite, M-turbo, Bothell, WA, USA) will be&#xD;
      placed in a parasagittal plane 3-4 cm lateral to the lumbar spinous process of L4 (which is&#xD;
      almost opposite to the iliac crest), producing a longitudinal scan of the lumbar&#xD;
      paravertebral region, thus identifying the transverse processes of L3 and L4 with psoas&#xD;
      muscle (PM) in-between and erector spinae muscle (ESM) posteriorly (superficial to transverse&#xD;
      processes), the probe is shifted slowly to the lateral side till the transverse processes&#xD;
      disappear and quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle is evident in its long axis attached caudally to&#xD;
      the iliac crest with a characteristic sonographic image of three muscle layers appearing from&#xD;
      posterior to anterior as : ESM, QL, and PM muscles respectively. Here, anterior layer of&#xD;
      thoracolumbar fascia (ATLF) - which is considered as a continuation of fascia transversalis -&#xD;
      is seen separating PM and QL muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subcutaneous local infiltration with lidocaine 1% at the cephalic end of the probe, the&#xD;
      block needle is advanced in a cephalo-caudal direction, through the erector spinae and QL&#xD;
      muscles, until it pierces the epimysium of the QL muscle. Local anaesthetic (LA) is injected&#xD;
      anterior to the QL, observing it's spread in a caudal direction towards the iliac crest&#xD;
      between the QL and psoas muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the caudal end of the probe is rotated slowly medially towards lumbar spine till the&#xD;
      hypoechoic shadow of transverse process of L4 appears in the ultrasound image. The needle is&#xD;
      withdrawn to subcutaneous tissue, then advanced in plane towards transverse process of L4.&#xD;
      After contacting it, LA is deposited in the plane between transverse process and overlying&#xD;
      ESM. Total volume of LA used will be 50 ml of 0.25 % bupivacaine, 25 ml for each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty minutes after block performance, sensory assessment will be performed using a pin&#xD;
      prick test for dermatomal distribution, followed by the induction of GA. While, in group MOR;&#xD;
      no block will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be induced with propofol 2 mg/kg, atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, and fentanyl 1µg/kg,&#xD;
      followed by endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia will be maintained by isoflurane 1 Minimum&#xD;
      Alveolar Concentration (MAC) in 100% oxygen. Multimodal analgesia protocol will be provided&#xD;
      including intravenous dexamethasone 8 mg, paracetamol 1 gm, and ketorolac 60 mg. Increments&#xD;
      of 0.5 µg/kg of fentanyl will be given intraoperatively if there is an increase in HR/MAP&#xD;
      above 20% of the basal value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, multimodal analgesia regimen will be continued in the form of paracetamol 1&#xD;
      g /8 hours and ketorolac 30 mg /8 hours intravenously for 48 hours. Intravenous morphine in a&#xD;
      dose of 0.05 mg/kg will be given as a rescue analgesic when the VAS ≥4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HR and MAP will be recorded preoperatively (baseline), every 30 minutes during the&#xD;
           surgery, and every hour postoperatively for the first 4 hours, then every 4 hours for&#xD;
           the remaining 24 hour postoperative follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Resting VAS every hour for the first 4 hours, then every 4 hours for the remaining 24&#xD;
           hour postoperative follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dynamic VAS every hour for the first 4 hours, then every 4 hours for the remaining 24&#xD;
           hour postoperative follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Total analgesic requirement (intraoperative fentanyl and postoperative morphine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Postoperative complications (block or opioid related complications).&#xD;
