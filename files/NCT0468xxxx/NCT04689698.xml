  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to verify the effect of therapy called &quot;tissue flossing&quot; on the range of&#xD;
      motion and examine the impact of this treatment on the Superficial fascial backline,&#xD;
      described by Myers. The research aims to verify whether the thick rubber bands used to create&#xD;
      a certain degree of compression in a predetermined part of the musculoskeletal system can&#xD;
      help to increase the range of motion (ROM) and whether this increase in motion can be&#xD;
      achieved by influencing fascial chains even in distant parts of the musculoskeletal system,&#xD;
      outside the primary therapeutic zone treated by the tissue flossing method. The research aims&#xD;
      to verify and especially compare the patient's joints' range of motion before and immediately&#xD;
      after the tissue flossing treatment. The results of the experiment clarify the influence of&#xD;
      the tissue flossing therapy method on the range of motion at the application site, on the&#xD;
      range of motion in other joints within the Superficial fascial backline described by Myers&#xD;
      and last but not least to prove the existence of these fascial chains in the human body.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight-bearing lunge test (WBLT) was used to evaluate the change in the ankle joint's&#xD;
      range of motion. A simple forward bend test - the Thomayer test - was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      therapy's effect on the Superficial fascial backline described by Myers. Both tests are&#xD;
      non-invasive. Both tests can be used to evaluate the outcome of a given therapy objectively.&#xD;
      Both tests are elementary to perform and highly standardized and commonly used in similar&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the entrance tests, the tissue flossing method is applied to each proband.&#xD;
      The treatment alone does not typically last more than 20 minutes for any proband. As part of&#xD;
      the tissue flossing treatment, both lower limbs of the proband will be treated. The &quot;tissue&#xD;
      flossing&quot; method will be applied according to the authors' standard recommendations first to&#xD;
      the plantar fascia area, then to the ankle joint. Finally, the last treated structure will be&#xD;
      the area of fascia cruris. The duration of each application does not exceed 2 minutes. The&#xD;
      order of individual applications is determined in advance as follows: right and then left&#xD;
      plantar fascia, right and then left ankle joint and right and then left fascia cruris. Each&#xD;
      application will be supplemented by the standard manual treatment or supplemented by the&#xD;
      proband's active movement. After a total of 6 treatments, the therapeutic unit will be&#xD;
      finished, and each proband will be re-examined using the same tests as before the treatment.&#xD;
      If a given proband experiences any undesirable complications during the application of the&#xD;
      &quot;tissue flossing&quot; method or applying the given method to the proband is subjectively&#xD;
      unpleasant, the given treatment will be finished immediately.&#xD;
