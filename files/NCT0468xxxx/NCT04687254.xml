  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent cancer of the urinary tract is the bladder cancer (BC), in Italy its&#xD;
      incidence reaches the 7% of all the new diagnosis of cancer, accounting for the fifth cause&#xD;
      of death in the western countries, overall 140.000 new cases per year in Europe. In the year&#xD;
      2017, the Italian association for medical oncology (AIOM) recorded in our country about&#xD;
      21.700 new diagnosis of BC men and 5.300 in women. This data show not only a relevant gender&#xD;
      disparity on the disease incidence (in 5th to 7th decade male incidence: 11-12% of all new&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer versus 1% in women) but also on the outcomes of treatment. Overall, the&#xD;
      30% of all the new diagnosis have a muscle-invasive (MIBC) onset, the female gender suffer a&#xD;
      correlation with a more advanced disease at the time of first diagnosis. As a consequence,&#xD;
      men have lower BC-related mortality when compared to women (p&lt;0,001). This discrepancy in the&#xD;
      mortality rate has been investigated by many authors, resulting in the evidence that female&#xD;
      gender suffers higher risks, especially during the first two-years after the radical&#xD;
      cystectomy. A comprehensive explanation has not been formulated yet, but a multiplicity of&#xD;
      cofactors, including variations in the hormone receptors and tumor biology as well as the&#xD;
      different anatomy between male and female, have been identified as potentially relevant.&#xD;
      Another important issue in the pre-operatory management of female patients with BC is the&#xD;
      misleading interpretation of hematuria. It seems to directly correlate with the evidence that&#xD;
      women suffer a more advanced stage at diagnosis, and this element has been withheld in the&#xD;
      list of relevant risk factors for prognosis. Nevertheless, a thorough analysis of their&#xD;
      effect will only be possible in the future, as well-designed prospective and randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials are currently not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A part from the preoperatory disparity, it has also been described that men are more&#xD;
      frequently candidates to an orthotopic urinary diversion, leading female patients to an&#xD;
      irreversibly altered perception of personal integrity and body image, namely to a lower&#xD;
      quality of life after radical cystectomy. The female anatomy has been considered as a&#xD;
      limitation to continence recovery, resulting in preoperative counselling more frequently&#xD;
      against in favor of ileal conduit or not-continent urinary diversions.&#xD;
