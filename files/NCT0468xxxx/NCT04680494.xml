  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing amount of studies show the beneficial effect of regular exercise on cognitive&#xD;
      and brain functions and especially in the memory domain. Yet little is known of what happens&#xD;
      within an acute bout of exercise and whether it would also yield cognitive effects. The&#xD;
      literature clearly shows that molecules such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and&#xD;
      endocannabinoids (mainly anandamide, AEA) are heavily involved in neural plasticity&#xD;
      mechanisms and increase when we exercise hinting at possible mechanisms underlying memory&#xD;
      improvement after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol assesses the effects of acute exercise on associative and motor sequence&#xD;
      memory, their underlying neural activations (measured using fMRI) and blood biomarkers (BDNF&#xD;
      and AEA). A related aim is to assess the effect of exercise intensity, therefore three&#xD;
      exercising conditions (rest, moderate intensity and high intensity) were included. Finally, a&#xD;
      3-month delayed retest visit is also realized to assess effects of acute exercise on&#xD;
      long-term memory consolidation.&#xD;
