    <textblock>
      Suprascapular nerve is the first nerve that branches from the upper trunk of brachial plexus.&#xD;
      It receives signals transmitted from the fifth and sixth cervical root. The clinical&#xD;
      importance of suprascapular nerve is mainly based on its distribution of 70% sensory&#xD;
      innervation to the glenohumeral joint. After divided from the upper trunk, the suprascapular&#xD;
      nerve goes laterally and posteriorly. First, it passes underneath omohyoid muscle, and then&#xD;
      goes through the suprascapular notch and into the suprascapular fossa. At suprascapular&#xD;
      fossa, the suprascapular nerve is just below supraspinatus muscle. If there are some problems&#xD;
      inside the supraspinatus muscle, the suprascapular nerve below it could be compromised. After&#xD;
      suprascapular nerve passes suprascapular fossa, it will cross spinoglenoid notch, then go&#xD;
      into infraspinatus fossa and innervates infraspinatus muscle. Based on the important&#xD;
      distribution of suprascapular nerve to the sensory and motor function of shoulder joint, it&#xD;
      has great benefits to understand its normal and abnormal sonographic images in order to&#xD;
      diagnose refractory shoulder pain cases. Although there are some studies trying to measure&#xD;
      the size of suprascapular nerve, most of them are limited in its location at the&#xD;
      supraspinatus fossa. Also, they do not take factors into consideration, such as the subject's&#xD;
      sex, body index, orientation and if shoulder pain or not at that point. In conclusion, our&#xD;
      study is aimed to explore the difference of the suprascapular nerves between the participants&#xD;
      with and without shoulder pain and to investigate potential factors that may influence the&#xD;
      nerve's size using high-resolution ultrasound.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder pain arises to be one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints. The mechanism&#xD;
      of an increased risk of painful shoulders is multifactorial and the role of the suprascapular&#xD;
      nerve in development and management of shoulder pain has been highlighted recently. In recent&#xD;
      years, high resolution ultrasound has been widely applied on evaluation of entrapment&#xD;
      neuropathy, and its reliability on assessing the cross-sectional area of suprascapular nerves&#xD;
      has been validated. As the suprascapular nerve is crucial for conducting shoulder motion and&#xD;
      sensation, it is of clinical importance to measure the size of suprascapular nerve. Our study&#xD;
      is aimed to explore the difference of the suprascapular nerves between the participants with&#xD;
      and without shoulder pain and to investigate potential factors that may influence the nerve's&#xD;
      size using high-resolution ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a cross-sectional study investigating suprascapular nerves in the asymptomatic and&#xD;
      painful shoulders of participants. All the participants were required to ambulate&#xD;
      independently, have normal cognitive function and complete the given questionnaires. Both&#xD;
      groups included at least 60 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detail of the investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High-resolution ultrasound evaluation of the shoulder region to recognize the biceps&#xD;
           tendon, subscapularis tendon, supraspinatus tendon, and infraspinatus tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High-resolution ultrasound evaluation for the C5, C6 and C7 nerve roots and the&#xD;
           suprascapular nerve over the supraclavicular fossa, in the supraspinatus fossa and in&#xD;
           the infraspinatus fossa to obtain the nerve cross-sectional image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collecting the shoulder pain-related information, including physical examination results&#xD;
           (bicipital groove tenderness, Speed test, Yergason's test, Empty can test, Neer test,&#xD;
           Hawkins-Kennedy test and painful arc test) and status of disability using Shoulder Pain&#xD;
           and Disability Index (SPADI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The measurements of the nerve cross-sectional area were conducted by another specialist&#xD;
           with the image processing software (Image J). For the most proximal section of the&#xD;
           suprascapular nerve, the cross-section of the nerve fascicles inside the hyperechoic&#xD;
           epineurium were measured. In the segment over the supraspinatus and infraspinatus&#xD;
           fossae, the whole nerve's cross-section including its epineurium were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The identification for the images of the rotator cuff lesions or biceps tendon lesions&#xD;
           were conducted by another specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Comparison of age, body height, body weight, and CSA across various age and sex groups&#xD;
           were conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continuous variables: Mann Whitney u test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Categorical variables: Chi-square test&#xD;

    <description>The Chinese version of the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) tool. The SPADI tool consisted of 13 questions categorized in two domains: pain and disability. They were instructed to indicate the level of influence on a 10 cm visual analogue scale for each question with a rating from 0 (no pain or no difficulty) to 10 (worst pain or extreme difficulty). The scores from the pain and functional domains were averaged to generate the total score of SPADI, with a highest value of 100 points.</description>
