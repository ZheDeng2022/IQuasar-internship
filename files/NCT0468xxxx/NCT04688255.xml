  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1.9 million youth sustain a concussion each year, and up to 30% experience&#xD;
      persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) such as headache, dizziness, and difficulty&#xD;
      focusing that continue for weeks or months. PPCS results in greater utilization of&#xD;
      sub-specialty care and can impact immediate and long-term social development, cognitive&#xD;
      function and academic success. Previous recommendations for treating PPCS have focused on&#xD;
      cognitive and physical rest, but more recently guidelines have shifted based on new research&#xD;
      suggesting the benefit of rehabilitative exercise for PPCS. The rationale behind using&#xD;
      exercise to treat youth with concussion is that gradually increasing physical activity&#xD;
      facilitates return to full function. Rehabilitative exercise has since become one of the most&#xD;
      common approaches to treating youth with PPCS, but access is challenging since most programs&#xD;
      require weekly centralized visits with a concussion specialist. To bridge this gap, the&#xD;
      investigators developed a telehealth-delivered approach to treat PPCS, utilizing physical&#xD;
      activity trackers (Fitbits) and weekly video conferences with trained research staff. They&#xD;
      then conducted a series of pilot studies with this approach, finding excellent feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and evidence for more rapid declines in concussive symptoms compared to&#xD;
      controls. The investigators also found preliminary evidence that mechanisms behind this&#xD;
      intervention may stem from both physiologic processes due to increased moderate-to-vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity (MVPA) and psychologic processes such as reducing fear- avoidance of&#xD;
      concussive symptoms. They now propose a fully-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      asses the efficacy of the &quot;Mobile Subthreshold Exercise Program&quot; (M-STEP) for treating youth&#xD;
      with PPCS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit n=200 youth 11-18 years old with PPCS. Youth will be&#xD;
      randomized to 6 weeks of either usual care plus M-STEP (intervention) or usual care plus&#xD;
      stretching (control). Youth in M-STEP will be coached through gradual increases in intensity&#xD;
      and duration of rehabilitative exercise via weekly video conferencing (Zoom) and will use&#xD;
      Fitbits to guide their progress. Youth in the stretching group will act as attention&#xD;
      controls. All youth will complete research-grade measures at multiple time points. Youth will&#xD;
      be followed for a total of 6 months. Data will be analyzed using mixed effects models to&#xD;
      examine differences between experimental groups in the primary outcome, trajectory of&#xD;
      concussive symptoms, and the secondary outcome, changes over time in health-related quality&#xD;
      of life, on an intention-to-treat basis. Potential mediators of the treatment effect will&#xD;
      also be examined, including fear-avoidance of concussive symptoms and MVPA, and explore the&#xD;
      impact of factors such as patient sex and parental protective behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators thus assert the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: M-STEP youth will have more rapid declines in HBI and improvement in PedsQL&#xD;
      compared to control youth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: M-STEP youth will have greater increases in MVPA over time than control youth,&#xD;
      and these increases will predict more rapid improvement in HBI and PedsQL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: M-STEP youth will have steeper declines in fear-avoidance compared to control&#xD;
      youth, and these declines will predict more rapid improvement in HBI and PedsQL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT: The proposed study will definitively answer the question of whether a mobile&#xD;
      sub-threshold exercise program (M-STEP) improves outcomes for youth with PPCS. It will also&#xD;
      provide essential information about both the long-term impact of this intervention and&#xD;
      potential mediators as well as biopsychosocial factors that influence treatment response. The&#xD;
      study design uses a rigorous protocolized smartphone administered mHealth intervention that&#xD;
      will be readily reproducible and generalizable to the majority of youth with PPCS. If&#xD;
      successful, this will be one of the few evidenced-based interventions available to treat&#xD;
      youth with PPCS.&#xD;
