  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of the relationship between perioperative sleep time/quality,&#xD;
      synovial fluid cytokine profiles, and clinical outcomes of primary ACL reconstruction with&#xD;
      BPTB autograft in 50 subjects. Sleep during the week before and month after surgery will be&#xD;
      assessed using Fitbit smartwatch and sleep diary. Synovial fluid sampled preoperatively,&#xD;
      intraoperatively, and postoperatively will be analyzed for levels of pro- and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. Postoperative knee pain and function will be assessed until 2&#xD;
      years post-op using validated questionnaires.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a survey is meant to track how the participant feels about their knee and how well they are able to perform their usual activities. There are six categories in the survey: Symptoms, Stiffness, Pain, Function/Daily Living, Function/Sports, Quality of Life.&#xD;
Symptoms category consists of 5 questions, ranked from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot; (0-5).&#xD;
Stiffness category consists of 2 questions, ranked from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;extreme&quot; (0-5).&#xD;
Pain category consists of 9 questions, ranked from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;extreme&quot; (0-5).&#xD;
Function/Daily Living category consists of 17 questions, ranked from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;extreme&quot; (0-5).&#xD;
Function/Sports category consists of 5 questions, ranked from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;extreme&quot; (0-5).&#xD;
Quality of Life category consists of 4 questions, ranked from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely, constantly, totally&quot; (0-5).&#xD;
The total range of score is 0-210. The lower the score, the better they feel about their knee and performance of usual activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale consists of 35 common complaints which people frequently have with their knee problems. Participants will check each statement which best describes their condition -- each statement is assigned a particular score, and those scores are added together to obtain the total score out of 100 (total range: 0-100). A higher score indicates more knee problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS Score for Anterior Knee Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot; The total score range is 0-10; the higher the score, the worse the pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Knee range of motion (maximal flexion and extension) will be measured bilaterally using a goniometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Thigh Circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Thigh circumference will be measured bilaterally.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration of Synovial Fluid Cytokines</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Synovial fluid from the injured knee will be sampled preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively and analyzed for levels of the following pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines using multiplex magnetic bead immunoassay or ELISA: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1, TIMP-2, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) 1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1beta/CCL4, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2).</description>
