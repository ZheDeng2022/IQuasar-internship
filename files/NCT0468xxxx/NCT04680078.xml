    <textblock>
      a prospective randomized study conducted upon 40 eyes of 24 patients with lower punctual&#xD;
      stenosis (grade 1 or 2 according to Kashkouli scale) attending at Menoufia University&#xD;
      hospitals and Kafr Elsheikh ophthalmic eye center. The upper punctum and canaliculus were&#xD;
      patent. All patients were complaining of epiphora and had a thorough ophthalmological&#xD;
      examination including dye disappearance test, and slit-lamp examination. A Nettelship dilator&#xD;
      is used to enlarge the stenotic lacrimal punctum. A single blade of a small Westcott spring&#xD;
      scissor or Vannus scissor is placed within the ampulla of the lacrimal canaliculus, with the&#xD;
      remaining blade placed on the conjunctival surface of the posterior aspect of the eyelid. The&#xD;
      first vertical snip is made at the vertical canaliculus. The second vertical snip is made&#xD;
      from the edge of the first snip to create a flap. The final horizontal snip was made at the&#xD;
      base. The triangular flap is removed and three sutures are placed, in an interrupted manner,&#xD;
      at the posterior wall of the ampulla using 10-0 nylon. The sutures are removed 1 week after&#xD;
      the surgery. Topical moxifloxacin 0.5% eye drops and fluorometholone 0.1% eye drops were used&#xD;
      four times daily for one week.Patients were then followed up for 6 months after the surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-randomized study which includes 40 eyelids of 24 patients with&#xD;
      acquired lower punctal stenosis grade 1 or grade 2 according to Kashkouli scale attending at&#xD;
      Menoufia University hospitals and Kafr Elsheikh ophthalmic eye center in the period from&#xD;
      January 2019 to June 2020. Ethics approval from the institutional review board was obtained,&#xD;
      and a written informed consent was taken from every patient according to the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full history and examination were done for patients for evaluation of proximal lacrimal&#xD;
      drainage system and exclusion of other causes of epiphora rather than punctal stenosis,&#xD;
      Inspection of face and periorbital region for position of the eyelids and puncta, Gross nasal&#xD;
      deformity, Facial symmetry, presence of any swelling or fistula in the lacrimal sac area ,&#xD;
      palpation of lacrimal sac for regurge test , slitlamp examination of lid margin for&#xD;
      coaptation with the globe , blepharitis or rubbing lashes , skin for laceration or eczema ,&#xD;
      conjunctiva for papillae , follicles, hyperemia or discharge , cornea for punctate keratitis,&#xD;
      filaments or abrasions , lower Tear meniscus height (TMH) using a 1 mm slit beam , punctal&#xD;
      orifices position, shape , grading of stenosis according to Kashkouli et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein dye disappearance test (FDDT) where the fluorescence of the tear meniscus was&#xD;
      observed with the help of cobalt-blue filter. FDDT was graded according to Ozgur et al.,&#xD;
      scale according the time of dye clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic probing and syringing were done to ensure anatomically patent nasolacrimal system&#xD;
      and to detect any obstruction distal to the punctum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were examined for results in visits at one week, 1month, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfactory surgical outcome was defined as postoperative patent lower eyelid punctum and&#xD;
      improved Epiphora and FDDT grade at 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery was performed using an operating microscope under local anaesthesia. We&#xD;
      transconjunctivally infiltrate 2% (w/v) lidocaine (with epinephrine in a 1:100,000 weight&#xD;
      ratio) from the posterior aspect of the eyelid into the region of the lacrimal canaliculus&#xD;
      and punctum.A Nettelship dilator is used to enlarge the stenotic lacrimal punctum. A single&#xD;
      blade of a small Westcott spring scissor or Vannus scissor is placed within the ampulla of&#xD;
      the lacrimal canaliculus, with the remaining blade placed on the conjunctival surface of the&#xD;
      posterior aspect of the eyelid. The first vertical snip is made at the vertical canaliculus.&#xD;
      The second vertical snip is made from the edge of the first snip to create a flap. The final&#xD;
      horizontal snip was made at the base. The triangular flap is removed and three sutures are&#xD;
      placed, in an interrupted manner, at the posterior wall of the ampulla using 10-0 nylon. The&#xD;
      sutures are removed 1 week after the surgery. Topical moxifloxacin 0.5% eye drops and&#xD;
      fluorometholone 0.1% eye drops were used four times daily for one week.Patients were then&#xD;
      followed up in 1 week , 1 month , 3 months , 6 months period.&#xD;

    <description>After instillation of topical benoxinate hydrochloride 0.4%, subconjunctival injection of 2% lidocaine was done beneath the lower punctum, then Nettleship dilator was used to dilate the punctum. A single blade of a small Westcott spring scissor or Vannus scissor is placed within the ampulla of the lacrimal canaliculus, with the remaining blade placed on the conjunctival surface of the posterior aspect of the eyelid. The first vertical snip is made at the vertical canaliculus. The second vertical snip is made from the edge of the first snip to create a flap. The final horizontal snip was made at the base. The triangular flap is removed and three sutures are placed, in an interrupted manner, at the posterior wall of the ampulla using 10-0 nylon. Hemostasis was done by compression with a cotton tip for one minute until bleeding stop. The sutures are removed 1 week after the surgery.</description>
