  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T-1101 (Tosylate) is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapeutic by Taivex Therapeutics Corp. T-1101 (Tosylate) is a potent&#xD;
      anti-cancer agent in numerous human cancer cell lines. In addition, oral administration of&#xD;
      T-1101 (Tosylate) showed tumor growth inhibition in different mouse xenograft models of human&#xD;
      cancers. In this study, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) of T-1101 (Tosylate)&#xD;
      capsules will be evaluated and also the recommended dose and regimen(s) to initiate Phase 2&#xD;
      will be determined.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of T-1101 (Tosylate) in Participants with Advanced Cancers Refractory to Standard Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>The first 28-day cycle</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is highest dose level of 30% target toxicity rate and the MTD will be determined based on the occurrence of the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessed using toxicity data during Cycle 1 (the first 28 days).&#xD;
When following toxicity events occur within the first 28-day cycle, these toxicity will be defined as DLT.&#xD;
Hematological toxicities : prolonged grade 4 neutropenia for &gt;7 days, grade 3 febrile neutropenia (an ANC &lt; 1000/mm3 with a single temperature of &gt; 38.3°C or a sustained temperature of &gt; 38°C for more than 1 hour), grade 4 febrile neutropenia (febrile neutropenia with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated), Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with IV treatment for infection and grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or grade 4 lasting 7 days.&#xD;
Non-hematological toxicities: grade 3 or 4 toxicities, Nausea and vomiting or diarrhea must persist at grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical therapy.</description>

    <description>Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUC0-last) of T-1101 (Tosylate) will be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC0-∞) will be also estimated.</description>

    <time_frame>Selected time points during first 28-day cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of T-1101 (Tosylate) will be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit, terminal elimination half-life (T½ ) will be also estimated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Oral plasma clearance (CL/F) of T-1101 (Tosylate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Selected time points during first 28-day cycle</time_frame>
