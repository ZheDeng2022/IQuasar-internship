  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most commonly used performance tests to evaluate upper extremity function in children&#xD;
      diagnosed with rheumatic disease are the 9-hole peg test and Jebsen Taylor hand function&#xD;
      tests. Although these tests have advantages such as being able to be applied in a short time,&#xD;
      providing objective data, being easily applicable in the clinical environment, and being&#xD;
      cost-effective, these tests are non-specific performance tests. Fine motor skills specific to&#xD;
      rheumatic diseases, planned for children; There is no test battery that examines the mobility&#xD;
      and position of each segment of the upper extremity during a function in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shriners Hospital for Children Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE) is a video-based&#xD;
      assessment approved for use in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. In addition to&#xD;
      spontaneous functional movement, it also evaluates the dynamical position, grip, and release&#xD;
      movements of the upper extremity segments. Approved with a total of 22 questions/tasks&#xD;
      observed for children aged 3-18. While the evaluation takes about 15 minutes, it takes about&#xD;
      15-30 minutes for the participant to score after the evaluation. The test battery can be&#xD;
      created with the materials found in the physiotherapy clinic and is therefore very practical&#xD;
      in terms of cost. In addition, due to the video recording of the evaluation, it provides a&#xD;
      detailed examination opportunity to the evaluator both during and after the evaluation.&#xD;
      However, it is superior to other tests in terms of creating a patient archive due to video&#xD;
      recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to introduce SHUEE to the literature as a new assessment tool to be used in&#xD;
      pediatric rheumatic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 25 volunteer pediatric patients diagnosed with rheumatic diseases in&#xD;
      the study. Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability of SHUEE in children with a&#xD;
      rheumatic diagnosis will be evaluated. For validity, the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function test and&#xD;
      Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire will be used.&#xD;

      Various questionnaires and test batteries are available to evaluate the functional activities&#xD;
      of the upper extremities in children with upper extremity involvement. Among these&#xD;
      questionnaires and test batteries, there are different performance tests evaluating the grip,&#xD;
      wrist, and elbow movements in the upper extremity due to rheumatic disease. In the&#xD;
      literature, the most common performance tests used in children diagnosed with rheumatic&#xD;
      disease are the 9-hole peg test and the Jebsen Taylor hand function tests. Although these&#xD;
      tests have advantages such as being able to be applied in a short time, providing objective&#xD;
      data, being easily applicable in the clinical environment, and being accessible in terms of&#xD;
      cost, these tests are non-specific performance tests. There is no test battery that examines&#xD;
      the mobility and position of each segment of the upper extremity during a function in detail&#xD;
      for motor skills specific to children with rheumatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shriners Hospital for Children Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE) is a video-based&#xD;
      assessment validated for use in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. In addition to&#xD;
      spontaneous functional movement, it also evaluates the dynamical position, grip, and release&#xD;
      movements of the upper extremity segments. Approved with a total of 22 questions/tasks&#xD;
      observed for children aged 3-18. While the evaluation takes about 15 minutes, it takes about&#xD;
      15-30 minutes for the participant to score after the evaluation. The test battery can be&#xD;
      created with the materials found in the physiotherapy clinic and is therefore very practical&#xD;
      in terms of cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHUEE provides detailed information about the location of the upper extremity segments during&#xD;
      the function. In addition, due to the video recording of the evaluation, it provides a&#xD;
      detailed examination opportunity to the evaluator after the evaluation. However, it is&#xD;
      superior to other tests in terms of creating a patient archive due to video recording.&#xD;

    <description>The Shriners Hospital for Children Upper Extremity Evaluation (SHUEE) is a video-based tool for the assessment of upper extremity function. The outcome is the total score of the spontaneous functional analysis, dynamic positional analysis, and grasp/release analysis. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) is a standardized and objective measure of fine and gross motor hand function using simulated activities of daily living (ADL). The outcome is the sum of time taken for each sub-test, which is rounded to the nearest second. Lower scores mean a better outcome. Except for the subtest titled writing, all subtest scores should be under 10 seconds at least.</description>

    <description>It is a self-report questionnaire and is said to measure both disability and discomfort in children with chronic arthritis. It assesses functional ability in 8 domains of physical function (30 items) for children between the ages of 6 months up to 18 years. Each item is scored on a four-point scale ranging from 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty), 3 (unable to do). Lower scores mean a better outcome.</description>
