  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, pilot dietary intervention. Ocean&#xD;
      Spray Cranberries, Inc provided the experimental and placebo beverages, which have been&#xD;
      validated and used in previous studies [26-29]. Both beverages were similar in appearance,&#xD;
      taste, and aroma and assigned to volunteers according to computer-generated random orders.&#xD;
      Both investigators and participants were blind to the assignment and products are identified&#xD;
      by a random 3-digit code pre-printed on the cap. The participants consumed either cranberry&#xD;
      juice or placebo beverage daily (8 fl oz per day) for 15 days&#xD;

      This was a prospective exploratory pilot study with a dietary intervention. Twenty-three (23)&#xD;
      women volunteered and participated in this study. The eligibility (no menstrual period for at&#xD;
      least 12 months) of the participants was determined using a questionnaire. The participants&#xD;
      were postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-75 years old who met the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      including no recent antibiotics or immunosuppressive therapies, surgery of the stomach, small&#xD;
      or large intestines, appendectomy, gastric bypass or gastric banding in the previous 6&#xD;
      months, and diagnostic with any autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
