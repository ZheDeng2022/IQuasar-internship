  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is designed to answer effectiveness of community-based multimodal intervention&#xD;
      programs on physical, mental, cognitive, social, and environmental in active and aging&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite that musculoskeletal diseases/conditions are the leading cause of disability and&#xD;
      frailty/mortality in aging individuals, the musculoskeletal health is given little&#xD;
      consideration. Exercise is essential and effective publicly-available medicine for&#xD;
      management/prevention of obesity, lack of physical activity, chronic disease, frailty, and&#xD;
      mental stress/anxiety/depression without any side-effects from drug use/abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, multimodal interventions with physical, postural, mindfulness, and power&#xD;
      exercises have shown to be effective improving both physical and mental health. To expand the&#xD;
      recent trend in multimodal intervention, the current proposal will examine effects of&#xD;
      community-based multimodal intervention on physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and&#xD;
      environmental characteristics in aging individuals. Simultaneously, a cross-sectional study&#xD;
      will establish normative values and inter-relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One simple (15 minutes a day /2-3 times a week) yet comprehensive multimodal (balance,&#xD;
      posture/thoracic spine, hopping, and mindfulness) intervention could provide a practical&#xD;
      solution for aging individuals. Such a program could be implemented individually or by&#xD;
      community staff, which would allow for a large-scale community implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the overall objective of the project is to explore effects of a community-based,&#xD;
      simple, multimodal intervention program (MayoP4) for aging individuals. A small group&#xD;
      intervention with friends and club/family members will help peer-to-peer support/team spirit&#xD;
      and improve positive engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this project is to establish normative values and examine&#xD;
      interrelations among various frailty/mortality risk factors. In addition to physical&#xD;
      activity, musculoskeletal, balance/posture, and psychological/wellness factors, there are&#xD;
      many additional elements associated with frailty/mortality risk. These include, but are not&#xD;
      limited to, positive thinking/behavior (optimism), sufficient sleep, and&#xD;
      cognitive/social/environmental considerations. Physical frailty plays an important role and&#xD;
      positively influences all other domains; however, this relationship among aging individuals&#xD;
      in our communities remains to be established.&#xD;
