  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), serum procalcitonin (PCT) and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor&#xD;
      (suPAR) in the initial investigation of patients hospitalized with suspected acute&#xD;
      pyelonephritis (APN).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe acute infection in the upper urinary tract, which&#xD;
      quite frequently is seen in the emergency department (ED). In our study, we define APN as a&#xD;
      urinary tract infection with extension above the bladder, implicated by systemic affection in&#xD;
      a suspected urinary tract infection (ie, fever, chills, malaise and/or lethargy beyond&#xD;
      normal, signs of sepsis). Most often, an infection of the bladder ascends to the kidneys,&#xD;
      causing APN. Symptoms and clinical affection range from mild to severe, but it is always&#xD;
      important to recognize and treat APN fast in order to prevent progression to sepsis, renal&#xD;
      failure and ultimately death. Uncertain or delayed diagnosis will often lead to an&#xD;
      overconsumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which contributes to increased development of&#xD;
      resistant bacteria and thus threaten the treatment options of the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APN diagnosis is primarily made today on the basis of clinical symptoms and findings in the&#xD;
      form of flank tenderness, fever and nausea/vomiting. Typical symptoms of cystitis (dysuria,&#xD;
      pollakisuria, suprapubic pain, hematuria) are possible but often absent. Especially elderly&#xD;
      can present with more generalized signs of infection with nothing clearly indicating&#xD;
      localization to the urinary tract. A positive urine culture verifies the diagnosis, but it is&#xD;
      only available after a minimum of 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support the diagnosis of an APN and assess its severity, a measure of the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response is useful such as abnormal temperature, elevated leucocyte count with&#xD;
      neutrocytosis, or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Some uncertainty is associated with CRP&#xD;
      because it has a delayed response to bacterial infection and is often elevated in&#xD;
      non-infectious inflammatory conditions. A more sensitive and specific marker is desired that&#xD;
      can differentiate between bacterial and viral infection and reflect the severity of the APN.&#xD;
      Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has potential as a diagnostic tool in suspected bacterial&#xD;
      infections and can distinguish between viral and bacterial urinary infections. Soluble&#xD;
      urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (SuPAR) might have a potential as a marker for acute&#xD;
      bacterial infections requiring antibiotic treatment. However, there are no well-conducted&#xD;
      studies which compare simultaneously all three biomarkers diagnostic abilities for bacterial&#xD;
      infections in general or in relation to APN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that serum CRP, PTC and suPAR have an impact on diagnosing,&#xD;
      prognosis, and treatment of patients with a verified APN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the diagnostic value of CRP, PCT and suPAR in the diagnosis of APN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the prognostic value of CRP, PCT and suPAR in relation to adverse events in&#xD;
           patients with verified APN&#xD;

    <description>The decision of whether patients admitted with suspicion of APN actually has a final diagnosis of APN is based on a combination of all findings during admission. The verification of diagnosis requires human handling, interpretation and judgment. Therefore, in this study, an expert panel will define the reference standard for the diagnosis APN. The expert panel consists of two independent consultants from the emergency department with significant experience in emergency medicine and acute infections. They will individually determine whether or not the patient admitted suspected with APN actually had this diagnosis. The final diagnosis will be based on all available relevant information from the patient medical record including MRI of the kidneys. A standardized template will be used. Disagreement will be discussed until a consensus is reached.</description>

    <description>Blood samples will be collected by a medical laboratory technologist and transferred to the local laboratory for analysis of CRP, PCT and suPAR. Laboratory staff will be blinded to participant diagnosis and outcome. CRP and PCT results will be available to the treating physician, but the suPAR result will not be available.&#xD;
Diagnostic test of CRP. CRP will be measured using an immunoturbidimetric assay (Tina-quant®, Roche) on Roche/Hitachi Cobas© systems.&#xD;
Diagnostic test of PCT: Plasma PCT will be quantified by an automated sandwich immunoassay &quot;ECLIA&quot; (Elecsys®, BRAHMS PCT-analyses) on Cobas© within two hours from collection according to standard procedure.&#xD;
Diagnostic test of suPAR: Plasma suPAR will be quantified by using the commercial available suPARnostic© Tubilatex assay reagents (ViroGates, Denmark) on Cobas© as previously validated (35). Separated plasma is kept refrigerated and analysed for suPAR within 48 hours after collection.</description>
