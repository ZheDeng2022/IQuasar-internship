    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study for an investigational clinical decision support system (&quot;the&#xD;
      System&quot;) intended to optimize the management of blood pressure (BP) for patients during&#xD;
      vasopressor infusion. The investigational outcomes are the perceptions of the nurse-subjects&#xD;
      who are managing the BP of the patient-subjects; the operational performance of the System;&#xD;
      and any technical failures of the software during real-time operation.&#xD;

      This is a feasibility study for an investigational clinical decision support system (&quot;the&#xD;
      System&quot;) intended to optimize the management of blood pressure (BP) for patients during&#xD;
      vasopressor infusion. Enrollment is planned of a convenience sample of 20 individual&#xD;
      patient-subjects and also the 20 nurse-subjects who correspond to the primary nurses managing&#xD;
      the patient-subjects. Consent will be obtained by the investigative team from the&#xD;
      patient-subject (or close family member or healthcare proxy) and from the nurse-subject. The&#xD;
      nurse will receive training in the intended use and important limitations of the System. The&#xD;
      System will be deployed to the patient's bedside and the System will be initiated. This&#xD;
      intervention will continue for a duration of between 4 to 8 hours. A Technical Observer&#xD;
      (&quot;TO&quot;) will be present to continually oversee the operation of the System, watching to ensure&#xD;
      that there are no observable technical failures. The TO will also watch to see if any early&#xD;
      termination conditions are met (specifically any concerns by the clinical staff or the&#xD;
      patient or the patient's family; any observed technical operational problems; maximum dose&#xD;
      vasopressors or hypoxia despite maximum respiratory support; or unplanned bedside response by&#xD;
      the clinical care team) and also will make annotations about the exact time that specific&#xD;
      clinical interventions are performed. After the intervention, the nurse-subject will be&#xD;
      surveyed. Prior to enrollment of a subsequent subject, additional data analysis -- sufficient&#xD;
      to identify or exclude any early stoppage condition -- will be performed on the System's&#xD;
      archived electronic data and log files. Any adverse events will be reported to the IRB and&#xD;
      the FDA as per FDA and institutional policy.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patient (18 years or older) receiving continuous vasopressor infusion to&#xD;
             maintain blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinician treating patient estimates future duration of vasopressor infusion likely at&#xD;
             least 4 additional hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provider order has been made that sets lower limit for mean arterial pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Indwelling arterial catheter has been placed for continuous blood pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of consent or at the discretion of the patient's primary nurse;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The discretion of any of the patient's other clinical providers;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People who do not speak English will be excluded. The rationale is that this protocol&#xD;
             involves the bedside deployment of an investigational system plus longitudinal&#xD;
             observation. Our mitigation for psychosocial risk involves a continual observer who&#xD;
             can monitor for any evidence of subject psychosocial discomfort, which involves the&#xD;
             ability to effectively communicate with the subject throughout the duration of the&#xD;
             protocol. This therefore excludes patients who do not speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are on two simultaneous vasopressors running at maximum doses (per the&#xD;
             ICUs own protocols) or who is on one maximum-dose vasopressor and has a&#xD;
             contraindication to receiving a second vasopressor (e.g., insufficient vascular&#xD;
             access).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are hypoxic (SpO2 &lt; 90%) despite maximum inspired oxygen (100% for&#xD;
             patients receiving mechanical ventilation, or 10L high-flow in patients who are not&#xD;
             candidates for mechanical ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provider order has been made that sets lower limit for SBP (because our system does&#xD;
             not have the capability to provide decision-support for an SBP lower limit).&#xD;
