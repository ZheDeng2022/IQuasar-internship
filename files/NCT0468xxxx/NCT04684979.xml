  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to treat patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies.&#xD;
      These types of cancers include diffuse large cell (DLBCL) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL),&#xD;
      mantle cell NHL, any indolent B cell NHL (such as follicular, small cell or marginal zone&#xD;
      NHL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with these types of lymphomas have been&#xD;
      shown to benefit from peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). PBSCT uses healthy&#xD;
      blood stem cells from a donor to replace your diseased or damaged bone marrow. Before&#xD;
      undergoing PBSCT, you'll receive chemotherapy and/or radiation to destroy your diseased cells&#xD;
      and prepare your body for the donor cells. This is called a &quot;conditioning regimen.&quot;&#xD;
      Non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning causes minimal cell death. This research study will look&#xD;
      at a course of treatment using NMA conditioning regimen including low dose chemotherapy and&#xD;
      low dose radiation as well as rituximab and PBSCT from a compatible donor. The primary aim is&#xD;
      to obtain a preliminary estimate of the overall and event-free survival 1 year&#xD;
      post-transplant after NMA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of a treatment regimen consisting of a non-myeloablative (NMA)&#xD;
      conditioning regimen incorporating low dose chemotherapy and low dose radiation as well as&#xD;
      peri-transplant Rituximab and the transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from&#xD;
      an HLA compatible related or unrelated donor in patients with B cell lymphoid malignancies&#xD;
      including diffuse large cell (DLBCLC) and mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCL), indolent&#xD;
      B cell NHL, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study design will be based on a total&#xD;
      of 90 patients, 30 recipients of related matched and 60 recipients of mismatched related or&#xD;
      unrelated PBSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the accrual will last 5-6 years. At the conclusion of the study, the&#xD;
      safety and a preliminary assessment of efficacy of NMA PBSCT will be determined. The&#xD;
      treatment will be declared efficacious if the disease-free survival at 1 year in this patient&#xD;
      population is at least 50%.&#xD;
