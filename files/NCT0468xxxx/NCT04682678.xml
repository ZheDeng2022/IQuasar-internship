  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our project is based on the fundamental hypothesis that epidural spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      (SCS) improves Freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease. In eight patients&#xD;
      implantation of electrodes for SCS at the epidural thoracic level will be performed under&#xD;
      general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of gait and motor symptoms will be performed with and without stimulation, after a&#xD;
      3-month period for each of the stimulation conditions.This is a pilot, single centre,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double blinded, cross-over study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be selected in the Movement Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, University&#xD;
      Hospital Grenoble. A preoperative assessment with gait assessment, clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      Non-Motor Symptoms assessment will be realized. The implantation of electrodes for SCS at the&#xD;
      epidural thoracic level connected to a neurostimulator at the abdominal level will be&#xD;
      performed under general anaesthesia. During the first postoperative month, the optimization&#xD;
      of SCS parameters will be performed by an experienced movement disorders neurologist.After&#xD;
      the first post-operative month the patient will be randomized to the STIM ON condition&#xD;
      (stimulation on, with the most effective parameters) or STIM OFF (without stimulation). The&#xD;
      randomization will be performed in a double blinded fashion, by a neurologist working in open&#xD;
      and not participating in the evaluations. After 3 months, the patient will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      double blind condition, and the stimulation condition will be crossed for another period of 3&#xD;
      months. At the end of this second 3-month period, the patient will be again double-blind&#xD;
      assessed. After this evaluation, the patient will enter the open phase of the study for a&#xD;
      period of 6 months. For this last phase of the study, under STIM ON condition, an&#xD;
      optimization of the stimulation settings will be realized, if necessary. At the end of this&#xD;
      6-month period of stimulation, the patient will be evaluated one last time. At all visits,&#xD;
      clinical and gait evaluations will be carried out under chronic dopaminergic treatment. No&#xD;
      change in antiparkinsonian treatment will be allowed during the entire study. Gait and&#xD;
      clinical assessment will be performed at baseline and at the end of each double blinded phase&#xD;
      and at 1-year follow-up. For the double-blind study the patient, the neurologist who performs&#xD;
      the clinical evaluation and the expert who performs the gait test and analysis will be blind&#xD;
      to the stimulation condition.&#xD;
