  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft surgery is commonly done to treat pterygiums.&#xD;
      Excessive bleeding during the procedure creates a challenging operating field, prolongs&#xD;
      surgery time, and prolongs healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brimonidine tartrate has a vasoconstrictive effect, which helps to reduce the amount of blood&#xD;
      flow and hyperemia to the eye. Preoperative use of brimonidine has been shown to decrease&#xD;
      subconjunctival hemorrhage during procedures such as cataract surgery, laser assisted in situ&#xD;
      keratomileusis, strabismus surgery, and intravitreal injections. The focus of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the effect of preoperative application of brimonidine tartrate 0.15% (Alphagan) and&#xD;
      0.025% (Lumify) on reducing hemorrhage during pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft surgery, incision into the conjunctiva&#xD;
      of the operated eye causes a significant amount of subconjunctival hemorrhage.&#xD;
      Brimonidine-tartrate is a selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonist. The 0.15% concentration&#xD;
      (Alphagan) is commonly used to treat glaucoma, while the 0.025% (Lumify) is an&#xD;
      over-the-counter drop used for its vasoconstrictive anti-hyperemia effect. Brimonidine 0.15%&#xD;
      has been evaluated in other studies to reduce bleeding in LASIK, cataract surgery, strabismus&#xD;
      surgery, as well as intravitreal injections. In these mentioned clinical trials, brimonidine&#xD;
      was found to safely reduce subconjunctival hemorrhage intraoperatively and hyperemia&#xD;
      postoperatively. Interestingly, prophylactic topical brimonidine was found to increase risk&#xD;
      of early flap slippage in LASIK due to molecular interference with flap stabilization.&#xD;
      Because creation of a flap is not a component of pterygium surgery, preoperative brimonidine&#xD;
      does not interfere with healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study by Ucar et al. has validated the use of preoperative brimonidine 0.15% for&#xD;
      conjunctival whitening prior to pterygium surgery, allowing for minimized hyperemia and&#xD;
      reduced surgical duration (Ucar, 2020). However, the long-term clinical outcomes, and&#xD;
      efficacy of brimonidine 0.025% has yet to be examined. This study aims to further examine the&#xD;
      comparative efficacy of preoperative brimonidine at different concentrations to reduce&#xD;
      subconjunctival hemorrhage during pterygium surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential side effects of topical application of brimonidine eye drop may include blurred or&#xD;
      loss of vision, burning, dry, or itching eyes, discharge or excessive tearing, disturbed&#xD;
      color perception, double vision, halos around lights, headache, itching of the eye, night&#xD;
      blindness, photophobia, redness of the eye or inner lining of the eyelid, swelling of the&#xD;
      eyelid, tearing of the eye, tunnel vision. Side effects of this medication are self-limited,&#xD;
      and reversible after the medication is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of this study to the subject is negligible as the standard surgical procedure will&#xD;
      be followed. This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirement as set by William Osler Health System Ethics Review Board.&#xD;

    <description>Subconjunctival hemorrhage grading of images at POD0, POW1, and POM1 will be done as follows: a score of 1-4 for the number of quadrants involved, and a score of 1-4 for the amount of involvement in the quadrant (1 = 0-25% coverage, 2 = 26-50% coverage, 3 = 51-75% coverage, 4 = 76-100% coverage). A total maximum score of 16 may be given, with 0 indicating no subconjunctival hemorrhage present. This grading algorithm is adapted from previously published methods (Munoz 2009, Hong 2007, Norden 2002). Grading will be done by an independent reviewer blinded to the randomization of participants.</description>
