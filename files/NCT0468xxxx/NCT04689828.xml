  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 177Lu-PSMA-617 improves the rPFS or death&#xD;
      compared to a change in ARDT in mCRPC participants that were previously treated with an&#xD;
      alternate ARDT and not exposed to a taxane-containing regimen in the CRPC or mHSPC settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 450 participants will be randomized (225 per treatment group).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, open label, multicenter randomized study where it is considered&#xD;
      appropriate to delay taxane-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at evaluating the superiority of 177Lu-PSMA-617 over a change of ARDT&#xD;
      treatment in prolonging rPFS. The primary endpoint of rPFS will be assessed via blinded&#xD;
      independent centralized review of radiographic images provided by the treating physician and&#xD;
      as outlined in PCWG3 Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate whether 177Lu-PSMA-617 improves the overall survival (OS) in&#xD;
      participants with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC compared to participants treated with a&#xD;
      change in ARDT treatment. OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any&#xD;
      cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration: approximately 43 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period At screening, the participants will be assessed for eligibility and will&#xD;
      undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan to&#xD;
      evaluate PSMA positivity. Only participants with PSMA positive cancer and confirmed&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization period The participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 or a&#xD;
      change of the ARDT treatment. The ARDT change will include approved Androgen Receptor (AR)&#xD;
      axis targeted therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide). Supportive care will be allowed in both&#xD;
      arms at the discretion of the investigator and includes available care for the eligible&#xD;
      participant according to best institutional practice for mCRPC treatment, including androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT). Investigational agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic&#xD;
      radioisotopes (e.g. radium-223), Poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)&#xD;
      inhibitors or hemi-body radiotherapy treatment must not be administered during the study&#xD;
      treatment period. ARDT must not be administered concomitantly with 177Lu-PSMA-617.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period • 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment arm Participants randomized to the&#xD;
      investigational arm will receive 7.4 GBq +/- 10% of 177Lu-PSMA-617 once every 6 weeks for 6&#xD;
      cycles. Best supportive care, including ADT, may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last day of study treatment period of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (i.e. after completion of 6&#xD;
      cycles of treatment OR treatment discontinuation for any reason), the participants must have&#xD;
      an End of Treatment (EOT) visit and enter the Post-treatment Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • ARDT treatment arm For participants randomized to the ARDT treatment arm, the change of&#xD;
      ARDT treatment for each participant will be selected by the treating physician prior to&#xD;
      randomization and will be administered per the physician's orders. Best supportive care,&#xD;
      including ADT, may be used. After the last day of study treatment (treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      for any reason) or upon radiographic progression as assessed by blinded centralized review,&#xD;
      the participants must have an End of Treatment (EOT) and enter the Post-treatment Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized treatment may be discontinued if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant chooses to discontinue treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of the 6 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious non-compliance to the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BICR-determined progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unequivocal clinical progression&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that the scheduled imaging assessments continue until BICR-determined&#xD;
      progression. PSA progression is strongly discouraged as a criterion for initiation of a new&#xD;
      neoplastic therapy prior to BICR-determined progression. PCWG3 guidelines should be followed&#xD;
      to guide discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment visit must be performed ≤ 7 days after the last day of study treatment&#xD;
      period. EOT is to occur before the participant is to enter the post-treatment Follow-up&#xD;
      period of the study and before the initiation of any subsequent anticancer treatment, outside&#xD;
      of what is allowed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant withdraws consent for the treatment period of the study, an EOT must be done&#xD;
      and the participant will enter the Post-treatment Follow-up unless he specifically withdraws&#xD;
      post-treatment Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover period Upon confirmation of rPFS by BICR, participants randomized to the ARDT arm&#xD;
      will either be allowed to crossover to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 or may continue to receive any&#xD;
      other therapy per the discretion of the treating physician in the Post-treatment Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for a participant randomized to the change in ARDT arm to cross over to receive&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-617, he must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed radiographical progression as assessed by BICR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No intervening antineoplastic therapy is administered after the randomized treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any unresolved toxicity from prior therapy should be controlled and must be no greater&#xD;
           than CTCAE grade 1 at the time of starting 177Lu-PSMA-617.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-1 at the time of crossover&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function at the time of crossover:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agreement to continue with the study visit schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has not undergone specific assessments defined below within 7 days prior to&#xD;
      commencing treatment of crossover, they must complete the following assessments in order to&#xD;
      ensure the above criteria are met prior initiation of 177Lu-PSMA-617:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG-PS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematology and biochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant, who is deemed to have disease progression per investigator assessment, but not&#xD;
      by BICR, is not eligible to crossover at that time. Such participant should continue to&#xD;
      receive randomized study treatment until progression determined by BICR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If crossover to 177Lu-PSMA-617 is selected, then 177Lu-PSMA-617 will be administered with the&#xD;
      same dose/schedule as for participants who were initially randomized to receive&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-617.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last day of study treatment period of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or upon second radiographic&#xD;
      progression (rPFS2), the participants must have a second End of Treatment (EOT2) and enter&#xD;
      the Post-treatment Follow-up. The participant can receive any other therapy per the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician in the Post-treatment Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment Follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 day Safety Follow-up All randomized and/or treated participants should have a safety&#xD;
           follow-up conducted approximately 30 days after the EOT visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term follow-up Long term follow-up starts after the 30 Days Safety follow-up and&#xD;
           lasts until the accrual of events for the planned OS-based analysis (key secondary&#xD;
           endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In long term follow-up safety and efficacy information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: all medically significant adverse events (all SAEs) deemed to be related to&#xD;
           177Lu-PSMA-617. This will include potential late onset radiation toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: In any participant entering long term follow-up discontinuing for reasons&#xD;
           other than BICR-determined radiographic progression, tumor assessments must be performed&#xD;
           every 8 weeks after first dose of study treatment for the first 24 weeks (week 8, 16,&#xD;
           24) and then every 12 weeks (week 36, 48, etc) until confirmation of radiographic&#xD;
           progression by BICR&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term follow-up period will also include the collection of survival information and&#xD;
      other assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other: Other data collected during long-term follow-up includes blood sampling for&#xD;
      hematology, chemistry testing, coagulation, DNA and tumor samples for biomarkers. The visits&#xD;
      will be carried out every 12 weeks (± 28 days) until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent or accrual of the number of events required for the planned analyses for OS for the&#xD;
      study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This follow-up will allow to collect information on medically significant long-term&#xD;
      toxicities such as long-term radiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of long term follow-up is expected to continue till end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant withdraws consent for the collection of blood samples and imaging&#xD;
      assessments during the long-term follow-up, information on survival, SAEs related to study&#xD;
      treatment and post-treatment antineoplastic therapy will be collected.&#xD;

             antibodies]) [Note: Taxane exposure (maximum 6 cycles) in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant&#xD;
             setting is allowed if 12 months have elapsed since completion of this adjuvant or&#xD;
             neoadjuvant therapy]&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any investigational agents within 28 days prior to day of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or its excipients or to drugs of&#xD;

             investigational therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Transfusion or use of bone marrow stimulating agents for the sole purpose of making a&#xD;
             participant eligible for study inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a history of CNS metastases that are neurologically unstable,&#xD;
             symptomatic, or receiving corticosteroids for the purpose of maintaining neurologic&#xD;
             integrity. Participants with CNS metastases are eligible if received therapy (surgery,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, gamma knife), asymptomatic and neurologically stable without&#xD;
             corticosteroids. Participants with epidural disease, canal disease and prior cord&#xD;
             involvement are eligible if those areas have been treated, are stable, and not&#xD;
             neurologically impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Symptomatic cord compression, or clinical or radiologic findings indicative of&#xD;
             impending cord compression&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Cardiac or cardiac repolarization abnormality, including any of the following:&#xD;
                  History of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, or CABG within 6 months&#xD;
                  prior to starting study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Concurrent serious (as determined by the Principal Investigator) medical conditions,&#xD;
             including, but not limited to New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, history of congenital prolonged QT syndrome, uncontrolled infection,&#xD;
             known active hepatitis B or C or other significant co-morbid conditions that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator would impair study participation or cooperation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV-infected participants who are at a low risk of AIDS-related outcomes may&#xD;
                  participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with an active documented COVID-19 infection (any grade of disease&#xD;
                  severity) at time of informed consent may be included only when completely&#xD;
                  recovered (in accordance with local guidance) and had no symptoms for at least 28&#xD;
                  days before the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Diagnosed with other malignancies that are expected to alter life expectancy or may&#xD;
             interfere with disease assessment. Participants with a prior history of malignancy&#xD;
             that has been adequately treated and who have been disease free for more than 3 years&#xD;
             are eligible, as are participants with adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking study&#xD;
             treatment and for 6 months after stopping study treatment. A condom is required for&#xD;
             all sexually active male participants to prevent them from fathering a child AND to&#xD;
             prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition,&#xD;
             male participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above. If local&#xD;
             regulations deviate from the contraception methods listed above to prevent pregnancy,&#xD;
             local regulations apply and will be described in the ICF&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Concurrent bladder outflow obstruction or unmanageable urinary incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of somatic or psychiatric disease/condition that may interfere with the&#xD;
             objectives and assessments of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any condition that precludes raised arms position&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Presence of any mutations or biomarkers that are known as predictors of better&#xD;
             response to treatments other than ARDT (e.g., AR-V7 or BRCA) as assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Not able to understand and to comply with study instructions and requirements&#xD;
