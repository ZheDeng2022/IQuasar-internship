  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate if the DermaSense prototype EIS scanner can&#xD;
      provide medical decision support which can complement dermoscopy-based identification of the&#xD;
      disease at time of biopsy decision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study designed to evaluate if the DermaSense device can be a system of an&#xD;
      automated analysis and classification of skin lesions aiming to provide a comprehensive,&#xD;
      reliable and cost-effective approach to assist the Dermatologists' decision (biopsy,&#xD;
      dermoscopy, histopathological analysis etc). The study enrollment will continue until a&#xD;
      minimum of 180 subjects are enrolled in the study. Second Department of Dermatology, School&#xD;
      of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, at the&#xD;
      &quot;Papageorgiou&quot; General Hospital will participate in this study. Dermatologists participating&#xD;
      in the study will perform the patient and lesion assessment for biopsy as standard of care at&#xD;
      the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIS (electrical impedance spectroscopy) measurements will be done once per participant&#xD;
      recommended by the Dermatologist based on their clinical interest in various areas of the&#xD;
      skin. Two sets of measurements will be performed for each participant, either at a nevus in&#xD;
      contrast with a nearby clear patch of skin, or at a skin damage area (melanoma, basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), etc) in contrast with a nearby clear patch of&#xD;
      skin. Also, more repeated measurements may be needed to determine the validity of the&#xD;
      measurement result. Evaluation and analysis of the measurement data will be done by the&#xD;
      DermaSense team and will be used not only for applying appropriate statistical correlations&#xD;
      compared to established dermatological diagnostic methods (eg dermÎ¿scopy, histopathological&#xD;
      examinations, biopsies etc.) but also for training in artificial intelligence and machine&#xD;
      learning methods. Finally, the participants will sign a consent form that is consistent with&#xD;
      bioethical rules and according with EU GDPR regulation to protect their personal data.&#xD;
