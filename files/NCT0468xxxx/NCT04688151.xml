      To evaluate the safety and tolerability and determine the recommended phase 2/phase 3 dose of&#xD;
      RAD regimen in PCNSL&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Target subject population Male and female patients with PCNSL who have failed to achieve a&#xD;
      response or who have relapsed after prior therapy (R/R) or who are treatment naïve but are&#xD;
      not candidates of standard high-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy. Patients are&#xD;
      not to have been previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or Bruton tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase (BTK) inhibitors; prior treatment with rituximab is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment Rituximab will be administered for up to 8 cycles or until intolerance&#xD;
      or excessive toxicities relevant to the trial therapy, or withdrawal of consents;&#xD;
      acalabrutinib and durvalumab will be continued until disease progression, intolerance, or&#xD;
      excessive toxicities relevant to the trial therapy, or withdrawal of consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration Dose level 1 Rituximab 375mg/m2&#xD;
      infusion once every 4 weeks for 8 cycles Acalabrutinib 100mg PO once every day Durvalumab&#xD;
      1500mg infusion once every 4 weeks Dose level 2 Rituximab 375mg/m2 infusion once every 4&#xD;
      weeks for 8 cycles Acalabrutinib 100mg PO twice every day Durvalumab 1500mg infusion once&#xD;
      every 4 weeks Expansion Determined by the result of the dose escalation phase Statistical&#xD;
      methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use the 3+3 design in the dose escalation phase. Analyses will be primarily&#xD;
      descriptive in nature; no formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. The&#xD;
      populations used for analysis will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis set: patients who receive at least 1 dose of anyone of the study drugs will&#xD;
      be used for safety analyses.&#xD;
