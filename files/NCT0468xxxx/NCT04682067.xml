      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of contingency management on&#xD;
      improving smoking cessation among individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cigarette smoking are major causes of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      US, and research indicates there is a complex relationship between these two risk factors.&#xD;
      Smoking cessation is recommended as a standard treatment of diabetes by the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association; however, patients with T2DM and their providers are often inundated with other&#xD;
      challenging lifestyle changes and disease management. Due to the complex relationship between&#xD;
      diabetes and smoking and the large number of competing lifestyle changes recommended at&#xD;
      diagnosis, smokers with T2DM may benefit from a contingency management (CM) program that&#xD;
      incentivizes cessation. Providing patients tangible rewards to reinforce positive behaviors&#xD;
      such as smoking abstinence has been proven effective in substance abuse programs, smoking&#xD;
      cessation among pregnant women unwilling or unable to quit, and other population subgroups.&#xD;
      In this CRUK2 study the investigators aim to test and further explore the potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of financial incentives contingent upon proof of quitting smoking. The&#xD;
      investigators will gather diabetes-related contextual factors associated with participation&#xD;
      in the program and smoking cessation.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the contingency management (CM) treatment arm will receive the usual care (UC) treatment program offered at the Tobacco Treatment Research Program (TTRP) and will be eligible to earn gift cards at each weekly visit on their quit date up until four weeks post-quit for proof of abstinence. They will earn $20 in gift cards for quitting on the specified quit day (i.e., one week after the orientation visit), and this amount will increase by $5 with each successive weekly abstinent visit (i.e., up to $40 in gift cards at 4 weeks post-quit; up to $150 total).</description>
