  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab combined with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is the first-line standard&#xD;
      treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, some research show&#xD;
      that the long-term survival benefit of patients in real world data is inferior to clinical&#xD;
      trial. The reason may be related to the difference in follow-up strategy of patients in the&#xD;
      real world. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) are a kind of outcome indicators that directly&#xD;
      measure and evaluate the disease and its consequences based on how the patient feels about&#xD;
      his own health. In advanced cancer, quality of life (QoL) is a major treatment goal. And the&#xD;
      electronic patient report outcome (ePRO) has become an effective method to capture the&#xD;
      symptoms of patients, which can improve the quality of life and physical and mental health of&#xD;
      patients. In order to observe whether ePRO can bring clinical benefits to patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer, this study aimed to compare the effects of ePRO and routine&#xD;
      follow-up on the quality of life and prognosis of patients with unresectable metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer who received first-line bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy. This is an&#xD;
      open label, multicenter, randomized controlled prospective study of first-line bevacizumab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy in patients with unretractable metastatic colorectal cancer.The&#xD;
      aim of this study was to assess the impact of ePRO on quality of life and survival outcomes&#xD;
      compared with routine follow-up.The study intends to start in February 2021 and end in June&#xD;
      2024.Patients were recruited for 12 months and followed up for 24 months.The study included a&#xD;
      screening period (28 days before first-line treatment to 1 day before treatment) and an&#xD;
      observation period (from the beginning of treatment to the end of the study).Day 1 (baseline)&#xD;
      was defined as the first day of first-line bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy.About 338&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study in China, and enrolled patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the following two groups in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

    <description>The European Cancer Research and Treatment Collaboration (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) was used to assess patients' quality of life at 1 year after randomization (day 1). Proportion of improved/stable patients was considered as prespecified main endpoint. Improvement: at least 10 points improvement in Global Health status; Deterioration: Global Health status (Items 29 and 30 standardized score in QLQ-C30) decreased by at least 10 points; Other conditions are stable. Scoring method: In order to make the scores can be compared with each other, the range method is further adopted to carry out linear transformation, the Score for the field (RS,Raw Score) is obtained by adding up the Score of the items included in each field and dividing by the number of items included, and the crude scores are converted into standardized scores within 0-100.</description>
