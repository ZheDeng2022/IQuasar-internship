    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of surfactant&#xD;
      protein D, Krebs von den Lungen (KL-6), and Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) in the&#xD;
      initial investigation of patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia. This to improve the&#xD;
      diagnosis of pneumonia, contribute to a more rapid and accurate antibiotic treatment, and&#xD;
      assess disease severity to predict short-term and long-term mortality in community-acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infection diseases in the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED). Diagnosis of pneumonia is challenging as symptoms are often weak&#xD;
      and nonspecific and the current methods for focal and etiological diagnosis have low&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity and often deliver results after the antibiotic treatment decision&#xD;
      has been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abundant and restricted expression of surfactant protein D (SP-D) within the lung makes&#xD;
      this protein a specific marker for lung disease. Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is expressed&#xD;
      in the lung and is a diagnostic and prognostic marker of interstitial lung disease. The&#xD;
      inflammatory glycoprotein Chitinase-3-like protein 1 commonly known as YKL-40 is associated&#xD;
      with severity of interstitial lung disease. The value of these lung injury markers for&#xD;
      diagnosing pneumonia needs further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that surfactant protein D, Krebs von den Lungen (KL-6), and&#xD;
      Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) have an impact on diagnosing, prognosis, and treatment of&#xD;
      patients with verified CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of surfactant protein D, Krebs von den Lungen&#xD;
           (KL-6), and Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) in the diagnosis of CAP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the prognostic value surfactant protein D, Krebs von den Lungen (KL-6), and&#xD;
           Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) in relation to adverse events in patients with&#xD;
           verified CAP&#xD;

    <description>The decision of whether patients admitted with suspicion of CAP actually has a final diagnosis of CAP is based on a combination of all findings during admission. The verification of diagnosis requires human handling, interpretation and judgment. Therefore, in this study, an expert panel will define the reference standard for the diagnosis CAP. The expert panel consists of two independent consultants from the emergency department with significant experience in emergency medicine and acute infections. They will individually determine whether or not the patient admitted suspected with CAP actually had this diagnosis. The final diagnosis will be based on all available relevant information from the patient medical record including HR-CT of lungs. A standardized template will be used. Disagreement will be discussed until a consensus is reached.</description>
