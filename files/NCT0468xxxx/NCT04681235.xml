      In our study, we tested the hypothesis of the safe effect applicability of motor training in&#xD;
      the immersion high-tech polymodal VR system not only on the parameters of balance, gait, and&#xD;
      motor status of the patient, but also on his cognitive functions and mental health in&#xD;
      patients with a degree of disability no more than 3 points on a scale Rankin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The neurological consequences of stroke cover the motor, sensory, visual, affective,&#xD;
      cognitive and speech spheres. 55-75% of stroke survivors suffer from motor impairments,&#xD;
      caused, inter alia, by hemiparesis, which substantially reduce the quality of their life. In&#xD;
      addition, neurocognitive functions, especially memory, visual-constructive abilities and&#xD;
      executive functions, are often affected by stroke. Cognitive impairments appear in 83%&#xD;
      patients in at least one cognitive domain, whereas in 50% patients appear in multiple (â‰¥3)&#xD;
      domains. These disorders affect the quality of life of patients, their skills of daily&#xD;
      activity (the ability to go to the store, prepare food, plan their actions for organizing a&#xD;
      daily routine), social adaptation. One of the rehabilitation methods that are comprehensively&#xD;
      suitable for the recovering on of stroke consequences is the intervention using virtual&#xD;
      reality. The VR method is used for the rehabilitation of stroke patients with various motor&#xD;
      and neurocognitive deficits: one-sided spatial ignorance, disorders of attention, memory,&#xD;
      mood, visual-spatial functions, and constructive abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we tested the hypothesis of the applicability of the safe effect of motor&#xD;
      training in the immersion high-tech polymodal VR system not only on the parameters of&#xD;
      balance, gait, and motor status of the patient, but also on his cognitive functions and&#xD;
      mental health in patients with a degree of disability no more than 3 score on a modified&#xD;
      Rankin Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients participated in the study in Federal Center of Cerebrovascular Pathology and&#xD;
      Stroke, Russian Federation Ministry of Health in Moscow, Russia. The study was run between&#xD;
      October 2019 and July 2020 and was approved by a local ethic committee and followed&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The patients stayed in a 24-hour hospital and&#xD;
      underwent a rehabilitation course. This course included a VR Trainig of 10 sessions of 40&#xD;
      minutes each, which the patients took over two weeks. VR training was conducted on the GRAIL&#xD;
      system equipment (Motekforce, Netherlands), consisting of a semi-cylindrical screen,&#xD;
      treadmill, 10 infrared cameras (Vicon, UK) and reflective markers, and software providing&#xD;
      biofeedback in real time. For complex recovery in VR, exercises stimulate the motor,&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral spheres, including visual-spatial orientation, the process of&#xD;
      attention (with one and duai-task), executive functions, lowering the level of anxiety,&#xD;
      hand-eye coordination and balance.Training applications were based on the therapeutic goals&#xD;
      for every patient, according to postural stability and gait adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the end of the training, the patient's condition was assessed, including&#xD;
      measurements in motor and daily living activity, measurements in mental health, measurements&#xD;
      in Virtual Reality.&#xD;
