  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial receptivity takes place in a self-limited period of time during the endometrial&#xD;
      mid-secretory stage. This period, named as window of implantation (WOI), is modulated by&#xD;
      molecular changes allowing embryo implantation to take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been already demonstrated the existence of transcriptomic profiles that are&#xD;
      characteristics of each endometrial phase: pre-receptive, receptive and post-receptive.&#xD;
      'Igenomix' group developed a molecular tool able to classify the endometrium based on its&#xD;
      transcriptomic profile, the Endometrial Receptivity Analysis (ERA). This molecular tool&#xD;
      analyses, by next generation sequencing (NGS), the expression of 248 genes related to&#xD;
      implantation coupled to a computational predictor to identify the specific transcriptomic&#xD;
      profile for each endometrial stage. This test has been applied at clinical level from 2010,&#xD;
      helping to synchronize a viable embryo with a receptive endometrium through the personalized&#xD;
      embryo transfer (pET). It aims to improve clinical implantation by personalizing, diagnosing,&#xD;
      and synchronizing the endometrial factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal in this project is to investigate at what extent, if any, the analysis of the&#xD;
      endometrial factor, at receptivity level, in patients at their first in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF) cycle improves their clinical outcome through a personalized embryo transfer by the ERA&#xD;
      test in comparison to embryo transfer(FET).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When the transcriptomic signature of human endometrial receptivity was reported, Igenomix&#xD;
      developed the ERA, a molecular tool able to diagnose the endometrial receptivity by NGS and a&#xD;
      computational predictor. The accuracy of this diagnostic tool has been shown to be superior&#xD;
      to endometrial histology, and its results are reproducible 29 to 40 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ERA test allows to transfer in a personalized manner by synchronizing the embryo with the&#xD;
      WOI of the patient. Nowadays, it has been published that around 30% of patients present 1 or&#xD;
      2 days of displacements and about 50% show 12 hours of displacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ERA has been broadly applied around the world in order to increase the probabilities of&#xD;
      recurrent implantation failure patients becoming pregnant. Recently, a multicenter&#xD;
      international open-label randomized controlled trial comparing personalized embryo transfer&#xD;
      guided by the ERA test versus frozen and fresh embryo transfer was carried out at first&#xD;
      appointment of infertile patients undergoing IVF. The current project aims to assess in a&#xD;
      randomized way the potential improvement on the clinical outcome of Chinese infertile&#xD;
      patients at their first IVF cycle by diagnosing, personalizing and synchronizing the&#xD;
      endometrial factor with the ERA. To do that, only the outcomes of the first single embryo&#xD;
      transfers performed after the inclusion of each patient will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a 30% of possible drop-outs, a total of 714 patients will be recruited (357&#xD;
      randomized in each group). They will be allocated on a balanced way (assigned by chance like&#xD;
      the flip of a coin) in one of the two arms described below. Reproductive outcomes (defined&#xD;
      following The International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, 2017) will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data exported from the source documents will be duly codified and treated in order to protect&#xD;
      the clinical and personal information of participants in accordance with the current local&#xD;
      legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the statistical analysis performed on the data, as well as the procedures, will be&#xD;
      registered in a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be developed during the&#xD;
      study and before starting data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of this data is planned once 50% of the recruitment has been achieved.&#xD;
      Besides and at that same moment, the study will be overseen by an independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the statistical procedures will be done systematically by both, intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis (ITT) and per protocol analysis (PP). The ITT analysis will include all randomized&#xD;
      patients recruited and assigned to one of two groups after endometrial biopsy collection. The&#xD;
      PP analysis will be applied to those patients who adequately follow the protocol assigned&#xD;
      according to their group and arm and in whom the transfer of the good quality blastocyst is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
