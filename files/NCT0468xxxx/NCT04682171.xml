      One of the most common forms of arthritis is Osteoarthritis. Approximately 15% of the&#xD;
      population is affected by the disease. The prevalence of the disease increases with the age,&#xD;
      with the peak incidence at fourth decade of life. Study shows that in Southern Pakistan mean&#xD;
      age of the patients suffering from Osteoarthritis was 58 years. The disease was more dominant&#xD;
      in women with the 3:8 male to female ratio. Study shows that 13.9% of adults aged 25 years&#xD;
      and above and 33.6% of older adults aged over 65 years are suffering from osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project prevalence of symptomatic knee OA was&#xD;
      recorded to be 16% and 28% for radiographic knee OA. Kellgren-Lawrence classified knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis based on the appearance of osteophytes in knee AP radiographs. Grades 0-4 were&#xD;
      assigned with &gt;2 indicating radiographic OA. Pain and stiffness are significant clinical&#xD;
      features of OA which leads to reduced physical function while articular cartilage&#xD;
      degeneration is considered to be important pathological feature of OA. Genetic factors,&#xD;
      age-related physiological changes and biomechanical factors are considered risk factors of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Several studies shows that increased age and BMI increases the risk of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. One of the important factors in knee osteoarthritis is being&#xD;
      overweight.Physical inactivity is also associated with osteoarthritis. Most notable symptom&#xD;
      of osteoarthritis is pain which is also determining factor of disability in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Pain increases physical inactivity which leads to increased body weight and&#xD;
      eventually predispose the person to osteoarthritis.Quadriceps weakness may contribute to&#xD;
      prompt clinical finding of knee osteoarthritis. Pain of osteoarthritis may causes reduced&#xD;
      quadriceps strength. However some studies reveal that quadriceps weakness plays as a risk&#xD;
      factor for knee osteoarthritis especially in females. Reduced muscle strength was reported in&#xD;
      24% of patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grade II knee OA. It is widely accepted that among the&#xD;
      patients with knee osteoarthritis quadriceps weakness is caused by muscle atrophy which&#xD;
      reduces muscle strength. It is reported that age-related quadriceps weakness is linked with&#xD;
      functional limitations and increased rate of falling among elders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for osteoarthritis include pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods.&#xD;
      The primary goal of these treatments is to relieve joint pain and improve functional quality&#xD;
      of life. Non-steroidal anti inflammatory (NSAIDS) are used widely but their use is now&#xD;
      limited due&#xD;
&#xD;
      to high frequency of side effects specially side effects of gastrointestinal tracts.Therefore&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment is preferred for elderly patients. Non-pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment includes weight reduction, manual therapy, strengthening exercises, electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, ultrasound, interferential current and laser therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is non-invasive and painless modality used for the treatment&#xD;
      of knee osteoarthritis. Studies show that it markedly alleviates both acute and chronic&#xD;
      conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, knee injuries, low back pain, chronic arthritis&#xD;
      and rheumatoid arthritis. Due to its stimulatory effect on tissue metabolism and ability to&#xD;
      regulate the inflammatory effect after knee injuries, LLLT is considered as a favorable&#xD;
      therapeutic modality for OA. It is reported that LLLT was effective for fibroblast and&#xD;
      osteoblast proliferation, bone regeneration, collagen synthesis, cellular oxygenation and&#xD;
      release of neurotransmitters linked with pain modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence shows that regular physical activity reduces pain and improves physical function&#xD;
      among the patients with knee OA. However being inactive and disuse of affected limb may&#xD;
      disturbs joint mechanics leading to softening of articular cartilage which leads to rapid&#xD;
      degeneration of cartilage. This study will focus on additive effects of LLL therapy on knee&#xD;
      OA patients for improving pain and function. This study will provide an insight in&#xD;
      traditional methods that are used in OA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. LITERATURE REVIEW: Osteoarthritis is the most common form arthritis which is overall&#xD;
      ranked among 50 common sequelae of injuries and diseases. Almost 250 million people or 4% of&#xD;
      the world's population is affected by osteoarthritis. It is generally divided into primary OA&#xD;
      and secondary OA. Etiology of primary OA is not clear but some factors such as genetic&#xD;
      factor, ethnicity, age related changes and biomechanical factors play an important role. Post&#xD;
      traumatic, dysplastic, infectious, inflammatory or biomechanical etiologies are common cause&#xD;
      of secondary OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females are more affected with hand, feet and knee OA. Women are more subjected to severe&#xD;
      knee OA than men especially after menopause due to the role of estrogen. Oestrogen unmasks&#xD;
      the symptoms of OA by increasing pain sensitivity(1). According to a study male to female&#xD;
      ratio affected by OA in Pakistan is 3:8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most significant symptom of knee OA is pain leading to increased physical inactivity which&#xD;
      increases body weight and predispose the person to OA. Obesity is also a risk factor for&#xD;
      developing knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain in knee OA also reduces strength in quadriceps muscle. Quadriceps weakness in OA may be&#xD;
      associated with the action of quadriceps during gait. Shock absorption at the knee is&#xD;
      provided by eccentric contraction of quadriceps. The spontaneous loading at the knee&#xD;
      resulting from inability to compensate the large compressive forces leads to quadriceps&#xD;
      weakness and osteoarthritic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of evidence shows that exercise reduces the symptoms of OA and improves the knee&#xD;
      joint function. However the most advantageous type or combination of exercises is uncertain.&#xD;
      Physical inactivity and disuse of the affected limb result in loss of flexibility around knee&#xD;
      joint leading to impaired joint mechanics and increased clinical findings of pain.&#xD;
      Participation in physical activity and exercise has been recorded to improve joint function&#xD;
      and beneficial for the treatment of knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy interventions for knee OA include electrical stimulation, manual therapy,&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, ultrasound, interferential current therapy, laser therapy and&#xD;
      orthotic devices. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) has been widely used for relieving pain in&#xD;
      many&#xD;
&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders. It has been considered as non-invasive and safe treatment for knee&#xD;
      OA due its stimulatory effect on tissue metabolism and ability to regulate inflammatory&#xD;
      process after injury Osteoarthritis is more common in females as compared to males. Pain,&#xD;
      joint stiffness and reduced physical activity are prominent symptoms of knee OA. Genetic&#xD;
      factors, reduced BMI, overweight, age related physical changes and quadriceps weakness are&#xD;
      considered risk factors for knee OA. Physical inactivity disturbs the knee biomechanics and&#xD;
      increases the symptoms of knee OA. Studies show that exercise helps to improve the symptoms&#xD;
      of knee OA and enhance physical function. Low level laser therapy is non-invasive and&#xD;
      painless therapeutic modality used for treating knee OA. Evidence proves that LLLT helps in&#xD;
      relieving pain of OA and improving microcirculation due to its stimulatory effect on tissue&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
