  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While eating disorders in males are often overlooked, up to 7 million men in the United&#xD;
      States will experience an Eating Disorder in their lifetime. Critically, men are less likely&#xD;
      to seek treatment for an Eating Disorder compared to females. Therefore, prevention programs&#xD;
      that target male-specific Eating Disorder risk factors prior to the development of an eating&#xD;
      or appearance-related disorder are crucial in reducing eating disorders in this population.&#xD;
      Preliminary work by our group established the initial efficacy of a novel program, the Body&#xD;
      Project: More than Muscles (MTM) compared to assessment-only control. This study will&#xD;
      replicate and extend this research by comparing MTM to a time and attention-matched control&#xD;
      used in previous eating disorder prevention work, media advocacy (MA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although often overlooked, Eating Disorders in men are a serious and deadly public health&#xD;
      problem, affecting up to 7 million men in the United States. Efficacious, promulgated Eating&#xD;
      Disorder treatments largely remain unknown, particularly for males. Over recent decades, men&#xD;
      have faced increasing social pressures to obtain an unrealistically lean and muscular&#xD;
      physique, which have contributed to body dissatisfaction and unhealthy eating and weight&#xD;
      control behaviors among men, including symptoms of both Eating Disorders and muscle&#xD;
      dysmorphia (body image disturbance characterized by the unhealthy pursuit of muscularity.&#xD;
      Despite the impairment and distress associated with these conditions, males are less likely&#xD;
      to seek treatment than females, in part due to stigma. Importantly, for those men who do seek&#xD;
      help, existing treatments are targeted mostly towards females, rarely address male-specific&#xD;
      risk factors, and are ineffective for over 50% of patients. Thus, well-accepted, easily&#xD;
      replicable preventative programs that target male-specific Eating Disorder risk factors prior&#xD;
      to disorder onset are critical to reduce the public health burden and disparities associated&#xD;
      with eating disorders in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research supports that for men, pressures from media, friends, partners, and family to pursue&#xD;
      a lean, muscular body can lead to body-ideal internalization -- the belief that one's&#xD;
      self-worth and value are defined by physical appearance. This can lead to dissatisfaction&#xD;
      with muscularity and body fat, which in turn, contributes to eating disorder and muscle&#xD;
      dysmorphia-related attitudes and behaviors. Thus, targeting internalization of the lean,&#xD;
      muscular ideal portrayed in media culture would be important for reducing both Eating&#xD;
      Disorder and muscle dysmorphia symptoms for men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While studies have targeted body-ideal internalization in groups of women using&#xD;
      dissonance-based interventions, until recently, no programs had been developed to address&#xD;
      internalization of the lean, muscular body ideal for men. Our group recently developed and&#xD;
      evaluated the Body Project: More than Muscles (MTM) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      target eating disorder and muscle dysmorphia risk factors in body-dissatisfied men. Results&#xD;
      demonstrated significantly greater decreases in body-ideal internalization, dietary&#xD;
      restraint, drive for muscularity, bulimic symptoms (e.g., binge eating, self-induced&#xD;
      vomiting, laxatives, fasting, and/or excessive exercise), and muscle dysmorphia symptoms for&#xD;
      men in the MTM intervention compared to assessment-only controls, both pre- to&#xD;
      post-intervention and at 1-month follow-up. Further, body-ideal internalization mediated&#xD;
      intervention outcomes for bulimic and muscle dysmorphia symptoms, supporting that the&#xD;
      intervention's effects were exerted through reducing internalization of lean, muscular ideal&#xD;
      images portrayed in media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While initial results for MTM are promising, prior to disseminating this program to a wider&#xD;
      audience, the present study will replicate and extend effects observed in the previous trial&#xD;
      by comparing the intervention to a time- and attention-matched media advocacy (MA) active&#xD;
      control condition used in previous Eating Disorder prevention programs. The present study&#xD;
      will also explore the impact of MTM on additional risk factors for Eating Disorders and&#xD;
      muscle dysmorphia in men not explicitly included in the previous RCT including unhealthy&#xD;
      exercise, self- and other-objectification, appearance- and performance-enhancing drug (APED)&#xD;
      use, and overall levels of depression, stress, and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the present study will provide critical support to help translate research on&#xD;
      Eating Disorders and muscle dysmorphia in men into evidence-based prevention of these&#xD;
      problems. MTM represents a novel approach to eating disorder prevention in this underserved&#xD;
      population. This intervention has potential for wide dissemination, as peer-led interventions&#xD;
      in women have demonstrated comparable impact to professional-led interventions. Further, if&#xD;
      effects for MTM replicate, future research could adapt online or web-based versions of the&#xD;
      program to help disseminate this program to a wider audience of men across the country. Thus,&#xD;
      if results support the intervention's efficacy, this could lead to the expanded delivery of&#xD;
      the intervention into university-based or online effectiveness trials to help prevent Eating&#xD;
      Disorders and reduce body dissatisfaction for men at a national level.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will briefly be screened for eligibility criteria by phone. Eligible participants will be assessed using two structured clinical interviews (SCID-5 &amp; EPSI-CRV) and complete a set of self-report measures at baseline. Following assessment participants will be randomized into one of two groups. One group will receive a dissonance-based intervention known as the More than Muscles (MTM), while other participants will engage in a Media Advocacy (MA) active control. Participants will complete the same set of self-report measures from baseline, after their final group, at 1-month follow-up and at 6-month follow-up.

    <description>MA content generally centers on acknowledging and discussing the role the media has on shaping body image ideals. Session 1: In session 1, similar to MTM, the primary activities will include: (1) describing the ideal body for men in our culture, (2) discussing how the media impacts this ideal, with a particular focus on advertising. Following this, participants will (3) watch a video on how the media influences body image among men, and the consequences of internalizing these messages. Session 2: In session 2, content will continue by further discussion of the video showed in session 1, with participants sharing their reactions. Next, the group discusses the attainability of the ideal as well as discusses other forms of media (e.g., social media) and how it impacts body image.</description>
