  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster-Randomized Clinical trial, which includes the development and activation of an&#xD;
      intervention program among young adolescents and their parents. Adolescents will be the&#xD;
      &quot;change agents&quot; and will receive activities and assignments to complete together with their&#xD;
      parents, as a mean for increasing parental involvement in the program. Study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the intervention program will yield improvement in adolescents whose parents&#xD;
      participated in the program, in comparison with the adolescents whose parents weren't&#xD;
      involved in the intervention. Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be&#xD;
      filled out by the participants before, immediately after, and three months after the&#xD;
      completion of the program. The questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good&#xD;
      psychometric qualities. The study protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional&#xD;
      review board. Parents of all participants, in the intervention and in the control group,&#xD;
      received information about the program and the study and were asked to provide informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early adolescent (10-13 years) is characterized by hormonal changes and accelerated&#xD;
      physiological growth. Significant risk factors for the physical and mental health of children&#xD;
      and adolescents include, among other things, disordered eating patterns, overweight and&#xD;
      reduced physical activity, low self-esteem and negative body image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;In Favor of Myself&quot; is a preventive intervention program. The program's primary goal is to&#xD;
      increase adolescents' self-esteem and to prevent negative self-image and body image, as well&#xD;
      as to development media literacy. In this study, the investigators will focus on the &quot;Young&#xD;
      In Favor of Myself &quot; program, designed for ages 10-12, grades 5 and 6, and its main core is&#xD;
      the development of self-care. To increase the effect of &quot;Young In Favor of Myself &quot; program&#xD;
      on the adolescents, the investigators have developed a parental component in addition to the&#xD;
      school-based activities. The adolescent participants will receive activities and assignments&#xD;
      to complete together with their parents, making them the &quot;change agents&quot;, with a goal of&#xD;
      increasing parental involvement in the program. The study will first assess the parents'&#xD;
      influence on the program, and then evaluate the difference in adolescent outcomes from the&#xD;
      program with or without this supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the adolescent&#xD;
      participants before, immediately after, and three months after the completion of the program.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good psychometric qualities.&#xD;
      Parents will complete a satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the program. The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board. Parents of all&#xD;
      participants, in the intervention and in the control group, received information about the&#xD;
      program and the study and were asked to provide informed consent.&#xD;
