      This study was planned as a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the&#xD;
      effect of evidence-based skin care interventions and hydrocolloid dressings in preventing&#xD;
      nasogastric induced pressure injuries in critically ill patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care patients in whom a large number of medical devices are applied during the&#xD;
      treatment and care process are at risk for medical device-related pressure injuries.One of&#xD;
      the most common medical tools applied to these patients is the nasogastric tube.These tubes,&#xD;
      which are applied to provide nasal decompression and enteral nutrition, cause pressure&#xD;
      injuries in the nasal mucosa and nasal wings of the patients.These wounds prevent the patient&#xD;
      from feeding, delay the healing process by causing the nasogastric tube to be pulled, delay&#xD;
      the healing process, cause the patient to experience discomfort and pain by re-inserting the&#xD;
      tube from the other nostril, and increase the cost of treatment and care.Guidelines for&#xD;
      prevention of pressure injuries, which include evidence-based recommendations, report that&#xD;
      these wounds can be prevented with evidence-based skin care interventions and hydrocolloid&#xD;
      dressings. This study was planned as a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      determine the effect of evidence-based skin care interventions and hydrocolloid dressings in&#xD;
      preventing nasogastric induced pressure injuries in critically ill patients. In the&#xD;
      literature, there is no study evaluating the effect of evidence-based skin care and / or&#xD;
      hydrocolloid dressings on pressure injuries caused by nasogastric tube. Therefore, a study&#xD;
      demonstrating that hydrocolloid dressing reduce pressure injuries to the nasal arch due to&#xD;
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation were referenced in the sample calculation. In the sample&#xD;
      selection, it was determined that the rate of pressure injury (n: 27/49) developed more in&#xD;
      those who did not use hydrocolloids than those who were used (n: 6/73). In the sample&#xD;
      calculation made in the G * Power (3.1.9.2) program, it was determined that a total of 56&#xD;
      patients, including at least 28 patients in each study group, should be included in the&#xD;
      sample. It was predicted that 20% of the sample could be lost during the data collection&#xD;
      process, and in this study, which was planned with three arms (control, skin care,&#xD;
      hydrocolloid dressing), it was determined that the research sample should be 102, with at&#xD;
      least 34 patients on each arm. The patients included in the study will be assigned to the&#xD;
      experimental group (skin care, hydrocolloid dressing) and control group by balanced block&#xD;
      randomization method according to the randomization list in a ratio of 1: 1:1. In the study,&#xD;
      block randomization was performed by a statistician based on the patients age. The final&#xD;
      evaluation of the patients included in the study will be made on the day of the wound in&#xD;
      those with pressure sores. In other patients, it will be performed on the 18th day of the&#xD;
      nasogastric tube, considering the literature data that pressure injuries occur within 2-7 and&#xD;
      11 ± 6.17 days after tube insertion. For those whose nasogastric tube is removed before the&#xD;
      18th day, the last follow-up will be done on the day the tube is removed. For the&#xD;
      implementation of the study, permission was obtained from the ethics committee of Republic of&#xD;
      Turkey Ministry of Health, Turkey Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency Ethics&#xD;
      Committee, and work permit was obtained from Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical&#xD;
      Faculty Hospital Chief Physician. Patients/patient guardian included in the study sample will&#xD;
      be informed before the study that the purpose of the study and participation in the study is&#xD;
      in line with the principle of volunteering, and &quot;Informing and Consent of Volunteers Consent&#xD;

           curve, Skewness and Kurtosis test, and when the data show normal distribution,&#xD;
