    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of flotetuzumab for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with blood cancers (hematological malignancies) that have spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (advanced) and have come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does&#xD;
      not respond to treatment (refractory). Flotetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (recommended phase 2 dose, RP2D) of flotetuzumab,&#xD;
      when given as a single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of flotetuzumab in CD123-positive advanced acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Cohort A) and other hematological malignancies (Cohort B), by&#xD;
      evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, and duration of&#xD;
      the toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain preliminary estimates of remission; (complete remission [CR], complete remission&#xD;
      with incomplete count recovery [CRi], complete remission with partial hematological recovery&#xD;
      [CRh] or morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS] in Cohort A or CR/molecular response [MR] in&#xD;
      Cohort B) rate and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate 1-year overall survival. III. Evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) status in&#xD;
      responders in the ALL cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the percentage of patients who receive subsequent allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine immune profile pre- and post-treatment with flotetuzumab. II. Assess the&#xD;
      association between CD123 expression and tumor response. III. Assess the association between&#xD;
      alterations in tumor genetic or microenvironment with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess cytokine levels during therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive flotetuzumab via continuous intravenous (IV) infusion on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD)/partial remission (PR) (Cohort A) or&#xD;
      PR/clinical improvement (CI) (Cohort B), receive an additional induction cycle. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve PR (Cohort A) or PR/CI/major molecular response (MMR) (Cohort B) after cycle 2&#xD;
      re-induction, may continue induction therapy for up to 4 more cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients who achieve CR/CRi/CRh/MLFS (Cohort A) or CR/MR (Cohort B)&#xD;
      after cycle 1 or cycle 2 of induction therapy, receive flotetuzumab via continuous IV&#xD;
      infusion on days 1-28 for up to 5 and 6 cycles, respectively, in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR (Cohort A) or PR/CI/MMR (Cohort B) who&#xD;
      have received up to 6 cycles of induction therapy may receive up to 2 cycles of consolidation&#xD;
      therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUPPORTIVE CARE: Patients also receive acetaminophen orally (PO) or ibuprofen PO every 8&#xD;
      hours for 48 hours, diphenhydramine or equivalent IV or PO every 8 hours for 48 hours,&#xD;
      ranitidine or equivalent IV every 8 hours for 48 hours, and dexamethasone IV up to 30 minutes&#xD;
      prior to dosing and then at 12 hours after dosing on week 1 days 1 and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for 1 year.&#xD;

                  (HCT) more than 100 days are allowed if no active graft versus host disease&#xD;
                  (GVHD) &gt; grade 1, not actively on systemic immunosuppressive therapy and off&#xD;
                  calcineurin inhibitors for at least 4 weeks prior to start therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, within 14 days prior to Day 1 of&#xD;
             protocol therapy. Maintenance-type ALL chemotherapies, including vincristine and&#xD;
             mercaptopurine are allowed up to 7 days before starting therapy. High dose steroids&#xD;
             are allowed up to 3 days before starting therapy. Cytoreduction with hydroxyurea is&#xD;
             allowed to control leukocytosis until to the day of starting therapy. Hydroxyurea can&#xD;
             be given during cycle 1 of flotetuzumab administration to control leukocytosis but&#xD;
             need to be discussed with the study PI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with immunotherapeutic agents (for example chimeric antigen&#xD;
             receptor [CAR] T cells, long acting bispecific antibodies, etc) in the 28 days period&#xD;
             prior to study drug administration on Day 1 Cycle 1, with the exception of short-half&#xD;
             bispecific antibodies (blinatumomab) where the washout period is only 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement, at the time of study entry, for concurrent steroid &gt; 10 mg/day of oral&#xD;
             prednisone or the equivalent, except steroid inhaler, nasal spray or ophthalmic&#xD;
             solution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of immunosuppressant medications (other than steroid as noted above) in the 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to study drug administration (Cycle 1 Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known central nervous system involvement. Patients with suspected CNS involvement must&#xD;
             be evaluated by lumbar puncture and be free of CNS disease prior to study entry.&#xD;
             Previously treated CNS involvement is allowed provided adequate treatment has been&#xD;
             provided and the patient is free of CNS disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to flotetuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active untreated autoimmune disorders (with the exception of vitiligo)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would preclude sufficient understanding to&#xD;
             provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second primary malignancy that requires active therapy. Adjuvant hormonal therapy is&#xD;
             allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active uncontrolled infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant pulmonary compromise&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable angina or clinically significant heart disease (left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction &lt; 50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major trauma or surgery within 4 weeks before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant uncontrolled illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical&#xD;
             study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to&#xD;
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to&#xD;
             feasibility/logistics)&#xD;
