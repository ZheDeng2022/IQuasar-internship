      A single center, open label, randomized, single-dose, two period, Two way cross-over study to&#xD;
      explore the Bioequivalence of Test Product Xaroban (Rivaroxaban) 20 mg Tablet with the&#xD;
      reference product Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) 20 mg tablet under fed conditions in healthy&#xD;
      Pakistani male subjects. Subjects will receive one single dose per treatment period separated&#xD;
      by a wash-out period of 7 days. Blood samples will be taken up to 48hours post-dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single oral administrations of study drug in two periods separated by a washout period of 07&#xD;
      days. Subjects will take their assigned study medication orally, together with 240 mL of&#xD;
      ambient temperature water, at least 1 hour after start of the meal at their scheduled dosing&#xD;
      time-point. Total duration of treatment of study drug will be of 58 hours comprising 10 hours&#xD;
      prior drug administration until 48 hours post dose in each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters include Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations at the given sampling&#xD;
      times. In each period 16 blood samples for plasma Rivaroxaban concentrations will be taken on&#xD;
      Day 2, Day 3 and Day 4 including 0.00 hour pre dose and post dose at 0.25, 0.5, 1.00, 1.50,&#xD;
      2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.5, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 24.00, 36.00 and 48.00 hours.&#xD;
