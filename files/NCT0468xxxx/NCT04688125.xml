  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation are common treatment&#xD;
      modalities for obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and chronic alveolar&#xD;
      hypoventilation from a variety of causes. Use of positive airway pressure (PAP) requires use&#xD;
      of an interface, commonly referred to as a &quot;mask.&quot; There are a range of mask options&#xD;
      available, differing in configuration and sizing, including masks that fit into the nostrils&#xD;
      (nasal pillows, NP), cover the nose (nasal masks, NM), cover both the nose and the mouth&#xD;
      (oronasal masks, ONM), and rarely those that fit into the mouth (oral masks, OM) or over the&#xD;
      entire face. The variety of masks, sizes, and materials result from the wide variety of&#xD;
      facial configurations and patient preferences along with requirements to provide a good seal&#xD;
      for varying pressure requirements. Failure to find a good match for a given patient may&#xD;
      result in significant side effects, such as eye irritation owing to leak into the eyes, skin&#xD;
      pressure sores, noise generation, and inadequate therapy when air leaks are extreme. Pressure&#xD;
      sores, mask dislodgement, claustrophobic complaints, air leaks, and sore eyes occur in 20-50%&#xD;
      of patients with OSA receiving PAP, and these effects negatively correlate with PAP&#xD;
      compliance. Furthermore, several trials point to differences in compliance related to which&#xD;
      types of masks are utilized. In a randomized cross-over trial, compliance was 1 hour more per&#xD;
      night in patients using NM compared to those using ONM.1 In another, NPs were associated with&#xD;
      fewer adverse effects and better subjective sleep quality than NMs.2 Therefore, failure to&#xD;
      find an acceptable mask results in lower or non-compliance, and therefore treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, finding a right mask is performed either using crude templates, or via an&#xD;
      iterative process, variably guided by experts in mask fitting. There are no standard&#xD;
      certifications or algorithms to guide mask fitting. Given the above, it would be very&#xD;
      desirable to find a reliable method to reduce the errors in mask fitting so that the costs,&#xD;
      inconvenience, and suffering are all reduced.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited from Mayo Clinic sleep medicine practices who have completed&#xD;
      testing and are initiating PAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity&#xD;
      hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), or central sleep apnea syndrome (CSA). Testing will be&#xD;
      performed for clinical reasons on patients referred for evaluation for sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing. Testing is at the clinician's discretion and can be either polysomnography or home&#xD;
      sleep apnea tests. Patients meeting inclusion and not meeting exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will be randomized into one of two groups: the Active group or the&#xD;
      Usual Care. A member of the study team register each patient to use the MyMask™ mobile&#xD;
      application to take facial measurements and generate mask recommendations. The patient will&#xD;
      then be provided with a list recommendations and will be invited to use this list to select&#xD;
      their mask from their durable medical equipment company. This is the differentiating part of&#xD;
      the study, with the recommendation for a mask being decided by the patient's group&#xD;
      assignment. The recommendation for masks may or may not be different from the one written on&#xD;
      initial prescription. After the initial visit at the study center, all participants will also&#xD;
      be contacted for a follow-up call and will also be asked to complete brief online surveys,&#xD;
      one after 40 days and one after 90 days following the first visit.&#xD;
