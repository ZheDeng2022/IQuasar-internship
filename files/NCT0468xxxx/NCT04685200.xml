    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare chronic liver disease. It affects the bile ducts of&#xD;
      the&#xD;
&#xD;
      liver. It can result in bile duct infections, cirrhosis, cancer, and end stage liver disease.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the biological causes of primary sclerosing cholangitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who have primary sclerosing cholangitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood, saliva, urine, and stool samples. They will have nasal swabs.&#xD;
      They will complete surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get an intravenous (IV) catheter. A plastic tube is inserted into an arm&#xD;
      vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a colonoscopy. A tube with a video camera at the end is inserted into&#xD;
      the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an upper endoscopy. A scope with a light and camera at its tip is used&#xD;
      to look inside the upper digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a liver biopsy, entering through the chest wall or a neck vein. Blood&#xD;
      is drawn from a blood vessel that carries blood to the liver. A liver tissue sample is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging or spectroscopy. They will get a contrast&#xD;
      agent through an IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have an optional bone marrow aspiration. A large needle is inserted into the&#xD;
      hip to withdraw marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a liver ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a 3-day food diary. They will have a nutrition assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give contact details for people who live with them, to also take part in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-site, small-scale prospective natural history study, we intend to recruit up&#xD;
      to 40 patients with PSC diagnosed by standard clinical, biochemical, or imaging features&#xD;
      (including up to 30 with a known diagnosis of IBD) and up to 90 controls. Evaluation of&#xD;
      subjects with PSC and of controls, as well as all study related procedures will take place at&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with PSC&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to obtain epidemiological as well as bio-samples from multiple body compartments&#xD;
      presumably involved in development and progression of PSC. These will include the nasal and&#xD;
      oral cavities, small bowel, colon, portal and systemic venous circulation, bile duct system&#xD;
      and liver, and optionally bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to collect epidemiological data as well as blood samples, nasal swabs, salivary&#xD;
      samples and stool samples from family members and cohabitants of subjects affected with PSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All or part of samples will be interrogated using cutting edge research methodologies which&#xD;
      may include quantitative immunophenotyping via mass cytometry, microRNA sequencing of targets&#xD;
      of interest, metagenomic sequencing, and other high throughput &quot;omics&quot; techniques. The robust&#xD;
      datasets generated from these multi-omics investigations will be integrated and mined using&#xD;
      advanced bioinformatics tools by leading experts in the field.&#xD;
