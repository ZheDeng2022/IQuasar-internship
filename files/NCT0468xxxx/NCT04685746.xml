  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a vestibular dysfunction occurs at birth or in early stages of life, one might expect&#xD;
      that this may have an enormous impact on a child's development. It is known that a severe&#xD;
      congenital or early acquired vestibular deficit in children results in delayed psychomotor&#xD;
      milestones. Later in life, children with a vestibular dysfunction may have difficulties with&#xD;
      several balance tasks and additional cognitive, motor and/or psychosocial performances. While&#xD;
      a few authors have suggested that there is indeed an influence of a vestibular dysfunction&#xD;
      upon these different developmental domains (cognitive, motor, educational and psychosocial&#xD;
      development), which can be supported by findings in clinical practice as well, literature&#xD;
      concerning this topic remains fairly limited. On the other hand, several studies have shown&#xD;
      that children with known difficulties in motor and/or cognitive functions have more&#xD;
      difficulties in vestibular performances in comparison with their unaffected peers. Although&#xD;
      more frequently discussed, the literature on this population is rather scarce too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the current project aims to investigate the relationship with and the involvement&#xD;
      of the vestibular system in the motor and cognitive development of school-aged children.&#xD;

      General goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Developing and standardizing a sensitive and specific test protocol for the detection of&#xD;
           vestibular, cognitive and/or motor dysfunctions in school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the relationship with and the involvement of the vestibular system in the&#xD;
           motor and cognitive development of typically developing school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigating whether a vestibular dysfunction (with/without an additional auditory&#xD;
           disease) has an impact on motor and/or cognitive performances in school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigating if in children with a known neurodevelopmental disorder an (additional)&#xD;
           underlying vestibular dysfunction can be identified.&#xD;
