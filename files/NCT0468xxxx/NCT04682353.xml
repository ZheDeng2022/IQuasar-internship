  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      Medroxyprogesterone acetate following subcutaneous administration of 3 different doses of&#xD;
      TV-46046 and a dose of Depo-subQ Provera in healthy female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate and compare the safety, local&#xD;
      tolerability, and acceptability of a subcutaneous injection of 3 different doses of TV-46046&#xD;
      and a dose of Depo-subQ Provera in healthy female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study for each participant is expected to be up to 19.5 months.&#xD;
