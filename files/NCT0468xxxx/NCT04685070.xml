    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have completed the neoadjuvant treatment before operation and have achieved CR or PR as confirmed by CT evaluation in all patients.</description>

    <measure>Major pathologic response (MPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>MPR is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved major pathologic response (on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, tumors with no more than 10% viable tumor cells) in all participants who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy before surgery.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as the time from random enrollment to death of participant due to any cause. In the case of a patient who still survives at the time of analysis, the date of last contact will be taken as the censoring date.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>It refers to the time from the first administration of HS-10296 in this study to the disease progression or death (including any cause of death in fthe case of no progression) as recorded in CRF, regardless of whether the patient exits from the treatment or receives other anti-cancer treatment before progression.</description>
