      Case control study Clinical symptoms, speech behavior test, EEG data, near-infrared brain&#xD;
      imaging data and facial expression data are collected from three groups of subjects&#xD;
      (consolidation/maintenance depression patient group, acute episode depression patient group&#xD;
      and healthy alternatives), In terms of magnetic resonance data and other aspects, compare the&#xD;
      similarities and differences of the data of the three groups of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up research The acute-onset patient group will receive follow-up every two weeks for&#xD;
      three months, and then continue in June, September, December, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;
      Consolidation/maintenance patients and healthy patients will receive follow-up evaluations in&#xD;
      March, June, September, December, 18 and 24 months after enrollment. The content includes&#xD;
      clinical symptom assessment, behavioral testing, EEG testing, near infrared testing, etc. The&#xD;
      time points of cranial imaging detection are 0, March, December and 24 months. In the&#xD;
      laboratory, if the subject agrees to collect language information in the patient's real life&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and inspection items&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical scale evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Speech Behavior Test Using speech production paradigm, semantic feature task, emotional&#xD;
           prosody perception paradigm and emotional vocabulary paradigm to comprehensively detect&#xD;
           the language perception, comprehension and output of patients with depression to find&#xD;
           objective indicators of speech mutation. Voice detection includes short-term energy&#xD;
           (Max, Min, Mean), pitch (Max, Min, Mean), voice speed, number of voice interruptions,&#xD;
           short-term zero-crossing rate (Max, Min, Mean), first formant, first Two formants,&#xD;
           12-order MFCC (12 coefficients) and other parameters. The experiment is carried out in a&#xD;
           well-lit and quiet room. Before the experiment, the subject will explain the experiment&#xD;
           process to the subjects. After the experiment, in order to avoid interference, the&#xD;
           subject should leave the room. The whole process of the experiment was in the same&#xD;
           computer program, and the subjects responded according to the task requirements on the&#xD;
           screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Speech and video production paradigm The speech and video output paradigm used in&#xD;
           this study includes five tasks: interview, short text reading, recitation, picture&#xD;
           description and video viewing. The video viewing task is only used for facial video data&#xD;
           collection. The experiment is written and run using E-prime 2.0 software. Participants&#xD;
           completed five speech production tasks accordingly, and recorded their voices and facial&#xD;
           expressions throughout the experiment to obtain speech and video data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Semantic processing tasks The semantic processing task is used to compare the&#xD;
           abilities of depressed patients and healthy subjects in speech processing, semantic&#xD;
           coding and extraction, and speech fluency, and explore more comprehensively the early&#xD;
           warning indicators of the recurrence of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Magnetic resonance examination The Siemens 3.0T magnetic resonance scanner is used,&#xD;
           which is a 32-channel head coil. Before scanning, use a foam cushion to fix the head to&#xD;
           avoid head movement during scanning. The scanning sequence is: first routine scan to&#xD;
           obtain the T1-weighted positioning image of the whole brain 3D structure, then use the&#xD;
           fast gradient echo imaging sequence to perform sagittal scan of the whole brain for&#xD;
           three-dimensional reconstruction and spatial registration, and finally use plane echo (&#xD;
           EPI) sequence for blood oxygen dependent BOLD-fMRI imaging (resting state and task&#xD;
           state).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functional near infrared spectroscopy Using Shimadzu lighnirs portable near-infrared&#xD;
           brain imager, the sampling rate was set to 0.1s, and the oxygenated hemoglobin&#xD;
           concentration (HbO), deoxyhemoglobin concentration (HbR) and total oxygen content (HbT)&#xD;
           were used as measurement indicators. Since language processing is mainly in the frontal&#xD;
           and temporal lobes, the probe layout covers the lateral fronto-temporal complex area.&#xD;
           After the fNIRS test, a 3D locator is used to locate the brain area. The positions of&#xD;
           the transmitter and the detector will be referenced to the Brodmann partition, and the&#xD;
           fNIRS channel position will be registered with the probability of the MNI space. The&#xD;
           subjects in the fNIRS examination need to complete the speech output paradigm and&#xD;
           semantic feature tasks. The experiment adopts a block design, the stimulation sequence&#xD;
           is written by E-prime software, and the stimulation program programmed by the computer&#xD;
           is presented on the computer display screen (approximately 55cm from the subject).&#xD;
           Before the start of the experiment, the subjects should wear an optode cap to ensure&#xD;
           that the signals of each channel are received normally. At the beginning of the&#xD;
           experiment, the screen showed &quot;+&quot;, and the subjects only need to watch the screen and&#xD;
           try to stay calm as much as possible; then complete the relevant behavioral tests, and&#xD;
           the subjects can complete according to the instructions. The entire experiment lasted&#xD;
           about 25 minutes. The subjects collected near-infrared brain signals and voice data&#xD;
           online while completing the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EEG examination Use Brainproducts liveamp portable EEG equipment to conduct EEG&#xD;
           examination in two stages: resting state and voice task state. In the resting state EEG&#xD;
           collection stage, after the subjects put on the EEG collection equipment, sit on a&#xD;
           comfortable chair, close their eyes and stay awake, and collect the resting EEG for 5&#xD;
           minutes. In the voice task stage, the subject wears an EEG device and sits in front of&#xD;
           the computer screen. According to the instructions displayed on the screen, the voice&#xD;
           production paradigm and semantic feature tasks are performed accordingly. The microphone&#xD;
           will simultaneously record the subject's voice. The experimental program is written&#xD;
           using e-prime2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Other physiological tests Physiological indicators (including heart rate, blood&#xD;
           pressure, weight, height, etc.), environmental indicators (including weather,&#xD;
           temperature, environmental noise, ultraviolet intensity, human comfort, etc.), Cambridge&#xD;
           Neuropsychological Test Automatic Battery (CANTAB) The gait test during natural walking,&#xD;
           the eye movement during task and facial expression information will be performed once in&#xD;
           baseline, March, June, September, December, 18 and 24 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Feasibility and specificity analysis of multiple detection methods This study uses&#xD;
           multiple detection methods, including clinical scale evaluation, language testing, and&#xD;
           neurophysiological examination. The purpose is to comprehensively and systematically&#xD;
           collect subjects' linguistic related information to better develop and develop voice&#xD;
           intelligent detection technology. application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple detection methods are feasible. Clinical scales are implemented by trained&#xD;
      researchers, language-related paradigms are implemented by computer programs, and&#xD;
      neurophysiological testing techniques are operated by experimenters. All detection methods&#xD;
      and methods are widely used in clinical research and are feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan, definition and selection of statistical analysis data set&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical analysis data set Full analysis set (FAS, Full analysis set): People who&#xD;
           have undergone at least one clinical scale evaluation, voice collection,&#xD;
           neurophysiological data, and major index evaluation data after enrollment. Cases with&#xD;
           missing baseline data for the main evaluation indicators will be excluded.&#xD;

           inclusion and exclusion criteria, have a valid baseline value, have good compliance, and&#xD;
           do not violate the clinical research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The curative effect analysis uses both the full analysis set and the conforming plan&#xD;
           set, and the FAS result is the main one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data description Observe whether the data conforms to the normal distribution, if not,&#xD;
           modify the statistical method or perform data conversion. Observe whether there are&#xD;
           outliers and missing values, and perform statistical and professional analysis to&#xD;
           determine the choice and the way of filling the missing values. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
           indicate the mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, credible interval, frequency,&#xD;
           composition ratio, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical inference methods Measurement data adopt t test, paired t test, rank sum&#xD;
           test, paired rank sum test, median test and other methods. Counting data: Chi-square&#xD;
           test, Fisher's exact test, etc.; grade data using Ridit analysis, CMH method. Use&#xD;
           machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Dynamic Bayesian&#xD;
           Network (DBN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for speech and video data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical expression The report is mainly expressed in tables, with table titles,&#xD;
           table notes, and number of cases. In addition to the statistical results of the&#xD;
           comparison between the groups, the statistical parameter diagrams and other icons are&#xD;
           attached to increase the readability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical software Use SPSS22.0, Matlab software (v2014a) and NIRS-SPM (Statistical&#xD;
           Parametric Mapping for Near-infrared Spectroscopy) software for parameter statistics&#xD;
           (t-test, analysis of variance, etc.) and non-parametric statistics (rank sum test,&#xD;
           chi-square test) Etc.), using two-sided tests, P less than or equal to 0.05 is&#xD;
           considered statistically significant.&#xD;
