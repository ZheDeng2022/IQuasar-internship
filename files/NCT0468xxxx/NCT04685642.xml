  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-year study will enroll 180 patients with mood disorders (90 patients with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder and 90 patients with bipolar disorder) and high pro-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      levels. They will be randomly assigned to three groups of aspirin, statin and control groups&#xD;
      for 12 weeks according to the disease group. The first aim of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of aspirin and statin in mood disorders. The second aim is to establish a&#xD;
      gene-immuno-brain imaging treatment prediction model by deep learning technology, using&#xD;
      pretreatment cytokines, neurocognitive function, brain structural/functional connectivity,&#xD;
      and telomere length as the predictors.&#xD;

      Multiple lines of evidence support the pathogenic role of neuro-inflammation in mood&#xD;
      disorders. Our team has published a series of papers showing the inflammatory cytokines are&#xD;
      related to severity of depressive symptoms, could be biomarkers of clinical outcomes, subtype&#xD;
      and mood phase of bipolar disorder. Compared with depressive disorder, bipolar disorder is&#xD;
      with more severe inflammatory dysregulation, which correlated to brain structure and&#xD;
      functional connectivity abnormality. Treatment non-responders tended to have higher baseline&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, suggesting that increased levels of inflammation are contributory to&#xD;
      treatment resistance. The clinical studies showed that anti-inflammatory drugs combined with&#xD;
      traditional treatments, can improve clinical outcomes, including N-Acetylcysteine,&#xD;
      infliximab, pioglitazone, celecoxib, aspirin, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,&#xD;
      minocyclin, statin, aspirin. Among them, aspirin and statin have been used for treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular metabolic disorders, which are associated with inflammation&#xD;
      dysregulation. The clinical and meta-analysis studies of aspirin and statin have shown&#xD;
      significant efficacy and good safety. Therefore, aspirin and statin have better clinical&#xD;
      feasibility and rationality for augmentation treatment in mood disorders. However, previous&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory research is mostly for individual drug studies, comparative research is&#xD;
      still quite lacking. In addition, many studies have suggested anti-inflammatory agents will&#xD;
      likely be most useful for the subpopulation of patients whose immune dysfunction is a driving&#xD;
      pathogenic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will establish a prediction model of anti-inflammatory drugs for mood&#xD;
      disorder. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated its power to learn and recognize&#xD;
      complex nonlinear hierarchical patterns based on largescale empirical data. A deep learning&#xD;
      algorithm for classification applications such as medical treatment in personalized medicine&#xD;
      is a procedure for choosing the best hypothesis from a set of alternatives that fit a set of&#xD;
      observations. Our series of studies have shown that the severity of inflammation related with&#xD;
      brain structure and functional connectivity abnormalities; which may be the outcome&#xD;
      predictors. Another possible predictor may be the chromosome telomere length. Telomeres are&#xD;
      located at the end of chromosomes and maintain normal function of chromosomes. Previous&#xD;
      studies have found that short telomere length is associated with mood disorder, as well as&#xD;
      the inflammatory dysregulation. Therefore, telomere length may be a predictor of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory treatment. The study will be the first comparative study of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory treatment, and establish gene-immuno-brain imaging individualized treatment&#xD;
      prediction model. The results will provide important scientific and clinical empirical data&#xD;
      for the inflammatory pathophysiology and treatment of mood disorders.&#xD;
