    <textblock>
      The photographical and functional parameters of paravertebral muscle in patients with lumbar&#xD;
      spinal stenosis will be measured to investigate the correlation between paravertebral muscle&#xD;
      degeneration and symptoms and prognosis of patients.By measuring the parameters of&#xD;
      paravertebral muscle with normal people, the differences between the patients and normal&#xD;
      people will be compared to establish an appropriate paravertebral muscle evaluation method.&#xD;

      It is a prospective observational study. This study will recruit 100 patients with lumbar&#xD;
      spinal stenosis who will undertake posterior lumbar decompression and fusion surgery in our&#xD;
      hospital.They all take preoperative lumbar mri examination and waist and back muscle strength&#xD;
      test as well as recording their preoperative visual analogue scale,oswestry disability index,&#xD;
      lumbar stiffness disability index score.All patients will receive a follow-up lasting for 1&#xD;
      year,and we will record patients outcomes,such as visual analogue scale,oswestry disability&#xD;
      index and lumbar stiffness disability index score at each follow-up time. At the same time,we&#xD;
      will recruit 100 healthy subjects without lumbar diseases or chronic lumbar pain. The&#xD;
      difference of their age with patients was less than 5 years. Meanwhile, lumbar dorsal muscle&#xD;
      strength test and lumbar mri examination were conducted, and visual analogue scale as well as&#xD;
      oswestry disability index and lumbar stiffness disability index score was recorded in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Participants were asked to lie prone on a plinth and lift their sternum from the plinth, raising their upper body.While maintaining this position, participants were asked to keep their arms in line with the body axis and not in contact with the plinth. Task failure was determined by a drop in the angle of trunk of greater than 10Â°at any point. The time was recorded until task failure or until the maximum contraction duration was reached (300 s).</description>
