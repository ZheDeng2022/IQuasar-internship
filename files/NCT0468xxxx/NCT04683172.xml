  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common symptom in palliative care cancer patients and is often insufficiently&#xD;
      relieved. The 2010 INCA report showed that France is not an exception to this worldwide&#xD;
      observation (synopsis of the 2010 national survey). This report shows that pain is the&#xD;
      symptom that these patients fear the most and that it dramatically impacts their quality of&#xD;
      life. These patients may experience nociceptive pain related to stimulation of sensory nerve&#xD;
      endings by the tumour. When tumour resection is impossible, a symptomatic analgesic treatment&#xD;
      is generally proposed, mainly consisting of administration of opioid analgesics. At high&#xD;
      doses, this treatment induces adverse effects, especially drowsiness and psychomotor&#xD;
      retardation that impair the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They may also experience neuropathic pain, secondary to anatomical lesions or functional&#xD;
      impairment of nerve structures (peripheral nerves or cerebral or spinal tracts) related to&#xD;
      repeated surgical procedures and/or radiotherapy. This type of pain may respond to&#xD;
      antiepileptic or antidepressant drugs. At high doses, these treatments also induce adverse&#xD;
      effects fairly similar to those observed during treatment of nociceptive pain. As these two&#xD;
      types of treatment often need to be coprescribed, these patients frequently present an almost&#xD;
      permanent state of drowsiness at the end of life, preventing all normal activities of daily&#xD;
      living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques (transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)) have been successfully&#xD;
      used to treat chronic pain. It was shown that these NIBS techniques can improve pain in&#xD;
      cancer patients in the palliative care setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tDCS appears to be more suitable than rTMS for the treatment of palliative care patients, who&#xD;
      are often difficult to mobilize, as tDCS can be delivered at the patient's bedside and&#xD;
      possibly even at home, which is not the case with rTMS. tDCS also appears to be rapidly&#xD;
      effective (after 5 sessions) in the context of cancer pain, and this effect lasts longer than&#xD;
      that of rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed treatment of refractory cancer pain by tDCS in palliative care patients is a new&#xD;
      treatment modality that is well adapted to hospitalised patients. Each patient will receive&#xD;
      20 minutes of transcranial direct-current stimulation daily for 5 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One arm will receive active stimulation and the control arm will receive sham stimulation.&#xD;
      Patients and investigators will be blinded to the type of tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By improving the patient's activities of daily living, this treatment will enable the patient&#xD;
      to return home under good conditions for both the patient and the caregivers. This treatment&#xD;
      can also be continued at home. This strategy is consistent with current guidelines in this&#xD;
      field, in which the priorities are improvement of quality of life, return home and decreased&#xD;
      workload for caregivers.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Active Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>tDCS consists of delivering a low-intensity (1 to 2 milliamperes) direct electrical current by means of a pair of electrodes (anode and cathode) applied to the scalp. Electrodes generally have a diameter (round electrode) or a diagonal (rectangular electrodes) ranging from 2 to 3.5 cm.&#xD;
To stimulate a given cortical zone, the anode is placed over of the selected zone, generally identified by means of an EEG headset (10/20 System Positioning). For the treatment of pain, the anode is placed over the primary motor cortex (M1) on the contralateral side to the pain or on the left side in patients with diffuse pain. The cathode is placed over a supposedly neutral cortical zone, usually the contralateral supraorbital cortex with respect to the anode. In this study, the stimulation intensity will be 1.5 mA using round sponge electrodes 3.5 cm in diameter.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sham Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The tDCS device has a &quot;Sham&quot; mode that allows for true placebo stimulation. A simulated session is thus designed as a real stimulation session without its effects. Sensations similar to tDCS are created by generating currents only at the start of the session.&#xD;
Same modalities as for the Active tDCS procedure will therefore be put in place: a pair of electrodes (anode and cathode) are applied to the scalp.To stimulate a given cortical zone, the anode is placed over of the selected zone, generally identified by means of an EEG headset (10/20 System Positioning). For the treatment of pain, the anode is placed over the primary motor cortex (M1) on the contralateral side to the pain or on the left side in patients with diffuse pain. The cathode is placed over a supposedly neutral cortical zone, usually the contralateral supraorbital cortex with respect to the anode.</description>
