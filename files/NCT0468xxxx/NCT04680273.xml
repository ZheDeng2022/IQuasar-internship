  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, two part study in healthy female subjects of&#xD;
      non-childbearing potential to investigate the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of&#xD;
      [14C]-GDC-9545 (Part 1), the absolute bioavailability of formulations F12 and F18 (i.e.,&#xD;
      GDC-9545/F12 capsule, 30 mg and GDC-9545/F18 capsule, 30 mg) and relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      GDC-9545 oral capsule F18 to the F12 formulation (Part 2). It is planned that Part 1 will&#xD;
      begin prior to Part 2 of the study, and that the two parts of the study will partially&#xD;
      overlap.&#xD;

             over-the-counter drugs, hormone replacement therapy [HRT], vaccines, topical&#xD;
             medications, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements), other than up&#xD;
             to 4 g of paracetamol per day, in the 14 days before IMP administration. Exceptions&#xD;
             may apply on a case by case basis, if considered not to interfere with the objectives&#xD;
             of the study, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken, oral antibiotics within 4 weeks or IV&#xD;
             antibiotics within 8 weeks prior to admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any medications/products known to alter drug&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, or elimination processes, including St. John's wort, within 30&#xD;
             days prior to admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of GI surgery (with the exception of appendectomy unless it was performed&#xD;
             within the previous 12 months) (Part 1 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute diarrhea or constipation in the 7 days before the predicted Day 1. If screening&#xD;
             occurs &gt;7 days before the Day 1, this criterion will be determined on Day 1. Diarrhea&#xD;
             will be defined as the passage of liquid feces and/or a stool frequency of greater&#xD;
             than 3 times per day. Constipation will be defined as a failure to open the bowels for&#xD;
             3 days (Part 1 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of an abnormal ECG that is clinically significant in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, including complete left bundle branch block, second- or&#xD;
             third-degree atrioventricular heart block, or evidence of prior myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QT interval corrected through use of Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;440 msec&#xD;
             demonstrated by at least two ECGs &gt;30 minutes apart&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ventricular dysrhythmias or risk factors for ventricular dysrhythmias such&#xD;
             as structural heart disease (e.g., severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left&#xD;
             ventricular hypertrophy), coronary heart disease (symptomatic or with ischemia&#xD;
             demonstrated by diagnostic testing), clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities&#xD;
             (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), or family history of sudden&#xD;
             unexplained death or long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed (e.g., 2 consecutive measurements) baseline heart rate ≤50 bpm prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with medications that are well known to prolong the QT interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.3 x 10^9/L (1300/μL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to satisfy the Investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason&#xD;
