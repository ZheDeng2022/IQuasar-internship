      This prospective randomized non-inferiority study is designed to compare the rate and&#xD;
      severity of complications after axillary and inguinal lymph node dissection in stage III&#xD;
      melanoma patients in a study group where the drain is left in place for three weeks and a&#xD;
      control group consisting of patients managed according to the standard institutional&#xD;
      protocol. Furthermore, variables associated with complications will be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive stage III melanoma patients 18 years or older referred to our institution for&#xD;
      axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection is eligible for inclusion of the study. A bipolar&#xD;
      vessel sealing device (LigaSure, Covidien) will be used for dissection in all procedures. All&#xD;
      patients will be scheduled for an outpatient visit with an experienced nurse three weeks&#xD;
      after the surgery. Any deviation from the normal postoperative course will be recorded in the&#xD;
      electronic patient journal. Complications are graded according to the Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
      classification. Patients with complications or with suspected complications at the three-week&#xD;
      follow up will be scheduled for new an outpatient visit. Patient demographics,&#xD;
      clinicopathological characteristics of the primary melanoma, indication for the procedure,&#xD;
      length of postoperative stay and early complications and treatment for complications will be&#xD;
      collected for analysis&#xD;

    <description>When the drain produces less than 100 mL over 24 hours, the self-suction bulb is removed and the drain is shortened and drained into a colostomy bag placed around the site of drain insertion. A request is filed with the community nursing system to have a visiting nurse to pull out the drain 1-2 cm per day.</description>
