  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first research study to examine the peripheral and spinal proprioceptive deficits&#xD;
      in AIS subjects in a comprehensive manner. It will determine normative values with reference&#xD;
      to age, the relationship of proprioceptive changes to curve pattern, magnitude and&#xD;
      progression, as well as whether all joints are equally affected, and thus address&#xD;
      definitively the contribution of spinal proprioception to aetiology. Furthermore, as little&#xD;
      is known about the measurement of proprioceptive sense, the present protocol from the study&#xD;
      could be a reference measurement guide for detecting the proprioceptive sense in normal&#xD;
      individuals, as well as to identify those with high risk for curve progression.&#xD;
