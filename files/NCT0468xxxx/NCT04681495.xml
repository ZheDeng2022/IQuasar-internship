  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      School interventions to reduce bullying can be effective but also require substantial time&#xD;
      and resources. Online technologies have the potential to deliver effective bullying&#xD;
      interventions to a large number of middle schools for less cost. The feasibility of&#xD;
      delivering the effective STAC bullying intervention through a mobile web app will be tested&#xD;
      using a needs analysis with school administrators, focus groups with middle school students,&#xD;
      and development and usability testing of a prototype.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While studies support the efficacy of comprehensive, school-wide interventions in reducing&#xD;
      bullying, these types of programs can require significant time and financial resources for&#xD;
      implementation, resulting in barriers to providing school-based bullying prevention,&#xD;
      especially in low-income and rural communities. Additionally, although training bystanders to&#xD;
      act as &quot;defenders&quot; on behalf of targets of bullying is an important intervention component,&#xD;
      few programs include this as part of their comprehensive strategy. Brief programs that focus&#xD;
      on bystander training and require fewer resources are needed to reduce bullying and its&#xD;
      negative consequences. The PI (Dr. Midgett) developed STAC, a brief, stand-alone bullying&#xD;
      bystander intervention for middle school students, to reduce bullying and mental health risks&#xD;
      for bystanders. Brief, in-person programs, however, still pose implementation barriers such&#xD;
      as training school personnel, providing external support, and not allowing for large groups&#xD;
      of students to be trained at the same time. For this project, we propose to develop a&#xD;
      technology-based STAC intervention (STAC-T) that will allow students to customize their&#xD;
      experience by selecting avatars and bullying scenarios based on our previous studies&#xD;
      conducted in a range of middle schools, including those in low-income and rural communities.&#xD;
      The innovative, user-centered design proposed will be inherently sensitive to cultural needs&#xD;
      of students and identify personally-appropriate strategies. The specific aims of this&#xD;
      application include conducting a needs analysis to determine product need, building a system&#xD;
      prototype leveraging prior work and expertise of an external advisory board, and usability&#xD;
      and effectiveness testing with middle school students and stakeholders to evaluate&#xD;
      feasibility. This proposal is designed to document proof of concept and finalizing design and&#xD;
      content of the system which will be developed and tested in a subsequent randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The technology-based platform will increase the overall reach, impact, and&#xD;
      sustainability of the STAC intervention for bullying prevention. It will substantially reduce&#xD;
      cost to increase reach and its interactivity and algorithms can tailor program content to&#xD;
      adapt it further for students attending low-income and rural schools. Thus, this low-cost,&#xD;
      easy to disseminate technology-based bullying bystander intervention has the potential to&#xD;
      have a substantial impact on the problem of bullying and the negative associated consequences&#xD;
      for both students who are targets and bystanders in middle school when the problem of&#xD;
      bullying peaks. There is a large market for the STAC-T intervention with approximately&#xD;
      100,000 public and private schools with middle-school grades in the United States. Globally,&#xD;
      the online education market is growing at 10% a year and the digital health market exceeds&#xD;
      $220 billion annually.&#xD;

    <description>Participant perspective of program feasibility and bullying prevention promotion. The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for measuring the usability of technologies. It consists of a 10-item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking. Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>
