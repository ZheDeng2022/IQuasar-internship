  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there is growing interest in the application of three-dimensional (3D) printed&#xD;
      bolus to radiotherapy.At present, the researches on the application of 3D-printed bolus in&#xD;
      breast cancer are mainly focused on air gap between skin and bolus or electron beam conformal&#xD;
      therapy [7,15], there are no clinical experience with customized 3D-printed bolus for&#xD;
      volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in daily practice has been published up to now. We&#xD;
      aim to evaluate dosimetry and application of 3D-printed bolus for the post-mastectomy&#xD;
      radiotherapy (PMRT) with Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Seventy five patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer receiving radiotherapy following post-mastectomy in our department were&#xD;
      randomly selected in this study. The accuracy of fit of the 3D-Printed bolus to the chest&#xD;
      wall was improved significantly relative to conventional bolus.This study demonstrates&#xD;
      customized 3D-printed bolus in post-mastectomy radiation therapy improves fit of the bolus&#xD;
      compared to conventional bolus. Furthermore, VMAT based on 3D-printed bolus significantly&#xD;
      improves the chest wall target coverage and the conformity of plan, and reduces the dose of&#xD;
      ipsilateral lung and heart, compared to conventional bolus.&#xD;

    <description>The prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were used dosimetric analysis. D98%, D50% and D2%, indicating dose to 98% (near-minimum dose), 50% and 2% (near-maximum dose) of both target volumes, and V95%, V100%, and V110% indicating percent volume receiving 95%, 100% and 110% of prescribed dose, were recorded</description>
