  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of periodontal diseases in patients has been associated to a worsened quality of&#xD;
      life overall. Many different indices have been proposed over time in order to evaluate&#xD;
      patient's centred outcomes. In particular, the most thorough questionnaire proposed so far is&#xD;
      the Oral Health Impact Profile 49 (OHIP-49), which is composed of 49 questions. Despite its&#xD;
      validity being unquestionable, OHIP-49 was found to be too time-consuming for the clinical&#xD;
      scenario and, therefore, its shortened 14-question version has been proposed. A more in-depth&#xD;
      knowledge of how these parameters change before and after periodontal treatment could enable&#xD;
      clinicians to tailor the treatment plan according to the patients' needs.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ) before and after non-surgical periodontal treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire will be carried out at baseline and re-evaluation (3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment). The change in the Brief IPQ values at baseline and after 3 months will be considered as the primary outcome measure.</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire consists of 9 questions, each one evaluated on a scale of 0 to 10 (minimum score of 0, maximum score of 90). Higher scores mean a higher patient's perception of the disease (higher scores mean worse outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oral Health Impact Profile 14 before and after non-surgical periodontal treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire will be carried out at baseline and re-evaluation (3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment). The change in the OHIP-14 values at baseline and after 3 months will be considered as the primary outcome measure.</time_frame>
    <description>14 questions about the impact of oral health on the quality of life; each question will be evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5 (minimum score of 0, maximum score of 70). Higher scores mean that patient's oral health impacts more significantly on their quality of life (higher scores, worse outcomes).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Full Mouth Bleeding Score (FMBS) before and after non-surgical periodontal treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>FMBS will be calculated at baseline and re-evaluation (3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment). The change in the FMBS at baseline and after 3 months will be considered as the secondary outcome measure.</time_frame>
    <description>Full Mouth Bleeding Score will be calculated as the percentage of sites with Bleeding on Probing on the total number of sites (percentage ranging between 0% and 100%). Higher scores of FMBS mean more periodontal inflammation and therefore worse oral health (higher scores of FMBS, worse outcomes).</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked two sets of questions:&#xD;
questionnaire about their perception of periodontal disease (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire; 9 questions, answers will be registered on a scale of 0 to 10);&#xD;
Oral Health Impact Profile 14 (OHIP-14) questionnaire.&#xD;
All these two sets of questions will be asked before and after non surgical periodontal therapy</description>
