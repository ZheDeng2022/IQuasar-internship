  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 82.1% treatment failure of post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), associated with gunshot&#xD;
      wounds, is related to high incidence of chronic pain syndrome as well as resistance to the&#xD;
      PTSD treatment. Defining treatment failure predictors among the PTSD patients with gunshot&#xD;
      extremity wounds and the following therapy would improve treatment outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been noted that the PTSD in military combatants results from their direct&#xD;
      participation in military actions. The study revealed that if a military combatant was&#xD;
      wounded during the action operation, his emotional and subjective feelings will 100% lead to&#xD;
      the PTSD. Other scientists state about the PTSD remote treatment failure in 80% of the&#xD;
      military combatants. The study evidences about 82.1% of the PTSD m-related wounds treatment&#xD;
      failure, which was essential for the subsequent studies. Some authors state about treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness of psychopharmacological drugs and psychotherapy, which is rather questionable.&#xD;
      Traumas and somatic diseases in the PTSD patients are known to accumulate their negative&#xD;
      effects. So, definition of the PTSD treatment failure predictors may improve treatment&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 218 patients completed the study. The Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD (M-PTSD) was used for assessment of the treatment outcome rate. The risk relation between treatment failure and factors was assessed by a univariate or multivariate logistic regression method, with the model accuracy measured by the AUC - Area under the ROC curve. The odds ratio (OR) was considered for the qualitative factor assessment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The treatment outcome rate was assessed by the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD (M-PTSD). A positive outcome rate is represented with the patient post-discharge positive coping, which corresponds to 94-58 points. A treatment failure is regarded as the absent PTSD treatment effect after discharge, which corresponds to 148-113 points and psychic disorders, which correspond to 112-95 points.</description>

    <description>The sedation with constant rate infusion of 1% propofol, 1-4mg/kg/h, guided by Bispectral analysis (60-70 - for regional anesthesia and 40-60 - for the general one). 0.005% fentanyl analgesia was injected, 3-10 mkg/kg or 0.05-0.2 mkg/kg/min during induction; and 2-10 mkg/kg/h for maintaining analgesia, by periodic bolus injection 25-100 mkg or by permanent infusion.&#xD;
The postoperative pain management of the I group patients was provided according to the local clinical protocol: paracetamol+/-non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs +/-opioids.&#xD;
The PTSD progress and treatment effectiveness were estimated using the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD, anesthesia risks - the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, pain intensity - the visual analogue scale, neuropathic pain component - the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questions.</description>
