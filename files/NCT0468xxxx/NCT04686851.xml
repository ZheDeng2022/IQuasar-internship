      This study aims to examine the effects of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and&#xD;
      interventions on prognosis in the older frail cancer patient in a Randomized Clinical Trial&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients screened frail with the Geriatric 8 screening tool, aged 70 or more, and found&#xD;
      eligible for oncologic treatment, will be included. We plan to enrol a total of 322 cancer&#xD;
      patients for 12 months. Participants will be allocated randomly to either interventional or&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the interventional group will be offered a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment&#xD;
      and intervention at the start-up of cancer treatment. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment&#xD;
      will be an add on to standardized cancer treatment offered at the Oncologic Outpatient Clinic&#xD;
      at Odense University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment will be performed by a team consisting of a doctor, nurse&#xD;
      and physiotherapist. If needed, referral to a dietician or an occupational therapist for&#xD;
      further evaluation will be made. The health issues are assessed using validated tests based&#xD;
      on a Danish version of the Geriatric Core Dataset (G-CODE). Follow-up on Comprehensive&#xD;
      Geriatric Assessment is scheduled for one month after initial evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized groups will be compared with respect to primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will receive standardized oncological treatment according to national guidelines. For patients randomized to the intervention arm, a full Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and corresponding interventions on identified health issues will be performed alongside oncologic treatment. The domains are assessed using validated tests based on a Danish version of the Geriatric Core Dataset (G-CODE). The domains are cognition, mood, comorbidity, functional status, physical status, polypharmacy, nutrition, fall risc and social support. The CGA will be performed by the PhD-student (geriatric resident) or a geriatrician together with geriatric nurses at the Department of Geriatric Medicine, OUH. Nutritional status and interventions are assessed by a dietician. A physical therapist will evaluate the physical performance as part of the CGA.&#xD;
Follow-up on initial treatment plan is scheduled to one month after baseline CGA.</description>
