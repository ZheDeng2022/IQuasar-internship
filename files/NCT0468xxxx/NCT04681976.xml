    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyse the effectiveness of a telematic dance intervention on&#xD;
      the quality of life of older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a controlled, randomized clinical trial. 54 people (Intervention Group, n=27;&#xD;
      Control Group, n=27) between the ages of 60-80 will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group participants will perform a 3-month telematic dance program based on&#xD;
      choreographic work. The participants shall be measured 3 times, at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and at 6-month post-intervention follow-up. Aside from the quality of&#xD;
      life, variables of balance, risk of falling, number of falls, level of physical activity,&#xD;
      mood, functionality, comorbidity, and quadriceps strength will also be measured.&#xD;

    <description>Telematic dance program&#xD;
The dance program will consist of 24 sessions distributed twice a week for a total period of 3 months. Each session will include:&#xD;
A) Warm up: It will consist of analytical and global movements of increasing intensity and stretching exercises. It will also involve body awareness and motor control exercises.&#xD;
B) Choreography part: the participants must follow and learn the choreographies. Intensity ranges shall vary between low and moderate. (3-4 in Borg's Modified Scale (0-10)).&#xD;
C) Cool down: It will consist of global movements of decreasing intensity, stretching, breathing, and relaxing exercises.</description>
