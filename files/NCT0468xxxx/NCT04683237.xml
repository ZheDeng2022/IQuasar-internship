      To investigate the efficacy of liraglutide plus megestrol acetate in obesity patients with&#xD;
      atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Backgrounds: High-dose progesterone (MA/MPA) or LNG-IUS is the first-line treatment for women&#xD;
      with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) or early endometrioid cancer who want to preserve&#xD;
      fertility. About 70-80% of them can achieve complete response (CR) with the median time of&#xD;
      7-8 months. Over 10% of the patients can not achieve CR and choose operation finally. By the&#xD;
      way, long-term treatment of progesterone has many side effects. Our previous study showed&#xD;
      that overweight (BMI≥25kg/m2) AEH patients had a significantly increased risk of progesterone&#xD;
      treatment failure, and the time to achieve CR is significantly prolonged. What's more, the&#xD;
      greater the baseline weight of AEH patients, the greater the weight gains after high-dose&#xD;
      progesterone treatment. Obese AEH patients have a lower response to high-dose progesterone.&#xD;
      Weight management and lifestyle interventions are clearly written into 2020 uterine NCCN&#xD;
      guidelines. We also find that metformin may improve insulin resistance in patients with AEH,&#xD;
      and shorten time to achieve CR and increase the CR rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), which is one of the commonly used&#xD;
      hypoglycemic drugs, has been approved for losing weight. And it is applicable for patients&#xD;
      with BMI≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 combined with one of the following: diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea. Liraglutide acts through improving insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      decreasing glucagon secretion , inhibiting appetite, delaying gastric emptying and improving&#xD;
      whole-body inflammation condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate whether liraglutide plus MA improve the efficacy of preserving&#xD;
      fertility when compared to MA alone in obese women with AEH who want fertility conservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A pilot prospective randomized controlled study is designed. And this study is&#xD;
      open-label. We use SPSS (version 22.0,IBM) to design simple randomization. And participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive MA alone or liraglutide plus MA. Patients in MA&#xD;
      alone group will receive MA 160mg po qd and patients in the liraglutide plus MA group will&#xD;
      receive liraglutide additionally with dose of 1.8mg/d or the max tolerance dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will receive mentoring in weight management and lifestyle improvement.&#xD;
      Hysteroscopic assessment will be performed every 12-16 weeks while other indexes will be&#xD;
      evaluated every month, including weight, metabolic indications，inbody fat analysis,&#xD;
      inflammation indicators and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the efficacy evaluation, CR is defined as the reversion of endometrial atypical&#xD;
      hyperplasia to proliferative or secretory endometrium; partial response (PR) is defined as&#xD;
      regression to simple or complex hyperplasia without atypia; no response (NR) is defined as&#xD;
      the persistence of the disease; and progressive disease (PD) is defined as the appearance of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer in patients. Continuous therapies will be needed in PR, NR or PD. Two&#xD;
      months of maintenance treatment will be recommended for patients with CR, and participants&#xD;
      will be followed up for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Primary outcome is the CR rates of the two groups (MA alone VS MA+ liraglutide) .&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include improvement of weight, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation&#xD;
      condition, and time to achieve CR, and safety and side events during the therapy, and the&#xD;
      recurrence rates, pregnancy rates and live birth rates in two years.&#xD;
