  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, and current estimates are that&#xD;
      1 in 8 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. Although surgery or&#xD;
      radiotherapy with hormone therapy offers a good chance of cure in localised disease,&#xD;
      recurrence can occur, which may cause significant distress, and may shorten the patient's&#xD;
      life. In patients with locally advanced disease (disease that has broken through the&#xD;
      surrounding capsule of the prostate gland), around 30-40% of patients experience a&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer develops as a result of normal cells acquiring genetic mutations, and localised&#xD;
      prostate cancer at diagnosis is commonly made up of different subclones - distinct regions&#xD;
      within the patient's cancer with different sets of genetic mutations, each of which may&#xD;
      behave differently and be more or less sensitive to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMRT clinical trial (CCR 1766) recruited 486 patients who received hormone therapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the prostate and lymph nodes in patients with locally advanced prostate&#xD;
      cancer. The FORECAST study (FORecasting the Evolution of CAncer of the proState within a&#xD;
      Trial) is undertaking genetic sequencing of several regions of these patients' prostate&#xD;
      cancers in order to determine which subclones are present at diagnosis, and how they evolved.&#xD;
      FORECAST also has permission to obtain and perform sequencing on primary samples from two&#xD;
      other large trials in localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to collect blood samples from patients who have experienced a recurrence in&#xD;
      whom the primary biopsies have been sequenced as part of FORECAST. Additionally, blood will&#xD;
      be collected from any patient in follow up at The Royal Marsden who received radiotherapy and&#xD;
      hormone therapy for a localised prostate cancer and has experienced a recurrence but not yet&#xD;
      started treatment. In these patients, the FORECAST protocol will be used to undertake genetic&#xD;
      sequencing of their original prostate cancer biopsies. Genetic mutations from the cancer can&#xD;
      be detected in the blood in patients who relapse, so-called 'liquid biopsies'. By comparing&#xD;
      the genetic information between the primary and relapsed cancer, we can detect which&#xD;
      subclones present at diagnosis are ultimately responsible for the cancer relapsing, and help&#xD;
      us to understand the evolution of prostate cancers over time. This will assist us in&#xD;
      predicting at the point of diagnosis which patients are more likely to relapse, so that we&#xD;
      may consider escalating primary treatments or treating patients with high-risk subclonal&#xD;
      mutations with targeted therapies upfront. As a result, we aim to reduce the number of&#xD;
      patients treated for localised prostate cancer experiencing a recurrence. Additionally,&#xD;
      although liquid biopsies are well-characterized in metastatic prostate cancer, little is&#xD;
      known about their value in patients who have a biochemical-only relapse (patients who have a&#xD;
      rising PSA with no evidence of cancer on scans) and this will also be explored.&#xD;

This study aims to identify prognostic evolutionary or genetic biomarkers in localised prostate cancers and such biomarkers can then be evaluated further in clinical studies.</description>
