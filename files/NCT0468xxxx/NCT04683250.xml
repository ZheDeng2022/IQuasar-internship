    <textblock>
      Phase 1 and 2 trial to study the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of TAS0953/HM06 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors with RET gene abnormalities. Phase 1 aims to determine&#xD;
      the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and identify the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) to be used&#xD;
      in phase 2.&#xD;
