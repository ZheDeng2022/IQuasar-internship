      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (single- and&#xD;
      multiple-dose) of oxymorphone ER for the relief of moderate to severe pain in pediatric&#xD;
      participants ages 7 - ≤17 years old requiring a continuous, around-the-clock (ATC) opioid&#xD;
      treatment for an extended period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Were males or females 7 - ≤17 years of age. Females of childbearing potential had to&#xD;
             be practicing abstinence or using a medically acceptable form of contraception (eg,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, hormonal birth control, or double barrier method). For the&#xD;
             purpose of this study, all menstruating females were considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential unless they were biologically sterile or surgically sterile for more than 1&#xD;
             year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Had chronic pain (malignant and/or nonmalignant) or postsurgical pain expected to&#xD;
             require ATC opioid analgesia for up to 12 weeks with at least 10 mg per day&#xD;
             oxymorphone ER (approximately equal to 30 mg per day oral MSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Had a body weight at least 18 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Were able to swallow oxymorphone ER tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Had laboratory results from within 21 days prior to Baseline available including&#xD;
             clinical chemistry and hematology laboratory analytes. Intraoperative (prior to&#xD;
             surgical incision) labs were acceptable provided the results had been reviewed by the&#xD;
             investigator for study eligibility prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with postsurgical pain were prescribed a parenteral analgesic regimen&#xD;
             utilizing a short-acting opioid analgesic AND were anticipated to be switched to an&#xD;
             oral opioid for an extended period of time (according to institutions standard of&#xD;
             care).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Were able to provide pain assessment evaluations using age-appropriate instruments&#xD;
             provided in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Had been informed of the nature of the study and informed consent and assent (as&#xD;
             appropriate) have been obtained from the legally responsible parent(s)/legal&#xD;
             guardian(s) and subject, respectively, in accordance with IRB requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             To participate in the PK Period, subjects had:&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Been hospital inpatients, expected to be hospitalized for up to 72 hours following the&#xD;
             initial administration of oxymorphone ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. An indwelling access catheter in place for blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Had known allergies or sensitivities to oxymorphone or other opioid analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Had a known sensitivity to any component of the oxymorphone ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Had a life expectancy &lt;3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Was pregnant and/or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Had cyanotic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Had respiratory, hepatic, renal, neurological, psychological disease, or any other&#xD;
             clinically significant condition that would, in the Investigator's opinion, preclude&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Had abdominal trauma that would interfere with absorption of oxymorphone ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Had increased intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Had a respiratory condition requiring intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Had a history of uncontrolled seizures that were not managed with anticonvulsants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Had prior history of substance abuse or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Had taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within 14 days prior to the start of&#xD;
             oxymorphone ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Had taken oxycodone or oxymorphone within 48 hours prior to Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The investigator anticipated that the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) was&#xD;
             unable to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The subject (and/or parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) was (were) unable to communicate&#xD;
             effectively with study personnel.&#xD;
