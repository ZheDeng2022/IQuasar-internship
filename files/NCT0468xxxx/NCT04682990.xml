  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. More than 95% of TB&#xD;
      deaths are in middle- and middle-income countries. Low incomes and long-term diagnosis&#xD;
      promote this persistence. In 2017, Cameroon was the 3rd in the top of 20 countries with the&#xD;
      highest estimated numbers of incident TB cases among people living with HIV, based on the&#xD;
      severity of their TB burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) encourages the introduction of rapid, non-invasive and&#xD;
      cheaper screening tests. In this scope, this study proposes the collection of exhaled breath&#xD;
      samples and their analysis through the electronic nose made in Tor Vergata University (TV&#xD;
      eNose) to diagnose TB and TB-HIV on their participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a 12 -month dynamic, open, descriptive and analytical type case-control study in&#xD;
      adults. The present study intends to recruit , all the Pulmonary TB suspects and case&#xD;
      notified by TB Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification(LAMP), sputum culture or GeneXpert&#xD;
      Mycobacterium Tuberculosis/Rifampicin (MTB/RIF) Assay, Pulmonary TB+HIV patients, healthy&#xD;
      control patients, HIV patients without TB. Each patient will undergo at least two tests: the&#xD;
      Breath Test Measurement and the TB LAMP. The TB LAMP will be used like the reference test for&#xD;
      positive TB cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment phase of the participants will take 12 months. After this period, additional 6&#xD;
      months will be dedicated to the data analysis and dissemination of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient meeting the inclusion criteria will be asked to join the study. Detailed&#xD;
      information will be provided him/her. In case of acceptance the participants will undergo&#xD;
      further sampling: breath test measurement. All data will be collected ensuring anonymity and&#xD;
      privacy. Standard protocols used in the center will not be changed by the research, but each&#xD;
      patient will be asked to provide 1 additional sample (exhaled breath in the bag sampler).&#xD;
      Each study participant will be properly informed, and a consent form will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation to participate: It will be required to patients to avoid drinking, eating,&#xD;
      smoking, or brushing their teeth 2 hours before the breath test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling collection: In order to collect breath samples, two bags will be used, one for&#xD;
      collecting airways breath (about 0.5 liter volume) and one for alveolar exhaled air (3&#xD;
      liters). It is asked to the patient after putting a clip nose, to inspire with the mouth and&#xD;
      to deeply breath inside the bags through an antibacterial filter connected to the sampling&#xD;
      apparatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end, the second bag (volume of 3 liters) contains the alveolar portion of breath that&#xD;
      will be analyzed by the TV eNose. During the measurement, the TV eNose will be connected to&#xD;
      the computer, to read and store the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) pattern from breath&#xD;
      given by the sensor array.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data are collected: clinical symptoms, TB LAMP results, and results of others test if&#xD;
      available: chest X-ray, smear microscopic, sputum culture and GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All personal data and results of the patients will be collected in a specific sheet&#xD;
      elaborated by the partners (University di Roma Tor Vergata). It will be an Excel database and&#xD;
      it will be store in the study site. All data collected will be anonymous.&#xD;
