  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is randomized, phase 2 trial in patients with rectal cancer undergoing&#xD;
      sphincter-preserving proctectomy and temporary ileostomy, to explore the effects of anal&#xD;
      dilatation plus probiotics administered per anus before ileostomy reduction in relieving&#xD;
      postoperative bowel dysfunction known as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60-90% of patients undergoing sphincter-sparing proctectomy complain of&#xD;
      postoperative bowel dysfunction including incontinence, frequency, clustering, and urgency,&#xD;
      collectively known as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). Literatures and our previous&#xD;
      data have demonstrated that diverting ileostomy is an independent risk factor for major LARS.&#xD;
      This is a randomized, phase 2 trial in patients with rectal cancer who underwent&#xD;
      sphincter-preserving proctectomy and ileostomy. This study will explore the effects of anal&#xD;
      dilatation plus probiotics administered per anus in relieving the symptoms of LARS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At 2 years after proctectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients with Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) score ≥30. LARS score is a tool consisting of five items, which are as follows: incontinence due to flatus (score range from 0 to 7), incontinence due to liquid stools (score range from 0 to 3), frequency of bowel movements (score range from 0 to 5), clustering (score range from 0 to 11) and urgency (score range from 0 to 16). The severity of each item is calculated on a scale ranging from 0 to 42, with a score of 0-20 (no LARS), 21-29 (minor LARS) and 30-42 (major LARS).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 at 2 years after proctectomy</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 years after proctectomy</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) developed and validated a 30-item core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) reflecting global QoL in cancer patients. QLQ-C30 comprises five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health scale/ a quality of life scale, and six single items. All the scales and single item measures range in score from 0-100. A high score represents a higher level of functioning, a high quality of life, and a greater degree of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ)-CR29 at 2 years after proctectomy</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 years after proctectomy</time_frame>
    <description>QLQ-CR29 is developed by The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). It is a validated supplement to the QLQ-C30 specifically designed for assessment of quality of life in colorectal cancer patients. QLQ-CR29 consists of four functional scales and eighteen single items. All the scales range from 0-100. A high score represents a higher level of functioning and a greater degree of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>MSKCC BFI Score at 2 years after proctectomy</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 years after proctectomy</time_frame>
    <description>The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre Bowel Function Instrument (MSKCC BFI) score is a validated questionnaire for evaluation of bowel function after sphincter-preserving surgery. It comprises 18 items covering the frequency of various LARS symptoms and is divided into three sub-scales and four single items. It is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;always&quot; to &quot;never&quot;. The sub-scales scores are summarised as: A 6-item frequency sub-scale (6-30), a four-item dietary sub-scale (4-20), and a four-item urgency sub-scale (4-20). A global score can be calculated as the sum of the sub-scale scores. A total score (possible score range 18-90) can be calculated by adding all the item scores (sub-scale scores plus single item scores). A higher score indicates better bowel function.</description>

    <description>LARS score is assessed every 6 months after proctectomy, and the time for major LARS (≥30) returning to minor or no LARS (&lt;30) is recorded. Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) score is a tool consisting of five items, which are as follows: incontinence due to flatus (score range from 0 to 7), incontinence due to liquid stools (score range from 0 to 3), frequency of bowel movements (score range from 0 to 5), clustering (score range from 0 to 11) and urgency (score range from 0 to 16).
