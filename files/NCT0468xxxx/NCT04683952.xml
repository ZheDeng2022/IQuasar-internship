  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula (HHFNC), with optional supplemental oxygen delivery, has&#xD;
      evolved in recent years with an increasing number of papers that show a better meet with&#xD;
      respiratory demand, decrease oxygen dilution, increased Functional Residual Capacity (FRC),&#xD;
      dead space washout, more tolerate than Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and provide heated and&#xD;
      humidified gas. HHFNC is mainly used in intensive care settings or in acute respiratory&#xD;
      diseases for the treatment of mild to moderate acute hypoxic respiratory failure and&#xD;
      ventilator weaning. The aim of this study is to evaluate, in patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in nocturnal NIV, according to the European Respiratory&#xD;
      Society (ERS) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, whether HHFNC during&#xD;
      rehabilitation has an additional effect in increasing the distance in 6 Minute Walking&#xD;
      Distance (6MWD) compared to the control group with nocturnal NIV without HHFNC treatment. As&#xD;
      secondary objectives, we expect a decrease in Emergency Department (ED) accesses, General&#xD;
      Practitioner (GP) unplanned visits, hospitalizations and an improvement of the quality of&#xD;
      life and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT PHASE: A qualified physiotherapist will check patient lists daily with the aim of&#xD;
      identifying suitable candidates for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled from January 2020 till june 2021 and they will be stratified&#xD;
      individually and randomized by a dedicated software (https://www.randomizer.org/) into two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients in nocturnal&#xD;
           Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) underwent to respiratory rehabilitation with Humidified&#xD;
           High Flow Nasal Cannula (HHFNC) with / without Oxygen Therapy (O2), according to medical&#xD;
           prescription;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group - patients in nocturnal NIV underwent to respiratory rehabilitation&#xD;
           without HFNC with / without O2, according to medical prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization, individual clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria will be taken into&#xD;
      account in relation to the ability of each patient to tolerate the administration of the high&#xD;
      flow ventilation program foreseen by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RUN IN PHASE: After the assessment, each patient will perform a training session prior to the&#xD;
      cycle ergometer, during which the subject will work on the workload and the established flow.&#xD;
      The intensity of the workload will be 60-80% of the Wmax, calculated with the Hill's formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wmax = ( 0.122 x 6MWD) + (72, 683 x Height) - 117.109&#xD;
&#xD;
      (where 6MWD is the distance walked on the 6-minute walk test, and the patient's height must&#xD;
      be expressed in meters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIV and HHFNC will be administered through VEMO 150 (EOVE SA. 64000 Pau - France), a device&#xD;
      with which it is possible setting up to 4 different ventilation programs. The High Flow can&#xD;
      be delivered, as a continuous flow through the humidified nasal cannulas, up to 60 L / min&#xD;
      with or without additional oxygen therapy according to medical prescription. The patients of&#xD;
      the experimental group will be trained with the most adequate continuous flow, in a range&#xD;
      between 20 and 60 L/min, according to the maximum flow supported by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP PHASE: Outpatient rehabilitation will be performed in 3 cycles, each cycle in&#xD;
      40-minute sessions, 3 times a week. Each session starts with the cycle ergometer with a&#xD;
      5-minute warm-up to an intensity of 0 watts, continues with a 30-minute resistance training&#xD;
      phase at a continuous target intensity (60-80% Wmax), then a warm-down of 5 minutes at an&#xD;
      intensity of 0 watts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rehabilitation will be followed by a three-month washout period, for 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS: We have identified four periods to evaluate gas exchange, Forced expiratory&#xD;
      volume in one second (FEV1) and respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea, exercise capacity, the&#xD;
      presence of obstructive/central sleep apnea, prediction of mortality, activities of daily&#xD;
      life, the impact of the disease and the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These four periods are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0: baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1: at the end of the first rehabilitation cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2: at the end of the second rehabilitation cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3: at the end of the third rehabilitation cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, demographics and clinical characteristics of eligible study&#xD;
      participants will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood gas analysis (BGA) in T0, T1, T2, T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), FEV1 and FEV1/FEVC% in T0, T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire of the British Medical Research Council (MRC) modified, in T0, T1, T2, T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic / Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI / TDI), in T0, T1, T2, T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) with / without oxygen therapy, according to the medical&#xD;
           prescription during the effort, in T0, T1, T2, T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COPD Assessment Test (CAT) in T0, T1, T2, T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Night time Polygraph to detect apnea/hypopnea, in T0, T3 ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BODE INDEX (where BODE means body mass index, obstruction of air flow, dyspnoea and&#xD;
           exercise capacity), in order to estimate the probability of survival, in T0, T1, T2, T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to investigate the quality of life in T0&#xD;
           and T3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the perception of muscle fatigue and dyspnea (Borg RPE) and Visual&#xD;
           Analogue Scale (VAS) each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During training, and the run-in phase, the physiotherapist will take note of FiO2 and of the&#xD;
      dyspnea at the beginning and end of the session through VAS / BORG and again when the patient&#xD;
      will be evaluated in 6MWD).&#xD;
