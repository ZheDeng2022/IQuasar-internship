  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational product (IP) HL-085 is an adenosine triphosphate-noncompetitive mitogen&#xD;
      activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor with a strong selective anti-tumor activity, with a&#xD;
      much lower dose than selumetinib. It has been shown strong anti-tumor activities in&#xD;
      preclinical studies to treat solid tumors, e.g., melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colon&#xD;
      cancer and other malignancies with RAF and RAS mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kechow has completed phase I dose escalation study to test HL-085 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      NRAS mutated melanoma in China. The tested doses were 0.5 mg, 1mg, 2mg, 3mg, 4mg, 6mg, 9mg,&#xD;
      12mg, 15mg and 18mg BID oral administration and there was no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      identified. All patients tolerated the study drug reasonably well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate tolerability, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary antitumor activities of HL-085 in US patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. The objective of the dose escalation is to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of selected TID and BID dose regimens in US patient population with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumor and establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose for this trial is 12 mg daily oral administration. Three selected daily&#xD;
      doses - 12 mg (4mg TID, 6mg BID), 18 mg (6mg TID, 9 mg BID), and 24 mg (8 mg TID, 12 mg BID)&#xD;
      will be tested in this study to assess safety and tolerability of HL-085 at the 3 selected&#xD;
      dose levels in US patient population with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

    <description>There are 3 cohorts for the dose escalation study. Six subjects each cohort will receive oral administration of HL-085 capsules at three daily dose levels (12 mg, 18 mg and 24 mg). Three subjects of each cohort will receive TID and 3 subjects will receive BID dose regimen. Dose escalation can occur after 6 patients have completed 28 days of treatment and no or 1 DLT is identified.</description>
