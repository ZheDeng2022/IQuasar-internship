  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The neurodynamics technique seems interesting for increased lower limb&#xD;
      flexibility of the lower limbs in healthy subjects. The objective of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the physiological effects of the SLUMP sliding technique on the range of knee extension&#xD;
      during the SLUMP test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 60 physiotherapy students perform measurements during three tutorials. The first&#xD;
      involves training in evaluation techniques. The second involves mobilizing the knee, out of&#xD;
      the SLUMP position. The third tutorial includes neuronal mobilization in SLUMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee extension in SLUMP position is measured immediately after completing techniques. The&#xD;
      mobilization amplitudes (degrees) will be compared between the techniques by a Student test&#xD;
      on paired series, each subject being his own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The results of this study will provide evidence for the physiological effect of&#xD;
      SLUMP sliding techniques performed by physiotherapy students on the range of knee extension&#xD;
      during the SLUMP test in asymptomatic subjects.&#xD;
