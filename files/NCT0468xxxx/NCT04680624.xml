  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BOMOGUMIP is an interventional research with minimal risk and constraints (cat.2),&#xD;
      exploratory, intra-individual, prospective, multi-site study. The main objective of this&#xD;
      intra individual prospective study is to determine the evolution of microbial composition of&#xD;
      fecal samples issued to 15 patients after 6 months of Brodalumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will consist of 15 adult patients suffering from moderate to severe skin&#xD;
      psoriasis and starting, after having received a methotrexate treatment during at least 4&#xD;
      months, a brodalumab treatment in the first line of biological treatment.&#xD;
