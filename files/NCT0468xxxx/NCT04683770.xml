    <textblock>
      Our study is aimed to explore a prospective observational clinical study on the efficacy&#xD;
      prediction and survival prediction of HR + / HER2 - biomarkers detection in patients with&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer. This study is a prospective, observational clinical study. We&#xD;
      analyzed the incidence of biomarker mutations in HR + / HER2 - advanced breast cancer (stage&#xD;
      IV), and the correlation between biomarkers and therapeutic efficacy, survival, and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;

      The object of this study is to detect the gene mutation of tumor tissue or peripheral blood&#xD;
      circulation tumor DNA of tumor patients. 10ml of tissue or fresh peripheral blood should be&#xD;
      collected as the test sample and stored at room temperature. On the same day, it was sent to&#xD;
      the &quot;cell and molecular diagnosis center&quot; of our hospital for DNA isolation and extraction,&#xD;
      second-generation sequencing, and detection of related biomarkers. The clinical total exome&#xD;
      sequencing (4813 gene) kit developed by Illumina company was used for embryo line detection,&#xD;
      and the system detection project used the system detection chip designed by the laboratory.&#xD;
