    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the Tolerability、Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity of oral FCN-338 for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), who have failed or are intolerant to one&#xD;
      or more lines of established therapy or for whom no other treatment options are available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase I dose escalation study of&#xD;
      Tolerability、Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary antitumor activity of FCN-338 in ascending&#xD;
      cohorts to determine the MTD or recommended dose in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      CLL/SLL patients. This is to be followed by a cohort expansion phase at the MTD or&#xD;
      recommended oral dose.&#xD;
