    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase I/II study in which a combination of duvelisib and nivolumab will be&#xD;
      used to treat a total of patients diagnosed with advanced unresectable melanoma who have&#xD;
      progressed on anti-PD1 therapy. The Recommended Phase II Dose of oral duvelisib will be&#xD;
      determined and administered with intravenous nivolumab 480mg for up to 1 year or until the&#xD;
      patient's disease does not progress or the patient experiences unacceptable side effects to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      This trial will study of PI3Kγδ inhibitor duvelisib in combination with nivolumab in patients&#xD;
      with advanced unresectable melanoma who have progressed on anti-PD1 therapy. In the Phase I&#xD;
      part of the study (18) patients will be administered nivolumab 480mg intravenously and&#xD;
      duvelisib orally in doses from 15mg once a day to 25mg twice a day to determine the&#xD;
      recommended dose for the Phase II part of the study. In the Phase II study patients will be&#xD;
      administered nivolumab 480mg intravenously and duvelisib orally (dose not determined until&#xD;
      the Phase 1 study is completed) up to 1 year as long as their disease doesn't progress or&#xD;
      have unacceptable side effects to the study drugs. This trial will attempt to determine&#xD;
      whether duvelisib acts as an immunomodulator, to shift the TME from an immunosuppressive to&#xD;
      an immunostimulatory setting, to overcome acquired resistance in anti-PD1 treated patients.&#xD;
      The phase I portion of the study is uniquely designed to find the ideal dose of duvelisib as&#xD;
      an immunomodulator, which is suspected to be lower than the previously determined maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of duvelisib in lymphoma studies.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 56 days (per patient)</time_frame>
    <description>The Maximun Tolerated Dose / RP2D will be determined via specified acute dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and laboratory abnormalities considered possibly related to study treatment, occurring from the initial dose of duvelisib + nivolumab through day 28 of treatment (acute), which will be considered for decisions to continue enrollment at the current dose level or proceed to the next dose level. Toxicities occurring from day 29 through 28 days after completion of treatment will be considered late toxicities. Acute and late toxicities will be considered when deciding on the RP2D. The highest dose level (Maximum Tolerated Dose) at which ≤ 1 of 6 treated patients experiences a DLT will determine the RP2D. DLTs are defined using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active&#xD;
             treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin that has undergone therapy with curative intent, or treated in&#xD;
             situ cervical cancer for which there is appropriate ongoing surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had therapy with radiation, surgery or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             time of consent and/or has not recovered from adverse events to due to prior therapy.&#xD;
             Subjects should be adequately recovered from all toxicities, complications, or acute&#xD;
             illnesses prior to starting investigational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A maximum of three patients who have received talimogene laherparepvec (T-vec) as&#xD;
             prior therapy will be allowed to enroll in the Phase II portion of the study. However,&#xD;
             study-related biopsies must be performed at a disease site that was not injected with&#xD;
             T-vec or adjacent to a T-vec injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable or unwilling to take prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii,&#xD;
             human simplex virus (HSV) or herpes zoster (VZV) at time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to duvelisib and/or its excipients:&#xD;
             Microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
             physical illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable or unwilling to comply with restrictions and prohibited&#xD;
             activities and treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable or unwilling to undergo venipuncture or tolerate venous access&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with prior surgery and/or chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction that may&#xD;
             affect drug absorption, such as gastric bypass, gastrectomy, malabsorption,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of medications or foods that are strong inhibitors of&#xD;
             inducers of cytochrome p450 3A (CYP3A) within 2 weeks prior to study intervention.&#xD;
             Duvelisib can increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates; consider dose reduction of such&#xD;
             substrates and monitor for signs of toxicities of co-administered sensitive CYP3A&#xD;
             substrates.&#xD;
