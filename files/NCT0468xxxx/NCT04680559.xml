  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) applied to psychotherapists&#xD;
      improve their empathy and increase the therapeutic alliance. It is expected that these&#xD;
      improvements may beneficially affect the results of psychotherapy. However, new studies are&#xD;
      needed to examine whether an MBI can have an effect on the healthy evolution of these&#xD;
      professionals' patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to analyze the influence of a mindfulness and compassion&#xD;
      based intervention (MCBI) applied to psychotherapists, on the empathy perceived by their&#xD;
      patients, the therapeutic alliance and their symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized clinical trial of an intervention based on MBSR and adapted to the&#xD;
      population of psychotherapists, including in the last two sessions the practice of&#xD;
      compassion, called Mindfulness and Compassion Based Intervention (MCBI). The subjects (n =&#xD;
      63) were randomly assigned to MCBI (n = 33) or to a Waiting List group in which they fill in&#xD;
      a self-record of their own feelings, thoughts, etc. in therapy for 8 weeks (n = 30).&#xD;
      Participants in the MCBI intervention condition were asked to meet weekly during a two-hour&#xD;
      session for two months. Pre / post-intervention and five-month evaluations were performed as&#xD;
      a follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness measures (FFMQ) will be taken for the evaluation of psychotherapists,&#xD;
      Self-compassion (SCS-SF), negative symptomatology (DASS-21), empathy (EUS-T, TECA), personal&#xD;
      therapist style (EPT-C) and mindfulness instructional style (MIQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the evaluation of patients, measures of mindfulness (FFMQ), self-compassion (SCS-SF) will&#xD;
      be taken - to try to control without these skills they can be vicariously modified without&#xD;
      being directly trained-, subjective well-being (PHI), psychological well-being (BSI),&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance (WATOCI, ENAT) and perceived empathy (EUS-P).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The practice of psychotherapy involves the formation and development of a series of skills by&#xD;
      the professional. These skills encourage the establishment of a quality therapeutic link,&#xD;
      which helps to improve the effectiveness of therapy sessions. In this sense, current research&#xD;
      indicates that the link established between the psychotherapist and his patients has a high&#xD;
      effect on the evolution and results of psychotherapy. This improvement is to a greater extent&#xD;
      attributed to the establishment of the link than to the specific techniques that are applied&#xD;
      in therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the variables that favor the link, the empathy of the psychotherapist has been widely&#xD;
      studied, and has proven to be highly related to the benefits of psychological interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the development of healthy empathy is one of the most important variables on which&#xD;
      the benefits of psychotherapy are based. It facilitates a true understanding of the vital&#xD;
      situations of the patients and is essential in establishing the therapeutic link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of the latter on the results of psychological interventions has meant that&#xD;
      empathy training is one of the basic objectives to follow in the training of clinical and&#xD;
      health psychologists, increasing research on effective strategies for this, among which&#xD;
      mindfulness and compassion based interventions (MCBI) stand out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the MCBI have established themselves as a very useful intervention in the&#xD;
      healthcare field, and several authors suggest the advantages of their application in&#xD;
      psychotherapists, pointing out their beneficial influence on the therapeutic relationship and&#xD;
      the psychotherapeutic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MCBI are structured interventions in which a series of attitudes and mental states&#xD;
      associated with mindfulness and compassion are trained through different meditation&#xD;
      techniques. You also learn to generalize these states in the way we relate to the experiences&#xD;
      we live. Based on this, the MCBI can be an especially useful strategy to train a series of&#xD;
      skills that beneficially influence the therapeutic link and the results of psychotherapy. In&#xD;
      relation to the above, it has been seen that MCBI have a beneficial effect on the levels of&#xD;
      self-reported empathy of clinical and health psychologists. In addition, an interesting&#xD;
      association has been observed between the levels of mindfulness and self-reported empathy in&#xD;
      psychotherapists, and between these variables and the therapeutic alliance established with&#xD;
      their patients. An association has also been found between the results of the therapeutic&#xD;
      alliance measures between therapists and patients after a Mindfulness-based Intervention&#xD;
      (MBI). Finally, it has been seen that the application of an MCBI in psychotherapists&#xD;
      indirectly influences the evolution of their patients, helping to reduce their symptoms and&#xD;
      increase their levels of well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results imply important support for the advantages of including the MCBI in the&#xD;
      training of clinical and health psychologists, in order to increase their levels of empathy&#xD;
      and the effectiveness of their interventions. However, there are many limitations we find in&#xD;
      these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the studies that have analyzed the influence of MCBI on empathy only include a&#xD;
      self-reported evaluation of psychotherapists on this variable. In addition, this evaluation&#xD;
      does not give us information about whether the MCBI affects the empathy that patients&#xD;
      perceive in their therapists, which prevents us from assessing whether these benefits exert a&#xD;
      real influence on the therapeutic relationship and the psychotherapeutic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, studies that have established a relationship between levels of mindfulness&#xD;
      and direct results in therapeutic alliance include only mindfulness-based interventions&#xD;
      (MBI), not including compassion training in a manner explicit. We are interested in observing&#xD;
      whether a MCBI significantly influences the perception of the therapeutic alliance by&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in Grepmair's study in which the benefits of applying an MCBI in psychotherapists on&#xD;
      the evolution of their patients have been observed, the mediating variables that could&#xD;
      explain these results were not evaluated. The objective of this project is to identify the&#xD;
      mechanisms of action of the MCBI and its effect on the different variables that could be&#xD;
      influencing the results of psychotherapy, such as the empathy of the psychotherapist and the&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance established with their patients.&#xD;

Distractions of the patient's speech to another topic&#xD;
Postural changes or discomforts (we always talk about you, the therapist)&#xD;
Thoughts and emotions that may arise&#xD;
And in general, anything that wakes you up what your patient says or does&#xD;
This registration should be done, if possible, at the end of the session with the patient. If not Possible will be filled that same day at another time.&#xD;
In no case will personal data of any of the patients be entered. it is requested to indicate who the patient will be A: your e-mail and B: your e-mail (if you have more than 1).</description>
