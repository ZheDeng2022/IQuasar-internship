      Spinal cord stimulation may be a new therapeutic approach for freezing of gait. It's a&#xD;
      multi-center, prospective, open label clinical study with a 12 months follow-up period, to&#xD;
      investigate the therapeutic effect and safety of spinal cord stimulation for freezing of gait&#xD;
      in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism-Plus syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benefits of dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation are limited for freezing of gait&#xD;
      in Parkinson's syndrome. Spinal cord stimulation is a well-established therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Recently, some pilot studies demonstrated the safety&#xD;
      and significant therapeutic effect of Spinal cord stimulation in freezing of gait patients&#xD;
      suffering from various movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, primary progressive&#xD;
      freezing of gait, and multiple system atrophy with predominant Parkinsonism. Spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation may be a new therapeutic approach for freezing of gait. However, evidence from&#xD;
      larger numbers of subjects is still lacking, especially little is known about its efficacy&#xD;
      for gait and posture dysfunction in Parkinsonism-Plus syndrome patients. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the therapeutic effect and safety of spinal cord stimulation for&#xD;
      freezing of gait in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism-Plus&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a multi-center, prospective, open label clinical study with a 12 months follow-up&#xD;
      period. The intended study population is individuals suffering from advanced Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism or progressive supranuclear&#xD;
      palsy. Each participant will complete an enrollment/screening/baseline visit, a spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation implant and activation visit, and a minimum of two follow-up visits, including&#xD;
      visit at 3 months and the final study visit at 12months. The participants will proceed to&#xD;
      implantation after satisfying implant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Paddle-shaped Spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation electrode with 16 contacts (AdaptiveStim® 39, 565; Medtronic, Minneapolis,&#xD;
      USA) will be implanted into the epidural space at the thoracic levels ranging from T10 to&#xD;
      T12. Electrode position will be verified by X-ray. The stimulators will be turned on within 1&#xD;
      month after electrode implantation surgery. The stimulation parameters could vary freely, but&#xD;
      medications will be kept constant during the study period. At the end of month 12,&#xD;
      participants will enter the long-term follow-up in which medications and stimulation&#xD;
      parameters could vary freely.&#xD;
