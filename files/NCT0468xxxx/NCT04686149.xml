  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to develop a genome-based platform to predict patients who can achieve&#xD;
      bladder preservation after neoadjuvant treatment. The main treatments for invasive bladder&#xD;
      cancer are radical cystectomy and intrapelvic lymph node dissection, but 50% of patients&#xD;
      experience recurrence within 2 years after surgery. The recurrence after surgery is associate&#xD;
      with T3 stage, the presence of invading soft tissue around the bladder and N1, lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis. Therefore, various methods are being tried to reduce recurrence and metastasis,&#xD;
      among which preoperative chemotherapy has been reported to increase survival rate. Based on&#xD;
      this, preoperative chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy are also recommended. However,&#xD;
      there are several limitations; The surgery may be delayed in case of non-responsive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the difficulty of tolerance of chemotherapy as the patients are relatively old&#xD;
      in bladder cancer. Therefore, the preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy can be considered&#xD;
      as a treatment effectively lower the recurrence. In several retrospective study has reported&#xD;
      that preoperative radiation induces the down-staging and leads to prolonged progression free&#xD;
      survival. However, after radical cystectomy, there is discomfort for patients regarding the&#xD;
      removal of the bladder. Treating the bladder while preserving the bladder is getting its&#xD;
      attention. The representative treatment is performing neoadjuvant concurrent chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by transurethral resection of bladder tumor. The bladder preserving treatment is&#xD;
      performed in patients who have unresectable, locally advanced bladder cancer or are not&#xD;
      medically appropriate for surgery. The 5-year overall survival is reported to be around&#xD;
      50-60%. To date, no clinical trial has been conducted to compare whether concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy can achieve the comparable clinical outcome as radical cystectomy in&#xD;
      operable conditions. Therefore, in order to perform the bladder preserving treatment, a&#xD;
      platform selecting patients who can preserve the bladder from bladder preserving treatment in&#xD;
      advance is needed. Responsiveness to radiotherapy is a combination of various factors, and&#xD;
      radiation sensitivity of tumors is the most important. The recent study has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that physician can predict radiation sensitivity using genomic data. In this study, we intend&#xD;
      to develop a platform that can predict responsiveness to radiotherapy and select patients who&#xD;
      can preserve bladder using genomic information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment in this study is one of the standard treatments suggested by the NCCN&#xD;
      guidelines. Bladder is preserved when neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy is performed&#xD;
      after transurethral resection of bladder tumor and complete remission is achieved through the&#xD;
      cystoscopy. If complete response is not achieved, additional chemotherapy is performed. In&#xD;
      case that complete response is not achieved through the cystoscopy after additional&#xD;
      chemotherapy, cystectomy is performed. If complete response is achieved, the bladder is&#xD;
      preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, the following are obtained; Medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
      Tissue acquisition through transurethral resection of bladder tumor, Blood Test (CBC),&#xD;
      Chemistry Test (SMA), staging through pelvic CT or MRI, cystoscopy, PET-CT or chest CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is conducted 4 times during the radiotherapy.&#xD;
      AFter radiotherapy, the gemcitabine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/carboplatin treatment is&#xD;
      performed. The target delineation is performed in 3mm simulation CT for radiotherapy. To&#xD;
      consider the uncertainty of breath, the 4D CT is taken. GTV includes primary lesions and&#xD;
      lymph node based on diagnostic CT, MRI, and PET-CT. CTV covers the entire bladder with&#xD;
      microscopic margin of GTV. PTV1 is defined as extending 1.5cm from the entire bladder. PTV2&#xD;
      is defined as extending 1.5cm from GTV. Radiotherapy is performed using 3D conformal&#xD;
      radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, volumetric modulated Arc therapy.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is administered daily, five times a week according to the NCCN guidelines. Each&#xD;
      treatment is performed with bladder empty. radiotherapy is performed 20 fractions in total.&#xD;
      For the first 15 fractions, 2.65Gy administered for PTV1 including the entire bladder. For&#xD;
      rest 5 fractions, 3 Gy for PTV2 is administered. Totally, 55 Gy is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If complete response is not achieved, the surgery and timing of surgery are determined by the&#xD;
      urologist according to the location and severity of the primary cancer. The biopsy if&#xD;
      performed using cystoscopy. If the findings are complete response, no additional treatment is&#xD;
      performed, and if not, radical cystectomy is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment response is evaluated based on standard treatment process. During the&#xD;
      treatment, the regular check up is conducted to evaluate the acute toxicity regarding&#xD;
      treatment. After bladder preserving treatment, the pelvic CT, MRI and cystoscopy is used for&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acquired specimens are ;used for RNA sequencing and organoid construction. The RNA&#xD;
      sequencing is used to analyze the differentially expressed based on treatment response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

        Patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer are subject to this trial. For bladder&#xD;
        preservation, the patients receive neoadjvuvant CCRT. In case that clinical CR status&#xD;
        obtained after CCRT in patients initally T2N0M0, no additional treatment is performed.&#xD;
        Patients without clinical CR status are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After&#xD;
        chemotherapy, the response is evaluated. If residual tumor is found, the radical cystectomy&#xD;
        is performed.&#xD;
