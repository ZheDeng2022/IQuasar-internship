  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite available treatments for perinatal mood disorders, only 20% of affected women receive&#xD;
      treatment that results in remission of symptoms. In order to address gaps in equitable access&#xD;
      to treatment the investigators developed the Reproductive Mental health of Ontario Virtual&#xD;
      Intervention Network (MOVIN), a virtual collaborative care platform to optimize access for&#xD;
      pregnant and postpartum people in Ontario. MOVIN combines collaborative and stepped-care&#xD;
      approaches to treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety. The overall objective of this&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the feasibility of implementing a&#xD;
      protocol for studying MOVIN for pregnant and postpartum individuals with significant symptoms&#xD;
      of depression and anxiety (EPDS &gt; 12) in order to inform the conduct of a larger scale&#xD;
      evaluation. O will be randomized to either the MOVIN or control condition and will be asked&#xD;
      to complete follow-up assessments 12- and 24-weeks post-randomization. Participants in the&#xD;
      MOVIN arm will receive access to the MOVIN platform which includes a care coordinator to help&#xD;
      them navigate various virtual treatments. Participants in the control condition will receive&#xD;
      a resource list and will navigate the various options on their own.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with scores above 12 on the EPDS have a 10 times greater likelihood of having a&#xD;
      diagnosis of depression than those with scores with 12 or less, so this is an appropriate&#xD;
      cut-off. The primary endpoint is at 12 weeks post-randomization and the secondary endpoint is&#xD;
      at 24 weeks post-randomization. Randomization will be performed as block randomization&#xD;
      (varying block sizes) with a 1:1 allocation and will be stratified based on EPDS score (13-19&#xD;
      vs. 20 or greater). Participants who score 12 or less on the EPDS in their initial&#xD;
      self-referral screen will be informed that they are not at high risk for having depressive or&#xD;
      anxiety disorder and the current time, and can re-screen as needed. Participants whose score&#xD;
      is in the 9-12 range (i.e. those who are not likely to be experiencing a depressive or&#xD;
      anxiety disorder requiring mental health treatment, but might benefit from additional&#xD;
      support) will receive an automated message that communicates their score and the&#xD;
      acknowledgment of their possible need for support, and provides a list of resources in&#xD;
      Ontario that may be helpful for them. These participants will be invited to re-screen at any&#xD;
      time into the study, and will be asked permission to be re-contacted in future to determine&#xD;
      which supports they used, if any.&#xD;
