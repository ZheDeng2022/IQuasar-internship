    <measure>Change from Baseline in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The mRSS is a validated physical examination method for estimating skin induration. It correlates with biopsy measures of skin thickness and reflects prognosis and visceral involvement, especially in early disease. It is scored on 0 (normal) to 3 (severe induration) ordinal scales over 17 body areas, with a maximum score of 51 and is used to categorize severity of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Higher the score maximum the severity.</description>

    <description>The mRSS is a validated physical examination method for estimating skin induration. It correlates with biopsy measures of skin thickness and reflects prognosis and visceral involvement, especially in early disease.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Score of 0.6 in American College of Rheumatology Combined Response Index in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) (ACR CRISS) at Week 24 and Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 24 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ACR CRISS is composite response index for clinical trials in early dcSSc developed by an international group of experts in SSc. Application of ACR CRISS algorithm in a randomized clinical trial is a 2-step process. Firstly, participants will be evaluated to have met the criterion for not improved. If yes, these participants are assigned a probability score of 0.0. For the remaining participants, calculate the probability based on change in 5 measures: mRSS, percentage (%) of predicted FVC, HAQ-DI, patient's global assessment, and physician's global assessment, where each measure has a probability score between 0 and 1.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Digital Ulcer Counts at Week 24 and Week 52 in Participants with Digital Ulcers at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Digital ulcers are defined as a full thickness (greater than [&gt;] 3 millimeters [mm] in maximal diameter) skin lesion with loss of epithelium including lesions covered by eschar. Healing is defined by re epithelialization with loss of pain and exudate.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score at Week 24 and Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). Overall score is computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to Week 24, Week 52 and Week 104</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to Week 24, Week 52 and Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events of special interest that may require expedited reporting or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a study intervention; suspected abuse/misuse of a study intervention; accidental or occupational exposure to a study intervention; unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a study intervention; Medication error, intercepted medication error, or potential medication error involving a Johnson and Johnson medicinal product (with or without patient exposure to the Johnson and Johnson medicinal product, for example, product name confusion, product label confusion, intercepted prescribing or dispensing errors); and exposure to a sponsor study intervention from breastfeeding. Any newly identified malignancy or case of active tuberculosis (TB) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurring after the first study intervention administration(s) in participants are considered as AESI.</description>
