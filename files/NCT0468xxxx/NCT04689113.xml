      Aim of study The aim of this study is to determine the effect of &quot;Incontinence Health Belief&#xD;
      Development Program&quot; on urinary incontinence awareness and health beliefs of women in&#xD;
      premenopausal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design ans setting The research was conducted in a randomized controlled double-blind&#xD;
      pretest-posttest control group experimental research design type. To avoid bias the&#xD;
      participants were not told whether they were in the experimental or the control group. The&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial was based on the guidelines proposed by the Consolidated standard&#xD;
      of Reporting Trials- CONSORT 2010. The data of the research were collected in Samsun / Atakum&#xD;
      District Healthy Life Center and three Family Health Centers between November 2019- September&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization An intervention group and a control group formed using the research randomizer&#xD;
      software. the program used random numbers to select participants and randomly assign them to&#xD;
      the experimental or control group(total 160 women, each group 80 women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of data collectors and statistician was implemented in this randomized blinded&#xD;
      study. another researcher who did not know the group assignments coded the data in the&#xD;
      computer. after statistical analysis was conducted and research report was written, assistant&#xD;
      researcher explained tge codes for experimental and control group. Therefore, blinding of the&#xD;
      collectors, statistical analysis and report writing was provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing the Incontinence Health Belief Development Program The trainings were applied to&#xD;
      the women in the experimental group in groups of 10 in the Atakum Healthy Life Center in 5&#xD;
      sessions of 45-60 minutes and 5 weeks. For 5 weeks, 8 group trainings were conducted by&#xD;
      taking two different groups every week, 4 days a week. Also Establishing Whatsapp and&#xD;
      Facebook Groups A WhatsApp group was established to remind women in the intervention group&#xD;
      about the kegel exercise 3 times a day for 3 months to increase their self-efficacy. In&#xD;
      addition, a facebook group was opened and posts about urinary incontinence and kegel&#xD;
      exercises were made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools The pre-test data of the study were collected using the&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics information form , the Incontinence Awareness Scale (ISI),&#xD;
      the &quot;Health Belief Scale for Urinary Incontinence and Kegel Exercise&quot; and the &quot;Broome Pelvic&#xD;
      Muscle Self-Efficacy Scale&quot; for the experimental and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introductory Question Form: Introductory question form was developed by the researcher and&#xD;
      consists of questions involving sociodemographic characteristics, gynecological features and&#xD;
      urinary incontinence and kegel exercise of people (age, gender, marital status, education&#xD;
      status, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incontinence Awareness Scale: The urinary incontinence awareness scale, developed by Avci et&#xD;
      al. (2017) to measure individuals' awareness of urinary incontinence, consists of 26 items.&#xD;
      It consists of 5 sub-dimensions: factors that prevent it from being accepted as a health&#xD;
      problem, coping with urinary incontinence, health motivation, restriction and fear of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. Scores obtained from sub-dimensions; For the factors preventing its acceptance&#xD;
      as a health problem sub-dimension, min 8, max 40; For health motivation sub-dimension, min 5,&#xD;
      max 25; For the sub-dimension of dealing with urinary incontinence, min 6, max 30; For&#xD;
      restriction sub-dimension min 3, max 15; For the subscale for fear of urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      the minimum is 4 and the maximum is 20. The scale does not have a total score.Having a high&#xD;
      score in the factors preventing its acceptance as a health problem indicates that it accepts&#xD;
      urinary incontinence as a health problem.High scores on the sub-dimensions of restriction and&#xD;
      incontinence indicate that he does not have a fear of restriction and urinary&#xD;
      incontinence.Low scores on the health motivation and coping with urinary incontinence&#xD;
      sub-dimensions indicate that their health motivation and coping with urinary incontinence are&#xD;
      better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Belief Scale for Urinary Incontinence and Kegel Exercise: The scale developed by Avcı&#xD;
      and Yıldırım (2019) based on the health belief model to determine the beliefs of individuals&#xD;
      about urinary incontinence and kegel exercise, consists of 49 questions in 5-point likert&#xD;
      type. Scale items are separated according to susceptibility, seriousness, health motivation,&#xD;
      Kegel exercise benefit perception, Kegel exercise barrier perception and self-efficacy&#xD;
      subdimensions created according to health belief model. Responses given to each statement in&#xD;
      the scale are in 5-point Likert type and all statements are positive. Scores obtained from&#xD;
      subdimensions vary between 9-45 for susceptibility subdimension; between 14-70 for&#xD;
      seriousness subdimension; between 5-25 for health motivation subdimension; between 7-35 for&#xD;
      Kegel exercise benefit perception subdimension; between 9-45 Kegel exercise barrier&#xD;
      perception subdimension and between 5-25 for self-efficacy subdimension. There is no total&#xD;
      score of the scale. Increasing scores indicate positive perception for susceptibility,&#xD;
      seriousness, health motivation, Kegel exercise benefit perception and self-efficacy&#xD;
      subdimensions and negative perception for Kegel exercise barrier perception. Increasing&#xD;
      scores mean that susceptibility, seriousness and motivation increase; that benefits are&#xD;
      perceived high for benefit perception while barriers are perceived high for barrier&#xD;
      perception. Cronbach's alphas in the validity and reliability study of the scale are as&#xD;
      follows for the sub-dimensions: sensitivity: 0.89; severity: 0.91; health motivation: 0.79;&#xD;
      kegel exercise benefit perception: 0.94; kegel exercise barrier perception: 0,90;&#xD;
      self-efficacy: 0.89.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broome Pelvic Muscle Self-Efficacy Scale: Developed by Broome (1999) to measure the&#xD;
      perception of self-efficacy in pelvic floor muscle exercise practice and to provide&#xD;
      clinicians with a valid and reliable measurement tool in pelvic floor muscle exercise, the&#xD;
      scale was validated in Turkish by Zengin and Pınar in 2012. The scale, which consists of 23&#xD;
      statements in total, consists of two sub-dimensions: &quot;effectiveness expectation&quot; and &quot;result&#xD;
      expectation&quot;. Total scale score is determined by taking the average of the scores obtained&#xD;
      from all expressions in the scale. The sub-dimension score is calculated by the average of&#xD;
      the total score of the expressions of that dimension. The total score of the scale varies&#xD;
      between 0-100; A score of 32 or less indicates low self-efficacy, 33-66 points medium, and a&#xD;
      score above 66 indicates high self-efficacy. The validity and reliability of the scale is&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha: 0.95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Data SPSS 23.0 statistical package program (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences, Chicago, Illinois) was used for statistical analysis and evaluation of the data.&#xD;
      Whether the data showed normal distribution was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Independent samples t test and Mann Whitney U test were used to compare data between groups&#xD;
      according to normality test. Paired samples t test and Wilcoxon test were used to compare the&#xD;
      pre-test and post-test values within the group. The Chi-square test and two ratio tests were&#xD;
      used to analyze categorical data. Significance level was taken as p &lt;.05.&#xD;
