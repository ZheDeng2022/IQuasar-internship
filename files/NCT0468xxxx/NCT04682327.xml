  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota of patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) through metagenomic&#xD;
      high-throughput sequencing methods, and explore the relationship between the gut microbiota&#xD;
      and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will further understand the influence and mechanism of the gut microbiota on tumor&#xD;
      immunotherapy, and will provide new ideas and theoretical basis for improving the efficacy of&#xD;
      tumor immunotherapy by targeting the gut microbiota in the clinic, and benefit more NSCLC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
