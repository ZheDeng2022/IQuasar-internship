  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is defined as recurrent, crampy pain occurring with menses in the&#xD;
      absence of identifiable pelvic pathology. Standard initial management of PD includes NSAIDs&#xD;
      as a first-line treatment and oral contraceptives for the relief of pain and improved daily&#xD;
      activity. In patients who have persistent dysmenorrhea despite medical therapy of NSAIDs&#xD;
      and/or oral contraceptives, further investigation including pelvic ultrasound, hysteroscopy&#xD;
      or laparoscopy may be needed to rule out other underlying pathologies. Historically, It is an&#xD;
      old clinical observation that primary dysmenorrhea is often completely or partially relieved&#xD;
      by childbearing. Similarly, the investigators have observed that the diagnostic/operative&#xD;
      hysteroscopy led to relive of pain in most of the cases in our practice. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that the process of cervical dilatation can have a role in&#xD;
      reducing pain of patients with dysmenorrhea. In this randomized, controlled study, it was&#xD;
      aimed to assess the effect of operational cervical dilatation on the pain in patients with&#xD;
      primary dysmenorrhea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who applies to the outpatient clinic for reasons non-related to the dysmenorrhea&#xD;
      (e.g. infertility investigation) will be assessed for the presence of primary dysmenorrhea by&#xD;
      history taking and anamnesis. Patients will be randomized to have cervical dilatation and&#xD;
      hysteroscopy or no intervention until the follow-up duration.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Investigator diagnosed primary dysmenorrhea with clinical history and anamnesis. Investigator refers the patient to the surgical nurse and nurse performs the randomization process and prepare the patient (control group) for the cervical dilatation and hysteroscopy and schedule the control group for follow-up (expectant). The outcomes assessor is also blind to the assigned group.</masking_description>

    <description>This scale assess the dysmenorrhea by grading the severity. The assessment includes working ability, systemic symptoms and the use of analgesics. The grades vary between grade 0, grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate) and grade 3 (severe).</description>

    <description>The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is an instrument for measuring quality of life and widely used. The EQ-5D descriptive system is a preference-based HRQL measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ-5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>
