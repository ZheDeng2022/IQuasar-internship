  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several biological augmentation procedures have recently been suggested to enhance tendon&#xD;
      healing after Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, such as marrow-stimulating technique with&#xD;
      microfractures of the greater tuberosity. The purpose of this study was to introduce a new&#xD;
      technique, &quot;greenhouse technique&quot;, and to compare the clinical outcomes with microfracture&#xD;
      combined with suture bridge technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has a high rate of successful subjective and functional&#xD;
      results. Although the rate of tendon healing is reported to be around 80% for small tears, it&#xD;
      can decrease to about 30% for large and massive tears. Poor tissue quality of bone, tendons,&#xD;
      and muscles can affect healing and functional recovery of the rotator cuff and has been&#xD;
      advocated as a major cause of tendon nonhealing and/or retear. Several biological&#xD;
      augmentation procedures have recently been suggested to enhance tendon healing after&#xD;
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, such as marrow-stimulating technique with microfractures of&#xD;
      the greater tuberosity. The purpose of this study was to introduce a new technique,&#xD;
      &quot;greenhouse technique&quot;, and to compare the clinical outcomes with microfracture combined with&#xD;
      suture bridge technique.&#xD;

    <description>Patients underwent greenhouse techniqueï¼šThe high-strength suture was passed through the tendon using Mason-Allen method, and then Crimson duvet procedure was performed on the foot print area from the articular surface of the humeral head to the apex of the greater tubercle. Immediately after this procedure, a lateral row anchor was used.</description>
