  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases are chronic diseases that occur as a result of a violation of the&#xD;
      balance between microbial dental plaque and the host response. Gingivitis is a disease&#xD;
      characterized by inflammation of the gingiva that occurs in one or more areas without loss of&#xD;
      attachments.1 in periodontitis, an inflammatory event that begins in the gingiva along with&#xD;
      gingivitis spreads to the periodontal ligament, alveolar bone and soft tissues that support&#xD;
      the tooth, causing the destruction of these structures.2 Cytokines are low molecular weight&#xD;
      proteins that participate in the initial and active stages of inflammation and immunity. In&#xD;
      periodontal disease pathogenesis, cytokine response has been reported to play a very critical&#xD;
      role in determining disease progression.3 IL-1beta and IL-6 are key cytokines in chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases and have the potential to initiate bone loss and tissue destruction&#xD;
      seen in periodontal disease.4the purpose of this study; it is to determine the degree of&#xD;
      inflammation and periodontal destruction by determining the levels of IL-1beta and IL-6&#xD;
      cytokines in the gingival crevicular fluid of periodontal healthy and diseased individuals.&#xD;

      Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), presence of bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket depth&#xD;
      (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were used during the clinical periodontal assessment&#xD;
      at 6 sites per tooth except third molar. All periodontal assessments were conducted with a&#xD;
      manuel probe* by an experienced calibrated periodontist (AD). Calibration exercises were&#xD;
      performed in 5 non-study periodontitis patients for probing depths (PD) and attachment loss&#xD;
      (AL). The reproducibility of the parameters was verified via the kappa coefficient, which was&#xD;
      0.90 for PD and 0.88 for AL. After clinical evaluation, individuals were divided into 6&#xD;
      groups according to the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and&#xD;
      Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions (Chapple and Papapanou).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthy control groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consisted of individuals with clinically healthy gingiva on an intact periodontium who&#xD;
           had a BOP score less than 10% and PD≤3mm, showed no attachment loss or radiographic bone&#xD;
           loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gingivitis groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consisted of individuals with a BOP score of 10% or greater and PD≤3mm with no&#xD;
           attachment or radiographic bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stage III -Grade C periodontitis groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consisted of individuals with interdental AL ≥5 mm, radiographic bone lose extending to&#xD;
      middle or apical third of the root, PD≥6 mm and tooth loss due to periodontitis of ≤4. Rapid&#xD;
      bone loss is observed compared to biofilm and % Root Bone Loss/age &gt;1.0 is determined as&#xD;
      grade C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AL caused by root caries in the cervical region of the tooth, gingival recession caused by&#xD;
      traumatic reasons, distal region of the second molar tooth due to extraction of the third&#xD;
      molar, lesion in the marginal periodontium of endodontic origin, vertical root fracture were&#xD;
      excluded from the study because they were not periodontal origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF samples were collected in the morning hours 24-48 hours after clinical periodontal&#xD;
      measurement. GCF was obtained using strips of filter paper† from the buccal part of an&#xD;
      interproximal region in each quadrant. In the Periodontitis group, GCF was obtained from the&#xD;
      regions where the most radiographic bone loss and SCD were observed. In these areas, if any,&#xD;
      the plaque was slightly removed with sterile tools, and the area was isolated with cotton&#xD;
      rolls. After drying the teeth with air, paper strips were placed in the gingival sulcus so&#xD;
      that they remained there for 30 seconds. Strips contaminated with blood or saliva were&#xD;
      removed from the study. The volume of absorbed GCF was determined by a calibrated electronic&#xD;
      device (Periotron 8010, oraflow). The strips were then immediately transferred to sterile&#xD;
      polypropylene tubes and frozen at -40°C for storage until analysis was carried out.The data&#xD;
      obtained in this study will be analyzed using the SPSS 17 package program. Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      and Shapiro Wilk's tests will be used to investigate the states of variables coming from the&#xD;
      normal distribution. 0.05 will be used as the level of significance when interpreting the&#xD;
      results; if p&lt;0.05, it will be stated that the variables do not adapt to the normal&#xD;
      distribution, and if p&gt;0.05, the variables adapt to the normal distribution. If the variables&#xD;
      do not adapt to the normal distribution, nonparametric Kruskal Wallis-H tests will be used&#xD;
      when examining the differences between the groups.&#xD;
