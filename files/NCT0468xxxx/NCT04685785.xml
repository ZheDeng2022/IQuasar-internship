    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a top-rated Prague rehabilitation school´s method. Part&#xD;
      of Prague rehabilitation school is called Mojžíšová Method, which is mainly used for the&#xD;
      treatment of back pain and woman´s non-structural sterility. This method offers an original,&#xD;
      innovative way, how to mobilize 1.- 7. costo-sternal joints. This type of mobilization is&#xD;
      very effective, fast and safe and probably widely used only in the Czech Republic. Mojžíšová&#xD;
      method uses the excentric force of patients pectoral muscle, passive stretch and shoulder&#xD;
      joint internal rotation. According to Mojžíšová, If one of the ribs joints has dysfunction&#xD;
      (limited range of motion), there can be found higher sensitivity of this joint, certain&#xD;
      muscle reflex spasm, hypersensitive zones and joint dysfunction. Probably the last study&#xD;
      evaluating this method was made in the 1990s.&#xD;

      This research aims to analyze the effect of mobilization of 1.-3-ribs joints in a&#xD;
      relationship in sensitivity and volume of neck and shoulders muscles. The ultrasonic&#xD;
      diagnostic method will be used to evaluate muscle volume before and after mobilization ribs&#xD;
      joints. Visual pain scale will be used to evaluate pain during palpation of certain muscles.&#xD;
      This research will examine 30 subjects, aged 19-26 years old, which will be divided into the&#xD;
      control and the experimental group. Each subject will be in both groups. In the control&#xD;
      group, we are going to analyze, if certain neck muscles keep the same volume for 5 minutes&#xD;
      during sitting position after ribs mobilization. The control group will evaluate if there are&#xD;
      any muscle volume and palpation muscle sensitivity change before and after mobilization of&#xD;
      the ribs joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of evidence for a relationship between the ribs joints and reflex spasms was the&#xD;
      motivation to make this study. During the research, I have found no study, which was aiming&#xD;
      to analyze the relationship between the mobilization of ribs joint and reflex muscle spasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject: Thirty subjects, men and woman, aged from 19 to 26 years old. Each included subject&#xD;
      has to be diagnosed with at least one sensitive 1.-3. costo-sternal connection. The study&#xD;
      examines the control and the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: During the entrance diagnostics, the examiner will palpate subject´s 1.-3.&#xD;
      costo-sternal connections and certain muscles on the same side of the sensitive connection.&#xD;
      Specifically m.scalenus anterior, medius and posterior, sternocleidomastoideus, levator&#xD;
      scapulae and trapezius. Those muscles are related to dysfunction of those connections&#xD;
      according to Mojžíšová. The subject will rate the sensitivity of those muscles on the visual&#xD;
      pain scale (0-10 scale). During palpation, the examiner will be using his index finger. The&#xD;
      subject will lay down on their back and turn their head 45 degrees away from the examined&#xD;
      side. Then the examiner will use sonograph to evaluate the volume of sternocleidomastoideus,&#xD;
      scalenus anterior and medius muscles, on the side, on the side of the sensitive joint. After&#xD;
      that, the subject will rest in sitting position for 5 minutes, and then the examiner will use&#xD;
      sonograph again to check the volume of those muscles, If there is any volume change without&#xD;
      joint mobilization. The subject will be placed in the same position, just as during the first&#xD;
      sonographic examination. Those data will be used for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this process, the examiner will mobilize 1.-3. costo-vertebral joints, using the&#xD;
      Mojžíšová technique. This technique will be done in the sitting position.&#xD;
