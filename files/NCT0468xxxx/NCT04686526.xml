      This study is a prospective observational cohort study implementing wearable&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor device and smartphone application in perioperative pain&#xD;
      management. Patients undergoing major abdominal surgical procedures will be recruited to wear&#xD;
      a ECG monitor device from the day before surgery until 1-3days after surgery. Patients will&#xD;
      report their condition of pain twice daily on the corresponding smartphone application based&#xD;
      on a structured and visualized pain report module. Patients will receive a telephone&#xD;
      follow-up 30/60/90/365 days after surgery for assessment of postoperative chronic pain. A&#xD;
      pilot study will be conducted to evaluate acceptability, safety and feasibility of the device&#xD;
      and application using system usability scale and comprehensive product quality assessment.&#xD;
      Further study will be conducted to evaluate the relationship between postoperative acute and&#xD;
      chronic pain and heart rate variability (HRV) acquired from ECG device.&#xD;
