    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week randomized, controlled study to investigate the effect of a Mediterranean&#xD;
      diet intervention on gastrointestinal function in Parkinson's disease. After a 2-week run-in&#xD;
      period, participants will be instructed to receive standard of care for constipation or&#xD;
      receive standard of care + follow a Mediterranean diet for 8 weeks and answer daily and&#xD;
      weekly questionnaires. Nutritional and neurological evaluations and stool samples will be&#xD;
      collected at 0, 4 and 8 weeks.&#xD;
