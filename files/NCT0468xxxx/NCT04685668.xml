      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childbirth care remains suboptimal in many low-resource settings, causing unacceptable&#xD;
      maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Realistic, context-tailored clinical support&#xD;
      is called for to assist birth attendants in providing best possible evidence-based and&#xD;
      respectful care. The PartoMa pilot study from Zanzibar suggested that co-created clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines and low-dose, high-frequency training were associated with care&#xD;
      improvements and perinatal survival. In the present study we will modify, implement and&#xD;
      evaluate this intervention in five urban, high-volume maternity units in Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is based on a theory of change, and includes three main steps: I. A&#xD;
      mixed-methods situational analysis will explore factors affecting care. Step II. Based on&#xD;
      step I., the PartoMa guidelines and training will be contextually modified through&#xD;
      discussions with birth attendants and postpartum women. III. The modified intervention will&#xD;
      be implemented through a stepped-wedge cluster trial, with embedded qualitative and economic&#xD;
      analyses. Women in active labour and their offspring will be followed until discharge to&#xD;
      assess intra-hospital stillbirths, intra-facility neonatal deaths and caesarean sections&#xD;
      without medical indications, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be measured.&#xD;
      Central intermediate outputs include health providers' knowledge, barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      to intervention use, and clinical performance.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, 300,000 women and 5 million children die each year in relation to childbirth. Most&#xD;
      would have survived had they been given proper care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple clinical guidelines have been developed to improve maternity care in low-resource&#xD;
      settings. However, they are often incompatible with the contextual realities. Maternity units&#xD;
      in low-resource settings often deal with limited capacity, high turnover of staff and an&#xD;
      unworkable ratio of labouring women per birth attendant. This often makes it impossible to&#xD;
      adhere to international clinical guidelines and calls for research on effective development,&#xD;
      implementation and upscaling of achievable clinical guidelines for such settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PartoMa project's focus on generating evidence-based and respectful childbirth care is a&#xD;
      key priority to reach the Sustainable Development Goals - particularly on birth-related&#xD;
      survival and gender equality, but also in regards to societal development and poverty&#xD;
      reduction. Also, the PartoMa project might serve as an example of context-tailored&#xD;
      development and implementation of guidelines for other areas of health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PartoMa Dar es Salaam intervention study will be carried out in the five highest volume&#xD;
      maternity units in the fast growing urban center of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: Amana Hospital,&#xD;
      Temeke Hospital, Mwanyamala Hospital, Sinza Health Centre, and Mbagala R. Health Centre. A&#xD;
      total of 50,000 births occur in these five facilities each year, providing a typical example&#xD;
      of overburdened urban maternity units in low-income countries. In these contexts, quality of&#xD;
      care is negatively impacted by lack of staff, persistent increases in births due to&#xD;
      urbanization, and increased demand for facility birth. These facilities primarily serve women&#xD;
      of lower socioeconomic background. Each birth attendant typically takes care of at least 3-6&#xD;
      labouring women simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze barriers, facilitators, effects and costs of implementing context-modified&#xD;
      clinical guidelines and low-dose, high-frequency training to improve the quality of care and&#xD;
      survival during birth in five urban, low-resource and high-volume maternity units in&#xD;
      Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To carry out a mixed-methods intrapartum care assessment in five maternity units, focusing&#xD;
      on the present and past structures within which care is given, processes of care provision&#xD;
      and birth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore and develop necessary context-modifications for the PartoMa intervention of&#xD;
      clinical guidelines and training to reflect birth attendants and labouring women's needs and&#xD;
      circumstances in the five maternity units, and to assess whether and how the resources and&#xD;
      experiences that hospital stakeholders bring to the process are informing and steering the&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the impact of the context-modified PartoMa intervention on perceptions,&#xD;
      knowledge and skills among birth attendants, quality of care and birth outcomes in the five&#xD;
      maternity units, and its cost-effectiveness as well as opportunities and barriers in the&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To develop a toolkit for co-creating and implementing clinical guidelines and associated&#xD;
      training that may be of relevance within and beyond maternal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess the structure within which care is provided, processes of care delivery and&#xD;
      birth outcome indicators will be analysed. Structural indicators will be assessed through&#xD;
      structured questionnaires for birth attendants and a checklist for each facility. To assess&#xD;
      the process of intrapartum clinical decision making, a case-control study will be conducted&#xD;
      of intrahospital stillbirths (positive foetal heart rate on admission) and neonatal deaths,&#xD;
      weighing at least 1000g, compared to randomly selected women with healthy perinatal outcomes&#xD;
      (Apgar score 7-10). Furthermore, to assess quality of routine clinical data collection and&#xD;
      use, the translations from clinical assessments to case file recordings (including partograph&#xD;
      use) and from case files to hospital registers will be analysed, by direct, structured&#xD;
      observations and reviews of case files and registers. Finally, a broader assessment of&#xD;
      outcomes and modes of birth will be conducted for all births during six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-creation process&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PartoMa intervention from Zanzibar, including guidelines and training, will be modified&#xD;
      in accordance with birth attendants' and pregnant women's needs and circumstances in the Dar&#xD;
      es Salaam context. Based on the results of the situational analysis, a first draft of the&#xD;
      modified intervention will be developed by the research team and shared with co-creators,&#xD;
      including skilled birth attendants, hospital management and women who have given birth at the&#xD;
      facilities. Through focus group discussions, co-creators will share their perspectives, which&#xD;
      will inform further modifications of the guidelines and training content, and possibly&#xD;
      changes to the training implementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first implementation month in the first maternity unit to receive the intervention will&#xD;
      function as pilot testing and might lead to further modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention implementation and evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall implementation design will be a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial&#xD;
      where each of the five maternity units represents a cluster receiving the intervention at the&#xD;
      cluster-level. In a random order, the maternity units will receive the intervention with&#xD;
      three-month intervals. Informed by the logical pathway, the evaluation levels follow the&#xD;
      Kirkpatrick model, including birth attendants' perceptions and reactions, their changes in&#xD;
      learning and clinical care practices, and resulting changes in birth outcomes. The cost of&#xD;
      co-creation and implementation will be collected alongside the entire study to analyze the&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training seminars, participants' perceptions, return rate and learning over time&#xD;
      will be assessed by providing all attendants with a unique research number. As no per diems&#xD;
      or allowances are paid and the seminars happen outside working hours, attendance will be&#xD;
      considered an indicator of interest and motivation to learn about the intervention. At each&#xD;
      quarterly seminar that health providers choose to attend, they will be asked to fill in a&#xD;
      Likert-scale questionnaire-based evaluation on their experiences of the intervention and a&#xD;
      questionnaire-based knowledge and partograph skills test (before and after the seminar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary birth outcome variables will be prospectively measured from&#xD;
      baseline and until 12 months after the last facility receives the intervention, including&#xD;
      stillbirths weighing at least 1000g with positive foetal heart rate on admission, Apgar score&#xD;
      1-6, and mode of birth. The outcome data will be gathered daily from hospital registers and&#xD;
      medical records, and cross-checked with the facilities' routinely kept birth registers. Women&#xD;
      referred to other facilities during labour will be followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During baseline and the 5th and 10th implementation months, the structure for care delivery,&#xD;
      usage of the PartoMa guidelines and elements of (dis)respectful care will be assessed by&#xD;
      structured observations. To assess potential changes in quality of intrapartum care,&#xD;
      criterion-based audits of case files will be conducted at each facility during baseline and&#xD;
      the 9th-12th implementation months, among a randomly-selected subgroup of labouring women,&#xD;
      and among births by emergency caesarean section and vacuum extraction. Case files will be&#xD;
      identified and included during the continual daily collection of birth outcome data. Results&#xD;
      of the situational analysis will inform final sample size calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant pathways and contextual factors contributing to the potential measurable changes in&#xD;
      care and outcomes related to the PartoMa intervention will be unpacked. As in the situational&#xD;
      analysis, this investigation will initially be limited to two of the facilities, but may&#xD;
      broaden if emerging findings suggest relevance of studying other of the facilities (e.g.&#xD;
      major differences in intervention use). This component will engage birth attendants and&#xD;
      hospital leadership using different qualitative methods, a qualitative researcher will&#xD;
      facilitate a series of task-based investigations: i. examine barriers and facilitators in the&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention through individual interviews; ii. elicit 'stories of&#xD;
      change' through photography and diary keeping; and iii. unpack collective experiences and&#xD;
      perspectives on the strengths and limitations of the PartoMa guidelines and associated&#xD;
      activities through focus group discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pragmatic cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a health care and societal&#xD;
      perspective, considering incremental costs and effects related to the intervention. Cost data&#xD;
      will be collected for both the intervention co-creation and the implementation. Cost will&#xD;
      relate to transport, time, commodities for trainings as well as running and capital costs for&#xD;
      training facilities. Data will be collected by participant questionnaires and original&#xD;
      receipts for direct and indirect costs as well as daily reports on activities of&#xD;
      facilitators, trainers and experts throughout co-creation and implementation. Fixed hourly&#xD;
      rates based on national salary scales will be used to calculate the costs per hour. Costs&#xD;
      will be adjusted by fixed-time exchange rates and purchasing power parity. Effects will be&#xD;
      measured in natural units related to maternal complications, intrahospital stillbirths, Apgar&#xD;
      score below 7 and non-medically indicated caesarean sections. A discount rate of 3% will be&#xD;
      applied to both costs and effect. Changes in birth outcomes (stillbirths and low Apgar score)&#xD;
      will be transformed to Disability-Adjusted Life Years' (DALY's) of a birth cohort by using&#xD;
      latest Burden of Disease disability weights and construction of a Markov model to estimate&#xD;
      DALYs lost or averted in a lifetime perspective. Finally, the incremental cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      ratio (ICER) will be calculated and related to alternative strategies for improving care&#xD;
      during birth in a low-resource context, including the frequently used World Health&#xD;
      Organization threshold of three times national Gross Domestic Product per DALY to estimate&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. Sub-group analysis will be conducted for mode of birth (vaginal,&#xD;
      caesarian section, instrumental delivery). Base case of costs and effect will be explored in&#xD;
      univariate sensitivity analysis. Non-parametric bootstrap method will be used to estimate the&#xD;
      sampling distribution of the ICER and subsequently compute the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      acceptability curve across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds.&#xD;
