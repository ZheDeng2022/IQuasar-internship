  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, men who have sex with men (MSM) born abroad are the most affected population by&#xD;
      HIV, in terms of HIV incidence and prevalence of undiagnosed infections. Close to 50% of&#xD;
      born-abroad HIV-infected MSM are living in the region of Ile-de-France, which is the&#xD;
      metropolitan area of Paris. Recent European data, not including France, suggest that&#xD;
      born-abroad MSM have the highest rate of post-migration HIV acquisition. Many vulnerability&#xD;
      factors could explain le burden of HIV in this group of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of vulnerability factors related to post-migration HIV acquisition&#xD;
      should allow to improve HIV prevention and screening strategies among born-abroad MSM living&#xD;
      in France. This, in turn, should reduce the burden of HIV in this population in France.&#xD;

      A better understanding of vulnerability factors related to post-migration HIV acquisition&#xD;
      should allow to improve HIV prevention and screening strategies among born-abroad MSM living&#xD;
      in France. This, in turn, should reduce the burden of HIV in this population in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, cross-sectional, two-year study in the region Ile-de-France. The study is based&#xD;
      on the self-completion of a questionnaire, built after an exploratory qualitative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constitution of a representative sample of born-abroad HIV-infected MSM from patients&#xD;
      followed up for HIV in Paris area. Questionnaires will collect data needed to estimate the&#xD;
      post-migration HIV acquisition rates, and will explore contextual and individual factors&#xD;
      leading to high exposure to HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will complete a questionnaire translated into 5 languages (English, Spanish,&#xD;
      Portuguese, Arabic, and Russian) in order to allow almost all of the participants to answer&#xD;
      the survey themselves, without assistance. In order to not exclude those who cannot read, or&#xD;
      those who do not master any of the 6 languages offered, the questionnaire may be administered&#xD;
      with the assistance of a member of the research team of the associated center, including&#xD;
      through a telephone interpretation service. A brief eCRF will collect clinical and biological&#xD;
      data, and historical viral sequences in associated virology departments, when available.&#xD;
