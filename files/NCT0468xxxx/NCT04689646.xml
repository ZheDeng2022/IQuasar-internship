  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if a mind-body intervention can help people suffering&#xD;
      from chronic back pain. The study is a randomized, partially blinded trial examining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a mind body intervention in reducing disability from back pain and&#xD;
      alleviating back pain in participants as compared to usual care and an active control (second&#xD;
      mind body intervention). The investigators will secondarily investigate whether the&#xD;
      intervention alleviates anxiety related to the pain and other quality of life parameters.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor) Participants will be partially blinded. Participants in the usual care arm will be blinded to the specifics of the interventions. Participants in Mind-Body Intervention 2 arm will be blinded to the specifics of the interventions. Intervention participants will be blinded to the specifics of the intervention until after they have been randomized into that arm. Data analysis will be conducted by persons who are completely blinded.</masking_description>
