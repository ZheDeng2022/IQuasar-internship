    <textblock>
      This study is single center, subject will receive a wireless TENS device. All subjects will&#xD;
      be allowed to keep the commercially-available device for use after the study. The primary&#xD;
      goal is to test the feasibility of the study design and secondary is to test the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the TENS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is single center, subject will receive a wireless TENS device. The coordinator&#xD;
      will introduce the study device, be available to answer questions about the device, and&#xD;
      assess adverse events. Subjects will be told that we are testing whether TENS, which has&#xD;
      shown promise in some patients but needs to be tested formally, has an effects on lower limb&#xD;
      swelling . The treatment period will be 3 weeks in duration. After the treatment period, all&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to complete the Treatment-period Endpoint-Qualitative interview. All&#xD;
      subjects will be allowed to keep the commercially-available device for use after the study.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impression of Change in Edema Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Impression of change in edema symptoms is measured from baseline to first endpoint and first endpoint to second endpoint. The form uses a 1 - 7 scale, with anchors &quot;very much improved&quot;, &quot;much improved&quot;, &quot;minimally improved&quot;, &quot;not changed&quot;, &quot;minimally worse&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot;, or &quot;very much worse&quot;, with [1 = very much improved, 7 = very much worse].

    <description>Quality of life is measure over the course of the study using a 1 - 4 scale, with anchors &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;a little bit&quot;, &quot;quite a bit&quot;, or &quot;very much&quot;, with [0 = not at all, 4 = very much]. If the question is not applicable the scale value is 0. Overall quality of life (Q22) is measure using a 0 - 10 NRS scores [0 = poor, 10 = excellent]. Each answer's score is summed by domain, Function 1-3; Appearance 4-9; Symptoms 10-15; and Mood 16-21. Each domain score is by the total number of questions answered in the domain. If fewer than 50% of the items were answered, the whole domain is scored as 0. The higher the LYMQOL (Lymphoedema Quality of Life) domain scores the more severe the edema. The 5th domain, Overall quality of life 22, is measure using a 0 - 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, with [0 = poor, 10 = excellent]. The range of scores the participant can achieve per domain is: Function 0 - 32; Appearance 0 - 24; Symptoms 0 - 24; Mood 0 - 24; and Overall quality of life 0 - 10.</description>
