  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NAFLD, closely linked to overweight and insulin resistance, has reached 25% prevalence&#xD;
      worldwide. Advanced liver fibrosis(ALF) must be accurately diagnosed in NAFLD because it&#xD;
      defines a subgroup of patients with impaired prognosis, and these patients need a specific&#xD;
      management to prevent the occurrence of liver-related complication. Relatively few NAFLD&#xD;
      patients develop ALF and it is a challenge for physicians to identify them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy is the reference for liver fibrosis evaluation but this invasive procedure&#xD;
      cannot be first-line used in NAFLD. Non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis is now&#xD;
      available, especially liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with Fibroscan and blood fibrosis&#xD;
      tests. However, Fibroscan is a costly device available only in few specialized centres with&#xD;
      thus poor accessibility in face of the large NAFLD population. Blood fibrosis tests can be&#xD;
      performed by every physician and are distinguished as &quot;complex&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. Because they&#xD;
      include specialized biomarkers, complex blood fibrosis tests are accurate for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of ALF but they are quite expensive and not reimbursed, with therefore limited use in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Simple blood fibrosis tests have the advantage to include cheap and&#xD;
      easy-to-obtain biomarkers with simple calculation thanks to free websites or smartphone&#xD;
      applications. Simple blood fibrosis tests are globally less accurate than complex blood&#xD;
      fibrosis tests or Fibroscan but, used with a high-sensitivity cut-off, they have the high&#xD;
      interest of being able to accurately rule out advanced fibrosis in a significant proportion&#xD;
      of NAFLD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two sequential diagnostic procedures have been developed for the diagnosis of ALF&#xD;
      with the idea to combine the advantages of the different kind of fibrosis tests: the&#xD;
      FIB4-Fibroscan (FIB4-FS) and the eLIFT-FibroMeterVCTE (eLIFT-FMVCTE) algorithms. These&#xD;
      algorithms include as first-line procedure a simple blood fibrosis test (FIB4 or eLIFT) which&#xD;
      identifies the patients who require a further second-line evaluation with a more accurate&#xD;
      non-invasive test (Fibroscan or FibroMeterVCTE). Liver biopsy is finally used as third-line&#xD;
      procedure in patients for whom the diagnosis remains undetermined. Such algorithms have the&#xD;
      advantage to limit the use of complex fibrosis tests only to a subset of at risk-patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRAFIC study compare two strategies for the diagnosis of ALF in NAFLD patients: the&#xD;
      FIB4-Fibroscan algorithm and the eLIFT-FibroMeterVCTE algorithm&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FIB4-FS and the eLIFT-FMVCTE were previosuly directly compared in a database of biopsy-proven&#xD;
      NAFLD patients. These two algorithms showed a very good &gt;80% diagnostic accuracy for advanced&#xD;
      fibrosis and a very low &lt;15% rate of liver biopsy requirement. The eLIFT-FMVCTE had a&#xD;
      significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (84.6% vs 80.6%, p=0.15), was more specific, and&#xD;
      provided higher negative and positive predictive value and higher non-invasive diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy. Finally, these preliminary results suggested the eLIFT-FMVCTE was most suitable for&#xD;
      clinical practice than the FIB4-FS. However, because almost all these patients from this&#xD;
      preliminary comparative study came from the population where the eLIFT-FMVCTE was developed&#xD;
      with thus an optimism bias, the results from this direct comparison require further&#xD;
      validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, FIB4-FS and the eLIFT-FMVCTE algorithms must now be evaluated and compared in an&#xD;
      independent population of NAFLD patients to determine which strategy is the best one for&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

Low-risk group (neither metabolic syndrome nor AST ≥35 UI/l): Liver biopsy won't be mandatory in this group because of the very low risk of advanced fibrosis (4%). These patients will be considered as having no-mild F0-2 liver fibrosis and the study visit will be scheduled for clinical data recording, blood sampling, and LSM with Fibroscan. Liver biopsy could still be performed in the low-risk group if the investigator deems it is required for the clinical management of the patient.&#xD;
At-risk group (presence of a metabolic syndrome and/or AST ≥35 UI/l): Because of the increased prevalence of significant liver lesions in this group, the patients will have a liver biopsy with clinical data recording, blood sampling, and Fibroscan the same day.</description>
