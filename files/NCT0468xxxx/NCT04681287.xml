      This study plans to explore the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with inetetamab&#xD;
      and PD-1 inhibitors in HER2 positive advanced breast cancer who failed to receive trastuzumab&#xD;
      and TKIs, and explore the dominant population of dual antibody combination to further guide&#xD;
      the precise and individualized treatment of advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.&#xD;
