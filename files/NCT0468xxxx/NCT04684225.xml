    <textblock>
      The effects of exercises performed by telerehabilitation on individuals with hand-affected&#xD;
      scleroderma on range of motion, grip strength, function, sensation, daily life activities and&#xD;
      general health will be compared with the effects of home-exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the evaluation results will be published; and after all data are collected, the&#xD;
      results will be published.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand Mobility in Scleroderma (HAMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hand Mobility in Scleroderma is a hand function test developed for adults who have systemic sclerosis. HAMIS consists of 9 items designed to measure all movements assessed in an ordinary range of motion-measured hand test. Each item is graded on a 0-3 scale, where 0 corresponds to normal function and 3 denotes that the individual is unable to perform the item. Each hand is assessed separately. The total score of HAMIS for each hand is 370 Sandqvist and Eklund Vol. 13, No. 6, December 2000 27, which represents a high degree of dysfunction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>9-Hole Peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to evaluate patients' hand and finger skills. The pegboard is placed in the middle of the body. It is desirable that 9 wooden pins be placed randomly in the 9-hole wooden block as fast as possible, and then the pins are removed from the wooden block and placed in the storage compartment one by one. These times are measured and recorded with a stopwatch. A total of 20 seconds or more is considered a &quot;loss of skill&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire is a measurement tool for evaluating function in individuals with systemic scleroderma and has been used in a number of countries. SHAQ is made up of 20 items distributed among eight domains and has five additional domains that assess dysfunctions caused by the symptoms of systemic scleroderma. For this, five visual analogue scales (VASs) are used. The scores on these scales are converted to subscores ranging from 0 to 3 points. The overall score of the questionnaire is the sum of each of the five VAS subscores and the scores for the eight domains, divided by 13. Lower score indicates better health status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Semmes Weinstein Monofilaman Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of pain and paresthesia symptoms of the patients will be assessed using the 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale. Before the assessment, patients instruct that &quot;0&quot; for &quot;no symptoms&quot;, &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;the most severe pain that could be felt&quot; and should mark the point that best describes the symptom. The patient's rest, activity and night pain in the last week will be questioned separately. To evaluate the paresthesia, the most severe paresthesia felt by the patient in the last 1 week will be questioned and it will be asked to mark the place that best expresses paresthesia on the scale. Marked points measure by a ruler and record in centimeters.</description>
