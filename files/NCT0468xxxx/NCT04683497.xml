      BACKGROUND: Pancreatic Cancer (PC) is one of the leading cancer-related causes of death&#xD;
      worldwide, with the majority of patients undergoing potentially curative surgery. In this&#xD;
      context, the implementation of an accurate imaging modality is crucial in order to facilitate&#xD;
      the clinical decision-making on the basis of tumor resectability. The contrast enhanced&#xD;
      intraoperative ultrasound (CE-IOUS) is a relatively new imaging modality that has been&#xD;
      employed in the detection mainly of colorectal liver metastases, but not for those of&#xD;
      pancreatic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The purpose of the present study is to validate the CE-IOUS in adult patients undergoing&#xD;
      pancreatic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Prospective single-center analysis of all consecutive patients with PC undergoing&#xD;
      pancreatic surgery from a single hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery team between December&#xD;
      1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2022 will be performed. Baseline characteristics, type of&#xD;
      surgery, intraoperative parameters, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      stay, postoperative morbidity and 30-day mortality data will be obtained from the database.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the clinical utility, defining its ability to change surgical&#xD;
      operation on the basis of its findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIMITATIONS: The key limitation is the inclusion of only one HPB surgery team from one&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRENGTHS: This study will potentially be the first to evaluate EC-IOUS and to compare it&#xD;
      with the IOUS, CT and MRI for pancreatic surgical patients.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal types of cancer. In fact, is&#xD;
      usually detected in an advanced stage, thus being associated with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Therefore, every surgical intervention has to be precise. Furthermore, the staging of a tumor&#xD;
      indicates the resectability of the tumor and the optimal extent of the surgery. In this&#xD;
      context, spiral computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) are employed&#xD;
      preoperatively to identify liver metastases but they demonstrate lower sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity than intraoperative ultrasound examination (IOUS) in a number of settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOUS was applied in pancreatic tumors during 1980s for the first time. At liver metastases&#xD;
      detection IOUS significantly exceeds CT or MRI in sensitivity, reaching 94-96 % even at small&#xD;
      focci with 3-5 mm dimensions. According to Kolesnik, 2015 study IOUS is a convenient method&#xD;
      to use and demonstrates superiority over CT and MRI, such as obtaining dynamic image with&#xD;
      possibility of correction and new data acquisition at any moment of operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there is a growing trend of implementing contrast-enhanced IOUS (CE-IOUS) in order&#xD;
      to identify potential liver metastases intraoperatively. Nonetheless, no real clinical&#xD;
      studies on CE-IOUS have been published to evaluate its efficacy in pancreatic surgery. In&#xD;
      fact, with CE-IOUS all small vessels and capillaries can be visualized using&#xD;
      microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agents. This could benefit by dynamic real-time imaging&#xD;
      modality for pancreatic metastases with abnormal vascularization, because isoechoic lesions&#xD;
      are underappreciated on IOUS. Additionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could induce steatosis&#xD;
      (which impairs ultrasound imaging) and cause a certain number of metastases to vanish posing&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, that require the surgeon to adapt the surgical&#xD;
      procedure accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical utility of CE-IOUS, we will conduct the first, to the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, prospective trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CE-IOUS in the context of&#xD;
      pancreatic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Material and methods Following approval by the Ethics Committee, the present study will be&#xD;
      performed in the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Our primary endpoint is to assess&#xD;
      the clinical utility (CU) of CE-IOUS regarding the identification of liver metastases in&#xD;
      patients undergoing curative surgery for pancreatic cancer. CU is defined as the justified&#xD;
      change in planned surgical strategy (conversion from therapeutic to palliative surgery) using&#xD;
      CE-IOUS, based on the identification of new liver metastases that were not described by&#xD;
      preoperative imaging modalities. Our secondary objectives are to outline technical modalities&#xD;
      of CE-IOUS regarding the dosage and duration of contrast agent administration, compare&#xD;
      CE-IOUS with CT, MRI, and IOUS, and to assess the CU of CE-IOUS in the subgroup of patients&#xD;
      with missing metastases after neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients aged &gt; 18 years with resectable, borderline resectable or locally&#xD;
      advanced+neoadjuvant-treatment pancreatic cancer undergoing surgery between December 2020 and&#xD;
      December 2022 will be included. All patients will sign an informed consent. Patients allergic&#xD;
      to contrast solution, patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or those with unstable&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, or severe arrhythmias, or pregnant or breastfeeding women, will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative staging For patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer, the evaluation&#xD;
      will include a CT, liver MRI (in case of neoadjuvant treatment), EUS in certain cases,&#xD;
      CA19-9, biochemical assessment within 8 weeks. This evaluation will be validated by the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative ultrasound: conventional and contrast-enhanced We will use contrast agent&#xD;
      which remains in the vascular compartment. The dual-screen mode allows checking whether the&#xD;
      lesion is visible, suspected with difficulty or completely undetectable by conventional&#xD;
      ultrasound. Following a laparotomy and liver mobilization, conventional IOUS will be&#xD;
      performed to confirm the preoperative tumor staging and to search for new occult liver&#xD;
      nodules. After IOUS, a bolus of perflubutane suspension will be injected through a peripheral&#xD;
      vein at a microbubble doses of 1.5-4 μL. A systematic ultrasonic liver screening will then be&#xD;
      performed using the harmonic mode at 10-15 min after contrast injection, with the focus point&#xD;
      set at the bottom of the liver (CE-IOUS). Any hypoechoic liver nodule that was visible during&#xD;
      CE-IOUS was considered to be a liver metastasis, except for the nodules that were diagnosed&#xD;
      as cyst or hemangioma using the preoperative CT and MRI. All the IOUS and CE-IOUS procedures&#xD;
      will be performed by a Resident Radiologist, supervised by an experienced Radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visualisation of lesions Following the contrast agent injection, healthy liver takes up the&#xD;
      contrast uniformly while the metastases initially appear as a bright signal in an arterial&#xD;
      phase (&quot;wash in&quot;). The metastases are then washed (&quot;wash out&quot;), which appear as gaps without&#xD;
      contrast in venous phase. If the low signal disappears within 45 s, then the lesions are&#xD;
      considered benign. Conversely, the low signal of malignant lesions lasts beyond 45 s and over&#xD;
      several minutes. Indeterminate lesions are those that do not precisely correspond to either&#xD;
      of the two previous definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The planned surgery decision will be recorded following conventional IOUS, as&#xD;
      well as with CE-IOUS during surgery. For a given patient, we will conclude that the CE-IOUS&#xD;
      had CU if the two planned decisions are different and if the modification is justified. A&#xD;
      justification could be: 1. pathological findings following CE-IOUS confirmed malignancy in&#xD;
      case of larger resection, 2. pathological findings following CE-IOUS confirmed absence of&#xD;
      malignancy in case of smaller resection in a given site that would have been treated without&#xD;
      CE-IOUS, 3. for absence of liver resection, pathological exam of biopsy confirmed the absence&#xD;
      or presence of malignancy of the lesions that were not removed, or 4. If biopsy is not&#xD;
      feasible or interpretable, the justification of the surgical procedure has to be confirmed&#xD;
      with the 3-month radiological follow-up (in the absence of post-surgery chemotherapy;&#xD;
      otherwise in case of chemotherapy within 3 months, we considered that lesions were&#xD;
      malignant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The results will be analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 for Mac (GraphPad&#xD;
      Software, San Diego, CA). Normal distribution of the data will be performed by application of&#xD;
      the D'Agostino and Pearson Omnibus normality test. Comparisons of continuous variables will&#xD;
      be performed with two-tailed unpaired t-test for parametric data and Mann-Whitney U-test for&#xD;
      nonparametric data. The categorical outcomes will be tabulated in 2x2 tables and will be&#xD;
      assessed by employing the Chi square test. Differences will be deemed significant with a p ≤&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
