      Geriatric presentations to emergency services comprise a significant percentage of all&#xD;
      emergency service presentations in Europe and it has been reported that 3-23% of all&#xD;
      emergency service presentations from various regions of the countries. There are specific&#xD;
      management practices for patients who are 65 years and older at emergency services. On the&#xD;
      other hand several risk-scoring systems have been developed to define the severity class of&#xD;
      the patient during their initial evaluation at emergency services.Only a few studies in the&#xD;
      literature have evaluated risk-scoring systems for the geriatric patient group.Several&#xD;
      studies have reported that risk-scoring systems, such as Identification of Seniors at Risk&#xD;
      and Triage Risk Screening Tool, which are specifically developed for geriatric patients over&#xD;
      65 years who present to emergency services, are not sufficiently effective for evaluating&#xD;
      patients in more severe conditions. Previously the TEDGeS (Turkish Emergency Departments&#xD;
      Geriatric Scoring Study) pilot study was carried out and published by some of the&#xD;
      investigators of this project.This pilot study enrolled all geriatric patients (age ≥ 65&#xD;
      years) and carried out in 13 centers from different cities of Turkey. This pilot study showed&#xD;
      that geriatric patients not only constitute significant proportion of emergency department&#xD;
      presentations but also these patients need more hospitalization. The predictive powers of the&#xD;
      Modified Early Warning Score, Rapid Emergency Medicine Score and The Vital PAC Early Warning&#xD;
      Score for hospitalization and mortality in geriatric patients those presented to emergency&#xD;
      department are significantly high and might be concerned in the emergency department triage&#xD;
      of these patients. Within the light of these pilot study results, the investigators have&#xD;
      decided to execute this prospective, multinational, multicentric study with the main&#xD;
      objective to determine the epidemiological and age related characteristics of geriatric&#xD;
      patients presenting to the emergency department across Europe and evaluate early warning&#xD;
      scoring systems systems regarding hospitalization, ICU admission and in-hospital mortality&#xD;
      for geriatric patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment modalities, life expectancy worldwide has&#xD;
      risen. The number of adults over 65 years of age who are presenting to emergency services is&#xD;
      increasing in parallel with the prolongation of the average life expectancy. While geriatric&#xD;
      presentations to emergency services comprise 40-50% of all emergency service presentations in&#xD;
      the U.S., it has been reported that 3-23% of all emergency service presentations from various&#xD;
      regions of the country comprise patients of 65 years of age and older. There are specific&#xD;
      management practices for patients who are 65 years and older at emergency services due to the&#xD;
      presence of co-morbidities and the change of physiological responses to acute diseases in&#xD;
      advanced age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several risk-scoring systems have been developed to define the severity class of the patient&#xD;
      during their initial evaluation at emergency services and generally named as Early Warning&#xD;
      Scores. Early Warning Scores (EWS) incorporate physiological measurements, which do predict&#xD;
      outcome although the addition of other simple clinical parameters might further improve the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of these scores. On the other hand all these EWS are simple and&#xD;
      easy to calculate, making their use appropriate in an emergency setting. Of these EWS, the&#xD;
      Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) have been&#xD;
      widely used for many years (8) and The Vital PAC Early Warning Score (VIEWS) score was&#xD;
      recently developed for the same purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few studies in the literature have evaluated risk-scoring systems for the geriatric&#xD;
      patient group. Several studies have reported that risk-scoring systems, such as&#xD;
      Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR) and Triage Risk Screening Tool (TRST), which are&#xD;
      specifically developed for geriatric patients over 65 years who present to emergency&#xD;
      services, are not sufficiently effective for evaluating patients in more severe conditions.&#xD;
      Other studies have reported that the ESI triage classification predicts the prognosis&#xD;
      correctly in only half of the patients over 65 years of age. In another study that evaluated&#xD;
      the MEWS for the geriatric patient group, which was calculated during the presentation in&#xD;
      emergency services, has been stated to have a prognostic value in terms of a poor result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously the TEDGeS (Turkish Emergency Departments Geriatric Scoring Study) pilot study was&#xD;
      carried out and published. This study enrolled all geriatric patients (age ≥ 65 years) and&#xD;
      carried out in 13 centers (University Hospitals, Government Education and Research Hospitals&#xD;
      and Military Hospital Emergency Departments) from different cities of Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key findings were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall 30 % of hospitalized patients from Emergency Department (ED) are elderly&#xD;
           patients and 30 % of these hospitalized patients were ICU hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In hospital mortality rate is about 6 % which is very high for general hospitalized&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most common presenting symptoms are related to gastrointestinal systems and about 80&#xD;
           % of the cases using at least one chronic medication (22.2 % of the cases using more&#xD;
           than 4 chronic medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 45 % of the cases final diagnosis are related to cardiovascular system and&#xD;
           gastrointestinal system and nearly 85 % of the hospitalized cases are treated in&#xD;
           non-surgical clinics (cardiology-pulmonology-internal medicine 65 %)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEWS, VIEWS and REMS scores are significantly high in hospitalized patients compared to&#xD;
           discharged from ED and also these three scores are high in ICU hospitalized patients&#xD;
           compared to both ward hospitalized and discharged patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEWS, VIEWS and REMS scores are significantly high in non-survivors compared to&#xD;
           survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEWS, VIEWS scores has higher sensitivity and specificity in terms of in-hospital&#xD;
           mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results suggest that geriatric patients not only constitute significant proportion of&#xD;
      ED presentations but also they need more hospitalization. The predictive powers of the MEWS,&#xD;
      VIEWS and REMS scores for hospitalization and mortality in geriatric patients those presented&#xD;
      to ED are significantly high and might be concerned in the ED triage of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the light of these results this multinational, multicentric, prospective, non&#xD;
      interventional, observational study on geriatric patients presented to ED. The main objective&#xD;
      is 'To determine Epidemiologic and Age Related Characteristics of Geriatric Patients&#xD;
      presenting to the ED across Europe' and secondary objectives are 'To evaluate Early Warning&#xD;
      Scoring systems (REMS, MEWS and VIEWS Scores) and determine most suitable Geriatric Emergency&#xD;
      Medicine Risk Score regarding hospitalization, ICU admission and in-hospital mortality for&#xD;
      patients; To determine the most effective triage elements that can be used to predict&#xD;
      hospitalization of geriatric patients presented to ED; To determine the in hospital mortality&#xD;
      and short term mortality rates of the patients above 65 years of age presenting to the ED&#xD;
      across Europe; Sub analysis of ED discharged patients versus admitted patients for&#xD;
      characteristics, comparison to recommended care and re-ED visit; Comparison of European data&#xD;
      characteristics, investigation, treatment and outcome to similar data in other part of the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
