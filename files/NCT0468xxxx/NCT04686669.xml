  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomised, open-label, three-way, three-period, crossover relative&#xD;
      bioavailability study to assess the single-dose pharmacokinetics of FOR-6219 in capsule and&#xD;
      tablet formulations in postmenopausal women. The effect of high-fat food on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation will also be evaluated. A total of twelve,&#xD;
      post-menopausal women, will be randomised to receive a single oral dose of FOR-6219 in three&#xD;
      treatment periods: capsule formulation (fasted); tablet formulation (fed); tablet formulation&#xD;
      (fasted)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness that are not stable or&#xD;
             may require a change in treatment, use of prohibited therapies during the study or&#xD;
