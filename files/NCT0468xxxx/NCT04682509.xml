  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the feasibility of a 2 week course of&#xD;
      glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret) starting immediately prior to transplantation to treat&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) in kidney transplant recipients who receive a kidney from a donor&#xD;
      with HCV.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, pilot study. The patient population will&#xD;
      include 20 patients who are on the kidney transplant waitlist at NYU Langone Health, are&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) negative, are willing to accept an organ from an HCV positive donor,&#xD;
      and consent to participate in this trial. Study subjects will receive a kidney transplant&#xD;
      from a deceased donor who tested positive for HCV as confirmed by nucleic acid amplification&#xD;
      testing (NAT) per standard of care. All study subjects will receive a two week course of&#xD;
      preemptive therapy with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret®), starting on postoperative day&#xD;
      (POD) 0 prior to the transplant. If HCV RNA is undetectable after 2 weeks of therapy, Mavyret&#xD;
      will be discontinued and study subjects will be followed with an intensive HCV monitoring&#xD;
      protocol. If HCV RNA is detectable after 2 weeks of therapy, Mavyret will be continued to&#xD;
      complete a full course of 8 weeks per standard of care. All patients will undergo close&#xD;
      monitoring and surveillance for HCV viremia post-transplant to ensure that sustained&#xD;
      virologic response (SVR) is achieved.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will have regular follow-up as standard-of-care for all kidney transplant recipients. Patients' survival will be readily apparent. Furthermore, all deaths of transplant recipients and allograft losses within the first year of transplant are required to be reported to UNOS. Survival rates will be reported as a percentage.</description>

    <description>This parameter is being used to measure overall graft function and will be described using the median value at 1 year post transplant for the cohort. All transplant recipients will have regular follow-up as standard-of-care and eGFR will be calculated using the MDRD equation.</description>

    <description>All transplant recipients will have regular follow-up as routine clinical care and as such, will receive for cause biopsies per standard of care if there is a clinical suspicion of rejection. Biopsies will be read by a renal pathologist per standard of care and reported in the EPIC system. The incidence of rejection will be calculated as a percentage of the patients with diagnosed rejection on biopsy within 1 year of transplant.</description>

    <description>Measuring serial HCV RNA Quantitative (PCR) starting immediately after transplant and continued throughout the duration of the study. A patient will be considered to be viremic when a post-transplant HCV RNA Quantitative (PCR) test is positive. The incidence of viremia after transplant will be calculated as the percent of the patients transplanted with an HCV-positive donor who subsequently developed HCV viremia (detected by RNA Quantitative (PCR) testing). The incidence of viremia after two weeks of treatment will be calculated as the percentage of the patients with detectable HCV viremia (detected by RNA Quantitative (PCR) testing) after completing 2 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and therefore require continuation of therapy to complete an 8 week course</description>
