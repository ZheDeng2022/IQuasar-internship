  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and clinical activity of BION-1301 in adults with IgA nephropathy&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study of BION-1301, a&#xD;
      first-in-class humanized IgG4 anti-a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who previously participated in Study ADU-CL-19 (NCT03945318) will receive open-label&#xD;
      treatment with BION-1301 for up to approximately 2 years. Study participants will receive&#xD;
      BION-1301 at the same dose, route, and dosing schedule as they received in ADU-CL-19. Dose,&#xD;
      route, and/or dosing schedule may be changed during the OLE study based on a review by the&#xD;
      Safety Review Team of all available PK, PD, and clinical activity data from previous and&#xD;
      ongoing studies of BION-1301.&#xD;
