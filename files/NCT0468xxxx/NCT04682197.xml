      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of Cereset Research to improve the symptoms&#xD;
      of stress in healthcare workers in an open label, waitlist controlled pilot clinical trial,&#xD;
      during the period of COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of CR to improve the Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale (PSS) in healthcare workers with symptoms of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of CR on the self-reported measures of&#xD;
      sleep and anxiety. Exploratory measure include a variety of symptom inventories (mood,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress, quality of life, social support, and cognitive function), and&#xD;
      autonomic cardiovascular regulation (heart rate variability, HRV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a single site, open label, randomized, waitlist controlled pilot&#xD;
      clinical trial, enrolling adults aged 18 or older, who have self-reported symptoms of stress&#xD;
      or anxiety, and meet a threshold score on self-reported inventories. Up to 166 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in order to have at least 138 to complete the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either an Early Intervention (EI) group which will receive 4 CR sessions&#xD;
      of audible tones echoing current brainwave activity, following enrollment, or a Delayed&#xD;
      Intervention (DI) group which will continue current care only, and will serve as a control&#xD;
      group. Participants in both groups will continue their other current care throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be interval change in The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) which&#xD;
      assesses the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's&#xD;
      life are appraised as stressful. Secondary outcomes include insomnia (Insomnia Severity&#xD;
      Index, ISI) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7). Exploratory outcomes to be&#xD;
      collected include symptom inventories for depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies-&#xD;
      Depression Scale, CES-D), traumatic stress (PTSD Checklist for civilians, PCL-C), overall&#xD;
      quality of life (QOLS), social support (ISEL-12), the Multiple Ability Self-Report&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MASQ) for cognitive function, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) for fatigue, and&#xD;
      mental health (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, DASS -21). Details about COVID-19&#xD;
      status, interaction, workplace engagement, healthcare utilization, and exposure will be&#xD;
      collected. Pre- and post-intervention data collection of physiological parameters (Heart&#xD;
      rate, HR, and measures of autonomic cardiovascular regulation assessed by heart rate&#xD;
      variability) will be assessed as exploratory outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures will be collected at an enrollment visit (V1), and participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the EI or DI groups. For those in the EI group, the intervention will begin 0-7&#xD;
      days thereafter. Sessions will be administered over 10 days. Post-intervention data&#xD;
      collections will be obtained at 0-7 days (V2) after completion of the intervention, and 4-6&#xD;
      weeks (V3, primary outcome) after the V2. Following V3, those in the DI group will be offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to cross over to receive 4 CR sessions and will continue to be followed for&#xD;
      data collections at 0-7 days (V4) after completing their sessions, and 4-6 weeks (V5) after&#xD;
      V4. Because V4 and V5 are not required, these visits will be exploratory. Mean contrasts will&#xD;
      be used to compare the changes in measures of autonomic cardiovascular regulation from V1 to&#xD;
      V3, the primary outcome, as well as for exploratory outcomes. Linear mixed models, which can&#xD;
      accommodate within-subject correlations due to repeated assessments over time, will be used&#xD;
      to generate point estimates for effect size along with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a ten-item psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale, with answers rated from 0-4, also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. Higher scores suggest increase perceived stress.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (0-7 days after final session), and V3 (4-6 weeks after V2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) is a self-report scale with 21 items(Le et al., 2019; D. Lee, 2019). These questions are divided into three subscales to depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The depression subscale scoring ranges from normal (0-9), mild depression (10-12), moderate depression (13-20), severe depression (21-27, and extremely severe depression (28-42). The anxiety subscale scoring ranges from normal (0-6), mild anxiety (7-9), moderate anxiety (10-14), severe anxiety (15-19), and extremely severe anxiety (20-42). The stress subscale ranges from normal (0-10), mild stress (11-18), moderate stress (19-26), sever stress (27-34), and extremely severe stress (35-42). This scale is routinely used in COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020) and SARS literature(McAlonan et al., 2007).</description>

    <description>Measures of heart rate variability in frequency domain will be derived and measures integrated over specified frequency ranges (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz; HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz). Power of RRI spectra in LF, HF range (LFRRI and HFRRI) and total power (TP) will be calculated in normalized units and ratio of LF/HF used as a measure of sympatho-vagal balance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, V2 (0-7 days after final session), and V3 (4-6 weeks after V2)</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous heart rate will be recorded while participant is breathing normally in seated position for 10 minutes using Faros 180 heart rate monitor (Bittium Corporation, Oulu, Finland). Beat to beat intervals (RRI) files will be generated at 1000 Hz via the data acquisition software. Files will be analyzed with Nevrokard HRV software (by Nevrokard Kiauta, d.o.o., Izola, Slovenia). Recordings will be visually inspected to ensure data quality (dropped beats or gross motion artifacts are excluded) and first 5 minutes of usable tracings will be analyzed.</description>

    <description>The upgraded platform for medical research using the HIRREM technology has been rebranded as Cereset Research® (CR). This system uses the same core technology and algorithms to echo brainwaves in real-time using audible tones, as with HIRREM. The CR system also includes 64-bit processing architecture for faster feedback, the use of 4 sensors, and the use of standard protocols (with flexibility regarding the length and sequencing of the standard protocols), all done with eyes closed. Four sensors are applied to the scalp at a time. However, only two sensors are actively echoing feedback. The software automatically switches from one sensor pair to the other when needed. This reduces the number of sensor placement changes needed, resulting in shorter session time and fewer interruptions.</description>
