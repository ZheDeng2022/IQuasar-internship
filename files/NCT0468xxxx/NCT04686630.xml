  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Cerebral Palsy have generally limited selective motor control which affects&#xD;
      their ability to complete functional tasks Selective Motor Control has been shown to&#xD;
      correlate with specific characteristics of gait, however in video based observational gait&#xD;
      analysis, the sub phases of the gait cycle, which are affected by selective motor control,&#xD;
      has not been investigated in children with Cerebral Palsy. Therefore the aim of this study&#xD;
      was determine the relationship between Edinburgh Visual Gait Score and Selective Motor&#xD;
      Control of the Lower Extremity test in children with cerebral palsy. Forty-two cerebral palsy&#xD;
      children with Gross Motor Function Classification System level I-II-III and between 4-18 ages&#xD;
      were participated for the study. After the demographic characteristics and all assessments of&#xD;
      the patients were recorded, the gait characteristics of children were assessed by video based&#xD;
      observational gait analysis. According to Edinburgh Visual Gait Score, phases of gait were&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

      Introduction and Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent but non-progressive neurological disorder that&#xD;
      emerges before, during, and after the birth. That disorder causes problems in the development&#xD;
      of movement and posture and activity limitations. Motor disorders seen in CP are frequently&#xD;
      accompanied by sensory and perception disorders, cognitive, communication and behavioral&#xD;
      problems. In addition, epilepsy and secondary musculoskeletal problems are also added to this&#xD;
      issue. CP varies according to etiology, severity and location of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a form of classification defined by the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe&#xD;
      (SCPE). This classification method according to the clinical features of children with CP;&#xD;
      Spastic type CP, Dyskinetic type CP, Ataxic CP and Unclassified / Other &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spastic CP, neurological damage to the corticospinal tract (CST) results in four&#xD;
      interconnected neuromuscular deficiencies are shortened muscle-tendon unit, muscle weakness,&#xD;
      spasticity and impaired selective motor control (SMC). These deficits are caused by brain&#xD;
      damage, which disconnects with descending inhibitory and excitatory signals and consecutive&#xD;
      changes in the motor unit, muscle fiber composition and muscle growth . These causes lead to&#xD;
      inadequate motor functions in children with CP. More involvement of sensory-motor areas may&#xD;
      impair motor function and proprioception. As well as, these neuromuscular deficits lead to&#xD;
      the gait disorders which have commonly seen in children with spastic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although most of the studies have focused on spasticity and muscle weakness, recent research&#xD;
      reveals the importance of SMC. SMC is described as the ability to isolate muscle activation&#xD;
      in a selected pattern when a voluntary movement or posture is required.SMC skills are&#xD;
      responsible for the movement and control of joints in agile and independent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of SMC loss has not been entirely understood, but it is known that voluntary&#xD;
      movements are provided by corticospinal ways. The corticospinal pathways undertake the task&#xD;
      of determining the direction of movement and controlling force production for movement. The&#xD;
      corticospinal pathways are located in the periventricular white matter (PWM). PWM injury is&#xD;
      the most common finding in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of children with spastic type CP&#xD;
      .CST are located in the PWM. Therefore, especially in children with spastic type CP, SMC&#xD;
      failure or loss is quite common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMC skills of the upper extremities are considered as a basic factor for the realization of&#xD;
      many activities such as eating, participating in daily living activities, performing&#xD;
      self-care activities and writing. In addition, SMC can be used as an important guide in&#xD;
      clinical interventions such as botulinum toxin treatment and selective dorsal rhizotomy. For&#xD;
      these reasons, a detailed evaluation of the SMC is of great importance. However, it is&#xD;
      noteworthy that studies on the evaluation of SMC are insufficient. The Selective Control&#xD;
      Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE) test, as the first scale that evaluates the lower&#xD;
      extremity in a comprehensive manner and with the high level of evidence. The SCALE test which&#xD;
      was developed as a clinical tool for evaluating SMC in lower extremities in children with CP,&#xD;
      stands out compared to other selective motor control tests .It has has a high level of&#xD;
      validity and reliability. The first instrument designed specifically to evaluate SMC ability&#xD;
      of the upper extremity is the &quot;Selective Control of Upper Extremity Scale (SCUES). Both&#xD;
      measuring instruments are very useful, practical and understandable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have been focused on the idea that SMC will guide the treatment of&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation. Additionally, botulinum toxin can be used as a guide in&#xD;
      surgical procedures. Beside the influence of weakness, short muscle-tendon unit, and&#xD;
      spasticity in gait has been studied, the impact of impaired SMC on overall gait pattern has&#xD;
      not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMC problems in children with CP affects motor activities at functional level such as&#xD;
      crawling and walking. When SMC decreases or disappears, the synergy that occurs in the lower&#xD;
      extremity prevents the performance of gait cycle or deteriorates the quality of gait. In the&#xD;
      literature, the effect of SMC on gait cycle investigated with 3DGA; however, impaired SMC on&#xD;
      the sub-phases of the gait cycle was not well defined in VBOGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, the effects of SMC on gait were investigated by three-dimensional gait&#xD;
      analysis (3DGA); however, 3DGA is not widely used in every clinic and requires the expensive&#xD;
      and complicated equipment. This makes the basis for us to conduct this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Edinburgh visual gait score (EVGS) was developed for gait assessment using video&#xD;
      recordings in children with CP. Additionally, in video based observational gait analysis, the&#xD;
      sub-phases of the gait cycle, which are affected by SMC, has not been investigated in&#xD;
      children with CP. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between&#xD;
      EVGS and selective motor control of the lower extremity in children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Method This study was conducted between July 2019 and December 2019 in the Human&#xD;
      Motion Assessment Laboratory in Istanbul to investigate the relationship between the SMC of&#xD;
      children with CP and the Edinburgh Visual Gait Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Medical, Surgical and Drug Research Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Yeditepe University Faculty of Medicine and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the study, the families and children of all children with spastic CP were informed&#xD;
      about the purpose of the study, all the assessments to be applied during the study and the&#xD;
      benefits of the study; families and children who volunteered to participate in the study were&#xD;
      signed an informed consent form that they voluntarily participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children with CP and their families were evaluated in terms of eligibility for the study.&#xD;
      However, children who did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the study and a&#xD;
      total of 42 children were included in the study. Both SCALE and EVGS assessment scales were&#xD;
      applied to the 42 children included in the study. Twenty-four spastic diparesis and eighteen&#xD;
      spastic hemiparesis cases were included in the study. Data was collected from 84 lower&#xD;
      extremities. There were 22 female and 20 male patients aged between 4-18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  GMFCS level I-II-III,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can understand simple verbal commands,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study was conducted in children of families who accepted the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for exclusion from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who do not meet the criteria for inclusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with ataxic and dyskinetic type CP were identified.&#xD;

        -  Families and children who want to quit working anywhere in the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who could not complete the assessment were identified as.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Methods This study was planned to investigate the relationship between SMC and walking&#xD;
      of children with CP. Personal and disease-related information of 42 individuals with diplegic&#xD;
      or hemiparetic CP were recorded by using the data collection form. Information collection&#xD;
      form; The patient's name-surname, age, gender, height, weight, history, gestational age,&#xD;
      birth weight, SCALE Test, GMFCS, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Range of Motion (ROM), EVGS,&#xD;
      affected side and previous surgical histories were recorded and their functional levels were&#xD;
      determined and recorded. The evaluations used in this context are indicated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Methods Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCALE test was developed by Fowler et al. (10) to evaluate SMC of the lower extremity. It&#xD;
      is a valid and reliable assessment method that does not require any special equipment during&#xD;
      application. Application time is approximately 10 minutes. In addition, motion of ankle joint&#xD;
      (S1), motion of subtalar joint (S2), motion of toes joint (S3), motion of knee joint (S4) and&#xD;
      motion of hip joint (S5) parameters of the SCALE test were evaluated separately and&#xD;
      bilaterally five. All evaluations are performed in the sitting position except for the hip&#xD;
      joint. When evaluating the hip joint, the participant is in the lying position with the&#xD;
      tested hip facing up. During the evaluation, clothing that prevents the observation of the&#xD;
      extremities of the evaluated person is more easily removed. Joints of motion can be observed&#xD;
      and scored more easily by using a short.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation positions for each S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 are specified separately. The patient&#xD;
      is asked to perform the desired movement for each joint level in approximately 3 seconds and&#xD;
      with a specific oral tempo. The degree of SMC is determined as &quot;normal&quot; (2 points) if the&#xD;
      patient could move the tested joint isolated, within at least 50% of the possible range of&#xD;
      motion and at a physiological cadence cued orally by the therapist (e.g. &quot;flex, extend,&#xD;
      flex&quot;). If any deviation in performance occurred (movement performed below 50% of the range&#xD;
      of movement, slower, with synergistic movements), selectivity was regarded as &quot;impaired&quot; (1&#xD;
      point). The score &quot;unable&quot; was given, if no joint movement could be made or&#xD;
      mass-synergy-patterns occurred. The total score is obtained by adding the score obtained from&#xD;
      the joint levels to a maximum of 10 points for each limb. Testing procedures were&#xD;
      standardized in regards to the assessment guidelines. All tests were carried out by the same&#xD;
      two physiotherapists, one assessing and one assisting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMC of each joint movement was scored on a three-point ordinal scale. SMC was scored as in&#xD;
      addition total SCALE score (ST) was included statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.2.5. Video Based Observational Gait Analysis Participants and their parents were informed&#xD;
      about the evaluation and then VBOGA was performed in order to evaluate their walking with&#xD;
      EVGS. High resolution (HD) and high frame rate (60 frames per second) Nikon Coolpix S100&#xD;
      camera, SanDisk 16GB memory card and tripod stand were used for recording walking trials. The&#xD;
      camera were located at the center of a 1m x 10m walkway. Its height was adjusted considering&#xD;
      the pelvis height of the individuals. Individuals were asked to wear comfortable clothes,&#xD;
      e.g.; tight shorts and athletes. In case of occluded superior anterior and superior posterior&#xD;
      spina iliac (SIAS and SIPS), shorts were adjusted so that anatomic landmarks visually&#xD;
      observable. All trials were obtained for bare foot walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The camera was placed 3m away from the middle of the walkway for video recording. Subjects&#xD;
      were asked to walk at their normal pace and looking forward. The evaluated cycles were taken&#xD;
      approximately 3-meter part in the middle of the 10-meter walkway. where the steps where the&#xD;
      subjects gained closest to the normal gait and gained natural walking speed, were taken into&#xD;
      consideration while determining the steps taken into consideration. The lower extremity,&#xD;
      which was close to the video camera, was evaluated. The proper trial was selected via&#xD;
      checking all videos. The video files taken for subject played and investigated slow play mode&#xD;
      and the best ones were selected for evaluation. The events were got by investigating proper&#xD;
      time frame using frame-by-frame play property of Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018 video editing&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM SPSS ( Statistical Package Analyze for Social Sciences ) Statistics version 25.0 software&#xD;
      was used for statistical analysis of the findings. The suitability of the variables to normal&#xD;
      distribution was determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov / Shapiro-Wilk tests. The relationships&#xD;
      between the variables were analyzed using the Spearman correlation test as they were not&#xD;
      suitable for normal distribution. Cohen correlation classification was used to define the&#xD;
      strength of the correlation.The twenty three participants were above the minimum sample size&#xD;
      needed to ensure a power of 95% confidence level.&#xD;

    <description>Edinburgh visual gait score is a tool for assessment of the gait phases. Selective Voluntary Motor Control was assessed with the SCALE Test. The SCALE Test consists of 5 items, and each item can be scored between 0 and 2 (0 = unable, 1 = impaired, 2 =normal). For each limb, high scores (maximum score of 10) indicate the best SVMC. Addition,assess of Edinburgh Visual Gait Score (EVGS) (0=normal, 1=moderate or mild pathology, 2=severe pathology). So 0 here means the best score at EVGS.</description>
