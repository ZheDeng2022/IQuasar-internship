  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was aimed to compare the effect of Schroth therapy method, which is a&#xD;
      3-dimensional scoliosis exercise method, and traditional exercises on pain, body awareness&#xD;
      and quality of life in young individuals with idiopathic scoliosis.&#xD;

      38 individuals aged between 10-24 with the diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis will be&#xD;
      participated in the study. Individuals (study group) underwent 1 hour exercise program 3&#xD;
      times a week for 6 weeks, and the individuals (control group) undervent a traditional&#xD;
      exercise program once a week under supervision of physiotherapist for 6 weeks. During the&#xD;
      rest of the week, same exercise program was given as a home program for at least half an hour&#xD;
      a day and individuals will followed up. Individuals' subjective pain intensity will be&#xD;
      assessed with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), pressure pain threshold by algometer, body&#xD;
      awareness by Turkish version of Body Awareness Questionnaire and quality of life by Turkish&#xD;
      version of Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 scale. Measurements will be performed before&#xD;
      and after the 6-week exercise program.&#xD;
