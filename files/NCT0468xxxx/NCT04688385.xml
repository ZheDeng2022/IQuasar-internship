      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency along with safety and toxicity of a&#xD;

      This is a phase I patient-individualized multi-peptide vaccination study in combination with&#xD;
      the novel TLR1/2 ligand XS15 in CLL patients under ibrutinib treatment and based on the&#xD;
      following rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development and clinical success of targeted therapies, the treatment landscape for&#xD;
      CLL, which is the most common leukemia in adults, has faced profound changes in the recent&#xD;
      years. The disease control achieved by ibrutinib, an inhibitor of the Brutons tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      (BTK), has led to its approval as first line therapy. However, in most cases only partial&#xD;
      remissions are achieved, and so far perpetual ibrutinib treatment bearing the risk of side&#xD;
      effects and development of drug resistance is required. Therefore, current efforts are&#xD;
      focusing on the further reduction/elimination of residual CLL cells to allow for reduced&#xD;
      treatment time as well as the achievement of long-lasting remissions. A rational and&#xD;
      promising approach to achieve this goal is peptide-based immunotherapy, which represents a&#xD;
      low side-effect treatment relying on specific immune recognition of tumor-associated HLA&#xD;
      presented peptides. Several peptide vaccination studies have reported promising result in&#xD;
      terms of in vivo immunogenicity, but so far lacked broad clinical responses. This likely is&#xD;
      due to several so far unmet prerequisites for clinical effective peptide vaccination,&#xD;
      including the selection of antigens, adjuvants, combinatorial drugs and vaccination time&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators here adresse these issues as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reportedly distorted relationship of gene expression and HLA-restricted presentation of&#xD;
      the corresponding gene product requires direct methods for peptide target identification for&#xD;
      vaccination approaches. This is realized by mass spectrometry-based analysis of the entirety&#xD;
      of naturally presented HLA ligands, termed the HLA ligandome of cancer cells. In the recent&#xD;
      years, the investigators worked intensively on the characterization of such TAA in HM based&#xD;
      on the direct isolation of naturally presented HLA class I and II ligands from leukemia cells&#xD;
      and the subsequent identification by mass spectrometry. To allow for the timely and&#xD;
      cost-effective production of personalized vaccine cocktail for patients in clinical studies&#xD;
      based on HLA ligandome analyses, the investigators have established a so called &quot;warehouse&#xD;
      concept&quot; providing premanufactured highly frequent TAA for the formulation of personalized&#xD;
      vaccine cocktails. The feasibility of such a warehouse concept, which is utilized in the&#xD;
      iVAC-XS15-CLL01 study, was already proven by the investigator's first clinical peptide&#xD;
      vaccination study (iVAC-CLL01, NCT02802943). The warehouse has been built based on&#xD;
      comprehensive HLA ligandome analysis of CLL cells and composites of a modified cocktail used&#xD;
      for the iVAC-CLL01 study as described above. On basis of the individual HLA allotype and a&#xD;
      HLA ligandome analysis of CLL cells of the respective patient, 10 tumor-associated peptides&#xD;
      are selected from the peptide warehouse. The so-called CLL peptide cocktails (drug substance)&#xD;
      are designed to trigger the cellular part of the patients' immune system by activation of&#xD;
      CLL-specific T cells. Once activated, these cells can destroy malignant cells presenting the&#xD;
      respective antigens. Applying several CLL-associated antigens simultaneously increases the&#xD;
      likelihood that a multi-clonal, broad and at the same time highly specific T-cell response is&#xD;
      mounted, therebypreventing potential tumor escape mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the selection of optimal antigen targets, a further important prerequisite is the use&#xD;
      of suitable adjuvant drugs capable to induce potent and long-lasting immune responses. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the novel TLR1/2 ligand (XS15, developed in Tübingen) that (i) is&#xD;
      water-soluble and (ii) GMP-amenable, (iii) non-toxic and (iv) effective in inducing T cells&#xD;
      specific for peptides in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important factor for the clinical effectiveness of peptide-based immunotherapy is the&#xD;
      rational combination with standard therapies. In this iVAC-XS15-CLL01 trial, peptide&#xD;
      vaccination will be applied in CLL patients under ibrutinib treatment which have achieved at&#xD;
      least a partial remission. The remission stage or, even better, the stage of MRD ensures an&#xD;
      optimal effector to target cell ratio for peptide-based immunotherapy, as most of the tumor&#xD;
      cells are eliminated and the T-cell compartment is recovered. Notably, several studies have&#xD;
      proven that ibrutinib does not impair and even can show positive effects on T-cell response.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>As usual in early phase 1 and 2 studies, statistical planning is designed as such that a statistically reasoned decision for or against a subsequent phase 3 study can be made. The sample size of the study was chosen based on the assumption that, in the case of peptide specific immune response induction in ≤ 30% of the patients, the therapy concept is extended with a probability of at most 5% (type one error, one-sided). On the other hand, in the case of peptide specific immune response induction in ≥ 60% of the patients, the therapy concept should be followed with a probability of at least 80% (power).&#xD;
With a sample size of n = 20 patients, this means that at least 10 patients must have an immune response, so that the therapy concept is evaluated in a randomized phase 3 study. The exact power is 87%, the exact type 1 error is 4.8% (calculations based on the binomial distribution with n = 20, p = 0.3 or p = 0.6, k &lt;10 or k ≥ 10).</intervention_model_description>
