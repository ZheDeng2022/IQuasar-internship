    <textblock>
      Open label, multi-center, pre-hospital randomized trial utilizing 10 level-1 trauma centers&#xD;
      designed to determine the efficacy and safety of low titer whole blood resuscitation as&#xD;
      compared to standard of care resuscitation in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock and to&#xD;
      appropriately characterize the hemostatic competency of whole blood relative to its age.&#xD;
