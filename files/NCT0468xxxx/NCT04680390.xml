  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women involved in the criminal justice system have complex and highly stigmatized sexual and&#xD;
      substance use risk profiles and are particularly vulnerable to, and experience, high rates of&#xD;
      HIV. Criminal justice settings represent an important opportunity to address health&#xD;
      disparities in HIV by linking women, who experience multiple, intersecting stigmas with&#xD;
      innovative biomedical HIV prevention strategies, like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The&#xD;
      investigators propose to develop and test a peer-led patient navigation intervention for&#xD;
      criminal-justice involved (CJI) women at risk of HIV acquisition to reduce intersectional&#xD;
      stigma and improve uptake and linkage to PrEP services, thereby increasing access to PrEP and&#xD;
      decreasing PrEP-related disparities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stigma persists as a principal factor shaping HIV risk. Women involved in the criminal&#xD;
      justice system have complex and highly stigmatized sexual and substance use risk profiles and&#xD;
      are particularly vulnerable to, and experience, high rates of HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis,&#xD;
      or PrEP, is an efficacious HIV prevention strategy, however, women at high-risk of HIV&#xD;
      infection in the United States (US) are largely absent from national efforts to improve PrEP&#xD;
      awareness and uptake. Criminal justice settings represent an important opportunity to address&#xD;
      disparities in HIV by linking high-risk women, who experience multiple, intersecting stigmas&#xD;
      with innovative biomedical HIV prevention strategies, like PrEP. Peer-led patient navigation&#xD;
      interventions have demonstrated efficacy in building trust and reducing stigma and&#xD;
      discrimination-related barriers to healthcare engagement, and hold strong potential to&#xD;
      address multiple, intersecting stigmas and other multifactorial and complex barriers to PrEP&#xD;
      acceptability, linkage, and uptake for criminal justice-involved women. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to develop and test a peer-led patient navigator PrEP linkage intervention for women&#xD;
      at risk for HIV acquisition who are on probation in San Francisco. Intervention development&#xD;
      and study design will be guided by our team's pilot research, the Stigma and HIV Disparities&#xD;
      Framework, and the PrEP Continuum of Care model. Study aims are to:1) Determine the content&#xD;
      and structure of a peer-led PrEP screening and linkage navigation intervention (Project&#xD;
      kINSHIP) for high-risk criminal justice-involved (CJI)-women; 2) Refine and test the content&#xD;
      and structure of the kINSHIP intervention for CJI-women; and 3) Assess the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary impact of the kINSHIP intervention on internalized stigma and&#xD;
      the PrEP continuum of care in a pilot randomized trial. Formative qualitative work with key&#xD;
      stakeholders, including women on probation, probation staff, and medical/public health staff&#xD;
      in Aim1 will guide intervention development and testing in Aim 2. In Aim 3, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine the primary outcome of PrEP service linkage and secondary outcomes such as time&#xD;
      to linkage, PrEP prescription/initiation, and PrEP adherence/persistence. The investigators&#xD;
      will explore how intersectional stigma may moderate intervention effects on linkage to PrEP.&#xD;
      The proposed study has the potential to: 1) reduce the impact of intersectional stigma as a&#xD;
      barrier to service care engagement, 2) inform PrEP care continuum estimates for criminal&#xD;
      justice-involved women as well as identify barriers, and 3) create an intervention suitable&#xD;
      for large-scale efficacy testing and translation to other criminal justice settings.&#xD;
