  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a potential behavioral intervention&#xD;
      (MED-Go app). To meet this objective, the researchers will conduct a pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of MED-Go app in adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD). The long-term goal of this research is to&#xD;
      promote medication adherence behavior and improve health outcomes in AYA with SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic disorder in the US, affecting about 100,000&#xD;
      Americans, and about 1 in 400 African American live births, incurring annual health care&#xD;
      costs of $335 million. SCD can lead to serious complications including unpredictable,&#xD;
      debilitating pain episodes, cardiopulmonary disease, stroke, and long-term end organ&#xD;
      damage.These complications lead to significant declines in health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQOL) and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs), culminating in early mortality,&#xD;
      particularly among AYA. Hydroxyurea (HU), at present, is the main FDA approved medication for&#xD;
      SCD that reduces morbidity and mortality, improves HRQoL and lowers healthcare&#xD;
      utilization.However, adherence to HU remains suboptimal with only 35-50% of patients&#xD;
      achieving high adherence (â‰¥90%), particularly among AYA with SCD. Low HU adherence has been&#xD;
      associated with worse health outcomes, poor HRQOL and increased healthcare utilization. Low&#xD;
      HU adherence is multifactorial, especially in AYA with other competing priorities and&#xD;
      vulnerability in developmental and psychological factors contributing to adherence behavior.&#xD;
      AYA have adopted text messaging and smartphone apps at a fast pace, including those who have&#xD;
      SCD.Existing evidence indicates that mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions are&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable with modest efficacy at improving medication adherence and&#xD;
      self-management in AYA, including SCD. The specific aim for this study is to test the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the MED-Go app as an mHealth behavioral intervention to&#xD;
      improve HU adherence among AYA with SCD.&#xD;
