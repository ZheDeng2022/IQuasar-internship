  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that clear, interpretable quality images of the ovaries and uterus can be&#xD;
      generated using a portable transvaginal ultrasound scanner in the home environment, and that&#xD;
      those images are interpretable by physicians with sufficient clarity to estimate approximate&#xD;
      antral follicle count (i.e., appropriate for age) and to observe submucosal fibroids. Study&#xD;
      aims to prove that images taken when ultrasound is performed by a woman herself (with HCP&#xD;
      supervision via telemedicine) and images taken when ultrasound is administered by an HCP are&#xD;
      of comparable quality. Study population reflects real-world patient characteristics and&#xD;
      includes both general-population and submucosal fibroid positive controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, pro-fertility information is generally unavailable to healthy women; clinically&#xD;
      meaningful in-clinic testing is limited by physician availability and patient willingness to&#xD;
      undergo testing in-clinic, while home testing is limited to hormonal bloodwork which is&#xD;
      insufficient on its own and has high false positives. Sponsor is developing home telemedicine&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound as part of a home fertility assessment. Sponsor wishes to demonstrate&#xD;
      the ability to obtain interpretable images, in women of varying body habitus, reproductive&#xD;
      age, and reproductive status.&#xD;

    <description>As assessed by two experienced, qualified independent raters on a 4 point scale for each organ visualized and each modality (supervised versus HCP). 4 point scale consists of: 4=excellent image quality; 3=acceptable image quality; 2=below clinical quality; 1=nondiagnostic. Scale is translated into binary outcome to assess if image is clinically comparable. 'Clinical-quality image' of an organ requires a score of '3' or greater on the scale.</description>

    <description>Difference between false positive rate among exams in two modalities (supervised self-performed and HCP-performed), conducted proximately (within 24-48 hours of each other). An all-cause false positive will be defined as a subject where pathology requiring in-person follow-up is identified on the supervised self-performed exam, but not substantiated by identification by the HCP-administered exam.</description>
