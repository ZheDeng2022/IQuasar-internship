  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, the investigators described the results of a randomized, comparative&#xD;
      clinical trial that was conducted to study the impact of the size of internal limiting&#xD;
      membrane (ILM) inverted flap on rate and timing of idiopathic macular hole closure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized comparative study included patients with idiopathic macular hole&#xD;
      (MH) attending outpatient clinic.Eligible eyes were divided into 2 groups based on the&#xD;
      narrowest diameter of the MH measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (SD-OCT). MHs from 250 to 400µm were classified as Medium-sized MHs and MHs &gt; 400 µm were&#xD;
      classified as Large-sized MHs. Within each group, eyes were randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      small-flap (1-2DD) or large flap (from &gt;2 to 4DD).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>pars plana vitrectomy with ILM inverted flap</intervention_name>
    <description>Complete vitrectomy was done with the aid of triamcinolone acetonide followed by fluid-air exchange. Staining of the ILM was carried with 0.05% solution of Brilliant Blue dye (BBG), (Ocublue plus, Aurolab, India) for 30 seconds, ILM peeling was proceeded leaving a circle of ILM measuring approximately 1-2 DD in SF groups and &gt;2 to 4DD in LF group, centered around the MH. The ILM outside the parafoveal area was peeled to the arcade. The ILM around the hole was then detached from the retina up to the edge of the hole. The ILM flap around the edge of the hole was inverted over the MH using a scraper.</description>
