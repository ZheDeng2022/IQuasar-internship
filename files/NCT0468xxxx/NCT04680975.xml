    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, single-cohort, multicenter trial of belumosudil in subjects&#xD;
      with Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc). An estimated total of 12 to 15 subjects&#xD;
      will receive belumosudil 200 mg administered orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 52 weeks. The&#xD;
      primary analysis will be at 24 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase 2, open-label, single-cohort, multicenter trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of belumosudil 200 mg BID using the Combined Response Index in diffuse&#xD;
      cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS) after 24 weeks of therapy. The duration of the study&#xD;
      will be approximately 14 months (4 weeks for screening, 52 weeks of dosing period, and 4&#xD;
      weeks of Follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have signed an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics&#xD;
      Committee-(IRB/IEC)-approved informed consent form (ICF) and met all of the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. A total of 12 to 15 to subjects at&#xD;
      approximately 5 to 6 sites will receive belumosudil 200 mg in tablet form administered PO BID&#xD;
      for 52 weeks. The total duration of the study is approximately 14 months: a 4-week screening&#xD;
      period, a 52-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be analyzed using Week 24 data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed throughout the 52-week dosing period using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite Response Index in Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician Global Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Global Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study and will include:.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examinations (PEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital sign measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection for hematology and chemistry; urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograms (ECGs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event (AE) assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medication assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for discontinuation of treatment because of toxicity will be documented. Careful&#xD;
      monitoring of all toxicities will be carried out. Dosing can be reduced 1 dose level. If the&#xD;
      dose is not tolerated, then the subject will be discontinued from the study. If there is a&#xD;
      interruption of dosing, after 14 days the subject will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a study drug diary to record the details of each dose of belumosudil&#xD;
      200 mg. Diaries will be dispense/collected on each visit. Compliance with dosing will be&#xD;
      confirmed using subject diaries, which will be examined at each visit by site staff to&#xD;
      determine if dosing is as instructed per protocol and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-Week Safety Follow-up Visit will occur 28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the effect of belumosudil 200 mg BID on the Combined Response Index in Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS) after 24 weeks of therapy with belumosudil 200 mg PO BID at the end of Week 24 in the Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population.&#xD;
The CRISS exponential algorithm determines the predicted probability of improvement from baseline, incorporating changes in mRSS, FVC% predicted, SHAQ-DI, and physician and Patient Global Assessments. The outcome is a continuous variable between 0.0 and 1.0 (0-100%). A higher score indicates greater probability of improvement. A CRISS score ≥ 20% is considered a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

&#xD;
          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior&#xD;

             anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative&#xD;
                  urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test)&#xD;

                  doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable,&#xD;
                  implant, transdermal) plus 1 barrier method; or (iii) 2 barrier methods.&#xD;
                  Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides&#xD;
                  (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm), or a vasectomized&#xD;
                  partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women:&#xD;
             agreement to use 2 forms of contraception as in criterion number 6b above during the&#xD;
             treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male subjects must not donate sperm for 3 months after last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Able to provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any&#xD;

             QTc prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participated in another study with an investigational drug within 28 days of study&#xD;
             entry (for studies involving biologics, within 3 half-lives of the biologic).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions that would make&#xD;
             the subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study.&#xD;

             prostate cancer after curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has had previous exposure to belumosudil or known allergy/sensitivity to belumosudil,&#xD;
             or any other Rho-associated Protein Kinase-2 (ROCK2) inhibitor.&#xD;
