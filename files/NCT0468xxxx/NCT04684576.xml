    <textblock>
      The use of powered mobility devices for young children with cerebral palsy (CP) has been&#xD;
      gaining traction, with evidence that the use of powered mobility at young ages complements&#xD;
      (rather than detracts from) other interventions focused on more traditional mobility skills&#xD;
      such as crawling and walking. This study will collect preliminary data (both numeric and&#xD;
      opinion/perception data) to investigate device use patterns, caregiver perceptions, and&#xD;
      developmental outcomes of children with CP as families are introduced to two early powered&#xD;
      mobility interventions: the Permobil速 Explorer Mini, and a modified ride-on toy car.&#xD;

      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine how early powered mobility devices impact the lives of children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy (CP) and their families. Investigators will compare a modified ride-on car to&#xD;
      one specifically designed for children 12-36 months with disabilities to understand how the&#xD;
      early introduction of these devices affects the child's developmental outcomes, examine&#xD;
      device use patterns (frequency, duration, and environment) and evaluate caregiver perceptions&#xD;
      of a motorized mobility device. Research comparing these devices in natural environments will&#xD;
      provide critical data regarding early powered mobility for children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children diagnosed with CP, or children being monitored for signs and symptoms related to CP,&#xD;
      make up the largest group of children affected by a disability. Across the lifespan, many&#xD;
      people with CP use powered mobility devices such as scooters and wheelchairs to support their&#xD;
      mobility and participation in home and community settings. However, the trend in early&#xD;
      intervention has been to delay use of devices until efforts to promote independent walking&#xD;
      are exhausted, despite strong evidence that supports early use of powered mobility to assist&#xD;
      with participation in everyday activities. Additionally, research has indicated the use of&#xD;
      powered mobility complements (rather than detracts from) other interventions focused on more&#xD;
      traditional self-initiated mobility skills such as crawling and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators have been involved in an international mobility and socialization program&#xD;
      called Go Baby Go, which provides safety and accessibility modifications to commercially&#xD;
      available toy ride-on cars. In compliment to this work, their colleagues at Permobil速 have&#xD;
      designed and recently received FDA clearance for the Explorer Mini, a powered mobility device&#xD;
      specifically designed for children 12-36 months with disabilities such as CP to enhance their&#xD;
      mobility and environmental exploration. Both these early powered mobility options offer&#xD;
      functional, aesthetic, and affordable alternatives for children and families to fill a gap&#xD;
      left by traditional powered wheelchairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are using a mixed-methods study to investigate the device use patterns,&#xD;
      caregiver perceptions, and developmental outcomes of children with CP and their families.&#xD;
      This represents the first opportunity to compare the novel device (Explorer mini) with a&#xD;
      modified ride-on car, which has also been customized to support early self-initiated mobility&#xD;
      in a socially inviting way. Taken together, research comparing these devices in natural&#xD;
      environments can add critical data to the evidence base supporting early powered mobility for&#xD;
      children with CP as a part of using multiple devices for mobility to care for those with&#xD;
      disabilities across the lifespan. This study will also create a pilot data set from which to&#xD;
      secure future large-scale funding to assess a wider variety of mobility devices with multiple&#xD;
      trial sites across the country. Establishing and improving this evidence base for children&#xD;
      with CP and their families is essential to ensure equitable access to mobility and&#xD;
      participation experiences across the lifespan using a range of technologies to support access&#xD;
      and facilitate achievement of key developmental skills. The aims are to: 1) Evaluate a&#xD;
      powered mobility intervention to promote developmental, activity and participation outcomes&#xD;
      of young children with CP; and 2) Compare the use patterns (frequency, duration, environment)&#xD;
      of two powered mobility options: The Explorer Mini and a modified ride-on car.&#xD;
