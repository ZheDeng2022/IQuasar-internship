  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the physiologic effects on loading conditions and contractility of&#xD;
      the left ventricle during high-risk primary coronary intervention (HRPCI) in the Cardiac Cath&#xD;
      Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed through analysis of real-time left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume&#xD;
      loops (PVL) by continuously recording PVL during HRPCI with the Inca® Pressure-Volume Loop&#xD;
      System that will be temporarily placed in the left ventricle during the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the complexity of patients treated by high risk percutaneous coronary interventions&#xD;
      (HRPCI), mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are increasingly used to maintain&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability during these procedures. It is crucial to have a better understanding&#xD;
      of the hemodynamic effects during HRPCI and of MCS devices to guide appropriate device&#xD;
      selection and utilization for HRPCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies evaluating different MCS devices are not all consistent in terms of patient&#xD;
      selection, outcomes examined and overall findings. Therefore, the role of MCS devices in&#xD;
      HRPCI is still widely debated. This is reflected in a variable clinical practice pattern and&#xD;
      recommendations from professional society guidelines. The investigators believe that having a&#xD;
      clear scientific understanding of MCS devices in terms of hemodynamic effects during&#xD;
      different stages of these complex procedures may prove helpful in refining the process of&#xD;
      appropriate MCS device selection in appropriate clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One especially insightful method of examining the MCS devices effect is analyzing the left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loops (PVL). Continuously recording PVL during HRPCI can&#xD;
      provide valuable data on the device effects on loading conditions and contractility of the&#xD;
      left ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will collect hemodynamic data in real-time during HRPCI&#xD;
      being performed as standard of care and continuously recording left ventricular&#xD;
      pressure-volume loop (PVL) throughout the procedure via the Inca® Pressure-Volume Loop System&#xD;
      (CD Leycom, Hengelo, The Netherlands).&#xD;

        Ten adult patients with planned elective HRPCI procedures. Procedures are deemed high-risk&#xD;
        based on patient-related risk features, hemodynamic criteria, clinical presentation and&#xD;
        complexity of coronary anatomy. Patient-related high risk features include low left&#xD;
        ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), advanced age, and comorbidities including advanced&#xD;
        kidney disease, peripheral and cerebral vascular disease. High-risk baseline hemodynamic&#xD;
        features include hypotension, severely elevated LVEDP, and severely depressed cardiac&#xD;
        output. Coronary anatomy complexity criteria include left main coronary artery involvement,&#xD;
        multi- vessel CAD, and severely calcified coronary lesions requiring atherectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The decision to use an MCS device for hemodynamic support will be planned, not randomized,&#xD;
        as it will be made prior to patient enrollment based on the clinical judgment of the&#xD;
        treating physician.&#xD;
