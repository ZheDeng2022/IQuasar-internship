      Prepare an ointment from Nigella sativa seeds extract and apply it over palmer arsenical&#xD;
      keratosis patient for 12 weeks. After than the effect of the ointment will be observed by&#xD;
      measuring the keratotic nodular size before and after the intervention.&#xD;

      Arsenicosis is a massive public health problem affecting thousands of people worldwide,&#xD;
      especially India, West Bengal, and Bangladesh. In our country groundwater of estimated 59&#xD;
      administrative districts have been contaminated with high concentration of arsenic. Through&#xD;
      this contaminated drinking water a large number of populations are chronically exposed to&#xD;
      high concentration of arsenic. Arsenicosis is characterized by diffuse melanosis followed by&#xD;
      hyperpigmentation and keratosis. Keratosis causes reduce working capacity that affects&#xD;
      socioeconomic condition of the patient. Invasive skin lesions like squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      Bowen's disease, and basal cell carcinoma also caused by it. Keratosis can treated by several&#xD;
      topical preparation like propylene glycol, salicylic acid, alpha-lipoic acid, neem leaf&#xD;
      extract, solanum melongena extract, Azadirachta indica and oral preparation like zinc,&#xD;
      antioxidant, and folic acid. This treatment procedure required longer time to relieve symptom&#xD;
      and reduce patient's compliance. Nigella sativa is a well-known spice of Southeast Asia,&#xD;
      especially in Bangladesh. It contains a yellow volatile oil, a fixed oil, protein, amino&#xD;
      acid, reducing sugars, alkaloids, and minerals like potassium, sodium, phosphorus, and iron&#xD;
      while zinc, magnesium, calcium, copper, and manganese are found in low level. Thymoquinone is&#xD;
      a main pharmacologically active constituent of volatile oil of N. sativa. Other constituents&#xD;
      of the volatile oil are thymol, thymohydroquinone, and dithymoquinone. These biologically&#xD;
      active compounds possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunological,&#xD;
      antimetastatic, anti-diabetic activity. Study with Nigella sativa in the treatment of&#xD;
      arsenical keratosis was done and found effective. Therefore, the study will be done to&#xD;
      identification of compound that is isolated from Nigella sativa and its effect on moderate to&#xD;
      severe arsenical keratosis. . After obtaining clearance from IRB, on the basis of selection&#xD;
      criteria, 34 patients of arsenical keratosis will be enlisted from Bhanga Upazilla of&#xD;
      Faridpur district, an arsenic affected area. The study will be an experimental study and&#xD;
      conducted in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. Nigella sativa extract will be&#xD;
      collected by using n-hexane as a solvent and rotary evaporator. Thin Layer Chromatography&#xD;
      (TLC), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Infrared (IR) spectrometry of the extract will be&#xD;
      done to identify compound. Cytotoxicity test of the extract will be analyzed by using brine&#xD;
      shrimp bioassay. . Then a topical ointment will be prepared from Nigella sativa extract and&#xD;
      supplied to the arsenical keratosis patient at two weeks interval. Instruction about the&#xD;
      application of the ointment on keratotic lesion will be given to the patients. Adherence and&#xD;
      side effects of the ointment will be monitored at regular interval over phone calls and&#xD;
      during field visit. Keratotic nodular size will be measured before start and after completion&#xD;
      of treatment. Photograph will also take before and after treatment. Improvement of the lesion&#xD;
      will be measured by mean scoring of nodule and perception of patients about their improvement&#xD;
      by using Likert Scale. Statistical analysis and results will be presented in tabulated forms&#xD;
      and in different diagrams.&#xD;
