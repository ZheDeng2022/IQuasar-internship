      Conduct a clinical trial of integration of Chinese and Western medicine to evaluate whether&#xD;
      the association of traditional Chinese medicine therapy has a remission effect on atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis, and to explore the remission of lesions after an association of Chinese herbal&#xD;
      medicine, and the correlation of syndrome differentiation types before and after treatment&#xD;
      with Chinese and Western medicine, with a view to better understand the efficacy of atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis in the treatment of the same disease in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and provide&#xD;
      another option for patients with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

      This examination will be posted at Taipei Veterans General Hospital to recruit 24&#xD;
      participants who meet the inclusion criteria of atopic dermatitis to do the study. After&#xD;
      participants agreeing to the clinical study and signing the consent form, the investigators&#xD;
      are going to separate them into the A group (12 participants) and the B group (12&#xD;
      participants). The tests are going to take a total of 14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants need to pass the international diagnostic criteria Hannifin and Rajka to be&#xD;
      determined as patients with atopic dermatitis. After, participants need test by scoring&#xD;
      Atopic Dermatitis Index (SCORAD) to be determined as mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and&#xD;
      accept the Wang Qi Traditional Chinese Medical Constitutional Scale (TCMCS), dermatological&#xD;
      quality of life index (DLQI) score or children's skin disease quality of life index (CDLQI)&#xD;
      score, routine blood tests, liver and kidney function tests, immunological markers associated&#xD;
      with atopic dermatitis Diagnosis of (eosinophils count, ECP, and IgE), tongue diagnosis, and&#xD;
      pulse diagnosis. After the collection of data is completed, the investigators will be&#xD;
      analyzing the data by SPSS version 21 as a two-paired t-test, ANOVA statistical method, and P&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 as a significant result.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, 6, 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) consists of 60 items to classify a person into one or more of nine Body constitution(BC) types: gentleness (8 Items), Qi-deficiency (8 Items), Yang-deficiency (7 Items), Yin-deficiency (8 Items), phlegm-wetness (8 Items), wetness-heat (6 Items), blood-stasis (7 Items), Qi-depression (7 Items), and special diathesis (7 Items). Coexistence of multiple imbalanced BC types was possible which is consistent with the TCM theories. The scoring algorithm proposed in the original CCMQ was adopted in this study. A higher score in the CCMQ BC scale indicates a higher likelihood of the specific BC type, and a score of 30 is set as threshold for case definition. The CCMQ will be conducted at baseline, 12 weeks, and follow-up (16 weeks).</description>
