  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of&#xD;
      single and multiple ascending oral doses of RP7214. The relative bioavailability in fed and&#xD;
      fasting conditions will also be evaluated for RP7214. The study comprises three parts; Part&#xD;
      1: Single ascending dose, Part 2: Multiple ascending dose and Part 3: Food effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three escalating cohorts in SAD part and two escalating cohorts in MAD part. In&#xD;
      each cohort, six eligible healthy volunteers will be randomized to receive either RP7214 or&#xD;
      placebo in 2:1 ratio. Within each cohort, two sentinel subjects (RP7214 and Placebo) will be&#xD;
      dosed first for assessment of safety and tolerability. The safety data of at least 48 hrs&#xD;
      will be reviewed to confirm safety of sentinel subjects after which the remaining four&#xD;
      subjects will be dosed. Food effect study is a randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence,&#xD;
      crossover study in 12 HVs.&#xD;
