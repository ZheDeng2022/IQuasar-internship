  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A mild reduction in food intake significantly inhibits renal cyst growth in mouse models of&#xD;
      ADPKD. The underlying mechanism was unknown at the time. Recently published data show that&#xD;
      the beneficial effect is not due to caloric restriction per se but due to the induction of&#xD;
      the state of ketosis. Dietary interventions leading to ketosis profoundly inhibited renal&#xD;
      cyst growth in rodent models of PKD. In addition, acute fasting led to rapid regression of&#xD;
      renal cystic burden in mouse, rat and feline models of PKD. Due to these compelling effects&#xD;
      in a multitude of PKD animal models, and due to the fact that well-established dietary&#xD;
      interventions have a tremendous translational potential, KETO-ADPKD will test such&#xD;
      interventions regimens in ADPKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two well-established ketogenic dietary regimens will be tested in comparison to a control&#xD;
      group to address the following four questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility: Are ketogenic dietary interventions acceptable to ADPKD patients in&#xD;
           everyday life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety: Are there adverse events of ketogenic dietary interventions in ADPKD patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Efficacy: Do the dietary interventions reach the metabolic endpoints? Do they have a&#xD;
           short-term impact on kidney volume?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Which of the two diets is the optimal approach?&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questions will be addressed in an exploratory, randomized, open, single center,&#xD;
      three-arm dietary intervention study using the following interventions in 21 ADPKD patients&#xD;
      per treatment arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Ketogenic diet B) 3-day water fasting C) Control: ad libitum food intake (no diet)&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility of ketogenic dietary interventions in every-day life, defined as a combination of objective adherence (ketone body levels) and a patient-reported feasibility questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Adherence: (A) Ketogenic diet-group: (1) ketone body levels ≥0.8 mmol/l in ≥75% of blood measurements at visits/patient or (2) ≥10 ppm in ≥75 % of Breathalyzer measurements and ketone body levels ≥0.8 mmol/l in ≥50% of blood measurements at visits/patient, to be reached by ≥ 75% of the participants by ≥50% of all per protocol measurements (B) 3-day water-fasting group:(1) full compliance to diet on ≥75% days/patient (based on diary), to be reached by ≥75% of the participants or by ≥50% of all per protocol measurements (2) at least 1 ketone body level ≥10 ppm/day on at least 2 out of 3 days of each fasting phase (analyzed using breathalyzer).&#xD;
Patient-reported feasibility will be measured using a dedicated feasibility questionnaire by counting the answers to the questions 1-17 and 21-26 (options ranging from-4 to+4 with higher values indicating better feasibility). Goal: Average value ≥0 in at least 75% of the participants.Both targets have to be met to reach the primary endpoint.</description>
