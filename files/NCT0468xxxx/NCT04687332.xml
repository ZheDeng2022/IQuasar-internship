  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective controlled monocentric observational study, we assessed safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of therapy with IA or PE in patients with neurological autoimmune diseases. In the&#xD;
      subgroup analysis of MS patients also the EDSS was evaluated. In addition, we investigated&#xD;
      possible pathomechanisms, such as cytokine alterations under therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasma exchange (PE) and immunoadsorption (IA) are first- or second line treatment options in&#xD;
      patients with neurological autoimmune disease, including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis&#xD;
      optica, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating&#xD;
      polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barré-Syndrom) or autoimmune encephalitis. This prospective&#xD;
      controlled monocentric observational study of patients treated with either tryptophan IA or&#xD;
      PE in cases of autoimmune neurological therapy refractory disease was performed between 2016&#xD;
      and 2019. The main outcome parameter for efficiency was clinical improvement after completion&#xD;
      of treatment with PE/IA. Symptoms were assessed before the first and after the last IA/PE. In&#xD;
      total, all patients receive 5 treatments. As patients with various neurological autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases were included in the study, the overall treatment response was categorized&#xD;
      descriptively as improvement or no improvement of symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>In the subgroup of MS patients, disability was evaluated by EDSS. The Expanded Disability Status Scale is a scale system for the systematic recording (assessment) of disability in neurological patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. The scale is used to classify the severity of disability by symptoms, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to a maximum of grade 10 (death from MS).</description>
