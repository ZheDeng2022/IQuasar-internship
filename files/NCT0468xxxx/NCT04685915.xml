  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining the effect of adding a fixed duration of copanlisib to&#xD;
      ibrutinib in select participants who have been on ibrutinib for at least six months for&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copanlisib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibrutinib&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study, adding copanlisib to ibrutinib in select participants&#xD;
      who are receiving ibrutinib for relapsed/refractory CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copanlisib has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CLL, but&#xD;
      it has been approved for use in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. Ibrutinib is&#xD;
      approved by the FDA as a treatment option for CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trying to understand what effects, good or bad, treatment with copanlisib in combination&#xD;
           with ibrutinib has in select participants who are receiving ibrutinib for&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory CLL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for this type of&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining whether genomic changes in CLL cells and changes in immune response make&#xD;
           treatment with the study drugs more or less effective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive combination therapy for six months before resuming ibrutinib alone.&#xD;
      They will continue therapy for as long as they do not have serious side effects and their&#xD;
      disease does not get worse and will be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals is supporting this research study by providing the study&#xD;
      drug, copanlisib. Ibrutinib will be obtained from commercial supply.&#xD;
