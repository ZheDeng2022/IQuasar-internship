             during screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to receiving&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug. If the screening serum test is done within 3 days prior&#xD;
             to receiving the first dose of study drug, a urine test is not required. If a patient&#xD;
             is of childbearing potential the patient must agree to use effective contraception&#xD;
             (see Appendix C for acceptable methods) during the study and for 120 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than&#xD;
             medical reasons):&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Amenorrheic for &lt;2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a&#xD;

             (screening) evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or&#xD;
             oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or&#xD;
             confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of&#xD;
             the actual procedure otherwise the patient must be willing to use 2 adequate barrier&#xD;
             methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If male, agrees to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN OR Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 60 by Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  Equation if Creatinine &gt;1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5 x ULN if documented liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 ULN OR direct bilirubin &lt; ULN if total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
