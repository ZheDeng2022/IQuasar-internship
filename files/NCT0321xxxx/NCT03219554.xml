  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single center, open-label, single arm study of palbociclib treatment in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or metastatic advanced TETs after failure of one or more cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens. Patients will receive oral palbociclib 125mg daily for 21days followed&#xD;
      by a 7-day break. Cycle will be repeated every 28 days.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will continue to receive Palbociclib until objective disease progression,&#xD;
      symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawn of consent, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) from the date of initiation of&#xD;
      treatment. Each assessment will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar&#xD;
      regardless of any dosing delay to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of&#xD;
      efficacy. Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographically and/or clinically (ie,&#xD;
      for photographed or palpable lesions) documented progressive disease (PD) as per RECIST&#xD;
      v.1.1, initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study&#xD;
      participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically proven thymic epithelial tumor (TET) patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented progressive disease according to RECIST v1.1 following receipt of at least&#xD;
             one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen administered for inoperable or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease as defined per RECIST v 1.1. Tumor lesions previously irradiated or&#xD;
             subjected to other locoregional therapy will only be deemed measurable if disease&#xD;
             progression at the treated sited after completion of therapy is clearly documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Availability of a tumor tissue specimen (ie, archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded&#xD;
             tissue [block preferred, or 10 unstained slides]), which will be used for&#xD;
             retrospective biomarker analysis. If archived tumor tissue is not available, then a de&#xD;
             novo biopsy will be required for patient participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases,&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease as indicated by clinical symptoms,&#xD;
             cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Patients with a history of CNS metastases&#xD;
             or cord compression are eligible if they have been definitively treated with local&#xD;
             therapy (eg, radiotherapy, stereotactic surgery) and are clinically stable off&#xD;
             anticonvulsants and steroids for at least 4 weeks before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to swallow capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
