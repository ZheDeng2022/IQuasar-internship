  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research investigation is to conduct a prospective observational study of&#xD;
      the comparative efficacy of haloperidol versus olanzapine versus midazolam versus ziprasidone&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute undifferentiated agitation in the emergency department.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ED will implement a treatment protocol as a quality improvement initiative. All patients&#xD;
      requiring chemical sedation for will receive haloperidol as the initial treatment for&#xD;
      agitation for 21 days, followed by ziprasidone as the initial treatment for agitation for 21&#xD;
      days, followed by olanzapine as the initial treatment for agitation for 21 days, and finally&#xD;
      midazolam as the initial treatment for agitation for 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical care quality improvement protocol. The research component is the&#xD;
      observation of this clinical care protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive medications in the ED will be observed by research staff, evaluating&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the administered medication. The decision to administer the medication&#xD;
      is at the discretion of the physician. Research protocols are only such that we are observing&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety, which coincides the quality improvement purposes of this clinical&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained Research Associates will collect all data on patients who receive a protocol&#xD;
      medication. This will include baseline demographic data including age, gender, etiology of&#xD;
      agitation (according to the treating physician, presumed at the time of medication&#xD;
      administration), initial vital signs, breath alcohol level, drug screen results, pre-hospital&#xD;
      medications administered, and any other laboratory data available at the time (e.g. glucose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research associates will record the patient's level of agitation using a validated agitation&#xD;
      scale, the Altered Mental Status (AMS scale). The AMS scale is an ordinal scale ranging from&#xD;
      -4 (profoundly somnolent) to +4 (profoundly agitated), with agitation generally defined as an&#xD;
      AMS scale of 2 or greater. This scale is a modified version of the Observer's Assessment of&#xD;
      Alertness Scale and the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMS scores will be recorded at the time of medication administration and at every subsequent&#xD;
      15-minute interval until 120 minutes. Research associates will also carry stopwatches and&#xD;
      record the time elapsed until adequate sedation (defined as an AMS â‰¤ 0), as well as whether&#xD;
      other medications (defined as &quot;rescue medications&quot;) were administrated for any reason and at&#xD;
      what time this occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research associates will prospectively monitor each patient for all adverse side effects of&#xD;
      the medications, including hypoxia, need for airway intervention (nasal cannula, facemask,&#xD;
      non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, endotracheal intubation), hypotension, cardiac&#xD;
      dysrhythmias, extrapyramidal side effects, and other complications.&#xD;

ADDENDUM: The primary outcome for this study was changed prior to study initiation to the proportion of patients adequately sedated at 15 minutes (defined as AMSS &lt; 1). This addendum was methodologically necessary to account for the ordinal, non-normal distribution of this data.</description>
