  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teicoplanin is an antibiotic used very commonly to prevent infection during surgery. Its use&#xD;
      has expanded rapidly in the last few years, with around 18,500 doses administered in Leeds&#xD;
      Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust alone, in 2014-15. Unfortunately, anaphylaxis (a severe allergic&#xD;
      reaction) to the drug appears to be increasing. These reactions can result in admission to&#xD;
      intensive care, prolong hospital stay, or even be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is vital that patients who suffer anaphylaxis have tests to accurately identify the cause,&#xD;
      so they can avoid the drug in future. However these tests are currently very limited, because&#xD;
      we don't have any diagnostic tools proven to confirm or refute a diagnosis of teicoplanin&#xD;
      allergy. We have to make a 'best guess' diagnosis, leaving patients vulnerable to harm in the&#xD;
      future, should they require antibiotics again. We need to reliably diagnose teicoplanin&#xD;
      allergy to reduce this arm. Where a diagnosis of teicoplanin allergy is confirmed, patients&#xD;
      and their doctors know to avoid it. Importantly, where allergy is excluded, teicoplanin can&#xD;
      be safely used, avoiding alternatives that may be less effective, more toxic, and more&#xD;
      expensive. This directly benefits individuals, saves the NHS money by reducing avoidable&#xD;
      harm, and helps improve antibiotic stewardship at a population level - which in the long term&#xD;
      helps reduce antibiotic resistance. The clinical need for this work has become imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborating with our industry partner ThermoFisher (significant expertise in this area), we&#xD;
      aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standardise the current skin testing protocols being used when testing patients with&#xD;
           suspected teicoplanin allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop laboratory tests to support the skin tests, and give a more confident diagnosis&#xD;
           to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Understand how and why people develop allergy to teicoplanin, to better predict and&#xD;
           modify the allergic response.&#xD;
