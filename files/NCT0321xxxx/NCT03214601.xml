      The purpose of this study is to conduct an early clinical evaluation of the Relay Branch&#xD;
      System, which will provide initial insight into the clinical safety and function of the&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Early Feasibility Study (EFS) will assess the safety and effectiveness of the device at&#xD;
      the index procedure and at 30-day follow-up. The study will evaluate the delivery and&#xD;
      deployment of the device, patency of branches and branch vessels, and exclusion of the aortic&#xD;
      pathology. The data will help determine if modifications need to be made to the device, the&#xD;
      procedural steps, operator technique, or the indications for use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This Early Feasibility Study (EFS) protocol describes the clinical study requirements for the&#xD;
      Relay Branch System; a device designed to provide an option for patients with arch and&#xD;
      proximal descending chronic thoracic aortic pathologies. As an EFS, this investigation is&#xD;
      intended to provide proof of principle and initial clinical safety data on the Relay Branch&#xD;
      System. The study is planned as an initial investigation of the device for aortic arch and&#xD;
      proximal descending thoracic aortic aneurysmal disease, PAU (including IMH) and uncomplicated&#xD;
      chronic Type B aortic dissection (including IMH). The study will yield information on&#xD;
      procedural techniques; assessing the safety and effectiveness of the device at the index&#xD;
      procedure and at 30 days, focusing on device delivery and deployment, and circulatory&#xD;
      exclusion of the pathologic process. As a branched device, patency of the endograft branches&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate three-dimensional (3D) imaging data, both at baseline and through&#xD;
      follow-up. Baseline 3D anatomy will augment information on the precise anatomic configuration&#xD;
      of patients presenting aortic arch pathology treatable with the device. Follow-up imaging&#xD;
      will provide information on the effectiveness of the device with respect to endoleaks in&#xD;
      patients with aneurysms, sealing of dissections, PAU and IMH, and stability of the device at&#xD;
      the deployed position, response, endograft patency, and short-term device integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this EFS will yield insights into the following aspects of the device,&#xD;
      preceding a traditional feasibility or pivotal study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical safety of the device-specific aspects of the procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of delivery and deployment of the device,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operator-dependent aspects of device use,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human factors associated with the design and use of the device,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of the device as assessed by device-related adverse events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness of the device in performing its intended purpose over short-term&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations from the study will guide the instructions for use (IFU) for the device.&#xD;
      Finally, the study will collect imaging data to augment the current use conditions data set.&#xD;
      It is anticipated that information collected will be used to make applicable design changes,&#xD;
      or be combined with a prospective, investigational device exemption (IDE) study for&#xD;
      submission of an original premarket approval application (PMA) to the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for approval to commercially distribute the system.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Relay Branch System is intended for treating thoracic aortic arch pathologies requiring coverage of the innominate and left common carotid arteries. The system includes a graft with a proximal landing zone in the proximal aorta and branch grafts that extend into the innominate and left common carotid arteries. The arch graft and branch grafts are composed of self-expanding nitinol stents sutured to polyester vascular graft fabric, creating an exoskeleton</intervention_model_description>
