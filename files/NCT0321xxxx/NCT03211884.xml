      The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of PST for positively impacting&#xD;
      distressed military family caregiver's depression and burden levels (secondary outcomes),&#xD;
      ultimately enhancing their mental health quality of life (QOL, primary outcome).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered the &quot;signature injury&quot; of recent&#xD;
      conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, with 22% of returning troops experiencing a TBI. After&#xD;
      receiving acute and rehabilitative healthcare services, combat veterans with a TBI (active&#xD;
      Service Members and Veterans) are typically cared for at home, by their female (79%) parent&#xD;
      (62%, 32% spouses), and the majority (60%) of these caregivers receive little or no help from&#xD;
      others with their caregiving responsibilities. Not only is TBI a well-documented risk factor&#xD;
      for dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD) later in life, noteworthy similarities exist&#xD;
      between the experiences of family caregivers of Veterans with TBI and caregivers of civilians&#xD;
      with AD. Symptoms of a TBI are very similar to AD and include cognitive impairment (deficits&#xD;
      in memory, language, attention, and/or planning), difficulty communicating, poor impulse&#xD;
      control, and poor emotion regulation. Both conditions necessitate adaptation to emotional and&#xD;
      behavioral changes in the injured family member, and personality changes may result in&#xD;
      relationship strain between the injured person and his or her family caregiver. Similar to&#xD;
      AD, symptoms of a TBI do not lessen over time, are often perceived as burdensome, and are&#xD;
      associated with negative mental health outcomes in their family caregivers. Similarly, both&#xD;
      AD and TBI family caregivers report additional stressors (e.g., continuous monitoring for&#xD;
      unpredictable behaviors and their consequences) when cohabitating with the impaired or&#xD;
      injured family member for an extended period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypotheses: To improve the mental health of family caregivers of post-9/11 combat&#xD;
      veterans with a TBI, the proposed study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of an&#xD;
      evidence-based, short-term (9, 60-mintue session), solution-focused, self- management&#xD;
      intervention utilizing problem-solving therapy (PST) to lessen burden and depression levels,&#xD;
      and improve the quality of life (QOL) in co-residing family caregivers of combat veterans&#xD;
      with a TBI (military family caregivers). PST is based on the premise that real-life&#xD;
      problem-solving plays an important role as a mediator of the relationship between stressful&#xD;
      life events and negative mental health outcomes. When deficits in problem-solving lead to&#xD;
      ineffective coping attempts, under high levels of stress exposure, burden and depression is&#xD;
      likely to ensue. Building on our previous work with caregivers of civilians with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (a proposed precursor for AD) and early-stage AD, it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that military family caregivers receiving PST training will endorse lower levels of&#xD;
      caregiving burden and depression, and improved mental health QOL, at each follow-up&#xD;
      assessment, than caregivers in the comparison (usual care) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of PST for positively&#xD;
      impacting distressed military family caregiver's burden, and depression levels, ultimately&#xD;
      enhancing their mental health QOL (primary outcomes). Data will also be collected to&#xD;
      characterize physical and social stressors for these caregivers such as illness that limits&#xD;
      the caregiver's activities, new household management and caregiving responsibilities,&#xD;
      satisfaction with social roles and activities, lifestyle constraints, the quality of the&#xD;
      marital relationship, perceived social support, and demographic factors. A secondary aim of&#xD;
      the proposed study is to determine which of a series of key caregiver sociodemographic&#xD;
      factors moderate PST- intervention efficacy for caregiving burden and mental health QOL&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A randomized controlled trail design (intention-to-treat model) will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of an individualized PST-based intervention on burden, mental health,&#xD;
      and well-being outcomes in family caregivers of combat veterans with a TBI. We expect to&#xD;
      enroll and randomize 100 family caregivers of Veterans with a TBI from the Joint Forces&#xD;
      Explosive Ordnance Disposal (the disarming and disposal of bombs) Warrior Foundation and&#xD;
      Boulder Crest Retreat for Wounded Warriors family caregiver websites. Caregivers assigned to&#xD;
      the PST group will receive nine PST training sessions (each approximately 60 minutes)&#xD;
      delivered face-to-face every two weeks (to allow time for problem solving efforts and&#xD;
      scheduling conflicts) using study-specific webcams (part of the Study Welcome Kit). Software&#xD;
      will be utilized that permits recording and saving of intervention sessions for review (to&#xD;
      ensure treatment fidelity over time). Outcomes will be collected through the Internet (to&#xD;
      enhance the study's sustainability and scalability) and measured baseline, and at 1-, 3-, 6-,&#xD;
      and 12-mos. post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Relevance: Since family caregivers constitute the largest group of adult care providers&#xD;
      in the United States and the market value of family caregiving exceeds that spent on formal&#xD;
      health and nursing home care, the mental health and well-being of family caregivers of&#xD;
      Veterans with a TBI - and their subsequent ability to assist wounded Veterans at home (e.g.,&#xD;
      prevent institutionalization of injured/impaired Veterans) - is of paramount importance. If&#xD;
      the PST-based intervention reduces burden levels and improves mental health aspects of QOL in&#xD;
      military family caregivers, the data will be used to lay the foundation for offering PST-&#xD;
      based mental health services for distressed family caregivers of Veterans with a TBI through&#xD;
      the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.&#xD;

    <description>Mental health quality of life (QOL) is measured with the mental health component of the Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS) Health Survey Short Form-12 Version 2 (SF-12v2). MOS-SF-12V2 is a multipurpose survey of health related quality of life (both physical and mental) and a practical tool for directly linking norms from large population surveys with the results from more focused RCTs. Both Mental Component Summary Scores (MCS) and Physical Component Summary Scores (PCS) were shown to have high internal consistency reliability (alpha &gt; .80).</description>

    <description>Caregiving burden (worry, exhaustion) is measured with the Montgomery's Subjective Burden Scale (SBS). The SBS includes a series of 13 questions to establish how the caregiver feels about caring for their family member with dementia. The SBS demonstrated sound psychometric properties in the feasibility study (Cronbach's alpha = .95) and preliminary data shows variability in responses for the target population.</description>

    <description>Depression levels are measured with the Center for epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D, Revised) is composed of 20 items, each response corresponds to the frequency of the symptom in the preceding week, higher score indicate more severe depressive symptoms. A cutoff score of 16 or greater is indicative of individuals at high risk for clinical depression. The CES-D demonstrated high internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .91) in our feasibility study.</description>

    <description>Couched within Bandura's social-cognitive theory, self-management refers to the process by which individuals accept responsibility for and take action to change their behaviors, obtain knowledge related to their situation (e.g., behavioral manifestations of a TBI) through increased awareness and use of effective personal resources (e.g., skill in every-day problem-solving). This ultimately enhances the caregivers' confidence that they can cope with caregiving and behavior-related stressors in the care recipient.</description>

    <description>The problem-solving therapy (PST)-based intervention consists of nine, 60-90 minute educational sessions conducted face-to-face via the Internet (through video conferencing software) approximately 2 weeks apart. After attending a preliminary 15 minute &quot;meet &amp; greet&quot; session, participants received written and verbal education about solving everyday problems. Together, the participant and interventionist complete the 7-steps to solve at least one problem together before ending the training. Participants keep a record of their problem-solving efforts between sessions and questions they had related to the application of PST. These records were used as a basis for discussion during the PST training sessions.</description>
