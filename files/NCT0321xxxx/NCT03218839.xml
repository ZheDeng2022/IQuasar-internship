    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of the PrePex device as applied to HIV positive men by&#xD;
      assessing the rate of clinical adverse events. The study will include adult, HIV + men who&#xD;
      are eligible to receive the PrePex procedure per the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child&#xD;
      Care (MOHCC) eligibility criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to mathematical modeling, Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) has the&#xD;
      potential to have a major impact on reducing HIV incidence in areas with high HIV prevalence&#xD;
      and low prevalence of male circumcision, as is the case in Zimbabwe. Male circumcision&#xD;
      devices have the potential to accelerate VMMC scale-up as the procedure is faster and simpler&#xD;
      and can be safely performed by nurses. However, fear of social stigma and desire to avoid HIV&#xD;
      testing remain potential barriers to those HIV+ men who would otherwise seek out VMMC. Study&#xD;
      subjects (n=400) are HIV+ males who elect to undergo VMMC with PrePex as a study subject, and&#xD;
      healthcare workers involved in implementation of PrePex on HIV+ male subjects. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to determine if PrePex can be used safely among HIV+ men with similar rates of&#xD;
      adverse events to HIV-uninfected men. If so, then the barrier of mandatory HIV testing as&#xD;
      part of VMMC could be removed, encouraging more men to undergo the procedure. Determining&#xD;
      PrePex safety in HIV+ men would also allow both those with unknown status and those with&#xD;
      positive status to undergo MC with PrePex. Determining the barriers to performing VMMC among&#xD;
      HIV+ men among healthcare workers, if any, would also inform future policy.&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of adverse events among HIV+ males using PrePex device</measure>
    <time_frame>Device application through complete wound healing (up to 90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of clinical adverse events and device-related incidents.&#xD;
Clinical related incidents such as the following:&#xD;
Site bleeding (bleeding that cannot be stopped with pressure of 30 seconds and requires suturing)&#xD;
Penis-wide diffuse hematoma&#xD;
Penis-wide diffuse edema&#xD;
Incision site infection and related symptoms&#xD;
Device-related incidents&#xD;
Necrotic Process not initiated&#xD;
Device does not remain in situ for the full 7 days (displacement)&#xD;
Note: This list of AEs is not exhaustive.&#xD;
Severity of AE will be determined according to PEPFAR/OGAC guidelines</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment at key time points</measure>
    <time_frame>Placement through complete healing (up to 90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's subjective pain, tingling, and discomfort related to PrePex when applying the system, wearing it and removing it. This will be assessed by numeric pain, tingling and discomfort VAS scale (Pain = VAS x Duration in Minutes). Measured in the post placement recovery at 15 minutes after placement, and then 1, 2, and 3 hours post placement.&#xD;
As the necrotic process initiates, it is expected that some of subjects will have temporary discomfort during the first 2 hours after deployment (hence anaesthetic cream), which vanishes thereafter for the rest of the weeklong period when the device is in place.&#xD;
Some pain is expected for a short duration (about 10 seconds) when extracting the Inner Ring during the removal procedure.</description>
