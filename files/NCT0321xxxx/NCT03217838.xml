    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      schedule, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AZD2811 monotherapy&#xD;
      or with combination agent(s) in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients or&#xD;
      treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive induction therapy. The study will&#xD;
      also explore the potential clinical activity by assessing anti-tumour activity in patients.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts, designated Part A, dose escalation, and Part B,&#xD;
      dose expansion. Patients will be enrolled in either Part A or Part B according to the&#xD;
      Investigator's judgment of the most appropriate treatment for the individual patient and slot&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - Dose Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 48 evaluable treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive induction&#xD;
      therapy or relapsed/refractory AML patients will be enrolled in Arm 1 and Arm 2 of the&#xD;
      monotherapy escalation in Part A of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation and de-escalation plan for evaluating AZD2811 will follow the Bayesian&#xD;
      Adaptive Design scheme which combines prior expectations about the dose toxicity relationship&#xD;
      and applies the data at the end of each cohort to recommend a dose and schedule for the next&#xD;
      cohort. The total number of patients will depend upon the number of dose escalations,&#xD;
      de-escalations, and schedule changes necessary. At least 3 and up to 6 evaluable patients&#xD;
      will be required for each dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Group 1, Arm A - Day 1 and 4 Monotherapy Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single 2- or 4- hour IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 4 of each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle. Dosing frequency and schedule may be adjusted during the study on the basis of&#xD;
      emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data. Approximately 22 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Group 1, Arm B - Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 Monotherapy Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 every 4 weeks or 28 days (Q4W) schedule will be investigated in&#xD;
      addition to the Day 1 and 4 Q4W schedule. The proposed starting dose for this schedule is 300&#xD;
      mg/infusion AZD2811 on Day 1, 4, 15 and 18 (i.e. cumulative dose 1200 mg/Q4W). This starting&#xD;
      dose is less than daily doses shown to be tolerated in the AML setting, and the cumulative&#xD;
      cycle dose/Q4W does not exceed the highest dose shown to be tolerated (600 mg/infusion Day 1,&#xD;
      4 cumulative 1200 mg Q4W). Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD2811 can be escalated (in the combination setting) independent of the monotherapy dose&#xD;
      explored, after thorough examination of the available safety data. The combination therapy&#xD;
      exploration will not impact the dose to be further explored in the monotherapy setting nor&#xD;
      will the monotherapy impact the dose in the combination setting. As such, the number of&#xD;
      cohorts in the monotherapy setting can differ from the number of cohorts in the combination&#xD;
      setting. The safety observations of the monotherapy will be considered by the Safety Review&#xD;
      Committee (SRC) in the overall decision-making process for subsequent dose exploration&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rolling 6 design will be applied to both of the AZD2811 and combination arms. The rolling 6&#xD;
      method allows accrual of 3 to 6 patients concurrently onto a dose level based on the numbers&#xD;
      of patients who are currently enrolled and evaluable, who experience a DLT, and who remain at&#xD;
      risk of developing a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Group 2 Arm A - Day 1 and 4 Azacitidine Combination Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A starting dose of 400 mg of AZD2811 will be used for investigation in combination with the&#xD;
      standard dose of the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine. In this dose escalation part,&#xD;
      approximately 12-15 evaluable treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive&#xD;
      induction therapy or relapsed/refractory AML will be enrolled and dosed in ascending doses of&#xD;
      AZD2811 and standard dose of azacitidine at 75 mg/m² of body surface area subcutaneously (SC)&#xD;
      in all territories or optionally/alternatively by IV in the United States (US) as per&#xD;
      national prescribing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Group 2 Arm B - Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 Azacitidine Combination Dose Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase dose intensity during the 4 week cycle, and improve efficacy in the&#xD;
      combination setting, AZD2811 will also be explored on the Days 1, 4, 15 and 18 schedule in&#xD;
      the azacitidine combination and start at a lower daily dosage that has been shown to be safe&#xD;
      while administered every 28 days. The proposed starting dose for this schedule is 300&#xD;
      mg/infusion AZD2811 on Day 1, 4, 15 and 18 (i.e., cumulative dose per 28 days is 1200 mg/Q4W)&#xD;
      and standard dose and use of azacitidine 75 mg/m² of body surface area subcutaneously (SC) in&#xD;
      all territories or optionally/alternatively by IV in the United States (US) as per national&#xD;
      prescribing information. Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax Combination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 18-21 evaluable relapsed/refractory AML patients will be enrolled and dosed&#xD;
      with AZD2811 and venetoclax. In cohort 1v, AZD2811 will be administered at 200 mg IV on Days&#xD;
      1 and 4 every 28 days (Q4W) and venetoclax will be given 100 mg orally (PO) on Day 1 and 200&#xD;
      mg (PO) with a meal and water on Days 2- 28 for the 1st cycle. The third patient in cohort 1&#xD;
      (AZD2811 at 200 mg) will only be enrolled after the first 2 patients have received ≥ 2 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment and have shown no evidence of toxicity observed to be compatible with a DLT, and&#xD;
      further dose escalations of AZD2811 will occur at the discretion of the Safety Review&#xD;
      Committee (SRC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of AZD2811 can be escalated (in the combination setting) independent of the&#xD;
      monotherapy dose explored, after thorough examination of the available safety data of the&#xD;
      current and the previous cohorts. The combination therapy exploration will not impact the&#xD;
      dose further explored in the monotherapy setting nor will the monotherapy impact the dose in&#xD;
      the combination setting. As such, the number of cohorts in the monotherapy setting can differ&#xD;
      from the number of cohorts in the combination setting. The safety observations of the&#xD;
      monotherapy will be considered by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) in the overall&#xD;
      decision-making process for subsequent dose exploration decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Group 3 Arm A - Day 1 and 4 Venetoclax Combination Dose Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 3 Arm A, AZD2811 is planned to be administered at 200 mg IV on Day 1 and Day 4 every&#xD;
      28 days (Q4W) and venetoclax is planned to be given (with a meal and water) at a dose of 100&#xD;
      mg orally (PO) on Day 1 and ramping up to 200 mg (PO) on Days 2-28 for the 1st cycle. The&#xD;
      third patient in cohort 1 (AZD2811 at 200 mg) will only be enrolled after the first 2&#xD;
      patients have received ≥2 weeks of treatment and have shown no evidence of toxicity observed&#xD;
      to be compatible with a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further dose escalations of AZD2811 in Group 3 Arm A will occur at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Safety Review Committee (SRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Group 3 Arm B - Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 Venetoclax Combination Dose Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      If data from Groups 1 and/or 2 suggest that patients could benefit from a more intense&#xD;
      AZD2811 dosing regimen, a schedule of venetoclax with AZD2811 dosing on Days 1, 4, 15 and 18&#xD;
      (see below) may be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 Arm B will not exceed the registered venetoclax dose when combined with a starting&#xD;
      dose of AZD2811 that is considered safe based on Group 3 Arm A observations. Subsequent&#xD;
      cohorts will explore how to escalate AZD2811 in a more intensified schedule towards a&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Dose Expansion&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B approximately 18 AML patients (6 additional patients in each group [AZD2811&#xD;
      monotherapy, Group 1], [AZD2811 in the azacitidine combination setting, Group 2], and&#xD;
      [AZD2811 and venetoclax combination, Group 3]) will follow the affiliated dose/schedule from&#xD;
      Part A that was found to be the most tolerable and/or efficacious.&#xD;
