      &quot;To determine the efficacy of program of prevention of delirium in critically ill patients&#xD;
      from the intensive care units of Bucaramanga and Floridablanca. Methods: The study will be a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial in 600 critically ill patients recruited at 24 hours&#xD;
      from arrival on the intensive care units of Bucaramanga and Floridablanca, without delirium,&#xD;
      with ≥50% in the PREDELIRIC scale score, who comply with the inclusion and exclusion. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in blocks to one of the two groups, intervention group (delirium&#xD;
      prevention program, n=200) with control group (usual care; n= 400), the study will compare&#xD;
      the incidence of delirium in both groups. Patients will be followed every day with Confusion&#xD;
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) until the patient presents delirium,&#xD;
      exit to hospitalization or death. Delirium prevention program includes individualized&#xD;
      nonpharmacological interventions such as multisensory stimulation, cognitive stimulation,&#xD;
      activate the functional and family involvement. The study has received ethical approval from&#xD;
      the University of Santander&quot;&#xD;

      &quot;delirium predominance in the intensive care unit (ICU) is 20- 80%, depending on the scale to&#xD;
      which it measures itself and some characteristics of the patients ( Carrillo &amp; Sosa, 2010).&#xD;
      The development of the delirium in the intensive care unit presents an important impact in&#xD;
      the treatment of the patient , therefore directly influences the hospital cost , in the stay&#xD;
      and the mortality .Martinez &amp; others (2004) also , the delirium is diagnosed just in 66-84%&#xD;
      of the patients who present this complication , because in come circumstances it is confused&#xD;
      with dementia or anxiety and why there does not exist a diagnostic methodology adequate for&#xD;
      its evaluation. With regard to the diagnosis of the delirium , several methods exist for the&#xD;
      diagnosis , the evaluation method of the confusion CAMICU of the english confusion assesment&#xD;
      method for the ICU is the most used, in the intensive care unit , for its high sensibility,&#xD;
      reliability and validity to identify delirium when it is used by nurses and doctors of the&#xD;
      ICU and only it needs 2-3 minutes for its achievement (Ely &amp; others, 2004) This way, Boogaard&#xD;
      and collaborators decided to construct and validate a model who allows to predict the&#xD;
      delirium probability in adult patients of intensive care unit (Boogaard&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  others, 2012), in order to restore preventive measurements to reduce its incidence,&#xD;
           gravity and duration. The delirium have high frequency and with an impact&#xD;
           bio-psico-economic in the patient and its environment , the prevention is the most&#xD;
           effective and economic measure of tackling the delirium in its initial phase and nursing&#xD;
           contributes to a great extent in this work . It is as well as in a titled previous study&#xD;
           : validity of the model of prediction of the delirium in intensive care unit of&#xD;
           Bucaramanga, realized by Torres and Páez in 2014 in the Comuneros universitarian&#xD;
           Hospital of Bucaramanga brought up to the date an incidence of the delirium of 20.5%,&#xD;
           with a mortality of 47.5% of the patients who do delirium during its stay in ICU ,&#xD;
           proving the efficacy od the model PREDELIRIC to predict the delirium in the first 24&#xD;
           hours of stay in ICU , in patients with high values its like say a PREDELIRIC result&#xD;
           &gt;50% Taking this study as a precedent there appears the target to determine the efficacy&#xD;
           of the prevention program of delirium in the population of critical patients in&#xD;
           Bucaramanga, (the Comuneros universitarian Hospital of Bucaramanga) across a randomized&#xD;
           controlled clinical essay , in order to predict early in these patients the possibility&#xD;
           of delirium development and to facilitate the application of preventive measurements not&#xD;
           pharmacological in patients with high risk . these preventive measurements would be done&#xD;
           across individualized interventions and they would be focused after the improved&#xD;
           orientation , cognitive stimulation , early mobilization to listen to music with the&#xD;
           intention of reduce the delirium incidence, of improving the cognition of the patients&#xD;
           and avoiding its deterioration during the staying in the ICU , condition that can remain&#xD;
           after its departure ( Inouye &amp; others, 1999). Also, the results of this investigation&#xD;
           will appear in a scientific article and scientific congresses in the área of health .&#xD;
           Also, they will be announced to the universitarian community and the involved&#xD;
           institution. Key words : Delirium, intensive care, prevention , nursing interventions.&#xD;
           Like an important antecedent in Santander the group of research of the nursing program&#xD;
           Everest execute a study to validate the prediction model PREDELIRIC to a spanish version&#xD;
           , this study expose the need to identify and implement interventions of nursing to&#xD;
           prevent the delirium in critical patients of Bucaramanga Our priority now is to apply&#xD;
           the model of prediction PREDELIRIC validated in a spanish version to the population of&#xD;
           critical patients to predict early in these patients the possibility of development of&#xD;
           delirium , facilitating the specific application of not pharmacological preventive&#xD;
           measurements in patient who is in high risk. These preventive measurements would be done&#xD;
           across an individualized intervention and they would be focused to: to improve the&#xD;
           orientation, cognitive stimulation , early mobilization, listen to music, in patients of&#xD;
           high risk, Inouye &amp; others (1999) All this , focused to improve the cognition of the&#xD;
           patients and to avoid the cognitive deterioration presented during the stay in the ICU&#xD;
           and that can remain after the departure of the patient in the ICU, Inouye&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  others (1999) Additionally identifying in a specific way the patients who has a benefit&#xD;
           from the preventive measurements optimizes the time of personnel of health, reducing the&#xD;
           incidence of the delirium, turns into a strategy cost- benefit for the persons and the&#xD;
           relatives also for the institution on having diminished the hospitable stay, adverse&#xD;
           events and the morbi- mortality . Inouye &amp; others (1990). It is of clarifying and&#xD;
           admitting that now some institutions make different interventions, which tackle the&#xD;
           prevention of the delirium, however , these interventions are realized in an isolated&#xD;
           way, associated with the interest and motivation of the personnel, there do not exist&#xD;
           organized and systematized processes that they allow to face and link to the whole&#xD;
           personnel , the recognition of the delirium during the hospitalization in the ICU , and&#xD;
           although they interfere in the process , there do no exist very few concrete proposals&#xD;
           that reflect in wich way institutions impact the presentation and prevention of the&#xD;
           delirium . In the same way , the services of intensive care unit has been unidentified&#xD;
           that the recommendations with regard to the care and prevention of the delirium tend yo&#xD;
           be generalized, without dedicating enough time to the recognition of the problems,&#xD;
           neither is clear the process of pursuit that is done, to the needs and to the result of&#xD;
           the realized interventions . To the date conclusive studies are not known in this&#xD;
           subject and there has not been proved the efficacy of not pharmacological interventions&#xD;
           directed to the prevention of the delirium in critics patients, only there exist the&#xD;
           modality of the study of doctor Inouye and collaborators in 1999 who verified a decrease&#xD;
           of 30% of the delirium with the implementation of these measurements in hospitalized&#xD;
           aged patients. Inouye &amp; others (1999) Bearing in mind the serious and irreversible&#xD;
           consequences of the delirium to shortly and long term in the critical patients, we want&#xD;
           to propose the implementation of not pharmacological measurements to prepare this&#xD;
           phenomenon and simultaneously to prove the efficacy in patients that diagnoses a high&#xD;
           risk of development of delirium as the application of the scale PREDELIRIC version&#xD;
           validated in spanish The investigation on the prediction of the delirium , of indirect&#xD;
           form will tackle these problematic , generating knowledge on the real e situation,&#xD;
           favoring the identification of courses that will face processes, qualification of the&#xD;
           personnel and making of a guide of intervention in nursing focus on the diminish the&#xD;
           frenzy of the intensive unit care of the country One admits that beyond the requested&#xD;
           for the regulations , the training and permanent accompaniment is needed for the team of&#xD;
           health as regards the attention humanized in highly specializing and technological&#xD;
           stages as it is the ICU To obtain new knowledge that they can contribute to the&#xD;
           comprehension and the sensitization of the situation of the delirium in the persons&#xD;
           hospitalized in the intensive care unit does part of the contribution to the body of&#xD;
           knowledge in the área of critical care , it is so to find a predictor of the&#xD;
           investigation of delirium cost in the intensive care unit strengthens the theoretical&#xD;
           bases to improve the care . There will be beneficiaries of the results of the present&#xD;
           investigation, in addition to the patients , relatives and personnel of health, the&#xD;
           educational institutions of the region , who will have new indications to the academic&#xD;
           programs realizing on the programs of specialization of the área, this way to validate&#xD;
           the care interventions for the user who came to the ICU and improve the offered care.&#xD;
           Generating and applying the results of the present study will be a contribution for the&#xD;
           generation of models of attention in Colombia, directed to a persons who live through an&#xD;
           illness situation and who are hospitalized in ICU , thinking about hoe to high light the&#xD;
           importance of implementing strategies for the advance in the knowledge and the&#xD;
           employment of the results in the formation, practice and investigation to consolidate&#xD;
           the proposals to answer for the needs of this population . The results of the present&#xD;
           study will be presented like a proposal for the institutions and specially for the&#xD;
           intensive care unit adult with the target to offer tools to the care, this will be a&#xD;
           progress of the general satisfaction.&#xD;
