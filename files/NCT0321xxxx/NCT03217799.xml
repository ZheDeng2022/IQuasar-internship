    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an optical system that measures the coagulation status of&#xD;
      patients in vivo in a non-invasive manner. The system is based on a small optical sensor that&#xD;
      emits coherent light into the skin and collects the reflected light from the red blood cells&#xD;
      in the blood vessels in the skin under the sensor. The sensor is placed on the fingertip, and&#xD;
      during a brief period of occlusion of blood flow by a small pneumatic cuff, red cell movement&#xD;
      becomes Brownian in nature and is thereby affected by the viscosity of the blood. In patients&#xD;
      who have a bleeding tendency, red blood cell movement will be faster, while in patients with&#xD;
      a hypercoagulable state the red cell movement will be slower. Treatment with anticoagulant&#xD;
      medications is expected to affect the movement of the red blood cells and these changes can&#xD;
      be detected by the sensor. The investigators plan to test the device in normal subjects and&#xD;
      in subjects taking Coumadin, direct oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs and heparin-based&#xD;
      medications. The investigators will determine whether anticoagulants affect the noninvasive&#xD;
      measurement and compare the results with standard laboratory tests of coagulation.&#xD;

      Overview: The investigators plan to measure the coagulation status with the new sensor in&#xD;
      patients who are attending the Coagulation Clinic in Meir Hospital Center. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure their coagulation status with the new sensor during the participants' routine&#xD;
      clinic visits. During their visits, The participants' care will not be affected or influenced&#xD;
      by the results of the data obtained by the new sensor. The accumulated data will be collected&#xD;
      and later correlated with their clinical status and with routine clotting parameters that are&#xD;
      measured, depending on the type of anticoagulation the participants receive. Specifically, in&#xD;
      those receiving warfarin, INR will be assessed during their visit, while in patients&#xD;
      receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), factor Xa activity will be assessed.&#xD;
      Inparticipants receiving heparin, PTT will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and control subject: Subjects will be recruited from the Coagulation Clinic. The&#xD;
      participants will consist of patients attending the clinic for follow-up of their prescribed&#xD;
      anticoagulation treatment. Patients to be studied will include subjects receiving warfarin&#xD;
      anticoagulation, NOACs, heparin and anti-platelet therapy (aspirin, clopidrogel or other&#xD;
      anti-platelet medications). Normal subjects receiving no anticoagulation will also be studied&#xD;
      and will serve as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: Experimental subjects will be selected from patients attending the Coagulation&#xD;
      Clinic. Patients will be seen in the clinic and receive their usual follow-up care. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, the participants' coagulation status will be assessed with the&#xD;
      new sensor. Patients on warfarin medications will have a venous blood sample obtained (5 ml)&#xD;
      for determination of INR. Patients receiving NOACs will have a venous blood sample obtained&#xD;
      (5 ml) for determination of Factor Xa activity. At a later date, the coagulation status of&#xD;
      the patients as assessed by the new sensor will be compared to the coagulation status as&#xD;
      assessed by the standard laboratory methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal controls will be recruited from hospital personnel. Normal controls will have their&#xD;
      coagulation status assessed by the new sensor only. Since normal control are not receiving&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy, blood samples for measurement of INR or factor Xa activity will not&#xD;
      be drawn. Normal controls will receive no financial compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The pneumatic cuff is attached to the root of the index finger. The sensor cuff&#xD;
      is attached several centimeters distal to the pneumatic cuff. Measurement is taken for a&#xD;
      60-second control period, and then the pneumatic cuff is inflated to above-systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (200 mm Hg) for 180 seconds, and measurement is taken during this period of time.&#xD;
      The cuff is then deflated, and another 60-second measurement is taken. Data is collected by&#xD;
      the measuring device for later analysis.&#xD;
