    <textblock>
      Dilated cardiomyopathy is a heart muscle disorder characterized by systolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      dilation of the left or both ventricles.Dilated cardiomyopathy can develop in people of any&#xD;
      age or ethnicity, although it is more common in male than female persons occurring at a ratio&#xD;
      of about three to one in male to female persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dilated cardiomyopathy is the predominant cause of cardiomyopathy in pediatric populations.&#xD;
      Annual incidence in pediatric populations has been reported to be much lower than one to one&#xD;
      hundred seventy thousand in the United States and one to one hundred forty thousand in&#xD;
      Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy has a lower annual incidence than adult dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, the outcome for pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy patients is particularly&#xD;
      severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most frequent cause of heart transplantation in pediatric&#xD;
      patients. Data from international pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy registries indicate that&#xD;
      the rates of death or heart transplantation over one and five year periods were thirty one&#xD;
      percent and forty six percent, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onset of dilated cardiomyopathy is usually insidious but may be acute in as many at twenty&#xD;
      five percent of patients. Approximately fifty percent of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      have a history of preceding viral illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy is made from history, physical examination,&#xD;
      and noninvasive testing. The initial clinical manifestations of dilated heart failure are&#xD;
      generally those of respiratory distress secondary to congestion of the pulmonary and systemic&#xD;
      venous circulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pallor, irritability, diaphoresis, tachypnea, easy fatigability are characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure to grow may also occur. In older patients, a history of orthopnea, nocturnal cough,&#xD;
      and dyspnea provoked by minimal activity can be elicited and generally precede evidence of&#xD;
      systemic venous congestion. In rapidly progressive disease, dominant symptoms are often&#xD;
      abdominal distention, right upper quadrant pain, and nausea. Less often, initial symptoms in&#xD;
      childhood include arrhythmias, syncope, neurologic problems (seizures or delayed&#xD;
      development), vomiting, abdominal distention, or fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although as many as fifty percent of children with cardiomyopathy and heart failure give a&#xD;
      history of a nonspecific febrile illness within three months of presentation, no evidence of&#xD;
      myocarditis can usually be found on biopsy.'Physical signs vary with the stage of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of congestive heart failure are frequent, and include tachypnea,tachycardia,&#xD;
      diaphoresis, hepatomegaly, pallor, and, in advanced cases, hypotension and shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure to thrive may be present if, heart failure has been long standing. Patients are&#xD;
      generally not cyanotic. Wheezing may be heard; however, rales are infrequent, especially in&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck vein distension is common, the external jugular crest reflecting mean right atrial&#xD;
      pressure, the internal jugular exhibiting a prominent V wave indicative of tricuspid&#xD;
      regurgitation.&#xD;
