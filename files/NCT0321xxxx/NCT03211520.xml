      The study is being conducted to see which cardiac tests that monitor how the heart functions&#xD;
      during and after treatment with anthracyclines are most effective. This study will assess a&#xD;
      new way to check the heart function of children during and after cancer treatment. Currently,&#xD;
      doctors use echocardiograms (heart ultrasound) to see how the heart is working.&#xD;
      Echocardiograms are currently being done as part of standard of care prior to giving&#xD;
      anthracycline chemotherapy doses and if any cardiac problems are suspected. The new method&#xD;
      involves Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imagining (CMRI) and a blood tests for certain biomarkers&#xD;
      for heart health: High sensitivity troponin, Caspase, C-reactive Protein (CRP), ventricular&#xD;
      derived B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), Tissue inhibitors&#xD;
      of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), C terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), C terminal&#xD;
      telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP), Troponin I, and Bone Alkaline Phosphatase. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to find out if CMRI and blood tests help us to find heart problems earlier,&#xD;
      before they are detected by echocardiograms.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study with a descriptive study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline induced late onset cardiotoxicity, defined in terms of abnormal findings on&#xD;
      echocardiography, has been reported to occur in 57% of childhood cancer survivors. Serial&#xD;
      monitoring of cardiac function by means of echocardiography detects cardiac toxicity only&#xD;
      when many of the cardiomyocytes have already been damaged. Given the lack of evidence to&#xD;
      support the reliability of serum markers of cardiotoxicity, many recommend modifying the dose&#xD;
      of anthracyclines only when there is objective evidence of myocardial dysfunction by&#xD;
      echocardiograph. This approach could be responsible for the increasing frequency of dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy occurring 10-15 years after treatment. Non invasive imaging methods are thus&#xD;
      critically needed to more precisely detect cardiotoxic changes in children receiving&#xD;
      anthracyclines. CMRI has become the gold standard for the assessment and quantification of&#xD;
      ventricular volumes, myocardial mass and global and regional wall function. CMRI also allows&#xD;
      morphologic analysis of the myocardium as well as detection and characterization of&#xD;
      pathological myocardium. In this study, the investigator therefore proposes to use serial MRI&#xD;
      parameters in conjunction with a battery of serologic markers, obtained at intervals&#xD;
      determined by cumulative anthracycline dose, to monitor changes in systolic function during&#xD;
      chemotherapy and one year after the end of chemotherapy. The investigator will use a&#xD;
      combination of a serum cardiac biomarker of inflammation (CRP), myocyte injury (Troponin,&#xD;
      Caspases), heart failure (BNP), and extracellular matrix remodeling (PICP, CITP, Bone&#xD;
      Alkaline Phosphatase, MMPs, TIMPs). The investigator will then correlate these findings with&#xD;
      CMRI parameters of myocyte dysfunction. Results will be compared with standard&#xD;
      echocardiography. The investigator predict that CMRI is a better indicator of early&#xD;
      anthracycline cardiotoxicity in children with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are of age 9 years of age or older, newly diagnosed with a malignancy that is&#xD;
      anticipated to receive high dose anthracyclines as part of their chemotherapy (such as but&#xD;
      not limited to solid tumors, high risk Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Acute Myelogenous&#xD;
      Leukemia, and lymphomas) will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To use CMRI to detect occult asymptomatic cardiotoxicity over time and in&#xD;
      relation to cumulative dose among pediatric cancer patients treated with anthracyclines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To quantitate serologic biomarker profile for several functional pathways&#xD;
      including the inflammatory cascade, MMP/TIMP remodeling pathways, signaling, cell viability&#xD;
      and growth domains over time and in relation to cumulative dose among pediatric cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with anthracyclines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To compare changes over time detected by CMRI and serologic markers of&#xD;
      cardiac toxicity to echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic function and&#xD;
      determine their ability alone or in combination to predict freedom from left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction defined as change in ejection fraction at one year post chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims will test the hypothesis that CMR imaging and serologic biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation, apoptosis and progressive extracellular matrix remodeling will precede&#xD;
      echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic function among children receiving high&#xD;
      dose anthracyclines as part of their chemotherapy protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial edema in the acute phase measured by the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased myocardial mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focal areas of high signal intensity T2 weighted spin echo imaging and myocardial&#xD;
           delayed enhancement. Significant enhancement will be defined as signal intensity&#xD;
           increases of greater than two standard deviations above the mean value of remote normal&#xD;
           myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased myocardial T2 relaxation time in the myocardium compared to baseline as&#xD;
           measured by T2 mapping technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in myocardial T1 relaxation time in the myocardium pre and post-contrast&#xD;
           compared to baseline as measured by T1 mapping technique (Modified Look-Locker inversion&#xD;
           recovery (MOLLI). Myocardial T1 (msc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in myocardial strain and strain rate compared to baseline calculations: Mid&#xD;
           wall left ventricular circumferential strain (ECC), Maximum longitudinal left&#xD;
           ventricular strain (ELL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in myocardial T2* indicative of presence of Iron in the myocardium (reflecting&#xD;
           anthracycline-Fe complexes)(ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following markers were measured: Matrix/Fibrosis pathway:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma levels of MMPs (all soluble MMP types) and TIMPs (all 4 TIMPs); Inflammatory domain:&#xD;
      cytokines (TNFα, interleukins, interferon gamma (IFNG), TGF β2, TGF βII)),cytokine receptors&#xD;

      Signaling pathway: growth factors (GDP-15, GCSF, VEGF, sVEGFR2 TGFβ1, IGF-1;). Changes in&#xD;
      regional myocardial function and elevation of serologic markers may predict freedom from left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction defined as ejection fraction ≥55% at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be done for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CMRI tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiograms&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests noted above will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to or at before the cum dose of anthracyclines = 60 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cumulative anthracycline doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  125-175 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  200-250 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  275-325 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After maximal anthracycline treatment&#xD;
