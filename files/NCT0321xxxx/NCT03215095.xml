  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a drug called&#xD;
      durvalumab combined with Thyrogen-stimulated RAI, has on the patient and thyroid cancer.&#xD;
      Durvalumab is a drug that has been developed to activate the immune system by blocking a&#xD;
      protein called programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) that can be present on tumor and normal&#xD;
      cells, including immune cells.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma of&#xD;
             follicular origin (including papillary, follicular, hurthle cell or poorly&#xD;
             differentiated subtypes and their respective variants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one RAI-avid lesion identified on the most recent radioiodine scan (a&#xD;
             diagnostic, post-therapy, or post-ablation scan) OR at least one lesion on the most&#xD;
             recent FDG PET scan with an SUV max of 10 or less. (Both RAI-sensitive and&#xD;
             RAI-refractory patients are eligible if at least one tumor with RAI avidity of any&#xD;
             degree can be identified within one of these parameters.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section&#xD;
             11 for the evaluation of measurable disease. Tumors in previously irradiated fields&#xD;
             may be considered measureable if there is evidence of tumor progression after&#xD;
             radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). (This will not&#xD;
                  apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent&#xD;
                  hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis&#xD;
                  or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their&#xD;
                  physician.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver&#xD;
                  metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine CL&gt;40 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft and Gault&#xD;
                  1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential (i.e., post-menopausal by&#xD;
             history: ≥60 years old and no menses for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause;&#xD;
             OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to undergo two research biopsies of (a) malignant lesion(s).&#xD;
             Biopsies do not need to be done if the investigator or person performing the biopsy&#xD;
             judges there is no tumor accessible for biopsy, the only accessible tumor must be used&#xD;
             for RECIST measurement, or the biopsy poses too great a risk to the patient. If the&#xD;
             patient has only one RECIST measureable target lesion for response assessment,&#xD;
             research biopsies must not be performed on that target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis (a&#xD;
             tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required. Patients with less&#xD;
