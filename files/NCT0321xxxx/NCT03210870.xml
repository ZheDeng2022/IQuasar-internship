    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to learn more about how nutritional advice given during pregnancy&#xD;
      affects a mother's food choices and her baby's growth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposal is to effect change in women's nutritional behaviors that&#xD;
      will improve not only their own health and that of their unborn child. Because solutions and&#xD;
      needs for prevention of chronic diseases are unique and especially challenging for rural&#xD;
      areas, we have chosen to stage our studies in the northern coast of Oregon, centered on the&#xD;
      town of Astoria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to assess the effect on markers of maternal health and fetal growth of&#xD;
      providing education that includes the rationale and practical aspects of healthy cooking&#xD;
      during pregnancy to improve her baby's lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease and other&#xD;
      chronic diseases. We will accomplish this objective through the completion of a nutritional&#xD;
      education program for pregnant women that incorporates the biopsychosocial principles of the&#xD;
      Satter Eating Competence Model in the curriculum, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emphasizing healthy food choices:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Whole foods&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Plant-based (fruits, vegetables, plant-based oils/fats) and whole grains&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Fish and lean meats&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Non-fat dairy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoiding / minimizing intake of unhealthy foods, such as processed foods/meals and&#xD;
           sugar-added beverages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving eating competency by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Developing and maintaining positive attitudes about eating and food&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Acceptance skills that support eating an ever-increasing variety of the available&#xD;
                food&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Following internal regulation signals that allow intuitively consuming enough food&#xD;
                to give energy and stamina and to support stable body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Enhancing skills and resources for orchestrating family meals&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developmental Origins of Health and Disease There is increasing evidence that the health of&#xD;
      adult populations is influenced by the nutritional provision imparted to its members during&#xD;
      their conception and through the first three years of their post-conception life, reflecting&#xD;
      the origination of the structures in an individual's body from developmental processes. The&#xD;
      links between early nutrition and later health initially came to light through the work of&#xD;
      Dr. David Barker, who showed that in poorer regions of the UK, those who survived infancy&#xD;
      predominantly died of athersclerotic disease as adults and demonstrated an inverse&#xD;
      relationship between birthweight and ischemic heart disease. Similar relationships between&#xD;
      low birth weights with increased risk of heart disease have now been replicated in the United&#xD;
      States, Scandinavian countries, Finland, the Netherlands and in India, as well as in animal&#xD;
      models of nutritional deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent research has demonstrated that people who grew poorly before birth or as infants&#xD;
      are at risk not only for heart disease but also for other adult chronic diseases including&#xD;
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, asthma, and osteoporosis. Poor growth in early life&#xD;
      has also been associated with compromised cognitive function. It is now believed, based on&#xD;
      animal and human data that prenatal stressors in the form of nutrition, high levels of stress&#xD;
      hormone (cortisol), and hypoxia lead to structural and epigenetic changes that impart&#xD;
      vulnerability for disease in later life. The developmental response to these stressors is&#xD;
      known as &quot;programming,&quot; or the developmental origins of adult diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the original work in this field focused on maternal undernutrition as a source of&#xD;
      stress for the developing baby, animal and human data suggest that exposure to a maternal&#xD;
      diet that is calorically &quot;sufficient&quot; but of low-quality foods, such as the consumption of&#xD;
      increasingly processed foods by Western societies, can result in similar in-utero programing&#xD;
      and predisposition to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in offspring. Especially&#xD;
      concerning about these findings is the implication that reversal of these effects will take&#xD;
      generations to realize. &quot;Transgenerational nutritional flow&quot; occurs because the eggs that&#xD;
      will be fertilized to form babies in women of child-bearing age today began development in&#xD;
      the ovaries of their mothers when their mothers were themselves in their grandmothers' womb.&#xD;
      Thus the grandmother not only provided for the health of her own eggs, which became the&#xD;
      mother, but also supplied the nutrients for the reproductive organs (including ovaries) in&#xD;
      the mother as she developed from fetus to baby, thereby influencing the programming of her&#xD;
      future grandchildren. Thus, we can now link the health status of the current citizens of&#xD;
      Oregon with generational nutritional flow over the past century. Fortunately, evidence shows&#xD;
      that improving the environment of mothers-to-be by lowering stress and providing access to&#xD;
      healthier foods can reverse many of the adverse effects that are programmed in early life,&#xD;
      though the full benefits of these efforts will take generations to realize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serious nature of these findings is evident by virtually any indicator of current&#xD;
      population health in America, which point to a dramatic worsening over the last two decades&#xD;
      with increasing rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes among adults and children, greater&#xD;
      numbers of people with uncontrolled hypertension, increasing hospitalization rate of for&#xD;
      heart failure, and ever decreasing birthweight. Recent studies predict further increases in&#xD;
      these chronic disease rates based on current indicators. Such disease rates will make health&#xD;
      care financially unsustainable. Worsening diets of mothers in recent decades has most&#xD;
      certainly contributed to the deteriorating health status of Oregonians, mandating that novel&#xD;
      innovations in dietary interventions are needed to bring wholesome nutrition to large&#xD;
      segments of the population.&#xD;
