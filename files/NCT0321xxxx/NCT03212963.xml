    <textblock>
      The objective of this open-label multicentric study is to determine the adrenal suppression&#xD;
      potential and the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of halobetasol lotion (HBP) applied twice&#xD;
      daily for up to two weeks in subjects aged 12 to 16 years 11 months with stable plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis. Subject enrollment will continue until at least 20 subjects with both screening&#xD;
      and end of study (EOS) serum cortisol data (pre- and pos-tcosyntropin stimulation) have&#xD;
      completed the study without any significant protocol violations (evaluable subjects). This&#xD;
      may require the enrollment of approximately 25 subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter study of an investigational formulation of HBP Lotion,&#xD;
      0.05% in male and female subjects aged 12 to 16 years 11 months with stable plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
      Approximately 25 subjects with stable plaque psoriasis on at least 10% of their BSA&#xD;
      (excluding the face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas), who fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled at multiple study sites. All subjects will have&#xD;
      a screening CST to assess their HPA axis response at Visit 1 (Screening Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into the treatment phase of the study should be timed such that the screening CST&#xD;
      will be performed a minimum of 20 days before Baseline Visit. At Visit 2 (Baseline), eligible&#xD;
      subjects with normal adrenal function will be eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will apply HBP Lotion, 0.05% to all psoriasis plaques identified at Visit 2 twice&#xD;
      daily (approximately every 12 hours) for the assigned treatment period or until the&#xD;
      investigator verifies the subject's psoriasis has cleared. The study is designed to determine&#xD;
      the adrenal suppression potential and pharmacokinetic properties of the test article after&#xD;
      the subject applies a maximum of approximately 50 grams per week for up to a two week&#xD;
      treatment period. All subjects will have a CST to reassess their HPA axis response at EOS (or&#xD;
      earlier if the investigator verifies the subject's psoriasis has cleared). In this study, an&#xD;
      abnormal Hypothalamujs Pituitary Adrenal axis response to 0.25 milligram dose of cosyntropin&#xD;
      is defined as a post-CST serum total cortisol level of less than equal to18 μg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will have blood drawn at Screening for baseline drug concentration in&#xD;
      plasma. On Day 8, all subjects, regardless of lesion clearance, will have blood drawn for&#xD;
      assessment of trough drug concentration in plasma. At the Day 15 visit, subjects who have&#xD;
      continued to treat lesions will have a final PK blood sample collected approximately 12 hours&#xD;
      after their Day 14 evening application and just prior to the initiation of the CST.&#xD;
