  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is a single center preliminary prospective cohort trial that evaluates patients&#xD;
      with hyperkyphosis. Participants will receive physical therapy exercises and be followed for&#xD;
      the above outcome measures over time. The treatment arm will receive training in one-time&#xD;
      training in kyphosis-specific exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participants receive physical therapy exercises will demonstrate&#xD;
      improved outcome measures over time. Also, it is hypothesized that participants who receive&#xD;
      kyphosis-specific exercises will demonstrate significantly improved perceived quality-of-life&#xD;
      and significantly reduced pain, compared to participants who receive generalized back&#xD;
      exercises after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, it is hypothesized that a kyphosis-specific SAQ will demonstrate satisfactory&#xD;
      test-retest reliability and concurrent validity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 50 patients will be recruited for this study. 28 patients will be recruited for&#xD;
      both groups, or 14 participants per group. Patients will be randomized by an independent&#xD;
      research assistant who will draw the group number from a hat. We assume less than 15%&#xD;
      attrition, which results in 12 participants per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will ideally be followed after 6 months, unless the patient's&#xD;
      treating orthopaedic surgeon schedules them for a visit up until 12 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1(Kyphosis-specific exercise Group): Patients will receive a one-time treatment&#xD;
      consisting of kyphosis-specific exercises that promote depressing the thoracic convexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (Generalized exercise group): Patients will receive a one-time treatment consisting&#xD;
      of core strengthening, hamstring stretching, and generalized back extension exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in each group will be asked to perform these exercises at home about 10 minutes a&#xD;
      day, 3 times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be given access to a software application though PT PAL on their smart&#xD;
      phone (or computer). Patients will be asked to use the app whenever they perform their&#xD;
      exercises throughout the 6 month period. Patients must turn off the app after 15 minutes for&#xD;
      the app to count the exercise session as complete. Each physical therapist participating in&#xD;
      the study will have administrator access to monitor exercise adherence for their respective&#xD;
      patients at any time as a tool to maximize exercise adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will also be asked about their pain intensity on a monthly basis through a&#xD;
      secure database (REDCap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Study Procedures: Group 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 0 (40 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray of back [standard of care]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Picture of back [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical therapy program [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two surveys on how kyphosis affects the patient [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2 (10 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two surveys at home on how kyphosis affects the patient [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Months 1-5 (2 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Monthly survey at home regarding your back pain [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 6-12 (40 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray of back [standard of care]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Picture of back [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two surveys on how kyphosis affects the patient [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination [research]&#xD;
&#xD;
      These x-rays will not need to be ordered as a study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5a. Sub-Study: Aim 2 Kyphosis-Specific SAQ (K-SAQ) The secondary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the psychometric properties of a kyphosis-specific SAQ and evaluate the test-retest&#xD;
      reliability and concurrent validity of this kyphosis-specific SAQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original study design included enrolling a total of 28 patients, all of whom would&#xD;
      receive and complete the SRS-22 and the kyphosis-specific SAQ at baseline, two weeks, and&#xD;
      6-12 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of initial enrollment, 21 patients had been enrolled and six (6) were lost&#xD;
      to follow-up. Of the 21 total patients, 15 completed Aim 1 of this study, not all of which&#xD;
      completed Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During analysis, we found statistical significance for the test-retest reliability and&#xD;
      concurrent validity of the K-SAQ, but due to weak enrollment and completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and two weeks, we are enrolling more patients for Aim 2 of the&#xD;
      original study design and will end enrollment for Aim 2 at the conclusion of 25 completed&#xD;
      responses of the K-SAQ and SRS-22 for both baseline and 2-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will increase enrollment from 28 patients to 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this sub-group must be diagnosed with hyperkyphosis, have a Cobb angle of at&#xD;
      least 50°, and be 8-21 years old. Exclusion criteria includes: scoliosis greater than 25°,&#xD;
      current brace wear, and previous spine surgery. Specific treatment is not a part of this&#xD;
      sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the Kyphosis-specific SAQ Sub-group of the PPKS Registry (STU&#xD;
      032011-130) will be included within this sub-group for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects: Patients with a diagnosis of hyperkyphosis meeting the&#xD;
      following inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate: ages 10 to 18 years, Cobb&#xD;
      angles at least 50°, and pain &gt;2 on the VAS during the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded according to the following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      scoliosis greater than 25°, conditions preventing understanding and compliance with an&#xD;
      exercise schedule, current brace wear, previous spine surgery, inability to commit to at&#xD;
      least 15 minutes of exercises for 3 days a week, and pain &lt;2 on the VAS during the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Sources of Research Material: Baseline participant characteristics will include age, sex,&#xD;
      ethnicity, Risser sign, height, weight, BMI, curve magnitude of a lateral radiograph, and&#xD;
      location of the kyphosis apex. The lateral radiograph information will be obtained from&#xD;
      Synapse, a radiology information system at TSRH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise adherence will be recorded including the length of exercise sessions and total&#xD;
      duration of PT until the patient is discharged to a HEP. HEP adherence will be calculated as&#xD;
      the percentage of prescribed exercises completed from baseline to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process: Patients will be screened by the&#xD;
      investigators, participating physical therapists, or research coordinator to determine&#xD;
      whether inclusion criteria is met. If the patient is eligible for this trial, the patient&#xD;
      will be offered enrollment to the patient and caregiver. Appropriate patient assent and&#xD;
      caregiver consent to participate in the trial will be obtained per IRB protocol. The patient&#xD;
      will then choose to be in either the treatment or observation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Potential Risks: Identifiable risk associated with participation in this study would be a&#xD;
      potential loss of confidentiality and tired or sore muscles from the exercises.&#xD;
