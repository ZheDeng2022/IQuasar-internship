      Can a type 1 diabetic adult avoid low glucoses and regain hypoglycemia awareness using a&#xD;
      hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system? Involvement is 22 months (13 visits) and includes&#xD;
      a 4-week Screening Phase and an 18-month Intervention Phase. Participants will undergo 3&#xD;
      Hyperinsulinemic Clamps done at: Baseline (before starting the device and after completing&#xD;
      the screening), 6 months (after using the device 6 months), and after using the device for 18&#xD;
      months. This metabolic testing will allow us to measure improvement in hypoglycemia&#xD;
      awareness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this small, proof-of-concept, mechanistic study is to determine whether hybrid&#xD;
      closed-loop insulin delivery can achieve sufficient hypoglycemia avoidance in patients with&#xD;
      long standing type 1 diabetes experiencing hypoglycemia and symptom unawareness despite&#xD;
      receiving intensive insulin therapy standard-of-care to improve glucose counterregulation&#xD;
      against insulin-induced hypoglycemia. As it remains critically important to understand the&#xD;
      potential physiologic benefits of hypoglycemia avoidance by means of a hybrid closed-loop&#xD;
      system in this population, studying each well characterized subject as his/her own control by&#xD;
      a within subject design should serve the study purpose, and has been the standard approach to&#xD;
      assessing the effects of various approaches to hypoglycemia avoidance in patients with&#xD;
      unawareness. The data generated will be available to power future randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      to determine the comparative efficacy of emerging artificial pancreas and Î²-cell replacement&#xD;
      approaches to achieve target glycemic control with amelioration of problematic hypoglycemia&#xD;
      in type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase At the screening visit, the study details and procedures will be discussed&#xD;
      with a research coordinator and at least one of the PI or the research nurse practitioner.&#xD;
      The potential participant is given adequate time to ask questions and review the informed&#xD;
      consent document. Once satisfied that all questions have been answered, the potential&#xD;
      participant will either decline to participate or sign the informed consent document. This&#xD;
      may occur at a subsequent visit if the potential participant desires, in order to think&#xD;
      further about what participation means and/or to consult with family, friends and/or a&#xD;
      personal physician. The consent form is signed in the presence of a witness (research&#xD;
      coordinator +/- family member). All participants must read, sign, and date a consent form&#xD;
      before entering the study, undergoing physical examination or undergoing any testing. The&#xD;
      informed consent form will be revised whenever important new safety information is available,&#xD;
      whenever the protocol is amended, and/or whenever any new information becomes available that&#xD;
      may affect participation in the studies.Eligibility will be confirmed through the performance&#xD;
      of a history and physical examination by the PI or the research nurse practitioner, EKG,&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test (if applicable), serum chemistries, TSH, cell counts, HbA1c and&#xD;
      C-peptide, completion of glycemic lability and hypoglycemia awareness and hypoglycemia&#xD;
      severity questionnaires, placement of a 7 day blinded CGM (iPro 2, Medtronic Diabetes,&#xD;
      Northridge, CA) unless on CGM available for downloading, and 7 day accelerometry (WGT3X-BT,&#xD;
      Actigraph LLC,) to define the nocturnal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only after all eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion) are met, will a potential&#xD;
      subject be enrolled. Repeated clinical testing throughout the study will ensure the continued&#xD;
      safety and minimization of risk for the enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Phase Eligible subjects will complete a baseline assessment of glucose&#xD;
      counterregulation by stepped- hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp prior to starting&#xD;
      intervention with the hybrid closed-loop system (MiniMed 670G system, Medtronic Diabetes,&#xD;
      Northridge, CA). Unless this system becomes available to the subject via their insurance&#xD;
      carrier, one will be provided for them. Subjects will also receive a study glucometer&#xD;
      (Contour Next Link 2.4, Bayer, Indianapolis, IN) that communicates with the MiniMed 670G&#xD;
      insulin pump for bolus dosing calculation and glucose sensor calibration. Subjects who cannot&#xD;
      maintain &gt; 80% (or 6/7 day) compliance with the sensor component as assessed at each study&#xD;
      visit may be dropped since less compliance has not been associated with any benefit of CGM to&#xD;
      glycemic control and limits the potential for benefit from LGS on hypoglycemia avoidance.&#xD;
      Accuracy of the sensor will be assessed at each visit through devise download and&#xD;
      interpretation. Study visits will occur weekly for the first month, then monthly until month&#xD;
      6, and then every 3 months until month 18. This schedule will allow for determination of&#xD;
      possible benefit from hybrid closed- loop insulin delivery on glucose counterregulation after&#xD;
      6 months of intensive provider support, and then for assessment of the durability or&#xD;
      potential further gains in beneficial effects after another 12 months of more typical&#xD;
      provider interaction occurring every 3 months. Weekly visits may be performed via telephone&#xD;
      with uploading devise data to Care Link for review and interpretation. Uploaded or downloaded&#xD;
      insulin delivery, blood and sensor glucose monitoring, insulin dose settings and CGM&#xD;
      calibration accuracy, alert settings, time spent in auto and manual modes, and LGS threshold&#xD;
      and activity will be assessed at each visit, targeting &gt; 80% CGM and LGS compliance,&#xD;
      adjusting basal and bolus insulin dosing in order to minimize glycemic excursions while&#xD;
      maximizing hypoglycemia (&lt; 60 mg/dl) avoidance, with adjustment of alarms set to alert the&#xD;
      subject to rapidly increasing or decreasing glucose and predict the occurrence of elevated or&#xD;
      low blood glucose. During manual mode, target glucose ranges will be 90 - 140 mg/dl before&#xD;
      meals, &lt; 180 mg/dl after meals, and 120 - 160 mg/dl at bedtime, with correction dosing to no&#xD;
      lower than 100 mg/dl during the day, and 120 mg/dl overnight. Alarm settings may be&#xD;
      individualized to target these ranges, but the hypoglycemia alarm for LGS will not be set&#xD;
      lower than 70 mg/dl. During auto mode, the automated interprandial basal insulin delivery&#xD;
      will adjust according to the closed-loop algorithm to target a sensor glucose of 120 mg/dl,&#xD;
      which may be temporality increased to 150 mg/dl if needed to further minimize exposure to&#xD;
      hypoglycemia during exercise or overnight. Prior to each 3 monthly visit, subjects will wear&#xD;
      an actigraph monitor ( WGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC,) for three weeks in order to define the&#xD;
      nocturnal period. Every 6 months measures of hypoglycemia awareness (Clarke score) and&#xD;
      severity (HYPO score), and the glycemic lability index (LI) will be calculated from&#xD;
      questionnaires, event diaries, and device downloads, respectively. At 6 months and at 18&#xD;
      months, subjects will again undergo assessment of glucose counterregulation by&#xD;
      stepped-hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp testing.&#xD;
