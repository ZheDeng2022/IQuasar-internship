  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been recently reported that EATL type 1, but not refractory coeliac disease, strongly&#xD;
      expressed CD30 and might benefit from brentuximab vedotin. Since the safety profile of the&#xD;
      combination brentuximab vedotin and CHP is known and since the role of etoposide as part of&#xD;
      induction regimen is not demonstrated, the investigator will assess the efficacy and toxicity&#xD;
      of the combination brentuximab vedotin and CHP followed by HDT/ASCT, as frontline treatment&#xD;
      of EATL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brentuximab vedotin is an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic drug&#xD;
      monomethyl auristatin E. It is currently evaluated in combination with multi-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy as frontline treatment of systemic ALCL (sALCL) and other CD30-positive mature T&#xD;
      cell and NK cell lymphomas. Preliminary results of this phase 1 study have been presented at&#xD;
      the 2012 ASH Annual Meeting: 26 patients have been treated with combination brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin and CHP. Nineteen of 26 patients had a diagnosis of sALCL and 7 patients had a&#xD;
      diagnosis of another mature Tor NK-cell lymphoma (EATL, n=1). The maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP was not exceeded at 1.8 mg/kg IV. Adverse events&#xD;
      were manageable. All patients achieved an objective response, with 23 patients (88%)&#xD;
      achieving a complete response (CR). All 7 non-sALCL patients achieved a CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it has been recently reported that EATL type 1, but not refractory coeliac disease,&#xD;
      strongly expressed CD30 and might benefit from brentuximab vedotin. Since the safety profile&#xD;
      of the combination brentuximab vedotin and CHP is known and since the role of etoposide as&#xD;
      part of induction regimen is not demonstrated, the investigator will assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity of the combination brentuximab vedotin and CHP followed by HDT/ASCT, as frontline&#xD;
      treatment of EATL.&#xD;
