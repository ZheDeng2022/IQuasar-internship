  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single centre exploratory study to analyse brain exposure of AZD1390&#xD;
      in healthy volunteer males.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 12 healthy male volunteers, 20 to 65 years of age will participate in the study. The&#xD;
      study population chosen is sufficient to examine variability in pharmacokinetic and imaging&#xD;
      measurements. All male volunteer subjects will have a baseline brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) for eligibility and anatomical delineation of brain regions to be applied in&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) image analysis. An arterial line will be inserted on day&#xD;
      the healthy volunteer arrives for the administration of study drug and PET imaging (Day 1).&#xD;
      The arterial line will be placed in the opposite arm than the one being used to administer&#xD;
      the single intravenous microdose of [11C]AZD1390. Blood samples will be collected after the&#xD;
      administration of microdose [11C]AZD1390 bolus injection and during the PET imaging&#xD;
      procedure. The arterial line will be removed at the conclusion of the PET imaging study after&#xD;
      the last blood sample has been collected. Standard institutional procedures will be followed&#xD;
      for arterial line removal. The study will conclude with a telephone follow-up call within 7&#xD;
      business days after the PET measurement.&#xD;

             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy Male subjects, aged 20 to 65 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject should be healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             laboratory parameters, ECG and brain MRI performed before administration of the&#xD;
             investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject should have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 and must weigh&#xD;
             at least 50.0 kg and no more than 100.0 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;

             spermicide (refer to Section 4.3); and refrain from donating sperm during the study&#xD;
             and for 3 months plus 5 half-lives after the last administered radiolabelled infusion&#xD;
             of [11C]AZD1390.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject should be willing and able to participate in all scheduled evaluations, abide&#xD;
