    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, case-control study where neurocognitive function will be&#xD;
      evaluated in 36 patients with Cushing syndrome (CS) and 36 controls matched for age, gender&#xD;
      and education.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) is the collective name for several rare disorders of&#xD;
           chronic glucocorticoid (GC) excess. The most common causes are ACTH producing pituitary&#xD;
           adenoma [Cushing's disease (CD)], cortisol producing adrenal adenoma (CPAA) and ectopic&#xD;
           ACTH producing tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric disorders, fatigue, and impaired quality of life&#xD;
           (QoL) are frequently observed in patients with active CS. Morphological changes in the&#xD;
           central nervous system have also been reported in patients with CS, including decreased&#xD;
           total brain volume and hippocampal formation volume compared with healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After successful treatment of CS, cognitive function improves according to some studies&#xD;
           while others have found no change from pre-treatment levels. Increased brain volume has&#xD;
           also been reported following treatment, although not to the levels of a normal control&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Various aspects of the neurocognitive consequences of hypercortisolism have been studied&#xD;
           in recent years. However, a major limitation of most previous studies is the small&#xD;
           sample size. Longitudinal research data is sparse. A further limitation is that CS is a&#xD;
           heterogeneous disease with several etiologies, varied clinical findings at presentation&#xD;
           and varying outcome after treatment. Consequently, and since CS is a rare syndrome, the&#xD;
           number of patients needed to be studied is too large for a single center. A&#xD;
           collaborative multi-centre effort is therefore a desirable approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
           The overall aims of this project are 1) to improve our understanding of CS, in&#xD;
           particular the spectra and time course of impaired well-being, fatigue and cognition, 2)&#xD;
           to study the mechanisms behind the apparently long-term negative consequences on the CNS&#xD;
           in these domains after biochemical remission has been achieved. For this purpose, the&#xD;
           investigators will use the following tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Structural MRI. To evaluate total brain volume and volume of structures important&#xD;
                for cognitive function such as hippocampus and frontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). To evaluate structural connectivity and integrity&#xD;
                of white matter&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resting state and task related functional MRI (fMRI). To evaluate brain functional&#xD;
                connectivity during rest and during testing of cognitive and emotional functioning.&#xD;
                Primary regions of interests are the hippocampus, the frontal cortex and other key&#xD;
                regions of the limbic circuitry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fludeoxyglucose Positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). To study glucose&#xD;
                utilization in the above mentioned brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CSF analysis. To understand the significance of inflammatory and neurodegenerative&#xD;
                biomarkers in CSF and blood in patients with CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Genetic and epigenetic analysis. To evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in the&#xD;
                GC receptor gene, and genes involved in metabolism and transport of GCs, on&#xD;
                cognitive and emotional functioning in patients with CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective, case-controlled study, conducted at three centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Department of Endocrinology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg,&#xD;
                Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Department of Endocrinology/Medicine, Hospital Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, and Leiden Institute for&#xD;
                Brain and Cognition/Department of Psychiatry, Leiden University Medical Center,&#xD;
                Leiden, The Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients and matched controls will be recruited at each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will be studied prior to medical and surgical treatment (baseline visit 0)&#xD;
           and 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgical treatment. The controls will be studied&#xD;
           on two occasions, namely at baseline and after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects Thirty-six patients with newly diagnosed endogenous CS and 36 matched controls&#xD;
           will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since CS is a rare disorder the investigators estimate that it will take 3 years to&#xD;
           include 36 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study investigators at each individual centre will identify patients with newly&#xD;
           diagnosed CS. Inclusion will take place before any intervention, including medical&#xD;
           treatment for hypercortisolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaires will be completed by patients at the individual centres in the morning&#xD;
           9-12 am, prior to treatment and 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. Controls will&#xD;
           complete the questionnaires at baseline and after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The fatigue impact scale (FIS) will be used to evaluate fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The EuroQol and CushingQoL will be used to evaluate quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory will be used to evaluate&#xD;
                depression and anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The apathy scale will be used to evaluate apathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Rey Complex Figure will be used to test memory. Digit symbol-coding from the WAIS-IV&#xD;
           NI will be used to assess information processing speed. Auditory attention and working&#xD;
           memory will be measured by the digit span test. The verbal fluency test (FAS) will be&#xD;
           used to measure the ability to generate as many words as possible beginning with a&#xD;
           specific letter within 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Structural MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will undergo cranial magnetic resonance imaging before treatment as well as 12&#xD;
           and 24 months after surgery. Control subjects will be scanned twice with an interval of&#xD;
           approximately 12 months. In line with previous MRI studies in patient populations, total&#xD;
           time for participants in the scanner will be one hour or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.5 Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will also acquire DTI data along 32 directions, enabling analyses of&#xD;
           integrity as well as fibre tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.6 Functional MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
           Functional MRI will be used to study resting state functional connectivity as well as&#xD;
           brain activity during cognitive and emotional function prior to treatment, and 12 and 24&#xD;
           months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.7 Positron emission tomography&#xD;
&#xD;
           Resting state glucose utilization in the brain will be studied by using fludeoxyglucose&#xD;
           positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) prior to treatment and 12 months after treatment&#xD;
           (only in patients from Gothenburg). Controls will be studied with FDG-PET only at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.8 Neurodegenerative and inflammatory biomarkers in CSF and blood&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory CSF markers, as well as peptides and hormones&#xD;
           important for GC metabolism, will be analysed prior to treatment and 12 months after&#xD;
           treatment (only in Gothenburg). Controls will be studied only at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.9 Genetics&#xD;
&#xD;
           Polymorphism in the GC receptor gene, and other genes involved in metabolism and&#xD;
           transport of GCs will be analysed in all subjects at inclusion in the study. All genetic&#xD;
           analysis will be performed at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, in a&#xD;
           single run at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples for DNA and RNA will be collected at baseline and 24 months after&#xD;
           treatment for analysis of methylation and mRNA expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Application for&#xD;
           Ethical approval will be applied from the local ethical committees in Barcelona,&#xD;
           Gothenburg and Leiden. Informed written consent will be obtained from all patients and&#xD;
           controls. Incidental findings of clinical significance will be investigated further by&#xD;
           the respective participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical methods - Power calculations A power analysis based on previous results from&#xD;
           studies on cognitive function as well as fMRI findings in patients with Cushing syndrome&#xD;
           suggests that between 14 and 28 subjects need to be included in the study to detect a&#xD;
           difference between patients with CS in remission and controls with a significance level&#xD;
           of 5% and power of 80%. Because multiple comparisons will be applied, comparing brain&#xD;
           activity between different groups on three performance tasks as well as a resting state&#xD;
           condition, 36 participants per group will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
