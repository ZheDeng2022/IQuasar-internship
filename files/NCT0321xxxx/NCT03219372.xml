  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a major health concern in the United States, particularly&#xD;
      among people with liver cirrhosis. Out of every 100 patients with liver cancer, only 18 will&#xD;
      survive 5 years or more. While locoregional therapies are utilized in an effort to combat&#xD;
      this disease, the recurrence rate of HCC after these therapies are high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are widely used drugs that lower cholesterol levels. Some studies have suggested that&#xD;
      statins lower risk of HCC recurrence, but this possibility has not been studied thoroughly in&#xD;
      a clinical trial. This study will examine the effects of pravastatin, a type of statin, on&#xD;
      time to HCC recurrence in patients with early stage HCC. It is possible that pravastatin in&#xD;
      combination with locoregional therapies may delay or protect against HCC recurrence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, there has been a scarcity of clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      adjuvant therapies in patients with early stage HCC, although it is widely considered an area&#xD;
      of highly unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase II trial is to&#xD;
      examine the effects of pravastatin use versus placebo after 12 months of treatment on&#xD;
      hepatocellular cancer (HCC) recurrence in 130 patients with liver cirrhosis, HCC meeting&#xD;
      Milan Criteria or OPTN tumor downstaging criteria for tumor burden, and initial locoregional&#xD;
      therapy (LRT) with adequate response.&#xD;

             clinical signs, symptoms, body imaging, or liver biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of HCC falling within one of the following criteria prior to LRT. Criteria&#xD;
             fulfillment will be confirmed by the Imaging Charter and MedQIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. One lesion ≤ 5 cm or two to three lesions, each ≤ 3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. One lesion &gt; 5 cm and ≤ 8 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Two or three lesions, of which at least one is &gt; 3 cm and all are ≤ 5 cm each.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Four or five lesions, each &lt; 3 cm. The sum of all diameters must be ≤ 8 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiation of LRT (according to clinical judgement) within 24 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening Visit, with adequate response as determined by Imaging Charter and MedQIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥70%; see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT) &amp; ALT (SGPT) ≤5 × institutional ULN&#xD;

             and medical release&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; for&#xD;
             women who are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with trial protocol and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of statin medication or statin use within 12 months of Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current systemic use of medications known to interact with statins and potentially&#xD;
             increase toxicity, including (e.g., gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, clarithromycin,&#xD;
             colchicine, niacin and fibrates).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of adverse effects, intolerance, or allergic reactions attributed to compounds&#xD;
             of similar chemical or biologic composition to pravastatin (i.e., other statin&#xD;
             medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any other investigational agents&#xD;

             human milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into&#xD;
             breast milk. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pravastatin, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pravastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Active malignancy within the past 5 years (excluding HCC, basal/squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, or prostate cancer with a Gleason score 6 or less)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemophilia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent illness which in the opinion of the investigators would compromise either&#xD;
             the patient or the integrity of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
