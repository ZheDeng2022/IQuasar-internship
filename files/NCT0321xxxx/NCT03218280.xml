  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill polytrauma patients have a number of physiological disorders secondary to&#xD;
      trauma, such as systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), adult respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS), sepsis, oxidative stress (OS), and finally the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome&#xD;
      (MODS). Another important aspect in terms of clinical outcome is the energy-metabolic status.&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown that implementing antioxidant therapy, capable of reducing the&#xD;
      expression of pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory and energetic-metabolic status, the mortality&#xD;
      rate in critical patients decreases statistically significant. In this research paper, will&#xD;
      be implemented a multimodal monitoring protocol that covers the use of biochemical, genetics&#xD;
      and epigenetics biomarkers and the use of non-invasive medical devices to assess and monitor&#xD;
      critical polytrauma patient. Also will be optimized the antioxidant treatment plan according&#xD;
      to the needs of each patient.&#xD;

      1. Objectives The project aims the integration for the first time in Romania of modern&#xD;
           monitoring equipment for pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory status and the&#xD;
           energetic-metabolic necessary specific to the departments of anesthesia and intensive&#xD;
           care, the clinical and laboratory data, genetic / epigenetic analyzes and existing&#xD;
           information for the modulation and optimization of the intensive care for polytrauma&#xD;
           patients. This way, the prospect of developing a decision support module for doctors to&#xD;
           improve indices of mortality and morbidity in this area will be created. Reducing&#xD;
           mortality and increasing quality of care is possible by providing a modern and complex&#xD;
           monitoring system for critically ill polytrauma patient followed essentially by the&#xD;
           acquisition, interpretation and synthesis in time of these biological signals and&#xD;
           correlation with other clinical and laboratory data useful in modulating intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The general objectives are to develop new areas of research in accordance with the&#xD;
           trends of international research and with the economic and social romanian and european&#xD;
           requirements by creating a integrated, innovative protocol with the improvement in the&#xD;
           indices of mortality and morbidity in the intensive care of trauma patient through&#xD;
           multimodality monitoring procedures and modulating intensive care management&#xD;
           continuously in order to improve the public health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The specific objectives of the study are the integration of modern methods for&#xD;
           monitoring and optimizing therapeutic management depending on the individual patient&#xD;
           (individualized management of intensive care); calculating severity and risk scores,&#xD;
           both in the first 24 hours and continuously, providing medical decision support tools in&#xD;
           real time; developing in an ergonomic, dynamic and standardized for viewing local and&#xD;
           remote way the intensive care protocol modulated after modern techniques for&#xD;
           non-invasive monitoring and cost-effective in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Advantages of multimodal monitoring of pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory and&#xD;
           energetic-metabolic status through conventional laboratory analyzes, genetic /&#xD;
           epigenetic analyzes and indirect calorimetry is represented by the particularly low time&#xD;
           for obtaining the results, but also the pool of information brought on regarding the&#xD;
           clinical status of these patients. Moreover, secondary it is possible to implement an&#xD;
           intensive care that is modulated individually that reflects both on clinical outcome of&#xD;
           the patient and the costs. Not least by obtaining a genetic array of specific&#xD;
           pathophysiology's polymorphisms (SIRS, sepsis, ARDS, MODS) early and targeted therapies&#xD;
           can be implemented that can significantly reduce mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Impact The direct beneficiaries of the study are represented by physicians Department of&#xD;
           Anesthesia and Intensive Care County Hospital Emergency &quot;Pius Brinzeu&quot; Timisoara that&#xD;
           will have a very useful tool in clinical practice and research with direct impact on&#xD;
           patient outcomes (approx. 3000 patients / year). Also, the entire local medical and&#xD;
           scientific community: doctors, medical researchers and teachers. Through&#xD;
           interdisciplinary nature of the specialty of anesthesia and intensive care, direct&#xD;
           beneficiaries of research results in this area are represented by physicians from a wide&#xD;
           range of medical specialties: surgery, neurosurgery, cardiology, infectious diseases,&#xD;
           orthopedics and traumatology, clinical biology, genetics and so on. They will retrieve&#xD;
           new information brought by research, will implement and apply it themselves on a new&#xD;
           target groups of patients, thus expanding the distribution area of potential&#xD;
           beneficiaries. Lastly, the economic environment through technology transfer from&#xD;
           research results to other clinical and experimental centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The indirect beneficiaries are represented by patients who will benefit directly from&#xD;
           the implementation of the clinical trial results of research in anesthesia and intensive&#xD;
           care: patients from clinics in the country and possibly abroad. Local and regional&#xD;
           community - by improving the quality of medical services for the community, increased&#xD;
           quality of life and level of economic and social reintegration of former patients. Local&#xD;
           administration by savings from the local budget allocated to health with the&#xD;
           implementation of new techniques and thus through reducing hospitalization time in the&#xD;
           intensive care unit of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical analysis Statistical analyzes will be carried out with specially designed&#xD;
           computer equipment such as Prism 6 for Mac OSX v.6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San&#xD;
           Diego, CA) and Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Bucharest, Romania).&#xD;
           Statistical analysis of data recorded in the database will be to calculate frequencies&#xD;
           and percentages for quantitative variables. Also, for the quantitative variables, the&#xD;
           results will be expressed as the mean and standard deviation. Statistical comparisons&#xD;
           used for test environments will be calculated with the unpaired t-test and for&#xD;
           statistical comparisons used percentages using Chi square test. Statistical significance&#xD;
           will be defined at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
