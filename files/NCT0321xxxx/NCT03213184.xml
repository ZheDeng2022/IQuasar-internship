  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The environment during the prenatal period and in early life is a major contributor to the&#xD;
      risk of developing childhood asthma. Birth cohort studies from single research centers have&#xD;
      identified several factors that affect the risk for developing childhood asthma, including&#xD;
      being exposed in early life to allergens, pollutants, viruses and bacteria, and psychosocial&#xD;
      stress. Despite such advances, further progress in understanding the root causes of asthma&#xD;
      have been hampered by the small size of previous studies, which makes it difficult to: 1)&#xD;
      identify asthma risk factors with certainty, 2) know how environmental factors across the&#xD;
      United States (U.S.) affect asthma, and 3) whether there are critical ages when pregnant&#xD;
      mothers, infants and young children are particularly susceptible to these influences.&#xD;
      Furthermore, different research groups tend to use different methods to study asthma, making&#xD;
      it difficult to either compare or pool findings. One other challenge is that there are&#xD;
      several types (i.e. phenotypes, endotypes) of childhood asthma, but these are poorly&#xD;
      understood. To help overcome these challenges, investigators leading 12 asthma birth cohorts&#xD;
      across the U.S. have established the Children's Respiratory Research Workgroup (CREW)&#xD;
      consortium. CREW proposes to identify specific types of childhood asthma, develop an&#xD;
      understanding of what early life environmental influences cause these different types of&#xD;
      asthma and when, and identify targets for future efforts aimed at preventing childhood&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CREW is an NIH-funded project consisting of 12 individual U.S. birth cohorts and two&#xD;
      scientific centers working together to identify phenotypes and causes of childhood asthma.&#xD;
      CREW will include data from a large number of children (over 9,000 at birth, 6,000-7,000 who&#xD;
      are still being followed, and at least 5,667 expected to enroll in CREW) and their families,&#xD;
      with broad diversity in terms of ethnicity, family characteristics, neighborhoods and&#xD;
      geographic locations. One of the primary goals of CREW is to put together sets of data and&#xD;
      samples of participating cohorts to identify phenotypes of childhood asthma (i.e. specific&#xD;
      subtypes of asthma that can be distinguished by clinical features such as natural history,&#xD;
      triggers, exacerbation frequency, concurrent allergies, lung function, sex, etc). As we&#xD;
      obtain mechanistic insights about personal and early life risk factors, we will connect&#xD;
      asthma phenotypes with underlying causes and pathogenic mechanisms to define endotypes of&#xD;
      childhood asthma.&#xD;

        CREW consortium represent a diverse national sample of children and families recruited over&#xD;
        the past 30 years into 12 early life and birth cohort studies that focused on asthma. The&#xD;
        total combined study population is 8,985 at the time of birth. The study population is&#xD;
        quite diverse in terms of current age (ages &lt;1 through 36 years), date of recruitment&#xD;
        (1980-2017), race/ethnicity, and risk of asthma. There is considerable variation in the&#xD;
        geographic locations of participants, with representation from East Coast (Baltimore,&#xD;
        Boston, New York City), Midwest (Cincinnati, Detroit, Madison, Marshfield), South&#xD;
        (Nashville, St. Louis) and West (Tucson). Most children are healthy (control population)&#xD;
        while some have asthma or some form of allergic disease.&#xD;
