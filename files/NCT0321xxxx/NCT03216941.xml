    <textblock>
      comparison of intramuscular olanzapine and ketamine efficacy as first medication for fast&#xD;
      sedation of patients with agitation and aggressive behavior. Five hundred patients with&#xD;
      agitation caused by psychiatric disorder were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions&#xD;
      to receive olanzapine or ketiapine. The Overt Agitation Severity Scale, Overt Aggression&#xD;
      Scale and Ramsay Sedation Scale will be applied within 12 hours after the first dosage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      double-blind controlled trial to compare effectiveness of intramuscular olanzapine and&#xD;
      ketamine as first medication to fast sedation of patients with agitation caused by&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions. Randomization will be performed by permuted blocks allocation in&#xD;
      which ketiamine or olanzapine standard treatment will be assigned to blocks of five patients&#xD;
      and distributed in this order: olanzapine and ketiamine. This assignment will be repeated&#xD;
      until the total number of subjects (500) be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      agitation status will be operationalized using Overt Agitation Severity Scale Total Score&#xD;
      (OASS) equal or greater than 20 and Overt Aggressive Scale (OAS) with four or more positive&#xD;
      items. Full physical and neurological examination will be completed as soon as possible,&#xD;
      whenever patient is considered eligible for the study. Written Informed consent should be&#xD;
      provided before and after participating in this study, and should be reviewed and approved by&#xD;
      the institutional review board. Written consent obtained before admission to the emergency&#xD;
      ward by legal guardian and after 12 hours by the patient (whenever he or she is is able to&#xD;
      understand the information) or by the guardian. This study will comply with principles of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice and approved by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB) of Hospital Larcade of San Miguel County (Province of Buenos AIres (Project&#xD;
      msm001) inter-rater reproducibility will be evaluated by two raters which will repeatedly&#xD;
      apply OASS, OAS and RSS to patients admitted to the emergency room before the study until the&#xD;
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) reach a score of 0.80 or greater medications will be&#xD;
      packaged in identical color-coded boxes and dosage of of olanzapine and ketiamine will be&#xD;
      determined according to standard protocols and previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject needs another intervention will be removed from the study. subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed from 1 to 12 hours after administration of selected medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      psychiatrists will be masked to patient's treatment assignment, and patients will be&#xD;
      instructed not to reveal current treatment to investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      clinical safety of treatment will be assessed by notification and with an close-ended inquiry&#xD;
      into adverse events together with full physical examination and vital signs measurements.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses mean and standard deviation (SD) and comparisons of baseline demographic&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical variables and mixed-effect analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) with medication&#xD;
      (olanzapine, ketiamine) as between-groups factor and time (1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours&#xD;
      and 12 hours) as a within-group factor. OASS at time zero, OAS at time zero, and presence of&#xD;
      excessive sedation will be fixe covariates, and symptom ratings (OASS, OAS and RSS) will be&#xD;
      time-varying covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      differences between groups at each time point and variance with post-hoc Duncan's tests will&#xD;
      be calculated to compare mean OASS, OAS and RSS scores between groups.&#xD;
