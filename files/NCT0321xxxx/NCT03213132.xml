      This study will compare the efficacy of an interactive internet intervention for older adults&#xD;
      with insomnia called SHUTi OASIS (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet for Older Adult Sufferers&#xD;
      of Insomnia and Sleeplessness) accessed at www.shutioasis.org both with and without support&#xD;
      for adherence to that of a static educational website to improve sleep, health, mood, and&#xD;
      overall quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a significant public health problem for older adults with substantial medical,&#xD;
      psychological and financial ramifications. With as many as 20-30% of older adults (age ≥55)&#xD;
      meeting diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia, finding accessible, effective, and low-cost&#xD;
      treatments is critical. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention that has been shown to be efficacious when tailored for&#xD;
      older adults. Regrettably, access to this treatment is significantly limited by a lack of&#xD;
      trained clinicians and expense. To overcome barriers to face-to-face care, use of the&#xD;
      Internet has emerged as a feasible and effective method to provide health information and&#xD;
      treatment. Unfortunately, the health care field has been reluctant to use&#xD;
      technology-delivered solutions with older patients out of a concern that older adults either&#xD;
      do not have access to or do not want to use technology. However, older adults in the U.S. are&#xD;
      the largest growing group of Internet users, and they generally have a desire to learn new&#xD;
      technologies. When older adults do use technology-based programs for health promotion, they&#xD;
      rate these programs favorably. Internet-delivered CBT-I for older adults has a high&#xD;
      likelihood of major public health impact by allowing widespread access to a needed&#xD;
      intervention, increasing the convenience of obtaining care, and decreasing treatment costs&#xD;
      among an age group with high rates of insomnia known to exacerbate other concerns (health,&#xD;
      mood, cognition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SHUTi Program: SHUTi is a self-guided (i.e., automated), interactive, and tailored&#xD;
      web-based program modeled on the primary tenants of face-to-face CBT-I (sleep restriction,&#xD;
      stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, relapse prevention). Intervention&#xD;
      content is metered out over time through 6 &quot;Cores.&quot; Users obtain access to a new Core based&#xD;
      on a time and event-based schedule (e.g., 7 days after completion of previous Core). This&#xD;
      schedule is consistent with the recommendation from a task force commissioned by the Academy&#xD;
      of Sleep Medicine, which deemed that an average of 6 - 8 sessions constitutes &quot;adequate&#xD;
      treatment exposure&quot;. The SHUTi program relies on user-entered online Sleep Diaries to track&#xD;
      progress and to tailor treatment recommendations (i.e., assign a &quot;sleep restriction&quot; window).&#xD;
      Each Core acts as an online analog for the weekly sessions typically used when delivering&#xD;
      CBT-I in a face-to-face format, following the same general structure: 1) Core objectives&#xD;
      (what will be learned and why this information is important), 2) review of previous week's&#xD;
      homework and sleep diary data, 3) new intervention material, 4) assignment of homework&#xD;
      (treatment strategies for the coming week), and 5) a summary of the Core's main points.&#xD;
      Intervention content is enhanced through a variety of interactive features, including&#xD;
      personalized goal-setting, graphical feedback based on inputted symptoms, animations /&#xD;
      illustrations to enhance comprehension, quizzes to test user knowledge, patient vignettes,&#xD;
      and video-based expert explanation. Automated emails are also sent to encourage program&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned for a period of 9 weeks to one of three&#xD;
      conditions: (1) the online CBT-i intervention optimized for older adults (SHUTi), (2) the&#xD;
      online CBT-i intervention optimized for older adults (SHUTi) with additional adherence and&#xD;
      technical support provided (stepped care), or (3) the patient education website. All&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires and two weeks of daily sleep diaries about their&#xD;
      symptoms at four time points - at the beginning of the study (baseline), immediately after&#xD;
      completing the 9 week intervention (post), and at 6 and 12 months later.&#xD;
