  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how to increase postpartum weight loss and how to&#xD;
      decrease risk factors for postpartum women at increased risk for diabetes and heart disease.&#xD;
      The program is delivered using a mobile application (app) and a lifestyle coach. This mobile&#xD;
      application is developed for women who are at higher risk for diabetes and heart disease.&#xD;
      Women who have gestational diabetes, (diabetes during pregnancy, or GDM), gestational&#xD;
      hypertension (high blood pressure), and/or preeclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in&#xD;
      the urine), and/or small-for gestational-age, and/or preterm (early) delivery during their&#xD;
      pregnancies have a higher risk for diabetes and heart disease. This mobile application was&#xD;
      developed using the latest research studies and using the evidence-based Diabetes Prevention&#xD;
      and Colorado Weigh programs. The goal of the program is to help women lose weight and&#xD;
      participate in physical activity after delivery.&#xD;
