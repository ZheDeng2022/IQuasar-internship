  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double (physician and patient) blinded randomized controlled clinical trial in&#xD;
      which patients who have undergone bilateral direct brow ptosis repair undergo a trial in&#xD;
      which one of brow is injected with placebo 0.9% Normal Saline and the contra-lateral brow is&#xD;
      injected with 0.3-0.6 mL over the entire brow of 50mg/mL 5-Fluorouracil sub-dermal&#xD;
      injections. The researchers aim to investigate whether injecting 5-Fluorouracil preemptively&#xD;
      will not only accelerate wound healing and decrease hypertrophic scar formation compared to&#xD;
      placebo, but also improve overall scar appearance in a safe manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blinded (physician and patient) randomized controlled clinical trial, the&#xD;
      patient's left and right brows are randomized to either the placebo or treatment arm of the&#xD;
      study and maintain this designation for the entirety of the study. This randomization is&#xD;
      performed and recorded by the study nurse in the physician's office. This study nurse also&#xD;
      will be responsible for preparing the placebo 0.9% Normal Saline (0.9%NS) and the 50mg/mL&#xD;
      5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Both placebo and 5-FU are placed into identical syringes with 30 gauge&#xD;
      needles, both materials are identical in color and clarity, making it impossible for&#xD;
      physician or patient to correctly identify which injection is which without a label. Only the&#xD;
      study nurse will be aware of which injection is which, and the nurse will ensure that the&#xD;
      correct injection is placed into the correct brow at each visit via the study log that the&#xD;
      nurse maintains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient who has undergone bilateral direct brow ptosis repair who has agreed to participate&#xD;
      in the study will first return for the post-operative day 10 visit where sutures are removed&#xD;
      from the brow incisions. The patient returns on post-operative week three for their first&#xD;
      injections, the details of which are below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on post-operative week three, the patient will receive 0.05mL aliquots of each&#xD;
      injection (0.9%NS and 5-FU) sub-dermally into the brow incision spread out evenly over the&#xD;
      brow, totaling 0.3-0.6 mL of each injection over each respective brow. Photos of the&#xD;
      patient's brows will be taken, and then both the physician and patient will fill out a survey&#xD;
      recording their impressions, the contents of which are listed in subsequent sections of this&#xD;
      protocol. This same procedure will be repeated every three weeks for a total of up to four&#xD;
      rounds of injections, thus the final round of injections will be given on post-operative week&#xD;
      twelve. At each of these post-operative visits, incidence of any side effects is recorded,&#xD;
      and if an unacceptably high rate of side effects occurs, the study will be precociously&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At post-operative week fifteen, the blind is broken, and again photos are taken and physician&#xD;
      and patient impressions are recorded via survey. After the blind is broken, if desired, the&#xD;
      patient can opt to undergo a similar series of injections on the placebo arm of 5-FU.&#xD;
