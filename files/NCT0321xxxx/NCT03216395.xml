  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the management of patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding from non-variceal&#xD;
      causes, endoscopic treatment and acid suppression are now the standard of care. Current&#xD;
      endoscopic treatment in the form of either thermo-coagulation or clipping to the bleeding&#xD;
      arteries is highly efficacious in the stopping bleeding. Unfortunately in 5 to 10% of&#xD;
      patients, bleeding cannot be controlled during index endoscopy or recurs after initial&#xD;
      hemostasis. These patients are often elderly with significant co-morbidities. Their bleeding&#xD;
      lesions are large eroding into major sub-serosal arteries. In the few who need surgical&#xD;
      salvage, mortality increases to around 30%. The Over-the-scope-Clip (OTSC) is a device, which&#xD;
      allows endoscopists to capture a large amount of tissue and compress on the bleeding artery.&#xD;
      The OTSC also has a high retention rate. Recurrent bleeding with the use of standard&#xD;
      hemo-clips can occur because of their low retention rate. We reported the use of OTSC with a&#xD;
      high success rate in a case series of patients with refractory bleeding after standard&#xD;
      endoscopic treatment. We have also used OTSC in the treatment of bleeding from&#xD;
      pseudo-aneurysm arising from large eroded arteries in ulcer base. A multicenter randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that compares OTSC to standard endoscopic treatment in the endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment of refractory bleeding lesions has just been completed. The use of OTSC has been&#xD;
      shown to be superior in achieving hemostatic control and reducing further bleeding. In this&#xD;
      proposed randomized controlled trial, we would test the hypothesis that the use of OTSC, when&#xD;
      used as the first or primary treatment, is superior to standard treatment in achieving&#xD;
      hemostasis and thereby improve patients' outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic therapy has improved outcomes to patients with acute non-variceal upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding. Acid suppression therapy as an adjunct to endoscopic therapy&#xD;
      further reduces recurrent bleeding and interventions. There remains a small subgroup of&#xD;
      patients who continue to bleed or re-bleed after initial endoscopic hemostasis. These&#xD;
      patients are often elderly with significant comorbid illnesses. In the 2007 National United&#xD;
      Kingdom Audit, mortality was 30% in those after salvage surgery for refractory bleeding [1].&#xD;
      The current standard in endoscopic treatment is the use of either hemo-clips or thermal&#xD;
      coagulation with or without pre-injection with diluted adrenaline. The two modalities are&#xD;
      similar in their efficacies [2]. Their use is associated with a small but significant failure&#xD;
      rate. Anatomically, the failed cases are usually larger deep ulcers with erosion into thick&#xD;
      subserosal arteries [3]. In an ex vivo model, control of bleeding becomes inconsistent in&#xD;
      arteries &gt; 2mm in diameter in size with 3.2 mm contact thermal devices [4]. The investigators&#xD;
      have few reports on in vivo data. Using thin barium angiography in 27 gastrectomy specimens&#xD;
      from patients who underwent surgery for control of bleeding from their gastric ulcers, Swain&#xD;
      and colleagues found vessels of varying sizes and disposition [5]. It was felt that artery&#xD;
      beyond 1 mm would be difficult to control during endoscopy in a clinical setting. In a series&#xD;
      of fatal deaths from bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers from Hong Kong [6], these arteries were&#xD;
      around 3 mm in diameter at post-mortem examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over-the-scope clips or the Bear Claws were developed for the purpose of closure of GI&#xD;
      luminal defects created at Natural orifice trans-luminal surgery. In clinical practice, OTSC&#xD;
      are widely used for closure of GI perforations and anastomotic dehiscence. There have been&#xD;
      anecdotal reports over the use of OTSC in the control of refractory bleeding from peptic&#xD;
      ulcers [7, 8]. The investigators reported our experience in 9 such patients with successful&#xD;
      hemostasis in all of them [9]. Further bleeding occurred in 2 patients. The investigators&#xD;
      subsequently illustrated its use in difficult ulcers that failed standard endoscopic&#xD;
      treatments; one of them showed a pseudo-aneurysm to a branch of the gastro-duodenal artery&#xD;
      [10]. In our hospital, indication for OTSC use has been failure with conventional endoscopic&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OTSC have several advantages over existing treatments. First, tissue compression on the&#xD;
      bleeding artery is critical in control of bleeding. OTSC captures tissue size to that of an&#xD;
      endoscope at least 9 mm in diameter. In theory, OTSC can compress arteries of significant&#xD;
      size, beyond what can be achieved with standard treatment. Second, clip retention rate with&#xD;
      OTSC is extremely and recurrent bleeding from clip loss or dislodgement can be avoided.&#xD;
      Third, local complication from their applications is negligible. As a comparison, contact&#xD;
      thermal coagulation carries a small risk (around 1%) of perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator group has participated in a multicenter randomized trial [11] that compares OTSC&#xD;
      to standard therapies in endoscopic management of refractory non-variceal bleeders. OTSC has&#xD;
      been shown to be superior in the control of bleeding (30/33 patients, 91% vs. 15/26 patients&#xD;
      57.6%, P=0.005) and is associated with fewer re-bleeding after hemostasis 6/33, 18% vs.&#xD;
      10/26, 38%, P=0.14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current proposed randomized controlled trial, the investigators compare OTSC and&#xD;
      standard therapies (hemo-clipping or thermal coagulation) as the primary endoscopic treatment&#xD;
      in the control of bleeding from non-variceal causes in patients who present with acute upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding. The investigators argue that OTSC should be used as the first&#xD;
      treatment given its promise in better bleeding control over other treatment methods.&#xD;
      Rebleeding patients are exposed to excessive risks in organ failure and death. Furthermore,&#xD;
      management of recurrent bleeding is expensive e.g. cost of angiographic embolization, surgery&#xD;
      and intensive care stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that OTSC as the first treatment during index endoscopy is superior&#xD;
      to standard endoscopic therapy in the overall rate of hemostasis. Knowledge from this&#xD;
      clinical trial will enable us to choose the correct treatment for bleeding lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and methodology Trial Design - A randomized controlled trial The trial will be&#xD;
      executed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines Randomization - Patients with&#xD;
      overt signs of acute upper GIB (melena, hematemesis, drop in haemoglobin with or without&#xD;
      hypotension) are invited to participate in the trial. Investigators or research nurses&#xD;
      approach patients and obtain their written consents. During endoscopy, if they have bleeding&#xD;
      lesions suitable for standard endoscopic treatment and OTSC, the endoscopist then requests&#xD;
      the next number sealed envelope to be opened by an endoscopy nurse. Patients are randomized&#xD;
      to receive either standard endoscopic treatment (contact thermal methods or hemoclips with or&#xD;
      without pre injection with diluted epinephrine), or the use of OTSC. Indications for&#xD;
      endoscopic treatment are active bleeding (pulsatile or Forrest Ia bleeding, oozing from a&#xD;
      visible vessel or a protuberance otherwise referred to as Forrest I b bleeding, or a non&#xD;
      bleeding visible vessel or Forrest IIa lesion). Clots overlying bleeding lesions are&#xD;
      irrigated or elevated using a cheese wiring technique with a minisnare. If a vessel is&#xD;
      unveiled, randomization can then proceed and the assigned treatment is then carried out. The&#xD;
      random number list is generated by computer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding - no blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants - Consecutive patients admitted with overt signs of acute upper GIB (melena,&#xD;
      hematemesis, drop in hemoglobin with or without hypotension) and documented bleeding (Forrest&#xD;
      I) from a non-variceal upper gastrointestinal sourcegastro-duodenal ulcers, Mallory Weiss&#xD;
      tear, cancers, Dieulafoy's and other vascular lesions) at endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions - Patients are randomly assigned at endoscopy to receive;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive; endoscopic treatment using OTSC or&#xD;
      standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No cross over to treatment of the other arm is allowed. A full description of the bleeding&#xD;
      lesion and the success of endoscopic therapy are provided and documented in the electronic&#xD;
      endoscopy report. It is unrealistic and impossible to completely blind ward staff as a plain&#xD;
      abdomen x-ray will readily an OTSC or indeed most hemo-clips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful endoscopy, patients are started on an intravenous infusion with proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor (PPI) for 72 hours. Thereafter, patients go onto receive an oral PPI or standard&#xD;
      PPI H. pylori eradication therapy should the patient is infected. It is generally recommended&#xD;
      that patients be transfused to a hemoglobin level of around 7 or 8 g/dl. In patients with&#xD;
      significant cardiac co-morbidities, a higher transfusion threshold is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulation in these patients is based on ASGE&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further bleeding is defined by failure to control bleeding during first endoscopy or&#xD;
      recurrent bleeding after initial control. Recurrent bleeding is defined by fresh hematemesis,&#xD;
      fresh melena or hematochezia with hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure lower than&#xD;
      90mmHg, heart rate greater than 110 per minute) and/or drop in hemoglobin &gt; 2g/dl in 24 hours&#xD;
      after transfusion to around 8 g/dl. An episode of recurrent bleeding has to be confirmed by&#xD;
      repeat endoscopy showing fresh blood in stomach or active bleeding from the previously&#xD;
      treated lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics analysis An independent data monitoring and safety panel will be formed by senior&#xD;
      physicians from our Clinical Trial Centre at the Chinese University of Hong Kong to&#xD;
      adjudicate over the occurrence of primary outcome events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses are by intention-to-treat and then per protocol principles. The primary outcome&#xD;
      between groups over 30 days is compared using a time-to-event type analysis with a log rank&#xD;
      test. An adjusted analysis or Cox regression model will be used in the presence of&#xD;
      significant difference in the baseline covariates. Initial rate of hemostasis and recurrent&#xD;
      bleeding within 30 days are independently reported and compared using a chi-square test.&#xD;
      Categorical data in secondary outcome measures are compared between groups again using&#xD;
      chi-square test. Parametric and non-parametric data are compared using student's t test and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test respectively.&#xD;
