    <textblock>
      This research will study the healing of standardized wounds created in the oral mucosa of&#xD;
      volunteer participants during daily intake of tablets and topical application of oil&#xD;
      containing the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri. Our null hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      consumption and topical application of probiotic supplements containing L. reuteri does not&#xD;
      improve clinical healing of oral wounds in healthy participants when compared to controls.&#xD;

      Intervention: after informed consent and baseline collection of clinical data (age,sex), the&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of the order of the treatments. As a run-in&#xD;
      period, they will be given a supply of probiotic or placebo tablets enough for seven days.&#xD;
      The participants are instructed to take two tablets daily (one in the morning and one in the&#xD;
      evening, days 0-7) and are asked to refrain from any other foods or supplements containing&#xD;
      probiotics. On day eight, the participant will attend to the clinics and a punch biopsy will&#xD;
      be performed. Depending on the allocation group, probiotic or placebo oil will be supplied.&#xD;
      The participant will be instructed to apply the oil locally on the wound with a plastic&#xD;
      microbrush for 9 days every evening, and strongly reinforced to continue with the assigned&#xD;
      tablets twice daily. The participant will attend the clinics on days two, five and eight&#xD;
      post-wounding for follow-up photographies of wound healing. The first intervention period&#xD;
      terminates with a wash-out period of four weeks, and then the second run-in an intervention&#xD;
      period start following the same procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic tablets and the probiotic oil (at the recommended dose) contain 2x10^8 CFU of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri. Both the placebo tablets and oil are identical in size and composition&#xD;
      but without the addition of the probiotic strains. The tablets and oil are packed in&#xD;
      identical pots/bottles with color coding. The code will be kept from the investigators until&#xD;
      the analysis are finished. Both the tablets and oil are provided by BIOGAIA AB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedures and sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical procedures and sample collections will be conducted by a qualified and&#xD;
      authorized dentist from the Institute of Odontology, Section for Cariology, Endodontics,&#xD;
      Pediatric Dentistry and Clinical Genetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University&#xD;
      of Copenhagen. Collected samples (saliva, wound exudate and bacterial smear) will be stored&#xD;
      in a freezer at -80 °C until all samples from all patients are gathered -for a maximum of six&#xD;
      months. Running of all collected samples at the same time allows laboratory analyses to be&#xD;
      carried out efficiently and avoids errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Punch biopsy: on day eight, a standardized circular wound of 3.5 mm diameter and&#xD;
      approximately 1.5 mm deep will be created in the mucosa of the hard palate with aid of a&#xD;
      biopsy punch. The biopsy is performed under aseptic conditions and local anesthesia using&#xD;
      lidocaine 2% combined with epinephrine for local hemostasis. A scalpel is used to remove the&#xD;
      surface epithelium and underlying superficial connective tissue, which will be discarded&#xD;
      according to biosafety regulations from the Institute of Dentistry, University of Copenhagen.&#xD;
      After wounding, the wound site will be photographed (blind-coded) with an intraoral camera,&#xD;
      placing a standard-sized 6 mm diameter template around the wound as reference. The&#xD;
      participant will attend to the dental clinics on days two, five and eight post-wounding to&#xD;
      have a photograph of the wound taken by Ph.D student Gina Castiblanco. The wound-size on&#xD;
      photographs will be measured by two raters and will be expressed as the ratio of the wound&#xD;
      surface area relative to the standard label size with aid of software (Canvas 7, ACD Systems&#xD;
      of America). The endpoint will be the percentage of initial wound size, measured at days two,&#xD;
      five and eight post-wounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sampling: six samples of unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) fro m each subject will be&#xD;
      collected (one at baseline, one right after the run-in period and one at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention period). For USW collection, the participant will be sitting in a comfortable&#xD;
      position with the head slightly bent. The participant is asked to keep the eyes open and make&#xD;
      as few moves as possible, including swallowing. Then, he/she is asked to rinse the mouth in&#xD;
      water and spit it out again. Thereafter, he/she is instructed to let saliva flow out of the&#xD;
      mouth down a designated plastic cup for ten minutes. Aliquots of saliva (1.5 ml) will&#xD;
      immediately be placed on ice and stored in a freezer at -80 °C until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of wound exudate: eight samples of wound exudate will be collected in total. The&#xD;
      wound site will be dried with cotton pellets and periopaper strips (ProFlow, Amityville, NY,&#xD;
      USA) will be gently pressed on the wound for 20 s. In case of blood contamination, the strip&#xD;
      is discharged and the sampling is repeated after five min. The volume of exudate is recorded&#xD;
      using a Peritron 8000 (Proflow) and expressed in µL. One strip holds approximately 0.1-0.4 µL&#xD;
      of exudate. The strips are then transferred to plastic tubes and stored at -80 until further&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial smear collection: four bacterial smears will be sampled. A sterile swab will be&#xD;
      passed through the wound site, placed in a plastic tube and stored freezed at -80 °C until&#xD;
      further analysis. The smears will be subjected to conventional microbial cultivation to&#xD;
      detects the presence/absence and counts of bacterial species commonly associated with delayed&#xD;
      wound healing (β-hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perception of pain and discomfort: a one-page logbook will be handed to the participants at&#xD;
      the beginning of each run-in period so they can register the intake of tablets and their own&#xD;
      perception of pain and discomfort according to a VAS-scale. The participant is also&#xD;
      encouraged to register factors that could possibly influence the outcome (physical activity&#xD;
      and number of alcoholic drinks). The participant will be asked to bring the filled logbook in&#xD;
      the end of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived stress and general health: in the end of the intervention period, the participant&#xD;
      will be asked to fill the validated General Heath Questionnaire GHQ-12 (10) and the validated&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (11). These factors (self-perception of stress and general health) are&#xD;
      known to be possible cofounders of wound healing outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance: at the beginning of each intervention period, the participants will be provided&#xD;
      with tablets enough for 16 days and oil for topical use enough for nine days application.&#xD;
      Compliance will be checked through the participant´s completion of a logbook in which the&#xD;
      daily intake of tablets and oil application is registered. For the last appointment, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to bring the remaining tablets and oil for counting/estimating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: all data will be processed with the open source statistics software &quot;R&quot; and&#xD;
      controlled for normal distribution. Multivariate and univariate analysis of variance (MANOVAs&#xD;
      and ANOVAs) will be used to assess within-subject change over time. A p-value less than 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant. The obtained results will be published in an&#xD;
      internationally recognized journal. If the results cannot be published in a journal, they&#xD;
      will be available at the website of the University of the Odontology Institute. We make&#xD;
      emphasis in that positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: all collected data will be treated in compliance with the Act on Processing&#xD;
      of Personal Data and &quot;The Health Law&quot;. At inclusion the participants will be assigned a&#xD;
      unique number and a separate protocol without personal identification number. This study will&#xD;
      not be reported to &quot;Datatilsynet&quot; as it is a private scientific health project&#xD;
