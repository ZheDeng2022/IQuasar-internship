  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a current opioid epidemic in the United States partially fueled by excess&#xD;
      prescribing practices after surgery. The objective of this study is to decrease the amount of&#xD;
      opioids needed after ambulatory hand surgery. In this randomized control trial, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized into a patient education group and into a control group. The education group&#xD;
      will be provided with a pre-operative video detailing proper indications for opioid use after&#xD;
      hand surgery, alternative pain management strategies to try before using prescription opioid&#xD;
      medications, and side effects associated with opioid use. Patients will also receive&#xD;
      information on the current opioid epidemic. Patients will be reminded of the information&#xD;
      given pre-operatively after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit. The control group will&#xD;
      not receive pre-operative education and will only receive standard of care post-operative&#xD;
      counseling by nursing in the post-anesthesia care unit. All patients will be given a pain&#xD;
      log, pain medication diary and participate in phone/email surveys to determine number of&#xD;
      opioid pills taken, pain levels, and satisfaction with surgery. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the education group will have decreased opioid intake and increased patient satisfaction&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;
