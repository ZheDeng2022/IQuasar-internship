  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized crossover study evaluates the plaque and&#xD;
      gingivitis reducing capacity of Cetylpyridium Chloride (CPC) chewing gum, with mechanical&#xD;
      oral hygiene. The study will enroll 73 students, faculty, and staff from the UTHealth School&#xD;
      of Dentistry. Half of the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to get the CPC gum&#xD;
      in the first treatment period (21 days), a wash-out period of 21 days, and then a placebo gum&#xD;
      in the second treatment period (21 days). The other half will be assigned to follow the same&#xD;
      schedule but with the treatment reversed. A statistician will perform the randomization.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are assessed by validated tools, such as the Plaque Index (PI), Gingival&#xD;
      Index (GI), and percent of bleeding sites on probe (BOP).&#xD;

    <description>Plaque will be assessed using the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index, where a score of 0 to 5 will be assigned to each facial and lingual non-restored surface of all teeth that are present with the exception of third molars at baseline and week 3 of the study, as follows. For each participant, an average of the scores for all teeth is calculated.&#xD;
0 No plaque&#xD;
Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth&#xD;
A thin continuous band of plaque (up to one mm) at the cervical margin of the tooth&#xD;

    <description>Gingivitis will be assessed using the Gingival Index (GI), where a score of 0 to 3 will be assigned to six teeth, representing six segments of jaws, at baseline and week 3 of the study according to the following criteria. For each participant, an average of the scores for all 6 teeth is calculated.&#xD;
0 Absence of inflammation.&#xD;
Mild inflammation - slight change in color and little change in texture.&#xD;

    <description>Objective observation of Discoloration of teeth will be recorded using a Vita scale. The color of the participant's teeth is matched to the colors on the scale. The colors in the scale are A1, A2, A3, A3.5, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3, C4, D2, D3, and D4--the letter portion of the scale indicates a tooth color of reddish-brownish (A), reddish-yellowish (B), greyish (C), or reddish-grey (D), and the number portion of the scale indicates degree of discoloration, with 1 indicating least discoloration and 4 indicating the most discoloration.</description>

        <description>Bleeding on probing (BOP) as described in Ainamo &amp; Bay 1975 will be assessed, where each of 4 gingival areas (disto-buccal, midbuccal, mid-lingual, and mesio-lingual) around each tooth will be light probed and scored from 0 to 2 as follows. For each participant, an average of the scores for the 4 gingival areas is calculated.&#xD;
