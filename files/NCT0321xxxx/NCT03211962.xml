  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient renal insufficiency is frequently observed in the course of cardiovascular arrest.&#xD;
      Although elevation of creatinine is reversible in a large majority of cases, severe renal&#xD;
      insufficiency is sometimes observed and is associated with a dark prognosis. Any intervention&#xD;
      that may limit the worsening of renal function may have an impact on patient mortality. There&#xD;
      is currently no validated pharmacological treatment to limit the progression of ARI or to&#xD;
      accelerate its recovery. A major challenge then concerns the detection of the reversible&#xD;
      character of renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal biomarkers have been little studied in the prediction of severe ARI and mortality after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. The combination of TIMP2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) and&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP7) in urine showed good diagnostic&#xD;
      performance in the early detection of the risk of developing acute renal failure within 12&#xD;
      hours. Measured in the urine, the excretion of these two markers specifically reflects renal&#xD;
      tubular lesions. Moreover, their rate seems to be strongly correlated with the severity of&#xD;
      the tubular lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it can be reasonably assumed that their very early dosing in post-cardiac arrest could&#xD;
      detect the presence and severity of renal tubular lesions. A threshold to be defined would&#xD;
      discriminate patients at risk of developing an ARI within 48 hours post ACR and to&#xD;
      distinguish between severe transient and severe persistent lesions beyond 72 hours.&#xD;
