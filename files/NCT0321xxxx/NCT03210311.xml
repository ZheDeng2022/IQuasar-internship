    <textblock>
      Breast-cancer related lymphoedema (BCRL) is a common phenomenon. Early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment is very important to alter the normal progression of this disease. A threshold (&gt;=&#xD;
      3% volume change) that recognizes subclinical lymphedema is promoted. When the lymphedema is&#xD;
      diagnosed late, options for treatment are diminished as fibrous tissue is formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative investigation with near-infrared fluorescence lymphography can show an&#xD;
      abnormality. Even if a linear transport is visualized, velocity of the transport can be&#xD;
      diminished or a different pathway than normal can be visualized. Such an extensive evaluation&#xD;
      has not been performed yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lymphofluoroscopy gives an opportunity to detect lymphedema earlier than clinically&#xD;
      visible (subclinical). The investigators hypothesize that the evolution of lymphedema can be&#xD;
      altered if treatment is started in the subclinical phase.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast-cancer related lymphoedema (BCRL) is a common phenomenon. Estimates of incidence rates&#xD;
      have varied over time, especially since the progression to less invasive techniques as&#xD;
      sentinel node procedures and radiotherapy. According to a review article of DiSipio the&#xD;
      incidence of arm lymphedema was about four times higher in women who had an axillary lymph&#xD;
      node dissection (18 studies; 19.9%, 13.5-28.2) than in those who had sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy (18 studies; 5.6%, 6.1-7.9). Several other risk factors are already suggested as&#xD;
      having a negative impact on the development of lymphedema such as BMI and chemotherapy. A&#xD;
      comprehensive overview of all treatment related risk factors and patient related risk&#xD;
      factors, including demographics, has not been reported yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphedema is identified with upper limb volume measurements eg circumference measurements,&#xD;
      water displacement and perometer. Bioimpedance spectroscopy can also be used to assess the&#xD;
      extracellular fluid. A 10% limb volume change has been reported as the most accurate&#xD;
      threshold to diagnose lymphedema. However, with this definition an underestimation of the&#xD;
      incidence rate of lymphoedema is made. Therefore, recently a threshold of 5% limb volume&#xD;
      change is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Rockson et al suggested that in almost 75 % of the cases, lymphoedema is&#xD;
      established in the first year after breast cancer treatment. But up to two years after&#xD;
      surgery, there still is a possibility to develop lymphoedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis and treatment is very important to alter the normal progression of this&#xD;
      disease. A threshold (&gt;= 3% volume change) that recognizes subclinical lymphedema is&#xD;
      promoted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the lymphedema is diagnosed late, options for treatment are diminished as fibrous tissue&#xD;
      is formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During near-infrared fluorescence lymphography (lymphofluoroscopy), a fluorescent substance&#xD;
      is injected subcutaneously in the hand and the transport of lymph is visualized from the hand&#xD;
      up to the axilla. A normal transport is defined as a linear image and an abnormal transport&#xD;
      as a dermal backflow image. The dermal backflow image is divided in three different&#xD;
      classifications according to the severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative investigation with near-infrared fluorescence lymphography can show an&#xD;
      abnormality. Even if a linear transport is visualized, velocity of the transport can be&#xD;
      diminished or a different pathway than normal can be visualized. Such an extensive evaluation&#xD;
      has not been performed yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lymphofluoroscopy gives an opportunity to detect lymphedema earlier than clinically&#xD;
      visible (subclinical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the evolution of lymphedema can be altered if treatment is&#xD;
      started in the subclinical phase.&#xD;
