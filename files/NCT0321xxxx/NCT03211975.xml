  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious endocarditis (IE) is the localization and proliferation of blood-borne germs in&#xD;
      the endocardium. It remains a complicated disease to manage due to its low incidence,&#xD;
      diagnostic difficulties, the change in epidemiology in recent decades and high mortality&#xD;
      rates. The annual incidence is estimated at 3-10 cases per 100,000 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiology of AR has changed significantly in recent years due to new risk factors.&#xD;
      Indeed, the frequency of rheumatic heart disease, which was the first predisposing factor,&#xD;
      decreased markedly in the industrialized countries, replaced by new predisposing factors: the&#xD;
      presence of valvular prostheses or intracardiac materials (the risk of AR is multiplied by 50&#xD;
      Compared with the general population), hemodialysis, nosocomial infections,&#xD;
      immunosuppression, increased use of injectable treatments and, above all, an aging population&#xD;
      with an increase in degenerative diseases such as aortic stenosis and l Mitral insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of IA is based on DUKE criteria. But the clinical presentation is sometimes&#xD;
      atypical especially in case of infection on prosthesis where the diagnosis is based mainly on&#xD;
      the results of the blood cultures and the ultrasound data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lesions visualized in ultrasound are: vegetations, abscesses, pseudo-aneurysms and&#xD;
      fistulas constituting the degenerated abscess evolution, the perforation of the cusps of the&#xD;
      native valve or the bioprosthesis giving rise to a jet of Eccentric regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of endocarditis and its prognosis vary according to many factors: the type of&#xD;
      germ responsible, the precocity of the diagnosis, the existence of a complication, the site&#xD;
      of occurrence. These complications of endocarditis are frequent, sometimes revealing. EI is&#xD;
      complicated by heart failure, atrioventricular conduction disorders, peri-vascular abscesses,&#xD;
      embolic, neurological, renal and septic complications. Despite improvements in diagnosis and&#xD;
      therapeutic methods, diagnosis is sometimes difficult, management remains very complicated&#xD;
      and morbidity and mortality remain high. Studies are still needed to study the prognosis and&#xD;
      to determine the predictive factors for hospital mortality and long-term mortality.&#xD;
