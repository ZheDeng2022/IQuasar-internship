    <textblock>
      The project aims at developing and structuring a network of clinicians, pathologists, and&#xD;
      scientists, from the &quot;Grand Ouest&quot; area, most of them already involved in prostate cancer&#xD;
      management and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated by radical prostatectomy will be recruited within the ReSCaP network of&#xD;
      clinicians, with centralized database and standardized bio-resource collection, including&#xD;
      prostate and adipose tissue samples. Seven clinical centers will participate to the network,&#xD;
      6 recruiting mainly Caucasian patients, and 1 from the French West Indies recruiting mainly&#xD;
      African Caribbean patients. After 18 months, 1000 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to study the relationships between adipose tissue/lipids and prostate cancer&#xD;
      aggressiveness. In fact, adipose tissue is likely to be involved in cancer progression at&#xD;
      many levels: abdominal obesity has been associated with aggressive disease, and&#xD;
      poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as cytokines produced by adipocytes&#xD;
      (adipokines) have an impact on cancer cells growth and migration in vitro. Moreover, adipose&#xD;
      tissue is the preferential site of storage of persistent organic pollutants with estrogenic&#xD;
      properties, which could impact cancer progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will analyze the association between adipose tissue (distant from the prostate)&#xD;
      composition and cancer aggressiveness. Among the 1000 patients, 100 aggressive tumors will be&#xD;
      selected according to the d'Amico criteria (Gleason score 8 or more and/or pT3 tumors). They&#xD;
      will be matched with 100 potentially indolent prostate cancers (Gleason 6 or less, and PSA&#xD;
      less than 10, and pT2 stage on the surgical specimen). These 200 adipose tissue samples will&#xD;
      be analyzed for 1/ the lipid profile, including the fatty acid composition, particularly&#xD;
      PUFAs, that reflects past dietary fat intake, 2/ adipokine expression, and 3/ tissue&#xD;
      concentrations of persistent organic pollutants belonging to the class of organochlorine&#xD;
      pesticides with hormone-like activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Relevance and strategic approach Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men and&#xD;
      the second leading cause of cancer deaths in western countries. Known risk factors are&#xD;
      advanced age, ethnic origins and positive family history of the disease (1). There are&#xD;
      considerable ethnic disparities in PCa risk, with a 60% higher incidence rate among&#xD;
      African-American (AA) men as compared with European-American (EA) men (2). Similarly, in the&#xD;
      French West Indies, where at least 90% of inhabitants are of African descent, the incidence&#xD;
      of PCa is twice as high as in the rest of France (3). Many lifestyles, environmental and&#xD;
      occupational related risk factors including obesity, diet, medications and pesticides have&#xD;
      been implicated in PCa etiology, but their roles remain unclear (4). Current research&#xD;
      suggests that there is a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors that have a&#xD;
      causative role in PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCa also has a highly heterogeneous potential of evolution. While some cancers will behave in&#xD;
      an aggressive manner, other patients will have an indolent form of the disease that could not&#xD;
      require any treatment. Several parameters are used to predict the risk of evolution in PCa&#xD;
      patients, either before any treatment: clinical stage, Gleason score on biopsies, and serum&#xD;
      prostatic specific antigen (PSA), or after the analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens:&#xD;
      pathological stage and surgical Gleason score (5). However, despite the value of these&#xD;
      prognostic factors, the potential of aggressiveness remains difficult to assess at diagnosis,&#xD;
      and patients classified within the intermediate risk group are often difficult to manageThere&#xD;
      is a challenge to discover new markers and novel targets for early therapeutic manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both genetic and environmental factors have been linked to the risk of aggressive disease.&#xD;
      The ethnic origin is likely to play a role, since the proportion of cases diagnosed at the&#xD;
      metastatic stage is reported to be higher for African-American patients (35%) than for&#xD;
      European-American patients (22%), with a 2.4-fold higher mortality rate in AA men than in EA&#xD;
      men (2).Together with genetic factors, environmental factors also seem to play a key role in&#xD;
      PCa progression. Some environmental factors such as obesity have been associated with&#xD;
      aggressive PCa (6). However, much remains to search about the role of genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors and their interplay in PCa aggressiveness. White adipose tissue (WAT)&#xD;
      and lipids are potentially involved in the development and/or progression of PCa at many&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WAT is a metabolically active endocrine organ. Adipocytes secrete a variety of hormones,&#xD;
      bioactive peptides and cytokines, termed adipokines (9). Several adipokines have been&#xD;
      involved in the mechanisms leading to PCa progression and aggressiveness, including leptin,&#xD;
      interleukin IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage of endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors (ED) are thought to be involved in&#xD;
      prostate cancer (10). However, epidemiologic evidence of a positive link between&#xD;
      environmental exposures to ED is limited. Two studies using blood plasma or abdominal fat for&#xD;
      monitoring persistent pollutants have shown positive associations with PCa risk&#xD;
      (transchlordane, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, trans-nonachlore, dieldrine, and polychlorinated&#xD;
      biphenyl 153) (11, 12). A recent study carried out in French West Indies showed that&#xD;
      chlordecone, an organochlorine pesticide with well defined estrogenic properties, increases&#xD;
      the risk of PCa, and is associated with an aggressive form of the disease in subjects with a&#xD;
      positive family history of PCa (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WAT composition: Lipidome. Among nutrients, dietary lipids are major determinants of the&#xD;
      overall lipid composition of WAT, as assessed during dietary intervention studies (19-22).&#xD;
      Among fatty acids, essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a subclass of bioactive&#xD;
      components divided in two groups, n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. The n-6 series include the&#xD;
      precursor linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6). The n-3 series include the precursor alpha-linolenic&#xD;
      acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), and highly unsaturated derivatives. The fatty acid composition of WAT&#xD;
      has been shown to reflect the past fatty acid intake (23). Although there are no conclusive&#xD;
      studies showing an association between total dietary fat intake and PCa risk, specific types&#xD;
      of dietary fat (animal fat) appear to be more significant in increasing PCa risk (6, 28). The&#xD;
      association between fish consumption (rich in in the long-chain omega-3 PUFAs) and lower risk&#xD;
      of prostate cancer is controversial, but a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific&#xD;
      mortality has been described (29). Previous studies analyzing the PUFAs composition in&#xD;
      prostate tissues have led to conflicting results. However, fatty acid composition of WAT has&#xD;
      never been studied in PCa in association with aggressiveness and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the program is to structure a network associating clinicians, pathologists,&#xD;
      and scientists devoted to prostate cancer management and research. The network will generate&#xD;
      a multi-centric centralized database of PCa patients treated by radical prostatectomy, with&#xD;
      standardized bio-resources collection, including prostate and adipose tissue samples. The use&#xD;
      of the bio-resources will be orientated mainly toward the relationships between adipose&#xD;
      tissue/lipids and PCa aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to characterize an association between PCa aggressiveness and the&#xD;
      composition of pelvic adipose tissue. Adipose tissue samples from patients with either low&#xD;
      risk (n=100) or aggressive (n=100) PCa will be analyzed for 1/ the lipid profile (fatty acid&#xD;
      composition and phospholipids proportions), 2/ expression of adipokines, and 3/ persistent&#xD;
      organic pollutants with hormone-like activity. The analysis will take into account known&#xD;
      factors of aggressiveness, including obesity, MetS components, ethno-geographic origin, and&#xD;
      positive family history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and techniques implemented I- Constitution of the database and bio-resources&#xD;
      collection Each patient with prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy in the 7&#xD;
      clinical centers of the network will be included in the cohort. Given the surgical activity&#xD;
      of these centers during the last 3 years, a minimum of 1000 inclusions is expected after 18&#xD;
      months, with around 250 african-carribean patients.Standardized clinical, biological, and&#xD;
      pathological data will be entered in a common centralized eCRF available in each center&#xD;
      (Clinsight®) with central management and validation (Team 13). Financial support will be&#xD;
      provided to the clinical teams for entering the data (technicians specialized in clinical&#xD;
      research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data commonly associated with PCa will be entered in the database: administrative items&#xD;
      (name, DOB, address, Hospital N°, Pathology N°), preoperative PSA, clinical stage,&#xD;
      pathological items (weight and size of the specimen, pathological stage including lymph node&#xD;
      status, Gleason score, % of grade 4 ou 5, greater axis of the main focus, margin status), and&#xD;
      follow-up items (both biological and clinical).The following items will also be specified:&#xD;
      BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, blood pressure, circulating lipids (triglycerides,&#xD;
      total, LDL and HDL cholesterol), ongoing treatments (lipid lowering drugs, HTA, treatments&#xD;
      for diabetes), ethno-geographic origin, and family history of PCa During the surgical&#xD;
      procedures, 3 pieces of pelvic adipose tissue (around 5g, 2g and 2 g, for tasks 1, 2, and 3&#xD;
      of Axis 1, respectively) will be sampled, sent to the biological resource center, and&#xD;
      immediately frozen at -80°C. The investigators choose to sample visceral WAT instead of&#xD;
      subcutaneous WAT, because visceral adipocytes are more metabolically active (8). Among&#xD;
      visceral WAT, the investigators choose to sample perivesical adipose tissue, since fat around&#xD;
      the bladder is always very abundant, and can be easily taken during the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      The prostate specimens will be sent immediately to the pathology departments, and managed in&#xD;
      a standardized manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the cohort will be asked to sign an informed consent (after&#xD;
      agreement of the Ethical Committee/IRB). The annotated bio-resources concerning the subjects&#xD;
      included in the programs will be managed in respect of the rules defined by the CNIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of patients with either aggressive or low risk disease from the cohort from the&#xD;
      1000 patients expected at M18, 100 patients with highly aggressive disease will be selected.&#xD;
      Selection will be made based on the criteria of high risk disease, mainly high grade PCa&#xD;
      (Gleason score 8 or more) and/or pathological stage pT3. Each of these 100 patients will then&#xD;
      be matched (center by center) with 1 patient with indolent disease and identical status for&#xD;
      age (50 or less, 51-55, 56-60, 61-65, 66-70, 71-75, more than 75 years old) and BMI (normal,&#xD;
      overweight, and obese). Criteria for indolent disease will include preoperative PSA &lt;&#xD;
      10ng/ml, and Gleason score 6 or less (on the surgical specimen), and pT2 stage. If several&#xD;
      indolent cases could be matched with 1 aggressive case, the one with the smaller tumor size&#xD;
      will be preferred. Adipose tissue sampled from these 200 patients will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to identify associations between aggressive and significant PCa and the&#xD;
      composition of adipose tissue. The investigators hypothesize that persistent organic&#xD;
      pollutants (that reflect cumulative past exposure), and/or lipid composition (that reflect&#xD;
      past intake), could be, together with adipokines expression, associated with disease&#xD;
      aggressiveness. Known factors of PCa aggressiveness (ethnic origin, familial history, and&#xD;
      obesity status) will be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task1: Lipidome analysis Analyses performed on the adipose tissue samples will be: i)&#xD;
      triglyceride fatty acid composition, and ii) adipose cells membrane phospholipids classes&#xD;
      relative amounts. Five major phospholipids classes found in the plasma membrane of adipose&#xD;
      cells can be separated and quantified: phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine,&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin. Adipose tissue being mostly&#xD;
      composed of triacylglycerol and only approximately 1% phospholipids, the study of membrane&#xD;
      phospholipids will require larger sample amounts (5 g) than would typically be necessary for&#xD;
      triglycerides fatty acid composition analysis (400-500 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose tissue samples will undergo lipid extraction with the use of chloroform and methanol&#xD;
      (according to the Folch method). Briefly, total extract will be vacuum-dried, then&#xD;
      resolubilized in a mixture of hexane and methanol to partition neutral (hexane soluble) and&#xD;
      polar (methanol soluble) lipids. Triglycerides in the hexane phase will be further purified&#xD;
      from other neutral or polar lipids by thin layer chromatography on silica-gel plates.&#xD;
      Purified triglycerides will undergo methanol transesterification to produce volatile fatty&#xD;
      acids as methyl esters. Separation and quantification of fatty acids will be performed by gas&#xD;
      chromatography (BPX-70 phase capillary column, on-column injection, flame-ionization&#xD;
      detector).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task2: Adipokine measurements Total RNA from adipose tissue samples will be extracted by the&#xD;
      Trizol technique and RNA quality will be checked by gel agarose electrophoresis and&#xD;
      quantification by NanoDrop. After reverse transcription of encoding mRNA into cDNA, control&#xD;
      quality of reverse transcription PCR amplification will be done using a housekeeping gene in&#xD;
      the low number of cycles and new control by gel agarose. Real-time quantitative PCR will then&#xD;
      be performed in triplicate on nine genes of interest (adipokines) and three housekeeping&#xD;
      genes for normalization (18S, beta-actin and SDHA), ie 10 800 points generated. PCRs will be&#xD;
      made in 384-well plates and the reaction mixtures distributed by robot distribution.Adipokine&#xD;
      list (n=9): chemerin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1),&#xD;
      retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), visfatin, leptin,&#xD;
      adiponectin, apelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task3: Measurements of persistent organic pollutants (organochlorine pesticides) The&#xD;
      analytical methodology used for measuring the targeted organochorine pesticides is derived&#xD;
      from procedures previously developed, validated, and accredited for other classes of&#xD;
      lipophilic persistent organic pollutants such as dioxins and PCB compounds. Briefly, a&#xD;
      preliminary step using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) will be followed by successive&#xD;
      purification stages on activated silica and celite columns. The measurement will be performed&#xD;
      using gas chromatography coupled to high resolution and/or tandem mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS,&#xD;
      GC-MS/MS). The quantification will be achieved according to the isotopic dilution method&#xD;
      (i.e. using 13C labeled analogous as internal standards). The selection of the main targeted&#xD;
      substances will be preliminary based on the Stockholm convention that lists about 12 major&#xD;
      pesticides of concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multicenter standardized clinical and biological database will identify 2 homogeneous&#xD;
      groups of PCa patients with characteristics of either aggressive or potentially indolent&#xD;
      disease. The investigators expect that the analysis of pelvic adipose tissue will demonstrate&#xD;
      whether some categories of 1/ Lipids (reflecting the diet), 2/ Adipokines and 3/ Stored&#xD;
      Xenobiotics are preferentially associated with a greater or lower risk of PCa aggressiveness.&#xD;
      Such identification could then lead to preventive strategies.&#xD;
