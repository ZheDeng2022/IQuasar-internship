  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of opioids facilitates angiogenesis and has a proven action in the immune system,&#xD;
      mainly in the reduction of natural killer cell activity, favoring the migration of neoplastic&#xD;
      cells and inhibiting humoral and cellular immunity. These factors may contribute to&#xD;
      recurrence and tumor metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, could opioid-free anesthesia help reduce tumor recurrence? This is a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial in which patients undergoing radical prostatectomy will&#xD;
      be evaluated by conventional means, which have moderate and high D'Amico criteria for tumor&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, patients will be monitored, receive peripheral venoclysis and then&#xD;
      randomized into two groups: in group I, the anesthetic induction will be done with pre&#xD;
      oxygenation with 100% O2, propofol, cisatracurium, lidocaine and fentanyl; In group II the&#xD;
      induction will be done with the same doses of propofol, cisatracurium, lidocaine and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups maintenance of general anesthesia will be with propofol 1% target infusion&#xD;
      controlled with model of Marsh target-controlled infusion plasma between 2.0 and 3.0 mcg /&#xD;
      ml, ketamine, lidocaine and dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive blockade of the transverse plane of the ultrasound guided&#xD;
      ultrasound, group I with placebo (saline 0.9% 20 ml on each side) and group II with&#xD;
      ropivacaine 0.375% 20 ml on each side. And the postoperative analgesia will be based on&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and opioid analgesics (pca of morphine) according to the analgesic pain&#xD;
      scale of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postoperative period, patients will be followed up for 2 years with serial doses of&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) to diagnose tumor recurrence (2 PSA measures&gt; 0.2 ng / ml)&#xD;
      and will be evaluated in relation to analgesia, need for analgesia of Rescue with morphine,&#xD;
      satisfaction with the anesthetic technique, adverse effects (nausea and vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate tumor biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      in patients undergoing opioid anesthesia compared to patients anesthetized without opioids.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the quality of analgesia with the two techniques,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with perioperative period, quality of anesthetic recovery and adverse&#xD;
      effects (nausea and vomiting, pruritus and drowsiness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, to answer the hypothesis raised, 146 patients will be needed (73 in each group).&#xD;
