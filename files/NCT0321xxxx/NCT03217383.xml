    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease that is largely un-diagnosed and untreated.&#xD;
      Standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP), entails use of a nose mask to deliver positive pressure which dilates the pharynx and&#xD;
      eliminates obstruction. This therapy is highly efficacious and benign but is associated with&#xD;
      low adherence, particularly in non-sleepy apneics with disease of mild and moderate severity.&#xD;
      The principal alternative to CPAP therapy is oral appliance (OA) therapy in which a custom&#xD;
      made mandibular advancement splint (MAS) is used to protrude the mandible during sleep,&#xD;
      thereby opening the pharyngeal airway. OA therapy, while preferred and well accepted by most&#xD;
      participants, is not uniformly efficacious. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the patient's&#xD;
      response to OAT and the effective target mandibular position can lead to a significant time&#xD;
      span between diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment. Furthermore, knowledge of the&#xD;
      effective target mandibular position supports the use of new OA design and manufacturing&#xD;
      processes that can further reduce the time and cost in delivering the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zephyr Sleep Technologies (the Sponsor) has developed a method of identifying OAT responsive&#xD;
      participants and their efficacious mandibular protrusion. Recently, Zephyr Sleep Technologies&#xD;
      developed a portable device that avoids this requirement and can be used in a multi-night&#xD;
      test in the home. Using a feedback controlled mandibular positioner (FCMP), the device&#xD;
      measures and analyzes respiratory airflow and oxygen saturation and makes decisions in&#xD;
      real-time about moving the mandible. The FCMP device was tested in a blinded, bi-phase&#xD;
      clinical study in which participants with mild-to-severe sleep apnea (n=202) underwent two&#xD;
      full-night studies in the home. Data from phase 1 were used to develop a predictive method,&#xD;
      and data from phase 2 were used to prospectively test the accuracy of the predictive method.&#xD;
      An efficacious mandibular position was also predicted, and each participant was treated with&#xD;
      a custom oral appliance set to that position. Data from both phases were used to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of use of the device in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random forest machine learning system was used to develop and test the predictive method.&#xD;
      The overall oral appliance success rate was 76% for phase 1 and 71% for phase 2. The overall&#xD;
      predictive accuracy was 88%. Values for sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 93%,&#xD;
      respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 97% and 72%, respectively. The&#xD;
      effective target protrusive position was identified in 86% of cases. The studies were&#xD;
      conducted independently by the participants in their homes, though due to limitations in the&#xD;
      early prototype design, a clinical coordinator visited the home to set up the equipment prior&#xD;
      to each night of study. No significant problems were encountered, and no significant risks&#xD;
      were identified. The results of the clinical trial show that the auto-titrating mandibular&#xD;
      positioner is suitable for use in the home and accurately predicts OAT outcome as well as&#xD;
      target protrusive position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of this study, Zephyr developed a commercially available device which&#xD;
      has been approved for sale in Canada (Health Canada device license #97614). The device,&#xD;
      branded MATRx plus, functions as both a sleep recorder as well as a home-based system to&#xD;
      select patients for oral appliance therapy. This commercially available device is currently&#xD;
      being used in three separate usability trials to quantify the usability of the device and the&#xD;
      benefits of an improved workflow through adoption of the new technology in a dental practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence has recently appeared to indicate that the change in pharyngeal volume caused by&#xD;
      protrusion of the mandible, measured while awake, correlates with the change in&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) achieved by OAT, measured while asleep. This is the first&#xD;
      convincing evidence that an awake measurement of the pharyngeal airway correlates with the&#xD;
      improvement in respiratory status during sleep induced by an oral appliance. The implication&#xD;
      is that a simple conebeam CT of the pharynx can predict outcome with OAT. Accordingly, we&#xD;
      shall carry out conebeam CTs in the research protocol, both at rest position of the mandible&#xD;
      and at 90% of maximal protrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the predictive accuracy of the FCMP in the home&#xD;
      environment is improved by the commercial design and whether patients predicted to be&#xD;
      suitable for oral appliance therapy have long term adherence.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Zephyr Sleep Technologies (the Sponsor) has developed a method of identifying OAT responsive&#xD;
      participants and their efficacious mandibular protrusion. A remotely controlled mandibular&#xD;
      positioner (RCMP) is used during polysomnographic monitoring to vary the mandibular position.&#xD;
      The in-lab version of the device, requiring use of a sleep technologist during a&#xD;
      polysomnographic study, was shown to accurately predict outcome with a custom oral appliance&#xD;
      in a triple-blind, prospective, predictive study in sixty-seven participants with&#xD;
      mild-to-severe sleep apnea (specificity: 92%; PPV: 94%; sensitivity: 86%; NPV: 83%). In&#xD;
      addition, the predicted target mandibular protrusive position proved efficacious in 87.5% of&#xD;
      cases. While accurate in prospectively identifying oral appliance responders, the&#xD;
      availability and utility of the RCMP device is limited by the requirement of a&#xD;
      polysomnographic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Zephyr Sleep Technologies developed a portable device that avoids this requirement&#xD;
      and can be used in a multi-night test in the home. Using a feedback controlled mandibular&#xD;

      benefits of an improved workflow through adoption of the new technology in a dental practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProSomnus Sleep Technologies has developed a digitally designed and milled sleep appliance&#xD;
      called the MicrO2. This device is designed to accurately represent the bite and targeted&#xD;
      mandibular position, minimize tongue interference, maintain the targeted mandibular position&#xD;
      throughout the night using 90-degree fin angles and use a novel titration process that can&#xD;
      reduce error in patient/doctor titration position selection. This device coupled with a&#xD;
      digital workflow and outcome of the FCMP is postulated to provide an increase in efficiency&#xD;
      of delivering efficacious treatment to the patient from diagnosis to final therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence has recently appeared to indicate that the change in velo-pharyngeal volume caused&#xD;
      by protrusion of the mandible, measured while awake, correlates with the change in&#xD;
