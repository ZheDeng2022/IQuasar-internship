      Study Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Noninvasive Positive Airway Pressure in the Pediatric&#xD;
      Emergency Department for the Treatment of Acute Asthma Exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator: Thomas J. Abramo, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: For acute moderate to severe pediatric asthma exacerbations the use of&#xD;
      NIPPV/BiPAP, in conjunction with current standard of care therapies, will lead to a more&#xD;
      rapid improvement in patient ventilation, faster resolution of respiratory distress and&#xD;
      result in improved ventilatory parameters, secondary outcomes and pediatric asthma scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: This study will be conducted over a 36 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 240 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Children ages 2-17 years of age presenting to the ED with Acute asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation and a Pediatric Asthma Score (PAS) â‰¥ 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis: Eligible subjects will be randomized to either a control group or study groups. The&#xD;
      study groups will be either a NIPPV/BiPAP group. The subjects in the study groups will&#xD;
      continue to receive all standard of care therapies per the asthma severity protocols. All&#xD;
      nebulized therapies will be given through the NIPPV circuit. Patients will be assessed by the&#xD;
      pediatric asthma score (PAS), measured respiratory parameters, volumetric end tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide monitoring and measured cardiac parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: A. Evaluate if the use of NIPPV/BiPAP in conjunction with traditional inhaled&#xD;
      beta-agonists improves the outcome in pediatric patients with acute moderate to severe asthma&#xD;
      in the acute setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Describe the physiology of NIPPV/BiPAP by measuring cardiac parameters in children&#xD;
      randomized to a NIPPV group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Monitor safety of NIPPV/BiPAP use for acute asthma exacerbations in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety A.: The study must be IRB approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.: Appropriate consent and assent documents will be obtained prior to enrolling the subject&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.: A clear safety plan including DSMB will be established to monitor for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D.: Confidentiality will be ensured for all subjects enrolled in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective and randomized clinical trial to investigate the utility of BiPAP&#xD;
      therapy for the pediatric patient in an acute moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in the pediatric emergency department at Arkansas Children's&#xD;
      Hospital. Patients between 2-17 years old will be identified to participate based on the past&#xD;
      medical history, history of present illness and PAS and the consent process will begin&#xD;
      immediately. All patients will be started on standard of care therapies including continuous&#xD;
      albuterol and atrovent aerosols, intravenous corticosteroids, intravenous magnesium sulfate&#xD;
      and a normal saline fluid bolus. Additional therapies with subcutaneous epinephrine or&#xD;
      terbutaline will be given at the discretion of the treating physician in the first 20&#xD;
      minutes. Further escalation of asthma therapy, for example administration of IV&#xD;
      bronchodilators, ketamine, terbutaline and/or epinephrine will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician. The history of present illness, past medical history, triage information&#xD;
      and initial physical exam information will be collected by the study investigator in the&#xD;
      first hour and marked on the data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented, participants will be randomized to one of two groups by selection of an&#xD;
      opaque folder by the study investigator. A PAS will be assigned at 1 hour after only having&#xD;
      received traditional standard of care therapies and before placing the subject on the therapy&#xD;
      determined by the randomization. If the child receives a score of 7 or less, he/she will not&#xD;
      be placed on NIPPV; however, they will be analyzed in this group based on intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Group #1: This group will receive all standard of care therapies as per the pediatric ED&#xD;
      Asthma Severity Protocol. Will be referred to as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Group #2: This group will receive all standard of care therapies as per the pediatric ED&#xD;
      Asthma Severity Protocol. All nebulized treatments will be given via the NIPPV/BiPAP machine&#xD;
      via the Servo i Ventilator. The treating PED Attending and treating PED respiratory therapist&#xD;
      will be blinded to the BiPAP/NIPPV settings during the study period. The PED clinical trial&#xD;
      research assistant and in conjunction with one of the study investigators will adjust the&#xD;
      BiPAP settings in concert with the treating physician. The discussion will be about either&#xD;
      increasing or decreasing the IPAP or EPAP not the true number changes to keep it blinded,&#xD;
      will be as follows: The inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) will be started at 10 cm&#xD;
      H2O for all patients. The patient will be observed clinically by a PED respiratory therapist&#xD;
      in conjunction with the treating pediatric ED attending and/or fellow. The IPAP will be&#xD;
      increased as needed by 2 cm H2O up to a maximum IPAP of 16 cm H2O for patients 2-6 years of&#xD;
      age, 20 cm H2O for patients 7-12 years of age, and 24 cm H2O for patients older than 12&#xD;
      years. The expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) will be set at 5 cm H2O. If the IPAP&#xD;
      settings are maximized based on age and the respiratory distress score continues to be 5 or&#xD;
      greater, the EPAP can be increased by 1 cm H2O to a maximum of 8 cm H2O for all patients less&#xD;
      than 12 years and 10 cm H2O for all patients older than 12 years. The I:E setting will be&#xD;
      1.75 seconds. Optimal settings for each participant should be achieved within 20 minutes of&#xD;
      initiation of BiPAP and respiratory distress scores should recorded at least every 5 minutes&#xD;
      or with every BiPAP settings change during this period. Pediatric asthma scores will continue&#xD;
      to be recorded at least every 30 minutes or with every physician suggested NIPPV ventilator&#xD;
      setting change for an 8 hour period. Furthermore, the NIPPV ventilator, Servo i ventilator,&#xD;
      has volumetric end tidal CO2 monitoring capabilities and will record ventilatory data in this&#xD;
      NIPPV/BiPAP group and will be compared to other study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will remain in the study for minimum of 4 hrs NIPPV therapy and total of 8 hours&#xD;
      unless clinically still needing the NIPPV therapy. The first hour they will all receive the&#xD;
      same standard therapies, followed by 7 hours of the therapies from the group in which they&#xD;
      were randomized. Each 30 minutes in the study, the subject will be assessed by treating&#xD;
      PED/PICU attending as to whether to continue the patient on the study arm, switch to a rescue&#xD;
      arm or discontinue the patient from the study. This reassessment will be facilitated by the&#xD;
      study investigator via a direct discussion with the treating attending physician.&#xD;
      Furthermore, every 30 minutes the treating RT, treating PED attending or fellow, or study&#xD;
      investigator will perform a PAS. Based on the PAS, the treating PED attending will be asked&#xD;
      if patient needs further adjustment of the EnVe or continue present therapy. Once a subject&#xD;
      in the NIPPV arm reaches a PAS of less than or equal to 7, the NIPPV settings may be weaned&#xD;
      per the ACH PED NIPPV/BiPAP weaning protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Rescue Arm A: If at any point during the treatment it is deemed medically necessary by the&#xD;
      treating PED attending that a subject from the control arm, Group 1, requires an escalation&#xD;
      of therapy, they may be moved from the group to the NIPPV/BiPAP group, Group 2, or be removed&#xD;
      from the study i.e. if intubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Rescue Arm B: If at any point during the treatment it is deemed medically necessary by&#xD;
      the treating PED attending that a subject from a NIPPV/BiPAP group,Group 2, is not tolerating&#xD;
      NIPPV they may be removed from the study. Patients may not tolerate NIPPV due to agitation,&#xD;
      vomiting or need for escalation of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, in an attempt to better understand the physiology of NIPPV/BiPAP parameters of&#xD;
      cardiac output, aortic flow and pulmonary flow, will be measured using the USCOM. This will&#xD;
      assist us in understanding the physiological effects of the setting choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Group 2 will be kept on the NIPPV machine for 4 hours minimum, unless the PED or&#xD;
      PICU treating attending deems the patient has dramatically improved to take off the machine.&#xD;
      The study investigator will collect information regarding medications given and any&#xD;
      complications. At the end of the 8 hour study period, a PAS score will be calculated, and the&#xD;
      study investigator will ask the PED or PICU treating attending whether to continue present&#xD;
      therapy or switch to another therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study time has completed, the study investigator will collect information such as&#xD;
      PED/PICU diagnosis, disposition from PED/PICU and related information based on disposition,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay and 72 hour returns from PED and mark it on the data sheet.&#xD;
