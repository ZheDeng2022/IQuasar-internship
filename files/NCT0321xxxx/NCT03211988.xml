  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center Phase II trial of entinostat given as a 5 mg&#xD;
      oral dose every week (days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4-week cycle) in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory abdominal neuroendocrine (NE) tumors. Patients will continue on treatment until&#xD;
      disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are derived from NE cells that reside widely in the endocrine&#xD;
      system and other organs and comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms. Because NETs can&#xD;
      arise in a broad spectrum of locations they are associated with a broad range of symptoms&#xD;
      that may be caused by mass effects and/or by the production of hormones or biogenic amines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently, entinostat has been shown to down-regulate the number and function of two key&#xD;
      immunosuppressive cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-cells&#xD;
      (Tregs), in the tumor microenvironment thereby enhancing the activity of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition. To date, entinostat has been investigated alone or in combination in &gt;900&#xD;
      patients with cancer in clinical studies, including &gt;600 patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
      Entinostat as a single agent has been studied in metastatic melanoma and in combination has&#xD;
      been studied in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, renal cell&#xD;
      cancer, and colon cancer.&#xD;

             is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT)&#xD;
             is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants and activated partial&#xD;
             Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5×ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy&#xD;

             to receiving the first dose of study drug, a urine test is not required. Note: Women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential (WoCP) are any women between menarche and menopause who have&#xD;
             not been permanently or surgically sterilized and are capable of procreation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Any condition (e.g., known or suspected poor compliance, psychological instability,&#xD;
             geographical location, etc) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect the&#xD;
             patient's ability to sign the informed consent and comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any condition that will put the patient at undue risk or discomfort as a result of&#xD;
             adherence to study procedures&#xD;

             or significant small bowel resection that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             preclude adequate absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Allergy to benzamide or inactive components of entinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients may not be taking any corticosteroid for any reason while on study and all&#xD;
