    <measure>Co-Primary Endpoint: Percentage of Participants With a Response for Dysmenorrhea (DYS) at Months 6 and 12 Based on Daily Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain daily and DYS (pain during menstruation ) and its impact on daily activities each day of their period in an electronic diary (e-Diary). DYS was measured by the 4-point Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Diary according to the following:&#xD;
0: No discomfort&#xD;
1: Mild discomfort but I was easily able to do the things I usually do&#xD;
2: Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do&#xD;
3: Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.&#xD;
Pain scores and analgesic use were averaged over 35 days prior to each visit.&#xD;
Response was defined as a reduction of -0.92 or more from baseline in DYS as well as no increase in rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain (defined as a &lt; 15% increase in average rescue analgesic pill count and no additional analgesic).</description>

2: Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do&#xD;
3: Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 6 in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Short Form 6a T-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 6a is self-administered and composed of 6 questions to evaluate fatigue over the past 7 days. All questions employ the following five response options: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always. The PROMIS Fatigue 6a score is calculated as a T-score, which is a standardized score with a mean of 50 (based on the average for the United States general population) and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. A decrease in score (negative change from baseline) indicates improvement in fatigue.</description>

        <title>Co-Primary Endpoint: Percentage of Participants With a Response for Dysmenorrhea (DYS) at Months 6 and 12 Based on Daily Assessment</title>
        <description>Participants recorded rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain daily and DYS (pain during menstruation ) and its impact on daily activities each day of their period in an electronic diary (e-Diary). DYS was measured by the 4-point Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Diary according to the following:&#xD;
0: No discomfort&#xD;
1: Mild discomfort but I was easily able to do the things I usually do&#xD;
2: Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do&#xD;
3: Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.&#xD;
Pain scores and analgesic use were averaged over 35 days prior to each visit.&#xD;
Response was defined as a reduction of -0.92 or more from baseline in DYS as well as no increase in rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain (defined as a &lt; 15% increase in average rescue analgesic pill count and no additional analgesic).</description>

        <title>Co-Primary Endpoint: Percentage of Participants With a Response for Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain (NMPP) at Months 6 and 12 Based on Daily Assessment</title>
        <description>Participants recorded rescue analgesic medication for endometriosis-associated pain and assessed NMPP and its impact on their daily activities each day in an e-Diary was measured by the 4-point Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Diary according to the following:&#xD;
0: No discomfort&#xD;
1: Mild discomfort but I was easily able to do the things I usually do&#xD;
2: Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do&#xD;
3: Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.&#xD;
Pain scores and analgesic use were averaged over the 35 days prior to each visit.&#xD;
Response was defined as a reduction of -0.55 or greater from baseline for NMPP as well as no increase in rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain (defined as a &lt; 15% increase in average pill count of rescue analgesics and no additional analgesics).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 6 in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Short Form 6a T-Score</title>
        <description>The PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 6a is self-administered and composed of 6 questions to evaluate fatigue over the past 7 days. All questions employ the following five response options: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always. The PROMIS Fatigue 6a score is calculated as a T-score, which is a standardized score with a mean of 50 (based on the average for the United States general population) and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. A decrease in score (negative change from baseline) indicates improvement in fatigue.</description>

          <description>Participants assessed DYSP each day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:&#xD;
0: None; No discomfort during sexual intercourse&#xD;
1: Mild; Able to tolerate the discomfort during sexual intercourse&#xD;
2: Moderate; Intercourse was interrupted due to pain&#xD;
3: Severe; Avoided intercourse because of pain&#xD;
Not applicable; I was not sexually active for reasons other than endometriosis or did not have sexual intercourse.&#xD;
Pain scores were averaged over the 35 days prior to each visit. Responses of &quot;Not Applicable&quot; were excluded.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Short Form 6a T-Score</title>
        <description>The PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 6a is self-administered and composed of 6 questions to evaluate fatigue over the past 7 days. All questions employ the following five response options: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always. The PROMIS Fatigue 6a score is calculated as a T-score, which is a standardized score with a mean of 50 (based on the average for the United States general population) and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. A decrease in score (negative change from baseline) indicates improvement in fatigue.</description>

          <description>The NRS measured endometriosis-associated pain with and without menstruation on an 11-point scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain ever. Site staff administered the Overall Endometriosis-Associated Pain questionnaire assessing pain over a 7-day recall period, and recorded the participant's response electronically via a tablet at the time of visit. Pain scores were averaged over the 35 days prior to each visit.</description>
