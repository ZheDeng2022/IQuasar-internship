  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance use disorders (SUDs), depression and anxiety in HIV-infected patients result in&#xD;
      poor HIV outcomes, yet are often unrecognized and untreated. To address these problems, this&#xD;
      study examines the implementation and effectiveness of a clinical intervention consisting of&#xD;
      self-administered tablet-based SUD and depression screening at routine HIV primary care&#xD;
      clinic visits, followed by evidence-based treatments for SUD, anxiety and depression&#xD;
      delivered by a behavioral health specialist. If successful, this study has potential to&#xD;
      reduce SUD-, anxiety- and depression-related problems and reduce HIV treatment disparities&#xD;
      for patients with these comorbidities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Substance use disorders (SUDs), anxiety and depression are common among HIV-positive patients&#xD;
      and lead to poor HIV treatment outcomes and increased mortality. Yet these disorders often go&#xD;
      unrecognized and untreated, despite the availability of effective interventions. To enhance&#xD;
      HIV care, this study examines the impact of self-administered tablet-based screening for SUD&#xD;
      risk, anxiety and depression using validated measures, with results integrated into the&#xD;
      electronic health record and reviewed by behavioral health specialists (BHSs) embedded in&#xD;
      primary care HIV clinics. Based on screening results, BHSs will initiate motivational&#xD;
      interviewing (MI)- and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based clinical interventions. Using&#xD;
      a hybrid study approach, the investigators will evaluate both implementation and&#xD;
      effectiveness of screening and intervention. Specifically, the investigators will employ a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge trial design, with a 12-month intervention phase implemented sequentially in&#xD;
      the 3 largest HIV primary care clinics serving 5000 HIV-positive patients in Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente Northern California (KPNC), with a 12-month usual care period prior to&#xD;
      implementation in each clinic functioning as an observational phase for comparison. This&#xD;
      design, a variation of a cross-over RCT, allows for intervention refinement at each clinic&#xD;
      and provides the opportunity to compare outcomes among patients before and after&#xD;
      implementation. The investigators will evaluate patient-level (e.g., demographics, HIV, SUD,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression severity) and provider-level (e.g., provider attitudes) factors&#xD;
      affecting implementation and effectiveness, and will analyze cost effectiveness. The results&#xD;
      of the study will provide insights regarding the implementation of evidence-based treatments&#xD;
      for SUD, anxiety and depression, such as: 1) How self-administered computerized SUD, anxiety&#xD;
      and depression screening and corresponding behavioral interventions can be effectively and&#xD;
      efficiently implemented in HIV primary care clinics and sustained over time; 2) What patient&#xD;
      and clinic characteristics influence screening and intervention rates; 3) To what extent&#xD;
      implementation of screening and treatment impacts SUD and depression outcomes, as well as HIV&#xD;
      outcomes, including retention in care, viral suppression and Veterans Aging Cohort Study&#xD;
      index score, and 4) What are the barriers, facilitators and costs of implementation. The&#xD;
      study setting is generalizable to other HIV clinics and health systems and will provide key&#xD;
      data regarding the effective delivery of treatment options within primary care settings, and&#xD;
      in coordination with SUD and psychiatry specialty care. Furthermore, the study addresses&#xD;
      NIH-identified high priority HIV research topics since effective treatment of SUDs and/or&#xD;
      depression anxiety would alleviate HIV treatment disparities for these individuals and reduce&#xD;
      SUD-, anxiety and depression-related medical comorbidity and mortality.&#xD;
