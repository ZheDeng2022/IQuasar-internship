  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthetic induced neurotoxicity has received considerable attention in the past&#xD;
      decade from various pre-clinical studies in rodents and non-human primates. Which&#xD;
      demonstrated that exposure to general anesthetic agents for a longer duration can induce&#xD;
      neuronal cell death that can lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuroapoptosis and impairment of neurodevelopmental processes has been postulated as the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism, but the molecular mechanisms was not completely understood. Various&#xD;
      hypothesis has been proposed they are- Antagonistic effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors&#xD;
      and agonistic effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors; mitochondrial perturbations&#xD;
      and activation of reactive oxygen species and dysregulation of intracellular calcium&#xD;
      homeostasis. They trigger neuroapoptosis and cell death through the activation of caspases.3&#xD;
      Caspases, a group of cysteine proteases, plays an important role in regulation and execution&#xD;
      of apoptosis. Caspase-3 is most important since it is activated by many cell death signals&#xD;
      and cleaves a variety of important cellular proteins.4 Various anesthetic agents like&#xD;
      isoflurane, halothane, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and propofol causes neurotoxicity by&#xD;
      activation of caspase-3. Which has been proven from various animal studies western blot&#xD;
      analysis, immunohistochemical analysis and flow cytometric analysis.3, 5-9 Though it is&#xD;
      documented that exposure to general anesthetics causes neurotoxicity during active brain&#xD;
      growth in animals, there is no evidence of such effects in adult humans.10 and it is&#xD;
      difficult to separate the effects of anesthetics from surgical impact and other factors&#xD;
      associated with diseases.11 The patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have&#xD;
      variable degree of neurological insults and it is possible, based on the evidence from animal&#xD;
      models that administration of general anesthetics could add to the neuronal insults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen patients will be included for the study under each intervention (surgery or&#xD;
      endovascular coiling). Total thirty two patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited to the study. The patients will be randomized into four groups to receive Propofol&#xD;
      (Group P), Isoflurane (Group I), Sevoflurane (Group S) or Desflurane (Group D) using a&#xD;
      computer generated algorithm for the maintenance of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery or endovascular coiling will be conducted by an experienced neurosurgeon or&#xD;
      radiologist who will be blinded to the anesthetic agent used for maintenance of anesthesia.&#xD;
      Pre-anesthetic checkup will be conducted prior to the intervention. Patient will be&#xD;
      thoroughly examined and all the investigations will be reviewed. Written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from the patient's next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANESTHESIA PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine non-invasive monitors will be attached to the patients. It will include noninvasive&#xD;
      blood pressure (NIBP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), end&#xD;
      tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), state entropy (SE) and urine output. All patients will be&#xD;
      preloaded with 10-15 ml/kg of normal saline Fentanyl will be administered intravenously in&#xD;
      dose of 2µg/kg prior to induction followed by 0.5-2 µg/kg/hr as infusion. Patients in all 4&#xD;
      groups will be induced with propofol 1 to 2 mg/kg, titrated to loss of verbal response.&#xD;
      Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Lignocaine 1.5mg/kg&#xD;
      will be given 120 seconds prior to laryngoscopy. For beat to beat monitoring of blood&#xD;
      pressure and blood gas analysis an arterial catheter will be placed after induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Patients will be maintained according to the group allocation along with 50/50%&#xD;
      Oxygen/Air. BIS monitoring will be used to maintain comparable depth of anesthesia in all the&#xD;
      groups and will be titrated to keep SE in range of 40 to 60. Vecuronium will be given&#xD;
      intermittently to maintain less than two twitches on neurostimulation. Body temperature will&#xD;
      be maintained using forced air warming blanket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Saline will be used as the intraoperative fluid. PaCO2 will be maintained around 32-36&#xD;
      mmHg. Neuromuscular blockade will be reversed with a combination of neostigmine 50 µg /kg and&#xD;
      glycopyrrolate 10 µg /kg. Subsequently trachea will be extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who cannot be extubated will be shifted to neurosurgical intensive care unit for&#xD;
      elective ventilator support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operatively hemodynamic monitoring, temporary clipping time and any incidence of&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture will be noted. Brain bulge at the time of dural reflection will be noted.&#xD;
      Patient status will be assessed at the end of surgery in terms of extubation and neurological&#xD;
      status i.e. GCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VARIABLES -&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREOPERATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of the patient, day of ictus, day of admission in hospital, day of surgery,&#xD;
      WFNS, Fischer grades and any comorbidities will be noted. Neurological examination including&#xD;
      the GCS and presence or absence of any preoperative neurological deficit will also be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRA OPERATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2) , temperature and end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) will be noted at the time of&#xD;
      induction, intubation, incision, application of head pins, bone flap reflection, Dural&#xD;
      reflection, clipping, Dural closure, skin closure and prior to cessation of anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Patients heart rate and blood pressure will be kept as close to baseline as possible. Any&#xD;
      sustained increase in BP more than 30% of the baseline values will be considered as&#xD;
      intra-operative hypertension. Hypotension will be considered if MAP &lt; 70 mmHg or SBP &lt; 90&#xD;
      mmHg. The management of hypertension or hypotension will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain relaxation scoring will be done following bone flap reflection using four point&#xD;
      scale. The temporary clipping time, intra operative rupture of aneurysm, intra operative&#xD;
      intravenous fluid administration, blood loss, urine output will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL FOR ENZYME STUDY AND ESTIMATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum blood sample will be collected. The&#xD;
      baseline CSF will be collected via an indwelling lumbar subarachnoid catheter placed prior to&#xD;
      intervention as a modality to prevent the complication associated with SAH like vasospasm and&#xD;
      to facilitate the drainage of SAH. A venipuncture will be done and 2 to 3 ml of blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected in plain vial for serum/EDTA for plasma.The second CSF and serum blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected after 1 hours of exposure to anaesthesia. The third sample will be&#xD;
      collected following completion of intervention or after the cessation anesthetic agent,&#xD;
      whichever is earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caspase 3 enzyme level would be estimated using a quantitative ELISA kit with precoated&#xD;
      antigen wells and known standards by a double antibody sandwich technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and storage- Blood samples would be collected in plain vials/vacutainers.&#xD;
      CSF samples would be collected in cryovials. Blood samples would be allowed to clot at room&#xD;
      temperature for 1 hour. The clotted blood in the plain vacutainers would be centrifuged at&#xD;
      2000 rpm for 15 minutes to separate out the serum. Serum would be pipetted off into&#xD;
      cryovials. All samples would be stored at -80˚C immediately till further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caspase 3 enzyme estimation The following steps will be followed for enzymatic evaluation-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ELISA kit stored at 40C will be taken out of refrigerator 20 minutes before&#xD;
           performing the test to equilibrated it to the room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Different concentration of Human-caspase 3 standards with known values and test samples&#xD;
           with unknown values would be added to the coated wells in the pre-coated microplate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biotinylated Human caspase 3 antibody liquid,enzyme conjugate liquid and colour reagent&#xD;
           are prepared 30 minutes before use&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Elisa plates would be washed 3 times by adding 350 µl of wash buffer to the wells and&#xD;
           dried on adsorbent paper towels between washes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Biotinylated Human caspase 3 liquid would be now added to each wel&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The wells would be washed 3 times as described above at step 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Enzyme conjugate liquid would now be added to the individual wells in the microplate&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The wells would be washed 3 times as described above at steps 4 and 6 above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Colour reagent (substrate solution) would be added followed by stop solution&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Optical density would be measured at 450nm using a microplate ELISA reader&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Values of unknown samples would be read off from the standard curve generated by&#xD;
           plotting the optical densities of known standards against their known concentrations.&#xD;
