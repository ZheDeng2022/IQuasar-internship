      Prospective data collection and evaluation of complete data sets will be performed in the&#xD;
      course of routine clinical care of a cohort of consecutive patients (children up to 16 years&#xD;
      old) presenting with an isolated femur shaft fracture. Data will be collected during&#xD;
      follow-up visits at 3 to 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, with additional follow-up visits as&#xD;
      needed or dictated by individual practice. Final follow-up will be at 24 months, unless a&#xD;
      patient requires additional follow-up or another intervention to address an unfavorable&#xD;
      outcome (e.g. malalignment, nonunion, limb length discrepancy) noted at the 24 month&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited evidence about the comparative effectiveness of different treatments for&#xD;
      pediatric femur fractures. The most common method used for isolated femur shaft fractures of&#xD;
      children older than 5 years of age is elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN). It is&#xD;
      thought to be the ideal indication for children up to the age of 10 to 12 and it is the most&#xD;
      commonly employed method of internal fixation in this age group, but other treatments include&#xD;
      external fixation, plating, other forms of flexible or rigid intramedullary nailing and&#xD;
      non-operative options such as spica casts or traction. In children under the age of 5&#xD;
      non-operative methods are believed to work well with few complications. Imperfect alignment&#xD;
      is more acceptable because of the tremendous remodelling potential in young growing children.&#xD;
      Internal fixation is believed to be unnecessary as it is more invasive, with some risk of&#xD;
      complications and likely need for a second surgical procedure to remove it. Biomechanical&#xD;
      properties are different in this age group. Consequently, operative treatment of these&#xD;
      fractures is generally not recommended in children under the age of 3 according to the German&#xD;
      guidelines (www.awmf.org), not under the age of 5 in the American guidelines (www.aaos.org);&#xD;
      and in Great Britain, surgical management in preschool children is restricted to polytrauma&#xD;
      and complex injuries (www.nice.org.uk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these recommendations and the general acceptance of non-operative treatment for&#xD;
      younger children , a survey of clinical practice in Germany revealed that 50% of children&#xD;
      under the age of 3 years are treated with ESIN, because some surgeons believe that patients&#xD;
      seem less comfortable when treated with traction or spica casting and might experience a&#xD;
      higher rate of loss of reduction. Consequently, the use of ESIN for fractures in preschool&#xD;
      children has become more prevalent in the last years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, there is wide variation in the preferred management of femoral shaft fractures in&#xD;
      older children, with little evidence about the comparative effectiveness of different&#xD;
      treatments for pediatric femur fractures. There is an imperative to collect prospective data&#xD;
      to generate higher quality evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this proposed registry is to collect the clinical outcomes (fracture healing &amp;&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes and complications) of the treatment of isolated femur shaft&#xD;
      fractures in children up to skeletal maturity. Additionally, health economic aspects will be&#xD;
      evaluated to give possible recommendations from a health economic perspective.&#xD;
