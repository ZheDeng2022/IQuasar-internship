  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, safety, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      cost of an Accessible Care intervention for engaging people who inject illicit drugs (PWID)&#xD;
      in hepatitis C care. Accessible Care for PWID is low-threshold care provided in programs&#xD;
      designed specifically for PWID where they can comfortably access care without fear of shame&#xD;
      or stigma. Accessible Care will be provided by co-locating a hepatitis treatment provider,&#xD;
      together with a Hepatitis C Care Coordinator (HCCC), on-site at a collaborating needle&#xD;
      exchange program. The proposed study will compare the effectiveness of Accessible Care with&#xD;
      Usual Care (referrals to existing services) in facilitating linkage, engagement, and&#xD;
      retention of PWID in care for hepatitis C, addiction, and HIV prevention. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is sustained virologic response, which constitutes virologic cure. Substance use and HIV and&#xD;
      HCV risk behaviors are secondary outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;Accessible Care&quot; for PWID is low-threshold care provided in the needle exchange programs, where they can comfortably access services without fear of the shame or stigma that often attends them in mainstream institutions.It includes features such as an informal, nonjudgmental atmosphere, availability of walk-in appointments, and a harm reduction framework to help them identify and pursue their own personal health goals. Accessible Care will be provided by co-locating a hepatitis treatment provider, together with a Hepatitis C Care Coordinator, on-site at our collaborating needle exchange program.</description>
