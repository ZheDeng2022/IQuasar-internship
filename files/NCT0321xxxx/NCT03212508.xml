  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous distending airway pressure (CPAP) has gained popularity as a means to provide&#xD;
      non-invasive respiratory support in neonates to reduce ventilator induced lung injury (VILI).&#xD;
      However, maintaining CPAP in preterm infants has been challenging, often related to issues&#xD;
      with nasal interface such as nasal septal injury, problems with keeping the prongs in the&#xD;
      nose and leak around the prongs with are important factors in proving effective CPAP. RAM&#xD;
      cannula was recently approved for providing supplemental oxygen and soon adapted by many&#xD;
      centers to provide CPAP in preterm infants. Concerns have been raised that RAM cannula&#xD;
      interface results in sub-optimal pressure delivery compared to standard nasal prongs.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare efficacy of delivering continuous distending pressure in preterm neonates using&#xD;
      RAM cannula versus the standard prongs (Hudson prongs) by measuring intra-oral pressure. It&#xD;
      is hypothesize that CPAP delivered with RAM cannula is comparable to pressure delivered via&#xD;
      standard nasal interface in routine clinical practice; and the desired CPAP level is often&#xD;
      not achieved in presence of variable leak from mouth irrespective of type of nasal interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the level of CPAP in oral cavity between RAM cannula and Hudson prong nasal&#xD;
      interface in preterm Hypothesis: The intraoral pressure with CPAP will not be different with&#xD;
      use of RAM cannula or Hudson prong nasal interface&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of nasal interface (RAM cannula and Hudson prong) on respiratory&#xD;
      variables Hypothesis: There will be no difference in respiratory variables with CPAP&#xD;
      delivered by RAM cannula compared to Hudson prongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single center prospective study. Inclusion criteria: Any preterm with respiratory&#xD;
      distress requiring CPAP but not mechanical ventilation or NIPPV was eligible for the study.&#xD;
      12 preterm infant more than 48 hours old and stable on bubble CPAP were recruited for the&#xD;
      study Exclusion criteria: Infants with major congenital anomalies, neuromuscular disorders,&#xD;
      upper airway anomalies, critically sick infants&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPHS approval and parental consent was obtained prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each infant was studied for ~1 hour during which the oral pressure was measured while&#xD;
      receiving CPAP with RAM nasal cannula interface and then with Hudson prongs. Blinding of the&#xD;
      intervention (nasal interface) was not feasible because of the visible differences in the two&#xD;
      nasal interfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Intra-oral pressure measured via a differential pressure transducer while infant&#xD;
      in receiving CPAP, and digitized data recorded with each nasal interface ( goal to record at&#xD;
      least 20 sec of stable waveform on each nasal interface). Standard care provided during the&#xD;
      study period and no changes made with CPAP level or flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between set pressure and measured pressure with RAM cannula and Hudson prong&#xD;
      was compared with standard paired student t-test with 95% confidence limits. Difference in&#xD;
      other variables will be similarly compared with t-test. STAT 12 will be used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
