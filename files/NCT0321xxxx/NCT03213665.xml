      This phase II Pediatric MATCH trial studies how well tazemetostat works in treating patients&#xD;
      with brain tumors, solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or histiocytic disorders that have&#xD;
      come back (relapsed) or do not respond to treatment (refractory) and have EZH2, SMARCB1, or&#xD;
      SMARCA4 gene mutations. Tazemetostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking EZH2 and&#xD;
      its relation to some of the pathways needed for cell proliferation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in&#xD;
      pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat with advanced solid tumors (including central&#xD;
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or histiocytic disorders that harbor gain&#xD;
      of function mutations in EZH2, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF complex subunits&#xD;
      SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 at a dose of 520 mg/m^2/dose twice daily for patients without any CNS&#xD;
      involvement or 1200 mg/m^2/dose orally twice daily for patients with CNS involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the progression-free survival in pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat&#xD;
      that harbor gain of function mutations in EZH2, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF&#xD;
      complex subunits SMARCB1 or SMARCA4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of tazemetostat in children with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to tazemetostat and specifically,&#xD;
      whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or fusions will demonstrate&#xD;
      differential response to tazemetostat treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation&#xD;
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
