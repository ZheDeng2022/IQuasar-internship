  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine the effects of the HiBalance program on neuroplastic changes&#xD;
      in people with mild to moderate Parkinson´s disease. The main hypothesis is that highly&#xD;
      challenging exercise will lead to greater gait and balance ability, increased levels of&#xD;
      physical activity and an improved health related quality of life. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that neuroplasticity changes will be seen in corresponding areas of the brain,&#xD;
      neuropsychological changes on cognitive test measures, and that exercise will inhibit the&#xD;
      degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain through the mediation of neurotrophic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting many physiological systems&#xD;
      essential for balance control. New findings suggest that intensive, challenging and&#xD;
      cognitively demanding exercises could induce neuroplasticity in PD. A new balance training&#xD;
      (the HiBalance program) have therefore been developed; emphasizing critical aspects of&#xD;
      balance control through highly challenging and progressive exercises incorporating&#xD;
      dual/multi-tasking (Conradsson et al, 2012). In an RCT, the HiBalance-program was shown to&#xD;
      improve balance, gait and physical activity level in favor for the training group (Conradsson&#xD;
      et al, 2015). In this proposal the investigators will combine physiotherapy, neurology and&#xD;
      neuroimaging to characterise and determine the effects on physical and cognitive symptoms as&#xD;
      well as structural and functional changes and wet biomarkers in the brain after the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through Karolinska University Hospital and via announcements&#xD;
      in relevant forums like for instance the Swedish Parkinson Association. According to earlier&#xD;
      power calculations for detecting effects in balance and gait measures after this particular&#xD;
      intervention, the investigators anticipate 40 to 50 participants in each group to detect&#xD;
      significant changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform both per protocol analysis and intention to treat analysis&#xD;
      using mixed model or repeated measurement ANOVAs if the data is normally distributed.&#xD;

    <description>The HiBalance program is based on scientifically well-established principles of exercise training and postural control as well as current research on training in PD. The training will be conducted as a progressive individually adjusted group program in order to challenge the specific balance disorder of every participant and endorse progression. The intervention will be performed for an hour, 2 times/week in groups of six to eight participants for a total of 10 weeks and one home training session on their own.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive a group treatment (2 times/w for 10 w + 1 home training session) consisting of speech and communication therapy performed by a speech therapist. This intervention will be performed in a sitting position. The speech and communication treatment will aim at increasing vocal loudness and improving articulatory precision. Level of difficulty is gradually increased by progressing from using loud voice and clear speech in short and automatized utterances, to using the same technique in more complex sentences and situations. The group format is used to practice techniques in communicative situations and also to introduce increasing level of multitasking by combining speech training with cognitively more challenging tasks in the group training.</description>
