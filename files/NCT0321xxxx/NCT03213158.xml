      The purpose of this research study is to find out how well ixazomib (the study drug) works to&#xD;
      desensitize highly sensitized kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot exploratory, proof of concept, open-label, single-center phase II&#xD;
      investigator initiated clinical trial entitled IXAzomib for DESensitization (IXADES). The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is (1) to examine the safety and efficacy of ixazomib for&#xD;
      desensitization of highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates and (2) to conduct&#xD;
      mechanistic studies to address the role of HLA and non-HLA antibodies, T and B cell&#xD;
      phenotypes, and BAFF/APRIL in immune monitoring of sensitized kidney transplant candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To determine the safety and efficacy of ixazomib as a desensitization&#xD;
      strategy. There is currently no effective desensitization strategy for highly sensitized&#xD;
      patients defined as calculated Panel of Reactive Antibodies (cPRA) ≥ 80%. For this study, 10&#xD;
      highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates on the waitlist for more than 24 months will&#xD;
      receive ixazomib 3 mg (and dexamethasone 20 mg) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 cycle for 12&#xD;
      months. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety (distal neuropathy, thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal symptoms) and efficacy (decline in cPRA &gt; 20%) of ixazomib. The&#xD;
      secondary efficacy endpoint is transplantation rate within 12 months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Identify immune indices which predict the course of disease and/or response&#xD;
      to treatment in highly sensitized patients. Mechanistic studies will use bone marrow and&#xD;
      blood obtained from subjects in Aim 1 to determine the effect of treatment on immune&#xD;
      regulation and reconstitution after therapy. Since the bone marrow microenvironment produces&#xD;
      BAFF/APRIL and supports plasma cell maturation,the effect of therapy on the generation of&#xD;
      BAFF/APRIL will be determined by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and the survival of bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived plasma cells after desensitization. Specifically it's proposed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify if bone marrow plasma cells, IgG subsets, and levels including free light&#xD;
           chains, and circulating BAFF/APRIL predict outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if treatment is effective in downregulating circulating BAFF/APRIL and&#xD;
           anti-HLA, endothelin-1 type A receptor (ETAR), angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), and&#xD;
           complement fixing C1q antibodies.&#xD;
