  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The birth of a child is a major life event that can be filled with excitement, anticipation&#xD;
      and joy. However, the transition and adaptation to new demands, roles, responsibilities, and&#xD;
      changes in relationships can be stressful, especially for new mothers. In addition, new&#xD;
      mothers typically encounter physiological changes and struggle with concerns about weight&#xD;
      gain, body image, sexuality, and other physical difficulties such as fatigue. These problems&#xD;
      may generate or exacerbate stress, lead to an actual or perceived crisis and psychological&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress, defined as anxiety, depression, and insomnia, in this study, often&#xD;
      increases during the postpartum period and can negatively affect maternal mental health&#xD;
      status, maternal and family relationships, and infant-child health. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effects of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) on anxiety, insomnia,&#xD;
      depression, and maternal functioning in first time new mothers following childbirth.&#xD;

      The birth of a child is a major life event that can be filled with excitement, anticipation&#xD;
      and joy. However, the transition and adaptation to new demands, roles, responsibilities, and&#xD;
      changes in relationships can be stressful, especially for first-time mothers. In addition,&#xD;
      new mothers typically encounter physiological changes and struggle with concerns about weight&#xD;
      gain, body image, sexuality, and other physical difficulties such as fatigue. These problems&#xD;
      may generate or exacerbate stress, lead to an actual or perceived crisis and psychological&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress, defined as depression, anxiety and insomnia, in this study, often&#xD;
      increases during the postpartum period and can negatively affect maternal mental health&#xD;
      status, maternal and family functioning, and infant-child outcomes. These conditions commonly&#xD;
      present as co-morbidities, but are often unrecognized in clinical practice or under-treated&#xD;
      as co-morbidities in new mothers. This unrecognized cluster of co-morbidities may lead to&#xD;
      psychological distress and subsequently poor outcomes for mothers, their infants and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment recommendations for depression, anxiety and insomnia are primarily&#xD;
      pharmaceutical or psychotherapy, both of which have limitations related to cost, time&#xD;
      involved and ineffectiveness for some women. Consequently, there is a need to examine other&#xD;
      treatment approaches including complementary modalities, such as cranial electrotherapy&#xD;
      stimulation (CES), particularly in light of current evidence that shows the efficacy of early&#xD;
      detection, intervention and treatment for pregnant and postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of CES on anxiety in new&#xD;
      mothers following childbirth. The secondary objectives are to: (1) determine the effects of&#xD;
      CES on depression and insomnia; (2) explore the effect of CES on maternal functioning in new&#xD;
      mothers following childbirth, and (3) to examine if items 1 &amp; 2 on the 14 item Hamilton&#xD;
      Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A14) perform well as a screening test for anxiety. Please see the&#xD;
      enclosed Instrument Description document for detailed information related to this scale.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The blocked randomization method will be used to assign participants to active and sham groups. Participants will be assigned to CES treatment or sham CES using a 1:1 ratio. Electromedical Products International, Inc. (EPI) will randomize the assignment of appropriate devices to active or sham groups by using a random list of computer generated numbers (1 for active and 2 for sham) in randomly selected block sizes. The PI and participants are blinded to which participants have Alpha-Stim® CES active or sham devices until data analysis is complete. After the completion of data analysis, blinding will be broken.</masking_description>

          <title>Active Comparator</title>
          <description>About the size of a smart phone, the Alpha-Stim® AID CES device delivers a mild electrical current (100-500 µA) to the brain via ear clips electrodes. The active intervention is one daily 60 minutes Alpha-Stim® CES treatment using ear clip electrodes for 6 weeks at 0.5 Hz. 50% duty cycle with a fixed current of 100 µA (subsensory level).&#xD;
Alpha-Stim AID CES (Active Comparator): The Alpha-Stim® AID CES device delivers a mild electrical current (100-500 µA) to the brain via ear clips electrodes. The treatment regimen is one daily 60 minutes Alpha-Stim® CES treatment using ear clip electrodes for 6 weeks at 0.5 Hz. 50% duty cycle with a fixed current of 100 µA (subsensory level).</description>

          <description>The Alpha-Stim® AID CES sham device is identical in appearance to the active device but is inactive and does not emit electrical current to the brain via ear clip electrodes. The sham intervention is one daily 60 minutes Alpha-Stim® CES treatment using ear clip electrodes for 6 weeks.&#xD;
