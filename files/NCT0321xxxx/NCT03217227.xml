  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is a condition of recurring chest pain or discomfort that occurs&#xD;
      when a part of the heart is not receiving sufficient blood flow. It is a major public health&#xD;
      concern internationally and in Singapore, the leading cause of death from cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the ability to assess heart structures,&#xD;
      scarring or lack of blood supply to the heart muscle with great accuracy and without any&#xD;
      radiation involved. A CMR-compatible cycle ergometer can offer a safe and low cost stress&#xD;
      equipment to assess heart function and motion abnormalities, and restrictions of the blood&#xD;
      supply to the heart tissues due to partial or complete blockages of the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop an exercise-CMR stress protocol by testing its feasibility and robustness in&#xD;
           assessing changes in cardiac volumes and function due to physical exertion in healthy&#xD;
           individuals and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the accuracy of the multiparametric stress-CMR as a diagnostic tool for&#xD;
           ischemic-causing coronary artery disease (CAD) with coronary fractional flow reserve&#xD;
           (FFR) as a reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to measure the overall economic impact of ischaemic heart disease by estimating the&#xD;
           direct and indirect medical costs for each participant. The current sample costs will be&#xD;
           extrapolated to estimate the annual costs of treating and managing ischaemic heart&#xD;
           disease in the local population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to evaluate the effects of coronary microvascular dysfunction on coronary flow and&#xD;
           regulation, physiological response and cardiac sympathetic signaling in patients with&#xD;
           chest pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suspected ischemic heart disease (IHD) or coronary artery disease (CAD) is commonly diagnosed&#xD;
      by stress testing where patients undergo exercise tests in order to make their hearts work&#xD;
      hard and beat fast to require more blood and oxygen. Pharmacological-induced stress is&#xD;
      employed in the case where the patient is unable to exercise. Since plaque-narrowed arteries&#xD;
      cannot supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the heart's needs, the stress test can show&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of IHD. Some of the symptoms include abnormal changes in the heart rate or&#xD;
      blood pressure, shortness of breath, chest pain, or abnormal changes in the heart's rhythm&#xD;
      and electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the stress tests, images of the heart are taken while the patient is exercising&#xD;
      and while the patient is at rest. The imaging stress tests will show how well the blood flows&#xD;
      in and out of the heart. An example would be a stress echocardiogram where an ultrasound is&#xD;
      performed on the chest to produce video images of the heart to. IHD is detected through&#xD;
      development of new regional wall motion abnormalities or worsening of preexisting regional&#xD;
      wall motions. The patient will be required to exercise on a treadmill before lying on the&#xD;
      examination bed for the ultrasound scan. This however, would require the patient to move from&#xD;
      the treadmill to the bed, which would result in some time delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another diagnostic test commonly used to diagnose IHD would be a nuclear scan known as&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion imaging where a radioactive isotope acting as a tracer is injected into&#xD;
      the bloodstream. During exercise, the tracer is monitored while it flows through the heart&#xD;
      and lungs to allow detection for any blood-flow problems. However, this test would involve&#xD;
      ionizing radiation due to the radioactive isotopic tracer used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed test to view blood flow through the heart, would be through a cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization or an angiogram where a thin and flexible tube known as a catheter is&#xD;
      threaded through an artery, usually in the leg, to the heart arteries. An invisible dye is&#xD;
      injected through the catheter and special x-rays will be taken while the dye flows through&#xD;
      the coronary arteries, allowing the doctor to study the blood flow through the heart and&#xD;
      blood vessels. Due to the nature of the catheterization with the insertion of the tube, it&#xD;
      makes the procedure invasive and hence involving risks although they are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is able to accurately and non-radiatively assess the&#xD;
      heart structure, any scarring or lack of blood supply to the heart muscle. A CMR-compatible&#xD;
      cycle ergometer offers a one-stop diagnostic test that is non-radiative and non-invasive.&#xD;
      Hence, our investigators aim to develop a protocol that does not require any invasive&#xD;
      procedure by assessing its accuracy and develop reference ranges in healthy individuals.&#xD;

    <description>It is a procedure to diagnose and treat cardiovascular diseases by inserting a long and thin tube known as a catheter into the artery or vein in the neck, groin or arm and threaded through the blood vessels to the heart.&#xD;
A coronary angiogram is also performed during the procedure where an invisible contrast dye (only visible in the X-rays) is injected through the catheter and X-ray images scanned will show the flow of the dye through the heart arteries to determine any blockages in the arteries.&#xD;
In the case where there is severe narrowings, fractional flow reserve (FFR) may be performed to measure the pressure in the coronary arteries.&#xD;
If there is no significant narrowing lesions, the interventionist may perform additional flow resistance measurements of the small vessels to further investigate the cause of angina</description>
