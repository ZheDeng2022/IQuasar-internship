  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A panel of highly sensitive circulating biomarkers for acute liver injury have been&#xD;
      identified and demonstrated to identify liver injury on first presentation to hospital before&#xD;
      standard tests are elevated in patients with paracetamol overdose. The investigators wish to&#xD;
      test these biomarkers in patients with active and latent tuberculosis to see if they can be&#xD;
      used to stratify patients undertaking anti-tuberculosis drug therapy. Anti-tuberculosis drug&#xD;
      induced liver injury is the most frequent side-effect of anti-tuberculosis therapy, affecting&#xD;
      2-5% of tuberculosis patients seen at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh and hindering their&#xD;
      effective treatment. Patients will be recruited from the TB out-patient clinic at the Royal&#xD;
      Infirmary Edinburgh. Blood samples will be taken every time the patient visits the clinic and&#xD;
      also retrieved from the biochemistry lab. The biomarkers in the blood samples will be&#xD;
      analysed to determine if they rise in patients who develop liver injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To improve patient stratification, the investigators have developed a panel of novel&#xD;
      circulating liver specific and mechanistic biomarkers that report early acute liver injury.&#xD;
      Such biomarkers are needed as current early biomarkers of liver injury lack sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity. The panel of biomarkers either have enhanced liver specificity or provide&#xD;
      mechanistic insights. Currently, antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is the&#xD;
      most frequent side-effect of anti-tuberculosis therapy and this hinders the effective&#xD;
      treatment of TB, as it means that treatment regimens are not completed. At present, the risk&#xD;
      of ATDILI means that monitoring of liver function is required, with levels of ALT measured&#xD;
      monthly. If levels of ALT rise to 2-5x the upper limit of normal levels (ULN) and the patient&#xD;
      is unwell the frequency of monitoring is increased to biweekly monitoring. Antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      is only changed if levels of ALT remain greater than 3xULN, the patient continues to display&#xD;
      symptoms and there is a positive causality assessment that the anti-tuberculosis drugs are&#xD;
      causing ATDILI. This project will recruit patients taking antituberculosis drugs and&#xD;
      determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of the biomarker panel, in relation to liver&#xD;
      injury as a result of anti-tuberculosis therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury defined as ALT elevation more than three times the ULN in the presence of hepatitis symptoms and/or jaundice, or five times the ULN in the absence of symptoms.&#xD;
This is a 'proof of concept' study to determine whether a panel of biomarkers are elevated in tuberculosis patients who develop anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury.</description>
