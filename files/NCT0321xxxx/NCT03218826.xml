  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 when&#xD;
      given together with docetaxel in treating patients with solid tumors with PTEN or PIK3CB&#xD;
      mutations that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 and&#xD;
      docetaxel may work better in treating patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 (AZD8186) when administered in combination with docetaxel in&#xD;
      patients with PTEN or PIK3CB mutated advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of AZD8186 when administered in combination with&#xD;
      docetaxel in patients with PTEN or PIK3CB mutated advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. Ia. To assess the objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      of AZD8186 when administered in combination with docetaxel in patients with PTEN or PIK3CB&#xD;
      mutated advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. To assess the clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks of AZD8186 when administered in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel in patients with PTEN or PIK3CB mutated advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate a drug-drug interaction between docetaxel and AZD8186 and correlate drug&#xD;
      exposure with pharmacodynamics response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine the pattern of co-mutated genes in PTEN or PIK3CB mutated tumors and their&#xD;
      association with treatment response or resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to PI3Kbeta inhibition. III.&#xD;
      Evaluation of protein expression of the PTEN gene and its association with treatment response&#xD;
      or resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Examine isoform-specific AKT inhibition and other downstream target modulation from&#xD;
      PI3Kbeta inhibition with AZD8186.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and PI3Kbeta inhibitor&#xD;
      AZD8186 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5 days each week. Cycles repeat every 21 days until&#xD;
      April 30, 2022 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will examine the pattern of co-mutated genes in PTEN or PIK3CB mutated tumors and their association with treatment response or resistance. Associations of pre-treatment pattern of co-mutated genes (grouped by pathway for e.g. mutations affecting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway - binary covariate) and response (CR/PR at 6 weeks; binary covariate defining responders and non responders) will be assessed. These associations will be performed using non parametric methods such as the Mann Whitney U test due to the small targeted sample size of this proposed study.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanisms of acquired resistance to PI3Kbeta inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will describe possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to PI3Kbeta inhibition. Sequencing data from pre- and post-treatment specimens of patients that initially responded to PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 will be compared to identify newly acquired mutations or deoxyribonucleic acid copy number alterations. Given that the number of patients and recurrence rate of specific events will be low, this analyses will be primarily descriptive with graphical representation in order to uncover any trends such as a pathway specific clustering of resistance mutations or second-site mutations or focal amplifications, that might inform potential mechanisms of acquired resistance. Results will be used to generate future hypotheses that will be tested in larger patient samples.</description>

Will summarize the expression pattern of PTEN by immunohistochemistry at baseline (archival/pre-treatment specimen) and post-progression on therapy to provide a preliminary assessment on the predictive capacity of this marker in determining responders versus non-responders.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known, untreated or unstable brain metastases should be excluded from&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors and/or&#xD;
             strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible; because the lists of these&#xD;
             agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated medical reference; as part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing bleeding or condition associated with increased risk of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD8186 is a PI3K inhibitor with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with AZD8186, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with AZD8186; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive patients must have:&#xD;

                  include strong inhibitors and strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A4&#xD;
