      The aim of such study is to compare three different school-based (in nurseries, kindergartens&#xD;
      and primary schools) interventions aimed at teaching to families how to prevent food choking&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The topic of food choking primary and secondary prevention is placed in a more general topic&#xD;
      regarding food safety, including education on food labeling and on food waste prevention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The CHOP has been designed as a community intervention trial that compares three different&#xD;
      school-based intervention strategies aimed at teaching to families how to prevent food&#xD;
      choking injuries in children, together with the basics of food safety. The choice of&#xD;
      employing such study design is motivated by the facts that community intervention trials&#xD;
      allow to reach as many people as possible regardless their risk of experiencing the outcome&#xD;
      of interest and to inform policy-makers on the effectiveness of an intervention on a&#xD;
      community basis instead of an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight educational facilities (nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools) equally&#xD;
      distributed between North, Centre, South, and major Islands of Italy will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational facilities will be stratified so that each stratum will include one educational&#xD;
      facility from each educational stage (stratum=1 nursery, 1 kindergarten, 1 primary school).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the effectiveness of each intervention strategy will be performed through a&#xD;
      structured telephonic interview one month after the delivery of the intervention. I&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools, to be enrolled, must provide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  availability of at least 45 families (one member from each family will be involved in&#xD;
           the study);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  availability of a room and of technological system (monitor, sound system) allowing the&#xD;
           performance of the educational intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  availability of administrative support;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  approval of the inclusion in the study by school's competent bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members (one from each family) must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aged &gt;18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  parent of children attending the school or person exercising the parental authority on&#xD;
           children attending the school;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  without physical impairments not allowing the performance of practical activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  willing to participate at all stages of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  signed informed consent.&#xD;
