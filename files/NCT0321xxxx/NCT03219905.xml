  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kinesio-taping (KT) has recently gained so much popularity and a growing number of physicians&#xD;
      started using it to alleviate musculoskeletal symptoms. It was originally developed by Kenzo&#xD;
      Kase in 1976. The effects of KT on ankle proprioception and stability have been investigated&#xD;
      in previous studies. However, these studies are limited and the current data is conflicting.&#xD;
      Repeated application of KT in a patient with chronic ankle instability has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in improving balance. In basketball players with chronic ankle sprain, KT did not&#xD;
      improve or inhibit balance. Application of KT did not cause a significant change in balance&#xD;
      of healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate and short-term&#xD;
      effects of KT on balance of healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty male healthy volunteers (between 18-40 ages) were screened for eligibility by physical&#xD;
      examination and history. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants before&#xD;
      enrollment. The research proposal was reviewed and approved by the Faculty Ethics&#xD;
      Committee(No: 05-213-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized sham controlled, double-blind pilot clinical trial. The block&#xD;
      randomization method with a block size of 4 was used in order to allocate the subjects&#xD;
      equally into two groups; Kinesiotaping (KT) and sham (control).To conceal the randomization&#xD;
      sequence an independent researcher (HG) who is unaware of the baseline data carried out the&#xD;
      procedure using a computer software. The researcher (MO) who was blinded to the&#xD;
      allocationprocedure did the balance testing of all subjects, before (t0), immediately after&#xD;
      (t1) and 24 hours after the application of KT (T2). The subjects were also blinded to the&#xD;
      type of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard 2-inch (5-cm) Kinesio® Tex (Kinesio Holding Corporation, Albuquerque, NM) Tape was&#xD;
      used for all applications in both groups. A certified KT practitioner (BST) did the all&#xD;
      taping procedures. KT was applied bilaterally to the ankle joints. To ensure blinding of the&#xD;
      assessor (MÖ), taping procedure was done in a separate room and subjects wore their socks&#xD;
      after the application. The tape remained in place for 24 hours duration and subjects were&#xD;
      instructed to participate in their normal daily activities, except shower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group received a standardized therapeutic Kinesio Tape application. Three&#xD;
      &quot;I&quot; strips were applied to the both ankle joints for joint stability with subject's ankle at&#xD;
      90 degrees. KT was applied according to the procedures recommended by the website of&#xD;
      http://www.kttapeeurope.com/How-to-tape-Ankle-Stability (last accessed on July 7th, 2017).&#xD;
      First strip was anchored 5 cm above the ankle. Then tape was applied down the outer ankle,&#xD;
      across the bottom of the heel, and up the inner side of the ankle. The last 5cm of tape was&#xD;
      laid without stretch. Second strip was anchored along the instep of the foot. Then tape was&#xD;
      laid around the back of the heel and across the arch with 50% stretch. The last part of tape&#xD;
      was laid down without stretch on inside of foot. Third strip was anchored same style along&#xD;
      the outside of the foot. The tape was laid the around the back of the heel and across the&#xD;
      arch with 50% stretch. The last 5 cm of the tape was laid down without stretch on insideof&#xD;
      foot. The control group received a sham Kinesio Tape application. Ankle position was hold at&#xD;
      minimally plantar flexion during taping. A&quot;I&quot; strip was placed from the anterior midfoot, not&#xD;
      stretched and attached to the midline of anterior leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's height and weight were recorded and body mass index (BMI) was calculated.&#xD;
      Balance measurements were made with a stabilometer, BiodexTM Balance System. A dynamic&#xD;
      postural stability test was performed in a double-leg standing position with eyes open. Each&#xD;
      test included three trials that lasted 20 seconds with a 10-second rest period between them.&#xD;
      A mean score was calculated from three trials. Subjects were given a practice trial lasting&#xD;
      20 sec. to familiarize with the test. During the dynamic postural stability test three&#xD;
      indices were calculated; (1) anteroposterior stability index (APSI), (2) mediolateral&#xD;
      stability index (MLSI), (3) overall stability index (OSI). The OSI indicates the total&#xD;
      variation in plate deviation (sway) from the horizontal plane. The APSI and MLSI indicate the&#xD;
      deviation of the plate (sway) from the horizontal position in the sagittal and frontal&#xD;
      planes, respectively. Since the values obtained during measurements indicate the amount of&#xD;
      sway from the horizontal position, lower scores show better balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric tests have been used due to the small sample size and skewed data&#xD;
      distribution. The baseline demographic characteristics of the patients in each group were&#xD;
      compared by Mann Whitney U test. The two-way mixed ANOVA was used to compare the mean&#xD;
      differences between independent groups over time and to understand if there is an interaction&#xD;
      between time and group factors.&#xD;
