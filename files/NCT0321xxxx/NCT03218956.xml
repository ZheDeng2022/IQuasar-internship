  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that a breast-feeding women need more protein in their diet compared&#xD;
      to non-lactating women, but how much additional protein is needed remains unclear. There is&#xD;
      reason to believe that the current Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) recommendations for&#xD;
      breast-feeding women are too low. To gain better understanding, we plan to study healthy&#xD;
      breast-feeding women 20 - 45 yrs, between 3 - 5 months lactation and 6 - 8 months lactation.&#xD;
      We will use the indicator amino acid oxidation technique (IAAO), which is a modern, quick and&#xD;
      safe research method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the dietary protein intake requirement in healthy lactating women during the&#xD;
      exclusive breast-fed period (3 - 5 months lactation) and during weaning (6 - 8 months&#xD;
      lactation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent stable isotope-based research using the IAAO technique indicate that current protein&#xD;
      intake recommendations are underestimated in adults by ~40 %, in school aged children ~75 %&#xD;
      and pregnant women during early and late gestation by ~39 % and ~73 %, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we hypothesize that that protein requirements will be increased during both phases&#xD;
      of lactation above that of the current recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO advocates that all newborn infants are exclusively breast-fed for the first 6 months&#xD;
      of life, followed by a period of weaning, with appropriate complementary feeds, which is&#xD;
      recommended to continue until the child's second birthday. The period of lactation from the&#xD;
      mother's perspective of up to 2 years for each child, represents a considerable period of&#xD;
      adult life. Adequate protein intake during lactation is important - if a woman's dietary&#xD;
      intake of protein is inadequate, her own lean mass will be depleted to support the growth of&#xD;
      the infant. Currently, dietary protein intake recommendations are based on nitrogen balance&#xD;
      studies conducted in men and recommendations for breast-feeding women are extrapolated from&#xD;
      these studies, and there is little breast-feeding specific data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the protein requirements during lactation and examine whether protein needs are&#xD;
      significantly altered during exclusive breastfeeding (~3 - 5 mo post parturition) and partial&#xD;
      breast feeding (~6 - 8 mo post parturition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 10 women will be recruited. Each mother will participate in up to 8 study days,&#xD;
      4 during the exclusively breast-fed period and 4 during the partial breast-fed period, for a&#xD;
      total of 40 data points (study days) during each lactation period. We hope to retain the same&#xD;
      women for all 8 study days to minimize data variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will meet us for a preliminary assessment where we will evaluate their&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in the study. The preliminary assessment will take approximately 1&#xD;
      hour during which we will examine body composition (Bioelectrical impedance, skin-fold&#xD;
      measurements, height and weight), resting energy expenditure (by indirect calorimetry) and&#xD;
      medical history (questionnaire). We will collect a 3 day food diary, to determine usual food&#xD;
      intake and food preferences. Based on the 3 day food record we will prescribe a standardized&#xD;
      diet two days prior to the study day to ensure protein intake of 1.5 g/kg/day and 1.7 x&#xD;
      resting energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each study day, the participants will randomly receive 1 of 40 test protein intakes.&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in one study day at approximately 14, 16, 18, 20 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum and 24, 28, 30 and 32 weeks postpartum, respectively, for a total of up to 8 study&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test protein intakes will be administered in an experimental diet. The study day diets&#xD;
      will consist of 8 isocaloric and isonitrogenic meals provided hourly, each meal presenting&#xD;
      1/12 of the daily energy requirement. Study day diet is composed of a crystalline amino acid&#xD;
      mixture based on the composition of egg-protein, flavored with orange Tang, orange Kool-aid&#xD;
      crystals and corn oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stable isotope tracer will be added to the 5th - 8th meal. We will measure the rate of&#xD;
      oxidation of this tracer expired in breath (F13CO2), and flux of this tracer by its&#xD;
      enrichment in urine.&#xD;
