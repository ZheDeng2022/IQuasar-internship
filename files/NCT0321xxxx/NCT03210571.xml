  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test a new medical device, called the eyeWatch, used in filtering surgery&#xD;
      for the treatment of glaucoma. This medical device has the following property: it allows&#xD;
      better control of intraocular pressure in the initial postoperative phase by adjusting&#xD;
      aqueous flow going through the device. The target criteria for the study are defined as:&#xD;
      keeping intraocular pressure in target range; reducing the number of anti-glaucoma drugs;&#xD;
      evaluating the number and type of postoperative complications. So far, this device has been&#xD;
      already tested on 20 patients in Switzerland.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient shall suffer from primary open angle glaucoma, pseudo-exfoliative glaucoma, or&#xD;
             refractory POAG or PEXG after previous failed filtering surgery, in the study eye.&#xD;
             Diagnosis is based on glaucomatous optic neuropathy, Shaffer angle greater than 2 as&#xD;
             seen on gonioscopy, and visual field defect attributed to glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eye to be treated shall be phakic or pseudophakic with no other active ocular disease&#xD;
             or disorder except for incipiens cataract. Prior ophthalmic surgery in the study eye&#xD;
             shall have been performed more than 3 months before enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient condition is indicated for primary and secondary filtration surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of elevated intraocular pressure defined as an intraocular corrected pressure&#xD;
             (IOP) &gt; 20 mmHg in the study eye, under maximally tolerated medications. The IOP level&#xD;
             shall be obtained on 2 consecutive measurements (not taken on the same day) prior to&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Optic neuropathy is exclusively attributed to glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient agreed to sign the written inform consent prior to entering into the&#xD;
             investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able and willing to complete post-operative follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of neovascular glaucoma, congenital glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous intraocular surgery in the study eye referring to but not limited&#xD;
             to extraocular muscles (strabismus), corneal transplant, retinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proliferative or severe non-proliferative retinopathy in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital anomaly of the anterior chamber angle in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Optic neuropathy other than glaucoma in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with retinal vein occlusion in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with retinal artery occlusion in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with corneal opacifications, endotheliopathy, or irregularities that may&#xD;
             interfere with the optic nerve evaluation or the IOP measurements in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a history of severe eye trauma in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with ocular malformations such as microphthalmia in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with concurrent inflammatory/infective eye disorder in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with severe systemic disease or disabling conditions such as chronic renal&#xD;
             failure, post organ transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient participating in another clinical trial or having participated in another&#xD;
             clinical trial less than 3 months prior to entering into the investigation.&#xD;

             clinical investigation (e.g. mentally ill person, mentally handicapped person)&#xD;
