      This study is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, sequential group, dose-escalation&#xD;
      study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      ascending doses of AZD5991 in subjects with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is monotherapy dose escalation. Closed November 2020 Part 2 of the study&#xD;
      is monotherapy expansion groups for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL),&#xD;
      AML/ myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and multiple myeloma (MM). Closed November 2020 Part 3&#xD;
      is a sequential, dose-escalation study of the combination of AZD5991 and venetoclax in&#xD;
