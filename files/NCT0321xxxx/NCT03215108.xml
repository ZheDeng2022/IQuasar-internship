  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this animal study is determining the technical feasibility of the novel&#xD;
      flower-type covered self-expandable metal stent (F-CSEMS) and investigating whether the novel&#xD;
      flower-type covered self-expandable metal stent (F-CSEMS) could prevent cholecystitis and&#xD;
      pancreatitis, comparing with conventional covered self-expandable metal stent (C-CSEMS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Covered self-expandable metal stent (C-CSEMS) has the risk of obstruction of the cystic duct,&#xD;
      and the main and branch pancreatic ducts due to strong radial force and covering material,&#xD;
      which results in cholecystitis and pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A flower-type covered self-expandable metal stent (F-CSEMS) having a five-petal-shaped design&#xD;
      with side grooves was constructed to prevent the obstruction of the cystic duct orifice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated the value of the F-CSEMS in protection for cholecystitis and&#xD;
      pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll patients with distal MBO (Malignant Biliary Obstruction) who&#xD;
      received placement at the Samsung Medical Center. Transpapillary flower-type covered&#xD;
      self-expandable metal stent (F-CSEMS) placements will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of MBO will be based on imaging and/or pathological findings. Malignancy was&#xD;
      proved by histopathological confirmation obtained by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided&#xD;
      fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), bile duct biopsy (cytology), pancreatic duct cytology, or&#xD;
      liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the frequency of pancreatitis and cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will evaluate various parameters to clarify the predictive&#xD;
      factors of pancreatitis and cholecystitis. The following 10 variables will be evaluated in&#xD;
      pancreatitis by univariate analysis: [1] sex, [2] age, [3] primary disease, [4] Covered type&#xD;
      (partially or fully), [5] SEMS with high AF, [6] F-CSEMS with high RF, [7] EST before&#xD;
      F-CSEMS, [8] previous biliary stent, [9] contrast injection into the pancreatic duct&#xD;
      (pancreatogram), and [10] the position of the distal stent edge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following 11 variables will be evaluated in cholecystitis by univariate analysis: [1]&#xD;
      sex, [2] age, [3] regions of stricture, [4] F-CSEMS with high AF AF (axial force), [5]&#xD;
      F-CSEMS with high RF, [6] previous biliary stent, [7] gallbladder stone, [8] contrast&#xD;
      injection into the gallbladder (GB injection), [9] involvement to the orifice of the cystic&#xD;
      duct (OCD), [10] position of distal stent edge, and [11] cystic duct occlusion by F-CSEMS.&#xD;
