  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. In patients with recent&#xD;
      stroke, the 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography-computed tomography highlights&#xD;
      high-risk culprit carotid plaque and is more discriminatory than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.&#xD;
      Using hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging investigators propose to&#xD;
      build upon these findings by prospectively assessing 18F-fluoride uptake in a broad range of&#xD;
      patients with acute transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke. Investigators will&#xD;
      specifically examine the association of 18F-fluoride uptake with multiparametric magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging assessments of atherosclerotic plaque, especially the role of thrombus and&#xD;
      lipid. Finally, using transcranial Doppler and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain&#xD;
      imaging, an assessment of the functional consequences of 18F-fluoride-positive&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque will be performed. If successful, this technique has a number of&#xD;
      valuable translational applications including the better selection of patients for carotid&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability to identify the culprit carotid plaque represents a key goal in carotid artery&#xD;
      imaging. Although an array of non-invasive imaging techniques can detect a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      complementary high-risk characteristics, no single modality can reliably identify vulnerable&#xD;
      plaques associated with future stroke development. Substantial histological data suggests&#xD;
      that specific plaque components identify patients at high-risk for future ipsilateral stroke&#xD;
      and cardiovascular events. This implies that investigators need to look beyond the&#xD;
      traditional paradigm where the basis for carotid endarterectomy were formulated by an&#xD;
      invasive imaging modality that provided no information on the arterial wall composition.&#xD;
      Alternative imaging strategies are therefore required targeting not only in vivo carotid&#xD;
      morphology but also plaque biology and disease activity. This is fundamental to optimal&#xD;
      risk-stratification and appropriate selection of patients for high-risk vascular&#xD;
      intervention. One new approach is to use non-invasive molecular imaging targeted at plaque&#xD;
      biology using hybrid systems such as positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;

      At the time of carotid endarterectomy, which is an established surgical intervention aimed at&#xD;
      reducing the future risk of stroke in symptomatic patients, tissue will be collected, and&#xD;
      lesion integrity and geometry will be preserved as much as possible. Specimens will be&#xD;
      photographed in detail to permit subsequent assessment by independent and blinded reviewers.&#xD;
      The excised tissue will be aligned and labelled to permit orientation in the carotid artery&#xD;
      axis before undertaking 7.4 T magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, carotid plaque&#xD;
      will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cellular content, macrophage infiltration, apoptosis,&#xD;
      and calcification-associated molecules within the plaques will be assessed by RNA analysis,&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using a variety of validated markers.&#xD;

        Patients with evidence of an acute stroke, transient ischaemic attack or amaurosis fugax&#xD;
        will be recruited as early as possible, but within 14 days of symptom onset. All patients&#xD;
        will undergo careful clinical evaluation including carotid Doppler ultrasound assessment&#xD;
        and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. This cohort will be identified at the point&#xD;
        they are referred to a vascular surgeon at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.&#xD;
