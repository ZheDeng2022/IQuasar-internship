      STUDY RATIONALE: Patients with hormone receptor (HR)+, HER2- node-negative breast cancers&#xD;
      generally undergo surgical resection upfront, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, if needed,&#xD;
      in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Because endocrine therapy is primarily delivered&#xD;
      in the postoperative setting, the ability to assess the tumor response to this treatment&#xD;
      modality is lost and very difficult to assess. This study offers the unique opportunity to&#xD;
      assess the responsiveness of breast tumors to endocrine therapy while the tumors are still in&#xD;
      vivo by treating patients with endocrine therapy before surgery and assessing molecular&#xD;
      changes with treatment. By comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of molecular markers in&#xD;
      individual tumors, the team expects to identify predictors of responsiveness to existing&#xD;
      agents and identify new candidate therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine the frequency of increased HER&#xD;
      family of receptor tyrosine kinases protein expression in tumors, following treatment with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and their correlation with Ki-67 tumor responses. The team will&#xD;
      measure cancer cell protein levels of growth factor receptors of the human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (HER) family before and after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The data will be&#xD;
      used to inform a future randomized trial of combined endocrine and the most promising&#xD;
      anti-HER targeted therapy.&#xD;

    <description>ImmunoHistoChemistry (IHC) will be used. The IHC test gives a score of 0 to 3+ that measures the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the surface of cells in a breast cancer tissue sample. If the score is 0 to 1+, it's called &quot;HER2 negative.&quot; If the score is 2+, it's called &quot;borderline.&quot; A score of 3+ is called &quot;HER2 positive.&quot;</description>

    <description>Once enrolled, patients would be treated with the current standard-of-care endocrine therapy. Choice of endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen) would be decided by medical oncologist, following a review of the patient's medical history and menstrual status. The patient would be treated with endocrine therapy in a neoadjuvant setting for four weeks, with dosing continuing until surgery.</description>
