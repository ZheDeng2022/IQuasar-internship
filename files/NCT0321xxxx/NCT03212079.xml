  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PATH is a research study for cancer survivors to help participants to become more active.&#xD;
      Studies suggested an association between inactivity and cancer. The investigators created new&#xD;
      novel ways and technologies that may help participants to become more active. The three&#xD;
      methods the investigators are studying are: 1) participant become active on her/his own;&#xD;
      educational material will be provided; 2) working with a programmed health coach over the&#xD;
      phone via text messages; and 3) using digital voice assist to help participant become more&#xD;
      active. The digital voice assist will be delivered via Amazon Alexa on Echo speaker (it is&#xD;
      the famous intelligent voice that you see in superball commercial by Alec Baldwin). This&#xD;
      study is funded by the State of Maryland.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the participant agree to be in this study, the investigators will ask the participant to&#xD;
      do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be asked questions about his/her physical activity (walking, running or&#xD;
      other exercise) to determine if he/she are eligible to participate. If the participant is&#xD;
      eligible and interested in participating, the investigators will ask hi/her to read and sign&#xD;
      the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, the investigators will randomly assign the participant to a research group (this&#xD;
      method would be similar to drawing numbers from a hat). The result will determine which group&#xD;
      the participant will belong to. The study would have three different groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group one will be self-motivated to be physically active (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second group will receive smart daily text messages only (text group);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The last group would have the Amazon Echo smart device installed in participants' homes&#xD;
           and they will interact with a digital voice assist that will help them be active (Alexa&#xD;
           group).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All study participants will receive a Fitbit device which you can keep after the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When the investigators start the study, the participant will be asked to start&#xD;
                wearing wrist device immediately. For the next one week the investigators will&#xD;
                monitor the participant daily number of steps to establish how active he/she is.&#xD;
                The participant will not be required to change his/her daily routine in the first&#xD;
                week.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After the end of the first week, the investigators will ask the participant to&#xD;
                increase his/her daily steps to at least 10 thousand steps per day for the next&#xD;
                four weeks. In total the participant will have one week of hi/her normal daily&#xD;
                routine and four weeks of trying to do 10 thousand steps per day or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the participant is in the control group, the investigators will ask you to try&#xD;
                to do 10 thousand steps per day on his/her own.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the participant are in the text group, he/she will get smart text messages with&#xD;
                healthy tips to help track his/her activities and reach his/her daily goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the participant is in Alexa group, a study member will visit the participant at&#xD;
                his/her home before the end of the first week to install the Echo smart speaker and&#xD;
                to explain to the participant how to use the voice assist to help him/her become&#xD;
                more active for the next four weeks.&#xD;
