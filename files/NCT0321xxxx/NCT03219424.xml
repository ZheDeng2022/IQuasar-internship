      To evaluate return to work (RTW) status after moderate and major trauma in Hong Kong at one&#xD;
      year after injury. To derive reliable prediction models for return to work.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma is a leading cause not only of death worldwide but also of disability, and in Hong&#xD;
      Kong it ranks sixth as a cause of death for all age groups. The implementation of trauma&#xD;
      systems has improved the survival of injured patients in many settings including Hong Kong.&#xD;
      However, the aim of trauma care for the injured person is not only to prolong life but also&#xD;
      to restore patients to the best possible health status, and where applicable, to return to&#xD;
      work. Survivors of trauma often experience late sequelae that have a major impact on almost&#xD;
      all aspects of everyday life, and improvements in functional outcome and health status may&#xD;
      continue for at least five years post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate return to work (RTW) status after moderate and major trauma in Hong Kong at&#xD;
           one year after injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to derive reliable prediction models for RTW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre, prospective long-term follow up cohort study of the 1163 trauma&#xD;
      patients admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH), Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) and&#xD;
      Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) in Hong Kong in 2017-2018. Patients will be recruited within four&#xD;
      weeks of ED attendance as soon as the patient is clinically stable and conscious. The&#xD;
      follow-up period for return to work status of the 1163 trauma patients will extend from&#xD;
      baseline to one year after trauma.&#xD;
