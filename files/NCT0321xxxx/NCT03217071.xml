  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-institution, phase II, open-label clinical trial of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      pembrolizumab with or without low-dose stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) in stage I-IIIA&#xD;
      non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are planned to undergo surgical resection of their&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two consecutive run-in cohorts will administer pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab with SRT of 12&#xD;
      Gy to the lateral aspect of the primary tumor. Patients will receive pembrolizumab for 2&#xD;
      cycles prior to surgery or SRT and surgery. Surgical resection of all involved areas of tumor&#xD;
      will occur within 6 weeks of the last administration of pembrolizumab. It should be noted&#xD;
      that surgery is expected to occur within a much shorter window and 6 weeks would represent&#xD;
      the greatest allowable amount of delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If during the run-in, only the pembrolizumab-alone cohort meets pre-specified safety&#xD;
      parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter a larger expansion cohort, with&#xD;
      treatment given according to that cohort only. If during the run-in both cohorts meet&#xD;
      pre-specified safety parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter the expansion&#xD;
      cohort and be randomized between preoperative pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab with SRT of&#xD;
      12 Gy.&#xD;
