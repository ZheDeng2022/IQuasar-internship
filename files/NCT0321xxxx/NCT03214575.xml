      Background: Central venous catheter (CVC) insertion is a very common procedure in the&#xD;
      intensive care setting. A recent international guidelines advocated the use of ultrasound for&#xD;
      routine internal jugular CVC insertion. The needle navigation technology is a new innovation,&#xD;
      also known as guided positioning system (GPS) which allows clinician to visualize the needle&#xD;
      position and trajectory in real time as it approaches the target. We hypothesised that the&#xD;
      use of GPS would increase success rate and decrease performance time in vascular access&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare the success, efficacy and safety of the procedure using the ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance (UG) with conventional versus GPS method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This was a prospective randomized controlled study in a single centre - intensive&#xD;
      care unit. 100 patients were randomized into two groups (50 each each). Subjects would&#xD;
      receive CVC insertion via internal jugular vein using ultrasound guidance out of plane&#xD;
      approach by conventional versus GPS method. Outcomes measured were the procedure efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, level of operators' experience and their satisfaction.&#xD;

      Introduction Central venous catheter (CVC) insertion is a very common procedure in the&#xD;
      intensive care setting. A recent international guideline advocates the use of ultrasound for&#xD;
      routine internal jugular central venous catheter insertion1. The needle navigation technology&#xD;
      is a new innovation, also known as guided positioning system (GPS) which allows clinician to&#xD;
      visualize the needle position and trajectory in real time as it approaches the target. We&#xD;
      hypothesised that the use of GPS would increase success rate and decrease performance time in&#xD;
      vascular access procedures. The objectives of this study are to compare the success, efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of central venous catheter insertion via internal jugular vein using the&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance with conventional method versus needle navigation technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prospective randomized controlled study. It was conducted in a single centre -&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU), University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from&#xD;
      February 2016 to October 2016. The ethic committee approval was obtained from the Malaysian&#xD;
      medical research and ethics committee, MREC at the www.nih.gov.my (NMRR-16-334-29476).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criterion was patients in the ICU who required central venous vascular access.&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were refusal to participate in this study by patient or their legal&#xD;
      representative and patient with known history of difficult central venous access at internal&#xD;
      jugular vein (IJV). The procedure operators were doctors in anaesthesia residency program&#xD;
      with various level of experiences classified into 3 groups: 1 to &lt; 2 years, 2 to &lt; 3years, 3&#xD;
      years and above. Simply speaking all the operators have had previous training in ultrasound&#xD;
      guided vascular access procedure. This would ensure that patient's safety is not compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study would be proceeded after obtaining consent from patient or the next of kin. The&#xD;
      emergency verbal consent would be taken if the next of kin was not immediately available with&#xD;
      subsequent written consent to follow. The available operator would perform CVC insertion via&#xD;
      IJV using ultrasound guidance out of plane approach either with conventional method or needle&#xD;
      guidance technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining consent, a computer generated randomisation would be assigned to either using&#xD;
      the conventional or GPS method. Identified operators using GPS method would receive a&#xD;
      standard 5 minute briefing on the needle guidance technology and got to practice with the new&#xD;
      technology using the vascular phantom (Blue Phantom Inc., Bothell, WA, USA). The operators&#xD;
      were allowed to practice until they were ready to perform on real patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedure would be performed using the ultrasound machine, eZono 4000 with eZGuide&#xD;
      (eZono, Jena, Germany) and linear array transducer L3-12NGS (3-12 MHz). This ultrasound&#xD;
      machine2 has a built-in adaptive needle recognition software called eZGuide. The navigation&#xD;
      technology of the ultrasound device is based on an electromagnetic field that communicates&#xD;
      with a transducer and an electromagnetic sensor sheathed by a vascular access needle. Needle&#xD;
      movements and related magnetic field variation allow navigation system to compute the&#xD;
      locations of the transducer and needle in the three dimensional space. The ultrasound screen&#xD;
      would display colour coded alignment of the needle and the position of the tip relative to&#xD;
      the imaging plane (Figure 1). Superimposed on the image is the real-time electronic needle&#xD;
      guidance system. The dashed line represents the predicted needle trajectory. The red box&#xD;
      represents the depth that the needle will cross the plane of the ultrasound. The solid lines&#xD;
      on either side of the dashed line represent the actual depth of the needle. The top left&#xD;
      corner shows a diagram of the transducer-needle relation. This allowed the user to identify&#xD;
      the correct needle trajectory, prior to puncturing the patient's skin and maintain the chosen&#xD;
      route to the target anatomy. Operators assigned to use GPS method would have activated the&#xD;
      eZGuide software while those performing conventionally would have the software technology&#xD;
      turned off when using the ultrasound machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure time was measured in seconds using a stopwatch. The performance time was&#xD;
      defined as time measured from placing the needle on the skin to successful vessel puncture as&#xD;
      indicated by blood withdrawn into the syringe.&#xD;
