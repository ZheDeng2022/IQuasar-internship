    <textblock>
      DOSCORT is a 2-dose, cross-over study primarily aiming to identify and validate novel&#xD;
      biological markers (biomarkers) of glucocorticoid effect in the human body. Patients with&#xD;
      Addison´s disease, primary adrenal insufficiency, with life-long glucocorticoid replacement&#xD;
      therapy will undergo 2 treatment periods where their usual hydrocortisone treatment will be&#xD;
      replaced with betamethasone in physiological and supra physiological doses. Blood, saliva,&#xD;
      urine, health related Quality-of-life self-assessment forms, measurements of physical&#xD;
      activity and sleep quality will be collected from both treatment periods.&#xD;
