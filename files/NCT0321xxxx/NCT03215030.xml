  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of single agent TAK-573&#xD;
      in participants with relapsed/refractory MM in Phase 1, and to provide a preliminary&#xD;
      evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK-573 as a single agent and in combination with&#xD;
      dexamethasone in participants with relapsed/refractory MM in Phase 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-573 as single agent and in combination with&#xD;
      dexamethasone. The study will determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-573 as single&#xD;
      agent and in combination with dexamethasone in participants with relapsed/refractory MM. The&#xD;
      study consists of 2 Phases, 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 51 and 100 participants in Phase 1 and 2 respectively.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups in each&#xD;
      Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 Schedule A: TAK-573 0.001 to 14 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 Schedule B: TAK-573 TBD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 Schedule C: TAK-573 TBD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 Schedule D: TAK-573 TBD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: TAK-573 TBD&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design to evaluate&#xD;
      once-weekly up to 4 different schedules of administration of TAK-573 starting at 0.001 mg/kg&#xD;
      for DLT evaluation and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or an optimal biological&#xD;
      dose (OBD) for assessments in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 will further assess the safety profile of TAK-573 and its efficacy at MTD or OBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The maximum treatment&#xD;
      duration in this study is up to 12 months and overall time to participate in the study is&#xD;
      approximately up to 40 months.&#xD;
