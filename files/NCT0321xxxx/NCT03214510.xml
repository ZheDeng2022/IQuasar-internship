    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well thoracic epidural analgesia or four-quadrant&#xD;
      transversus abdominus plane block works in reducing pain in patients undergoing liver&#xD;
      surgery. It is not yet known whether thoracic epidural analgesia or four-quadrant transversus&#xD;
      abdominus plane block may help people to recover more completely and more quickly after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare length of hospital stay between patients treated with thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia (TEA) versus (vs.) pre-incision ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus&#xD;
      abdominus plane (TAP) block after open liver resection within an enhanced recovery program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the area under the curve of early (0-48 hour) post-operative pain scores and&#xD;
      number of patients who experience severe postoperative pain between the TEA and TAP groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare anesthetic-related complication rates and need to change modalities between&#xD;
      TEA and TAP groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare surgery-related complications (including 30-day readmission and 90-day&#xD;
      mortality rates) between TEA and TAP groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare return to baseline symptom burden, functional and cognitive status between TEA&#xD;
      and TAP groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo placement of thoracic epidural catheter before surgery. Patients&#xD;
      receive hydromorphone hydrochloride and bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter every 10&#xD;
      minutes or 3 hours as needed. Patients may receive fentanyl and bupivacaine or plain&#xD;
      bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo placement of ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus abdominus&#xD;
      plane block. Patients receive plain bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine via TAP block.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early post-operative pain control</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 48 hours post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The area under the curve for each patient will be computed using the trapezoidal method using the pain score by time curve as has been done in prior studies of this type at MD Anderson. Will be compared between groups. In addition, the number of patients experiencing severe pain (&gt;= 7/10) during the inpatient recovery period will be compared between study groups. Will be summarized using descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, median and range. Will be compared with 2-sample t- tests, Mann Whitney U tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as indicated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complication rates secondary to the analgesic regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pain control modality complications will be prospectively recorded including epidural hematoma, epidural catheter migration/malfunction, injection/exit site cellulitis, epidural abscess, cerebrospinal fluid leak, prolonged ileus (defined as inability to tolerate regular diet by post operation day 5), imbalance and gait instability, altered mental status and delirium, and need to change pain control modality due to inadequate pain control. The rate of these complications will be compared between study groups. Will be tabulated with frequency and percentages. Will be compared using chi-square test with Fisher's correction as indicated.</description>

    <description>Postoperative surgical complications will be prospectively recorded and graded using the Accordian grading scale. Liver surgery specific complications including bile fistula, bleeding requiring transfusion and liver failure will be recorded. 30-day readmission and 90-day mortality will be recorded. The rates of these complications will be compared between study groups. Will be tabulated with frequency and percentages.

Likewise, pre- and post-operative physical and cognitive performance recovery will be compared between groups. Will be summarized using descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, median and range.
