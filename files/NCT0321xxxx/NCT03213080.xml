  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DISCOVER TLD study is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm study designed to record the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of the CE-marked Nuvaira™ Lung Denervation System, in a subset of its&#xD;
      CE-marked approved indication. This study is being conducted in Europe.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall COPD patient experience with the&#xD;
      Nuvaira™ Lung Denervation System and allow for the continued collection of safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness data on the CE-marked product. The study is a multicenter, prospective,&#xD;
      single-arm study designed to include patients, on average, who fall within a more severe&#xD;
      stage of COPD, defined as 20-45% FEV1 percent predicted. Subjects will remain on respiratory&#xD;
      medications per their standard of care and will be followed and tested per standard of care&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects who are enrolled and meet the eligibility criteria will undergo Targeted Lung Denervation (TLD). TLD is a bronchoscopically-guided, minimally-invasive procedure using the Nuvaira™ Lung Devervation System. The Nuvaira System is intended for the long-term maintenance treatment of airway obstruction associated with COPD. TLD uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to ablate the airway nerve trunks of the vagus nerves that travel parallel to and outside of the main bronchi and into the lungs. Ablation of the nerves opens the airways and makes breathing easier.</description>

        Patients with diagnosis of advanced COPD [20% ≤ FEV1 ≤ 45% and FEV1/FVC &lt; 70%&#xD;
        (post-bronchodilator)] who are no longer smoking (quit at least 2 months prior to registry&#xD;
        consent) and are able to undergo general anesthesia. All subjects will undergo a CT scan to&#xD;
        determine whether bronchial anatomy is appropriate for TLD procedure.&#xD;
