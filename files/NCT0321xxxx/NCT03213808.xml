      Allergic diseases, including allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and anaphylaxis are not&#xD;
      properly classified in current classifications of diseases. We here propose a project based&#xD;
      on the evaluation of medical records of hospital databases of patients suffering for allergic&#xD;
      and hypersensitivity conditions coded with the current and a new coming version of the&#xD;
      international classification of diseases, no patient or intervention will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We here propose a study to update and reach quality assurance of the classification of&#xD;
      allergic and hypersensitivity conditions in international classification systems. The&#xD;
      Allergic and hypersensitivity conditions section has indeed been recently built into the new&#xD;
      ICD-11 framework and we aim to reach its quality assurance by evaluating medical records of&#xD;
      French hospital databases. All the consecutive cases related to allergic and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      conditions registered in the last 1 year will be selected and blind-coded by two independent&#xD;
      coders based on the online English versions of the ICD-10 (2015 version) and ICD-11 Beta&#xD;
      draft. The generated data will support the intra and inter-variability testing, survey among&#xD;
      end-users and economic-impact evaluation. The economic impact of the transition from ICD-10&#xD;
      to ICD-11 will be analysed based on average estimated cost per day of each principal&#xD;
      diagnosis and the effect of the classification change will be quantified by the cost variance&#xD;
      of inter or intra diagnosis of ICD-10 and ICD-11. For the bridge procedure based on the&#xD;
      alignment of the allergic and hypersensitivity conditions described into the ICD-10 (and&#xD;
      ICD-10 CM US adaptation) framework to the ICD-11 beta phase, we propose the mapping and&#xD;
      cross-linking terms methods. Meanwhile, we will start updating the allergic and&#xD;
      hypersensitivity procedures by influencing the International Classification of Health&#xD;
      Intervention (ICHI).&#xD;

      Rationale for this Non-Interventional Study Allergic diseases, including allergic asthma,&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis and anaphylaxis are not properly classified in current classifications of&#xD;
      diseases. We here propose a project based on the evaluation of medical records of hospital&#xD;
      databases of patients suffering for allergic and hypersensitivity conditions coded with the&#xD;
      current and a new coming version of the international classification of diseases, no patient&#xD;
      or intervention will be analized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this Non-Interventional Study Main Objectives: To assess the stability of codes&#xD;
      for ICD-10 allergic diseases and hypersensitivity to ICD-11 using the medical-administrative&#xD;
      databases of 3 hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: (I) To adjust the terms and links for allergic diseases and&#xD;
      hypersensitivity and thus continue the on-line implementation process of ICD-11 based on the&#xD;
      lessons learned on the main objective; (II) To estimate the economic impact of ICD-10 and&#xD;
      ICD-11 transition for health care facilities; (III) To electronically align ICD-10 codes (and&#xD;
      CM adaptation in the USA) with ICD-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design All the consecutive cases of allergies over a year and registered in the DIM&#xD;
      bases of 3 healthcare establishments (the university hospital of Montpellier (CHRUM), Paris&#xD;
      (APHP), Toulouse) will be individualized. Depending on the size of the facility, Â½ to 1/10 of&#xD;
      the cases will be included in the study. All cases will be selected anonymously. Two&#xD;
      professional coders will encode the selected cases twice. The analysis of the data will be&#xD;
      based on the degree of inter-encoder agreement using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. At the end of&#xD;
      this process, we will be able to identify the correspondence between the codes recorded in&#xD;
      the DIM database (ICD-10) and those of the new classification. In the event of discordant&#xD;
      results, consensus will be reached by involving other coding experts from CHRUM. The economic&#xD;
      impact of the transition from ICD-10 to ICD-11 will be approximated by estimating the average&#xD;
      costs per ICD code used in the main diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target subject population Our project is focused on allergic and hypersensitivity sufferers.&#xD;
      Although we intend to validate the classification of allergic and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      conditions, the international classification systems are for global use and our methodology&#xD;
      might be helpful for other diseases and for the program of medicalization and information&#xD;
      system (PMSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods In order to reach the inter and intra-variability testing, the data&#xD;
      analysis will be based on the degree of inter-rater agreement using Cohen's Kappa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic impact of the transition from ICD-10 to ICD-11 will be analized based on average&#xD;
      estimated cost per day of each principal diagnosis and the effect of the classification&#xD;
      change will be quantified by the cost variance of inter or intra diagnosis of ICD-10 and&#xD;
      ICD-11.&#xD;
