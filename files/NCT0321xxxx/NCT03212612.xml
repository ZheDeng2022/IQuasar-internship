      The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown ,so our study is to investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between Galectin-3 and endometriosis by comparing between its level in healthy and&#xD;
      endometriosis women. Also, we will measure the level of oxidative stress markers in&#xD;
      endometrium of both healthy and endometriosis women and investigate the correlaton between&#xD;
      them and galectin-in endometriosis women.&#xD;

      Endometriosis is a benign gynaecological disorder with malignant biological characteristics&#xD;
      and is defined by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity.&#xD;
      Ectopic endometrial cells can spread to pelvic organs such as rectum, bladder, and ovaries.&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of endometriosis is likely to be multifactorial and to involve an&#xD;
      interplay between several factors. (Fauser BC, Diedrich K, Bouchard P, Domínguez F, Matzuk M,&#xD;
      2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endometrial cycle and implantation are complex processes. Alterations in levels of some&#xD;
      regulatory molecules on the cell surface occur during the cycle tightly controlled&#xD;
      proliferation and differentiation. Most of these regulatory molecules and mechanisms have not&#xD;
      yet been investigated, However, Galectins , a sub family of lectins are delineated to&#xD;
      regulate vital cell functions. (Leffler H. et al Introduction to galectins. Glycoconj j,2004)&#xD;
      It has been shown that Gal-3 is expressed in many cell types, including endometrial cells and&#xD;
      trophoblast cells (Riss D, Naude S 2003) . Previous studies have reported that Gal-3 is&#xD;
      specifically expressed in endometrial cells in the secretory phase, in placental tissue&#xD;
      during early pregnancy, and in decidua surrounding the site of implantation. Another study&#xD;
      verified that Gal-3 plays an important role in the process of embryonic implantation (Liu YK,&#xD;
      Hum Reprod.2009). Intracellular Gal-3 promoted proliferation and adhesion in endometrial&#xD;
      cells(Yang H, TaylorHS,2011) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female reproductive system is vulnerable to the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      (ROS) that damage proteins, lipids, and DNA structure. Oxidative stress is a key factor for&#xD;
      progression of endometriosis. Many theories have been elaborated so far to clarify&#xD;
      endometriosis pathogenesis and oxidative stress, a result of increased production of free&#xD;
      radicals or depletion of the body's endogenous antioxidant defense, has been implicated in&#xD;
      its pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a case-control study that will be made in woman health hospital and medical&#xD;
      biochemistry department -assiut university. We will estimate the tissue level of galectin-3&#xD;
      in endometrium of both healthy and endometriosis women and detect wether galectin-3 leads to&#xD;
      or protect against endometriosis. Also, we will measure the level of oxidative stress markers&#xD;
      in endometrium of both healthy and endometriosis women and investigate the correlaton between&#xD;
      them and galectin-in endometriosis women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated by Epi Info 2000 software computer program. Based on the&#xD;
      expected proportion of Galectin-3 deficiency among controls will be 20% and its increase in&#xD;
      cases by four folds (Odd Ratio = 4) with 80% power and a confidence level 95%, the calculated&#xD;
      sample size is 45cases and 45 controls (totally 90 women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will include age, parity, menstrual history , present history (including&#xD;
      symptoms of pain, bleeding and infertility), drug history , history of previous diseases and&#xD;
      any investigations were done. The aim of the study will be explained to each participant&#xD;
      before filling study sheet. A written consent will be obtained from those who welcome to&#xD;
      participate in the study, then women will be divided into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      45women who were found to have surgically and histolopathologically -confirmed endometriosis.&#xD;
      Endometrial samples(1-2 gram) will be taken by laparoscopy which is the gold standard for&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis of endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 women free of endometriosis. These women had normal menstrual cycles and had not received&#xD;
      hormonal therapy within 3 months prior to sampling. Endometrial samples(1-2 gram) will be&#xD;
      taken from them through Punch biopsy after IUD insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Galectin-3 will be estimated by ELISA kit. Endometrial samples(1-2 gram) will be separated&#xD;
      from each women during proliferative phase(days 5-15) and washed several times with 0.9%&#xD;
      sterile saline solution to remove any blood from the tissues. The tissue samples will&#xD;
      homogenized by tissue homogenizer at 40,000rpm. The supernatant extracts will be collected in&#xD;
      Ependorf tubes and frozen at -80°C till analysis by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tissue levels of NO and TBARS (oxidative stress markers) were determined by chemical&#xD;
      methods according to the methods descriped by Van Bezooijen et al, (1998), and Buege and Aust&#xD;
      (1978) respectively. Also the tissue levels of catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and&#xD;
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (anti oxidants) were determined by chemical methods&#xD;
      according to the methods descriped by Clairborne ( 1985), Beutler et al. (1963) and Marklund&#xD;
      (1985).&#xD;
