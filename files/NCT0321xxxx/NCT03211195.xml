      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the bioequivalence of a single dose of the commercial tablet of sotagliflozin&#xD;
      (test) compared to the development tablet of sotagliflozin (reference) under fasting&#xD;
      conditions in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin and its main metabolite&#xD;
           sotagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide following administration of a single sotagliflozin (test)&#xD;
           tablet or a single sotagliflozin (reference) table in healthy male and female subjects&#xD;
           under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of a single dose sotagliflozin (test) tablet&#xD;
           compared to a single sotagliflozin (reference) tablet administered under fasted&#xD;
           conditions in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;

      The study duration per subject will be 36-99 days and will consist of a screening period of 2&#xD;
      to 21 days, a study period of 7 days for each of four periods, and a washout of 8-21 days&#xD;
      between each dose administration, and a final follow up visit 10-15 days after final dose&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
