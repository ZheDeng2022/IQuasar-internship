  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It had been shown that high percentage of severe preeclampsia patients got a high cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion pressure (CPP) due to abnormal autoregulation of cerebral blood vessels with&#xD;
      associated endothelial dysfunction and disrupted blood brain barrier. Moreover, patients with&#xD;
      high CPP is more likely to present with headache compared to other patients with normal&#xD;
      CPP.In this particular scenario, use of magnesium sulphate is associated with marked&#xD;
      reduction of CPP and. hence prevention of cerebral damage.This hypothesis was confirmed by&#xD;
      new magnetic resonance techniques that demonstrated brain edema in eclampsia/ severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia patient mostly due to vasogenic edema and less commonly attributed to cytotoxic&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) mirrors the changes in the Intracranial&#xD;
      pressure(ICP), subsequently when the intracranial pressure increases the optic nerve sheath&#xD;
      diameter (ONDS) also increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect Magnesium sulphate infusion on intracranial&#xD;
      pressure, in patients presented with severe preeclampsia by measuring changes in the ONSD&#xD;
      using ultrasound examination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      30 obstetric patients admitted to the HDU in Corniche Hospital for treatment of severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia. Patients with the following criteria will be excluded from the current work:&#xD;
      Patients undergone cranial or eye surgeries, Patients with known intracranial pathology,&#xD;
      Patients suffering from glaucoma or any other eye pathology that prevent clear identification&#xD;
      of the optic nerve, and Patients on drugs that may affect the cerebrospinal fluid [based on&#xD;
      operator decision].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective pilot study, patients who will fulfill the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited at the time of admission in HDU by the investigators. The ONDS will be measured&#xD;
      before the commencement of Magnesium sulphate infusion, 1hr after finishing the loading dose,&#xD;
      6 and 24 hrs after infusion started. Patients will be in supine position with the head of the&#xD;
      bed less than 20 degrees. High frequency (7.5 MHz) linear probe will be used; it will be&#xD;
      placed gently over both closed eye after liberal application of sterile gel, the patient will&#xD;
      be instructed to look forward to align the optic nerve directly opposite to the probe. The&#xD;
      ONSD will be measured 3mm behind the optic disc in both the sagittal and transverse planes&#xD;
      and an average will be calculated and recorded. In the absence of complete visualization of&#xD;
      the optic disc, the largest viewed diameter will be taken as the maximal ONSD. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      variables &amp; oxygen saturation will be recorded at the same times.&#xD;
