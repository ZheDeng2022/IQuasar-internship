      In this work, the investigators report the effects of consume of 15g walnuts and 15g almonds&#xD;
      for 8 week on weight, waist and hip circumferences, body mass index, fat mass, serum&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol adiponectin, lipocalin-2 concentration and fatty acids profile.&#xD;

      The study consists of a diet-intervention in a single group under-free-living conditions. The&#xD;
      diet was enriched with 15g of almonds and 15g of walnuts per day for eight weeks, supplied&#xD;
      directly to the patient by the researcher. This amounts of walnuts and almonds contain&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids of approximately 2.02g of omega 3 (alpha-linolenic acid) and&#xD;
      11.1g of omega 6 (linoleic acid) mostly. In a period of 14 months, the investigators&#xD;
      recruited forty-eight sedentary subjects of 30 to 50 years old, and body mass index between&#xD;
      30 and 34.9 kg/m2, without evidence of chronic degenerative, infectious or neoplastic&#xD;
      diseases, neither medication nor actually dietary treatment, and a physical level of exercise&#xD;
      &lt; 2 hours/week. All participants gave their written informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Universidad de&#xD;
      Guanajuato.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data included the clinical-nutritional history, 24-hour recalls, and the&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire was applied to evaluate if subjects were&#xD;
      sedentary. The dietary intake evaluation was estimated in kilocalories/day, the amount and&#xD;
      type of macronutrients according to the database of United States Department of Agriculture&#xD;
      and the National Institute of Public Health (Mexico). In order to evaluate adherence to the&#xD;
      diet, volunteers were visited every two weeks to carry out three 24-hour recalls (two on&#xD;
      weekdays and one on weekends). Positive Adherence to the diet plan was considered when the&#xD;
      food consumption, walnuts and almonds were not modified more than Â± 20% of the amount&#xD;
      indicated by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recorded the anthropometric measures, body composition, and measured serum&#xD;
      glucose, lipid profile, insulin, lipocalin 2, high sensitivity C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      adiponectin, and fatty acids profile, which were analyzed at the baseline and after dietary&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
