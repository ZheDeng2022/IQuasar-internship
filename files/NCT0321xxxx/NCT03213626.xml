  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase II trial. Safety will be monitored on an ongoing&#xD;
      basis. Laboratory testing (chemistry, hematology tests) will be performed every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      the first 8 weeks followed by assessments every 4 weeks. Other safety evaluations including&#xD;
      EKGs, urinalysis, coagulation and thyroid function studies will be performed at regular&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event seriousness, severity grade, and relationship to study treatment will be&#xD;
      assessed by the investigator. Severity grade will be defined by the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors will be assessed by contrast enhanced CT or MRI every 8 weeks. Pre-treatment tissue&#xD;
      will be obtained via CT-guided FNA biopsy or collected during resection. However, archival&#xD;
      tissue will also be requested, when available and if adequate for testing. Post-treatment&#xD;
      tissue will be obtained on Day 15 (i.e., Week 3/Day 1) via CT-guided FNA biopsy. All tumor&#xD;
      tissue from eligible patients will be utilized for the correlative studies which are outlined&#xD;
      in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject's course will consist of three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Pre-Treatment Period in which subjects are consented and undergo screening assessments&#xD;
           to be qualified for the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period in which subjects receive study treatment and undergo study&#xD;
           assessments. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with&#xD;
           cabozantinib orally at 40 mg daily and erlotinib orally at 100 mg daily without breaks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Post-Treatment Period in which subjects no longer receive study treatment but undergo&#xD;
           follow-up study assessments and contacts.&#xD;

      Primary Objective The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate a radiographic&#xD;
      response rate of 15% or greater for the combination in a selected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease&#xD;
           control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety and tolerability of this combination in the target patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests will be performed on blood and tumor tissue samples collected during this&#xD;
      trial to correlate with PFS and OS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  c-Met and EGFR mRNA by RT-qPCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plasma HGF and soluble Met receptor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  c-Met and EGFR phosphoprotein levels by IHC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KRAS mutation status&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. The subject must have EGFR and c-Met overexpressed in tumor as determined by&#xD;

             supportive therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has organ and marrow function and laboratory values as follows within 7&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. All sexually active subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a&#xD;
             medically accepted barrier method (e.g., male or female condom) and a second method of&#xD;
             birth control during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug(s);&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening. Females&#xD;
             of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of becoming&#xD;
             pregnant (i.e., females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,&#xD;
             with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
             However, women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to&#xD;
             be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
             antiestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression or other reasons.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a single arm two stage design. The 1st stage was to have 11 patients and be terminated if 0 responded. The 2nd stage would have a total of 37 patients and if the number responding was &lt;= 2, the combination was to be rejected. The study was terminated prematurely due to no patient benefit at Patient 7.</recruitment_details>
