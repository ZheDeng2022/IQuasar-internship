  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with glioma,&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, or solid tumors with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic) and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the overall response rates of olaparib in subjects with recurrent/progressive&#xD;
      IDH1/2-mutant solid tumors, who will be recruited to 3 cohorts: a. glioma, b.&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, c. other solid malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the distribution of progression free survival (PFS) of olaparib in adults with&#xD;
      recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant glioma and cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2- mutant&#xD;
      glioma and cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the duration of response in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant&#xD;
      glioma, cholangiocarcinoma or other solid malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To confirm the safety and tolerability of olaparib monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe 2HG concentration in plasma by mass spectrometry at baseline and at specific&#xD;
      timepoints and correlate with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe 2HG levels in tumor biopsies from prior to the beginning of treatment and at&#xD;
      specific timepoints and correlate with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate in tumor biopsies and in liquid biopsies performed at baseline and at&#xD;
      specific timepoints if co-occurring alterations detected via multiplexed immunofluorescence,&#xD;
      mass cytometry (CyTOF)-imaging mass cytometry (IMC), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and/or&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing can be associated with differential levels of 2HG&#xD;
      production, treatment response and resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to understand the nature of this trial and provide written&#xD;
             informed consent, prior to any study specific procedures; patients with Impaired&#xD;
             Decision Making Capacity (IDMC) who have a close caregiver or legally authorized&#xD;
             representative (LAR) may be considered eligible for this study at the treating&#xD;
             physician's discretion, provided that the physician is reasonably sure that the&#xD;
             possible risks and benefits of the study are clear and that the patient will take the&#xD;
             drug as prescribed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with a glioma, cholangiocarcinoma or other solid malignant&#xD;
             tumor that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard&#xD;
             therapy exists, with biopsy-confirmed evidence of an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation associated&#xD;
             with neomorphic activity of the encoded proteins; patients must have IDH1 or IDH2&#xD;
             mutation which must be detected in a clinical accredited laboratory using a Food and&#xD;
             Drug Administration (FDA)-approved molecular test or a validated deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
             (DNA)-based assay conducted in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments&#xD;
             (CLIA)-certified laboratory; only specific mutations that lead to a neomorphic&#xD;
             phenotype will be eligible for enrollment, and include IDH1: R132V, R132G, R132S,&#xD;
             R132L, R132C and R132H; IDH2: R140W, R140L, R140Q, R172W, R172G, R172S, R172M, R172K&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be&#xD;
             willing to have serial biopsies (with a third biopsy upon evidence of disease&#xD;
             progression); in case of multiple lesions, tumor biopsies will be performed on the&#xD;
             most accessible site of disease; all possible precautions to avoid complications will&#xD;
             be taken, including discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed; patients&#xD;
             affected by glioma will not be considered for study biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to undergo extra blood sampling for correlative studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with extracranial disease must have evaluable disease by Response Evaluation&#xD;
             Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1); subjects affected by glioma must&#xD;
             have evaluable disease by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO)&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with glioma, specific inclusion criteria are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The disease should be recurrent or transformed glioma; subjects must not have had&#xD;
                  prior surgery (biopsy allowed) or radiation therapy within 3 weeks of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There must be an enhancing component of disease, as evaluated on pre-treatment&#xD;
                  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV glioma and&#xD;
                  progressive disease &lt; 12 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, progression&#xD;
                  can be defined by the following set of criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  New enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high-dose region&#xD;
                       or 80% isodose line)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling&#xD;
                       (e.g., solid tumor areas. i.e., &gt; 70% tumor cell nuclei in areas), high or&#xD;
                       progressive increase in MIB-1 proliferation index compared with prior&#xD;
                       biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression or increased anaplasia in&#xD;
                       tumor);&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Given the difficulty of differentiating true progression from&#xD;
                       pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the absence of radiographic or&#xD;
                       histologic confirmation of progression, will not be sufficient for&#xD;
                       definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after completion of&#xD;
                       concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with WHO grade III or IV glioma and progressive disease &gt;= 12 weeks&#xD;
                  after completion of chemoradiotherapy, progression can be defined by the&#xD;
                  following set of criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  New contrast-enhancing lesion outside of radiation field on decreasing,&#xD;
                       stable, or increasing doses of corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Increase by &gt;= 25% in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters&#xD;
                       between the first post-radiotherapy scan, or a subsequent scan with smaller&#xD;
                       tumor size, and the scan at 12 weeks or later on stable or increasing doses&#xD;
                       of corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For patients receiving antiangiogenic therapy, significant increase in&#xD;
                       T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) non-enhancing lesion may also&#xD;
                       be considered progressive disease; the increased T2/FLAIR must have occurred&#xD;
                       with the patient on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared&#xD;
                       with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy and not be a&#xD;
                       result of comorbid events (e.g., effects of radiation therapy,&#xD;
                       demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes,&#xD;
                       or other treatment effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Clinical deterioration alone is not attributable to concurrent&#xD;
                       medication or comorbid conditions is sufficient to declare progression on&#xD;
                       current treatment but not for entry onto a clinical trial for recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with WHO grade II glioma progression is defined by any one of the&#xD;
                  following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Development of new lesions or increase of enhancement (radiological evidence&#xD;
                       of malignant transformation)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A 25% increase of the T2 or FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or&#xD;
                       increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best&#xD;
                       response after initiation of therapy, not attributable to radiation effect&#xD;
                       or to comorbid events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subject with extracranial disease, they must have at least one lesion, not&#xD;
             previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as &gt;= 10 mm in the&#xD;

             computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or &gt;= 10 mm with calipers&#xD;
             by clinical exam OR at least one lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be&#xD;
             accurately assessed by CT/MRI/pain x-ray/clinical exam at baseline and follow up&#xD;
             visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have progressive cancer at the time of study entry; prior experimental&#xD;

             last 30 days or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is less) prior to the&#xD;
             initiation of study treatment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative&#xD;
             reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other malignancy within the last 5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ&#xD;
             (DCIS), stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma, or other solid tumors including&#xD;
             lymphomas (without bone marrow involvement) curatively treated with no evidence of&#xD;
             disease for &gt;= 5 years; patients with a history of localized triple negative breast&#xD;
             cancer may be eligible, provided they completed their adjuvant chemotherapy more than&#xD;
             three years prior to registration, and that the patient remains free of recurrent or&#xD;
             metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 msec or family&#xD;
             history of long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin,&#xD;
             clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir,&#xD;
             saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil); the required washout&#xD;
             period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks; because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated drug&#xD;
             information reference; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference&#xD;
             may also provide this information; as part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,&#xD;
             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's wort) or&#xD;
             moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil); the required washout&#xD;
             period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3&#xD;
             weeks for other agents; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it&#xD;
             is important to regularly consult a frequently updated drug information reference;&#xD;
             medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information; as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will&#xD;
             be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent toxicities caused by previous cancer therapy; toxicities should have&#xD;
             recovered to =&lt; grade 1, excluding alopecia and stable chronic grade 2 toxicity that&#xD;
             is not overlapping with presumed toxicities of olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features&#xD;
             suggestive of MDS/AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases; a scan to confirm the absence&#xD;
             of brain metastases is not required; the patient can receive a stable dose of&#xD;
             corticosteroids before and during the study if these were started at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to treatment; patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have&#xD;
             received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for&#xD;
             28 days; patients with known uncontrolled brain metastases should be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment; effects from surgeries&#xD;
             should have recovered to =&lt; grade 1, with the exception of stable chronic grade 2 that&#xD;
             is not overlapping with presumed toxicities of olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection; examples&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder&#xD;
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent and would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are actively breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive&#xD;
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); HIV-positive patients on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with Olaparib; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be u&#xD;
