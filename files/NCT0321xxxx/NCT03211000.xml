  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The molecular mechanisms contributing to the development of aortic aneurysmal disease are&#xD;
      poorly characterized making actual therapies not sufficient. Autophagy is an intracellular&#xD;
      mechanism that removes dysfunctional organelles and unfolded proteins, thereby maintaining&#xD;
      cellular homeostasis. Activation of autophagy was shown to limit cardiac damage during&#xD;
      stress. Accordingly, autophagy was found to be inhibited in the heart in animal models of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity and aging thereby contributing to the development of&#xD;
      cardiac derangements associated with these conditions. However, it remains to fully dissect&#xD;
      the association between autophagy and structural alterations of the aortic wall and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction in humans. In this study the correlation between levels of autophagy&#xD;
      and the development of human aortic aneurysm will be assessed in patients subjected to&#xD;
      surgical interventions for aortic pathologies. The association of Hippo signaling activation&#xD;
      with the formation of aortic disease will also be evaluated, since previous work demonstrated&#xD;
      that the Hippo pathway negatively regulates autophagy and promotes the development of&#xD;
      cellular abnormalities. The results of this study may provide new insights into the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the development of aortic disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autophagy may represent a new potential therapeutic target for the prevention and the&#xD;
      treatment of aortic pathologies. It is a cellular self- digestion mechanism that prevents the&#xD;
      accumulation of senescent organelles and damaged proteins. Autophagy plays a pivotal role in&#xD;
      the regulation of cellular homeostasis and promotes the cellular response to stress. However,&#xD;
      further investigations are needed to establish how autophagy is influenced by cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors, as well as by pharmacological therapy. Moreover, it is still unclear in humans&#xD;
      the association between autophagy and structural and functional alterations of aortic wall,&#xD;
      as well as its association with endothelial dysfunction, especially in subjects affected by&#xD;
      aortic pathologies. Furthermore, no data are available on the correlation between autophagy&#xD;
      and the prognosis of patients who underwent cardio-surgical procedures for aortic&#xD;
      pathologies. In this study, autophagy levels will be evaluated in human aortic aneurysm&#xD;
      samples obtained from patients enrolled for a surgical aorta procedures. Autophagy markers in&#xD;
      each aneurysm sample will be compared to those observed in the non-aneurysmatic aortic&#xD;
      portion adjacent to the aneurysmatic tract obtained from the same patient. Levels of&#xD;
      autophagy will also be correlated with markers of apoptosis and oxidative stress in both the&#xD;
      aneurysmatic and non-aneurysmatic aortic parts. The involvement of the Hippo signaling&#xD;
      pathway and inflammation in control and aneurysm samples will also be investigated. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that autophagy levels will be lower in aneurysm samples with respect to&#xD;
      non-aneurysmatic adjacent aortic portions. They will also be inversely correlated with&#xD;
      aneurysm dimension. In contrast, the Hippo pathway will be activated in aortic aneurysms.&#xD;
      Autophagy and Hippo signaling markers will also be correlated with markers of apoptosis and&#xD;
      oxidative stress in aortic samples. In conclusion, the results of this study may underline&#xD;
      the vascular role of autophagy and Hippo signaling and their involvement in the development&#xD;
      of aortic diseases.&#xD;
