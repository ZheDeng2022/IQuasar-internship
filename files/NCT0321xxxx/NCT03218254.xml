    <textblock>
      Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is the most debilitating problem for patients with&#xD;
      haematological cancer. CRF severely reduces quality of life (QoL), functional capacity,&#xD;
      impacts health behavior, recovery and furthermore no approved treatment exists. In solid&#xD;
      cancer methylphenidat (MTP) has been suggested to improve CRF, however patients with&#xD;
      haematological cancer has not been studied. The current randomized placebo controlled study&#xD;
      includes a variety of severely fatigued haematological cancer patients from seven Danish&#xD;
      departments. It aims at revealing whether MTP can improve CRF, functional capacity and QoL&#xD;
      thereby hopefully providing improvement and treatment options in this field where&#xD;
      improvements are requested the most by patients. Patients are randomized to treatment with&#xD;
      MTP or placebo week 1-6 followed by &quot;wash-out&quot; and cross-over - placebo to MTP or vice versa&#xD;
      - during week 8-13. End-points will be patient reported fatigue, as well as improvements in&#xD;
      active hours, functional capacity, and QoL.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Survival prognosis in haematological malignancies has improved considerably,&#xD;
      however the frequency and impact of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms - cancer&#xD;
      related fatigue (CRF) - has not improved. Up to 40% of cancer patients has daily difficulties&#xD;
      due to CRF and fatigue and weakness is affecting 2/3 of patients. In contrast to everyday&#xD;
      fatigue CRF is defined as an unusual and persistent sense of tiredness, weakness, or even&#xD;
      exhaustion that is not relieved by rest or sleep and leads to decreased physical or mental&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haematological cancer is often associated with fatigue due to both anemia and constitutional&#xD;
      symptoms. Myeloablative chemotherapeutic regimens and stem cell transplantations are unique&#xD;
      for haematological cancer treatment and these very potent regimens may result in CRF even&#xD;
      after several years. CRF among haematological cancer patients is associated with reduced&#xD;
      adherence to physicians recommendations [11] and permanent withdrawal from labor market.&#xD;
      Patients express that their single most prevalent and severe problem is &quot;dealing with feeling&#xD;
      tired&quot;, exceeding the proportion who expresses problems &quot;in dealing with not feeling sure&#xD;
      that the cancer has gone&quot; or &quot;being told they had cancer&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing emphasis has been given to rehabilitation in cancer patients and individualized&#xD;
      exercise programs; however, these will only be feasible among a minority of haematological&#xD;
      cancer patients. In recent years, studies using methylphenidate (MTP) in the treatment of CRF&#xD;
      in solid cancer have been conducted, some of which have found improvements in fatigue with&#xD;
      MTP and without significant adverse effects. These studies show that MTP may be beneficial in&#xD;
      management of CRF. However, patients in concurrent chemotherapy were unlikely to benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE Patients with haematological malignancies have a severe unmet&#xD;
      need in dealing with CRF and hardly any patients with haematological malignancies have been&#xD;
      included in previous intervention studies. MTP treatment has been found to be safe in this&#xD;
      setting . The current study aims at studying whether MTP can be used for management of CRF in&#xD;
      patients with haematological cancer in order to improve also functional capacity and quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL). Many of the patients in the current study will have no other treatment options&#xD;
      to improve their fatigue, QoL, and functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY END-POINTS The primary end point it patient reported fatigue after six weeks of MTP&#xD;
      treatment measured by the FACIT-F scale. A good clinical response is defined as a 25%&#xD;
      reduction in fatigue from baseline score. Secondary end-points are changes in hours awake, in&#xD;
      time spend at work, being social, house work / gardening, being outside, participating in&#xD;
      exercise, in muscle strength and endurance, in QoL, and in number of blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION AND DESIGN The study population comprises 150 patients with haematological&#xD;
      malignancies who are not in current chemotherapy. The patients will be included from seven&#xD;
      haematological out-patient clinics in Denmark. The haematological out-patient clinics have a&#xD;
      large group of chronic severely fatigued haematological cancer patients that will be&#xD;
      approached for inclusion in the trial. Power calculations, and assumptions behind as well as&#xD;
      a detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria are available from full study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized (1:1) to MTP or placebo treatment for 6 weeks. After this time&#xD;
      points patients treated with MTP will after one week wash-out cross over to placebo treatment&#xD;
      and vice versa (Figure). The rationale for the crossover design is that the study includes a&#xD;
      variety of different haematological malignancies with different symptomatology, course,&#xD;
      management and different degree of bone-marrow failure. When using patients as their own&#xD;
      controls the effects of these factors are accounted for. Treatment will be blinded to the&#xD;
      patient, treating investigators, staff, sponsor, and study secretariat. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to start either MTP or matching placebo twice daily. The dosage will start at 5 mg&#xD;
      twice daily at 8 am and 1 pm or matching placebo and can be titrated to a maximum of 20mg&#xD;
      twice daily or matching placebo. From day 1 in week 8 treatments will be crossed over from&#xD;
      either MTP to placebo or vice versa (Figure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT TOOLS The fatigue assessment scale - FACIT-F - has&#xD;
      been widely used in studies of cancer related fatigue and a FACIT-F score change both as a&#xD;
      covariate and as the main outcome measure in interventional studies. In line with us previous&#xD;
      clinical trials used a single VAS-fatigue assessment for inclusion prior to treatment. The&#xD;
      visual analogous scale is 100 mm long and ranges from 0 = &quot;not tired&quot; to 10 = &quot;worst possible&#xD;
      tiredness&quot;. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QoL&#xD;
      questionnaires are among the most widely used tools for assessing physical and psychosocial&#xD;
      symptoms in cancer patients. The EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL was developed for the palliative setting&#xD;
      [24]. Permission to include the fatigue and QoL scales has been granted to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY EVALUATION Efficacy of MTP treatment will be evaluated using FACIT-F,&#xD;
      EORTC-QLQ-C15-Pal, VAS-F as well as patients' perception on their energy and diaries on&#xD;
      activities. The study is powered to show a 4.25 point reduction in the FACIT-F scale&#xD;
      (corresponding to an estimated 25% reduction from baseline) that has been suggested as a&#xD;
      minimal important difference in studies of CRF. Assessments of functional capacity (muscle&#xD;
      strength and endurance) as well as patients' actual daily chores are also included in this&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
