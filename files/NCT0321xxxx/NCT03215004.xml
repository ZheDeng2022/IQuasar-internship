      Clinical specimens are required from HIV positive individuals with viremia controlled by&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy to complete process development for a genetically modified autologous&#xD;
      T cell product, AGT103-T. The product will be used in a subsequent early stage clinical trial&#xD;
      in subjects with chronic HIV disease and viremia suppressed by antiretroviral therapy as the&#xD;
      initial step in testing a functional cure for HIV disease. Enrolled participants provide a&#xD;
      venous blood specimen (approximately 25mL) to determine their level of HIV-reactive CD4+ T&#xD;
      cells. Subjects with positive T cell responses will be asked to undergo leukapheresis and&#xD;
      their clinical specimens will be used to validate and qualify the AGT103-T cell product.&#xD;

      This protocol is to collect blood specimens from HIV positive individuals. The first blood&#xD;
      draw will be done at the first study visit and if eligible, the second blood collection will&#xD;
      be done via leukapheresis at the second visit. The leukapheresis procedures will follow the&#xD;
      facility's standard operating procedures and protocol requirements for leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be males or females between and including the ages of 18 years and 60 years.&#xD;
      Volunteers will provide written informed consent and meet all inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Each participant can be in the study for up to 120 days (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with GCP/ICH for human research for the purposes of&#xD;
      obtaining clinical specimens for research. There is no endpoint for this study, however, data&#xD;
      collected from this study will include, but not be limited to, gender, demographics, medical&#xD;
      history, clinical laboratory values, and volume of the blood collected. The data will be&#xD;
      summarized in future studies reporting results from a planned clinical trial.&#xD;

    <description>The blood samples collected will be tested to measure the absolute and relative levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Data will describe the range of CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses to peptide stimulation. The samples will also help validate the assays and processes for the development of the cell product to be used in a future clinical trial.</description>
