      Subjects will undergo a 7±1 day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and&#xD;
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects or their caregivers will manage their diabetes at&#xD;
      home per their usual routine using the study CGM and remain on current MDI or pump therapy.&#xD;
      This will be followed by a 5-day/4-night or from approximately 48 to 72 hours for children&#xD;
      ages 2.0-5.9 years, hybrid closed-loop phase conducted in a supervised hotel/rental house&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study schedule will consist of a standard therapy data collection week followed by a&#xD;
      hybrid closed-loop phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a 7±1 day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and&#xD;
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects or their caregivers will manage their diabetes at&#xD;
      home per their usual routine using the study CGM and remain on current MDI or pump therapy.&#xD;
      This will be followed by a 5-day/4-night or from approximately 48 to 72 hours for children&#xD;
      ages 2.0-5.9 years, hybrid closed-loop phase conducted in a supervised hotel/rental house&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hybrid closed-loop phase will begin prior to lunch on Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, subjects will participate in specific setpoint&#xD;
      challenges, meal challenges, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hybrid closed-loop will be discontinued approximately 5 hours after breakfast time on Study&#xD;
      Day 5. Subjects will be asked to complete a post-study questionnaire regarding their&#xD;
      experience with the system. Subjects will be discharged home when stable and all discharge&#xD;
      criteria are met. Subjects will consume a snack or meal after discontinuation of hybrid&#xD;
      closed-loop before they leave the study site.&#xD;
