  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose/maximum feasible dose&#xD;
      (MTD/MFD) of a single infusion of FATE-NK100 via intra-peritoneal catheter in women with&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer meeting one of the following&#xD;
      minimal prior treatment requirement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platinum resistant: may receive FATE-NK100 as 2nd line (as 1st salvage therapy).&#xD;
           Platinum resistant is defined as disease that has responded to initial chemotherapy but&#xD;
           demonstrates recurrence within a relatively short period of time (&lt; 6 months) following&#xD;
           the completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platinum sensitive: may receive FATE-NK100 as 3rd line therapy (as 2nd salvage therapy).&#xD;
           Platinum sensitive is defined as the recurrence of active disease in a patient who has&#xD;
           achieved a documented response to initial platinum-based treatment and has been off&#xD;
           therapy for an extended period of time (≥ 6 months).&#xD;
