  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small phase I study with dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts. The former&#xD;
      cohort will need up to 12 subjects with advanced solid tumor to define feasibility and&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); the latter up to 10 subjects to further define safety. Study&#xD;
      subjects will be adults with advanced solid tumor (dose escalation) and advanced non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on at least one first-line systemic therapy (dose&#xD;
      expansion).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) is a target of cancer immunotherapy. Epacadostat&#xD;
      (INCB24360) is an oral IDO1 inhibitor. IDO1 activation blocks T-cell activation, enhances&#xD;
      T-cell apoptosis and promotes the differentiation of na√Øve T cells to regulatory T cells&#xD;
      (Tregs). Preclinical findings suggest that IDO1 is critical for cancers to evade immune&#xD;
      surveillance and can be exploited for cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus is an oral Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. Protein Kinase B mTOR&#xD;
      pathway has been considered one of major signaling cascade downstream of receptor kinases in&#xD;
      human cells. Its activation in human cancer cells prompted scientists to develop its&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical findings found that sirolimus can enhance activity of anti-Programmed Death-1&#xD;
      (PD-1) antibody by suppressing Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in human lung&#xD;
      cancer models. Sirolimus is also known to suppress function of Tregs which contribute to&#xD;
      immune evasion in cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other research groups also reported that autophagy is essential for Thymus cell/lymphocyte&#xD;
      (T-cell) -mediated apoptosis which can be enhanced by AKT/mTOR/Phosphoinositide 3-kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K) inhibitors. These studies indicate that autophagy is essential for T-cell mediated&#xD;
      apoptosis signaling. Because autophagy is at least partially down-regulated by mTOR, mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitors such as sirolimus can be used to pharmacologically induce autophagy. Overall,&#xD;
      these findings suggest that activation of mTOR and resultant suppression of autophagy play a&#xD;
      critical role in resistance of IDO1 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a clear unmet need for patients with advanced NSCLC whose median survival is&#xD;
      approximately one year. Those who progressed on both standard first-line chemotherapy and&#xD;
      second line anti-PD-1 inhibitor do not have any standard therapeutic option. Novel&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy needs to develop for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat is currently being investigated in clinical trials in&#xD;
      combination with various agents. However, these existing studies do not consider that mTOR&#xD;
      and/or autophagy are key mechanisms of its resistance despite the abovementioned background&#xD;
      information. The purpose of this phase I study is to test the combination of sirolimus with&#xD;
      the IDO1 inhibitor in order to overcome potential resistance mechanisms associated with the&#xD;
      use of IDO1.&#xD;
