  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a non-blinded feasibility (pilot) study comparing triple therapy nebulizer vs&#xD;
      dry powdered inhalers (DPI) for care transitions in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) exacerbation patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that patients treated in hospital and discharged on respiratory medications&#xD;
      administered by nebulizers will exhibit better quality of life (QoL), symptom control, and&#xD;
      lower COPD and all cause hospital readmission rates compared with patients treated with&#xD;
      respiratory medications delivered by DPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to demonstrate that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients treated and discharged on nebulized bronchodilators will have fewer&#xD;
           readmissions to hospital at 30 and 90 days compared to the group utilizing DPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The nebulizer group will demonstrate a longer duration of time until hospital&#xD;
           readmission for COPD and all cause readmission compared to the group utilizing DPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The nebulizer group will demonstrate better QoL (measured by the SGRQ - Saint George&#xD;
           Respiratory Questionnaire) and symptom control (as measured by the CAT &amp; mMRC) compared&#xD;
           to the group utilizing DPI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used to treat Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are available primarily in&#xD;
      hand held inhaler devices that deliver dry powder (DPI), a soft mist or a metered dose of&#xD;
      spray (MDI). The frail, arthritic elderly are often prescribed DPI rather than MDI or soft&#xD;
      mist devices, because they require less coordination. DPIs however require the ability to&#xD;
      inhale against a resistance with a peak inspiratory force (PIF) more negative than 60 L/min&#xD;
      to break the dry powder into respirable particles. Preliminary data suggests that suboptimal&#xD;
      PIF's are common during an acute exacerbation of COPD, affecting 48% of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients, thus placing them at risk for treatment failure and possibly hospital readmission.&#xD;
      Use of nebulizers to administer respiratory medications may avoid the hazards of insufficient&#xD;
      dosing that can result from use of DPI however they are cumbersome, expensive and the variety&#xD;
      of drugs available in a nebulizer format is limited. We hypothesize that patients treated in&#xD;
      hospital and is charged on respiratory medications administered by nebulizers will exhibit&#xD;
      better symptom control and lower COPD and all cause hospital readmission rates compared with&#xD;
      patients treated with respiratory medications delivered by DPI. We aim to demonstrate that 1)&#xD;
      patients treated and discharged on nebulized bronchodilators will have fewer readmissions to&#xD;
      hospital at 30 and 90 days compared to the group utilizing DPI 2) that the nebulizer group&#xD;
      will demonstrate a longer duration of time till hospital readmission for COPD and all cause&#xD;
      readmission compared to the group utilizing DPI and 3) the nebulizer group will demonstrate&#xD;
      better symptom control compared to the group utilizing DPI. This nonblinded feasibility&#xD;
      (pilot) study will enroll 100 patients hospitalized for an exacerbation of COPD who are &gt; 40&#xD;
      years of age, have a clinical diagnosis of COPD. The study will consist of 3 outpatient&#xD;
      visits (Transitional Care Visit [314 days after discharge], Visit #2 [30 +/5 days after&#xD;
      discharge], and Visit #3 [90 +/5 days after discharge]). Visit #2 and #3 are for study&#xD;
      purposes, the Transitional Care Visit is standard of care. We hypothesize and aim to&#xD;
      demonstrate that patients treated in hospital and discharged on respiratory medications&#xD;
      administered by nebulizers will exhibit better quality of life (QoL), symptom control and&#xD;
      lower COPD and all cause hospital readmission rates compared with patients treated with&#xD;
      respiratory medications delivered by DPI.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life Measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations - Symptoms component (frequency &amp; severity) with a 1, 3 or 12-month recall (best performance with 3- and 12-month recall); Part 2: Activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness; Impact components (social functioning, psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease) refer to current state as the recall</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Control Measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a patient-completed instrument that can quantify the impact of COPD on the patient's health. The CAT is a validated, short (8-item) and simple patient completed questionnaire. The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40 and a difference or change of 2 or more units over 2 to 3 months in a patient suggests a clinically significant difference or change in health status. A score of &gt;30 indicates that COPD has a very high impact on daily life, a score of &gt;20 indicates a high impact, 10-20 is medium impact, &lt;10 is low impact, and 5 is the upper limit for healthy non-smokers. A higher score would represent a poor outcome for this test.</description>

    <measure>Symptom Control Measured by The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, or MMRC, uses a simple grading system to assess a patient's level of dyspnea -- shortness of breath. The scale goes from 0-4 with a 0 = I only get breathless with strenuous exercise, 1 = I get short of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill, 2 = On level ground, I walk slower than people of the same age because of breathlessness or have to stop for breath when walking at my own pace, 3 = I stop for breath after walking about 100 yards or after a few minutes on level ground, and 4 = I am too breathless to leave the house or I am breathless when dressing. 4 would represent the worst outcome.</description>

        <title>Symptom Control Measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT)</title>
        <description>The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a patient-completed instrument that can quantify the impact of COPD on the patient's health. The CAT is a validated, short (8-item) and simple patient completed questionnaire. The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40 and a difference or change of 2 or more units over 2 to 3 months in a patient suggests a clinically significant difference or change in health status. A score of &gt;30 indicates that COPD has a very high impact on daily life, a score of &gt;20 indicates a high impact, 10-20 is medium impact, &lt;10 is low impact, and 5 is the upper limit for healthy non-smokers. A higher score would represent a poor outcome for this test.</description>

          <title>Symptom Control Measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT)</title>
          <description>The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a patient-completed instrument that can quantify the impact of COPD on the patient's health. The CAT is a validated, short (8-item) and simple patient completed questionnaire. The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40 and a difference or change of 2 or more units over 2 to 3 months in a patient suggests a clinically significant difference or change in health status. A score of &gt;30 indicates that COPD has a very high impact on daily life, a score of &gt;20 indicates a high impact, 10-20 is medium impact, &lt;10 is low impact, and 5 is the upper limit for healthy non-smokers. A higher score would represent a poor outcome for this test.</description>

        <title>Symptom Control Measured by The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC)</title>
        <description>The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, or MMRC, uses a simple grading system to assess a patient's level of dyspnea -- shortness of breath. The scale goes from 0-4 with a 0 = I only get breathless with strenuous exercise, 1 = I get short of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill, 2 = On level ground, I walk slower than people of the same age because of breathlessness or have to stop for breath when walking at my own pace, 3 = I stop for breath after walking about 100 yards or after a few minutes on level ground, and 4 = I am too breathless to leave the house or I am breathless when dressing. 4 would represent the worst outcome.</description>
