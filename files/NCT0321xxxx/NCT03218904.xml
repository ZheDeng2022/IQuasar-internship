      Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) caused by deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme&#xD;
      leading to build up of a complex sugar called glycogen in liver and low blood glucose level.&#xD;
      Nutritional treatment involves supplying carbohydrates and uncooked cornstarch. Glycosade®&#xD;
      (modified cornstarch) has shown promise in maintaining normal blood glucose level in GSD I.&#xD;
      But the difficulty in nutritional treatment is determining the best type of carbohydrate to&#xD;
      be given to avoid low blood glucose. Thus, there is a need to develop a simple test to&#xD;
      examine glucose digestion and measure the utilization of different carbohydrates in GSD I and&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;

      Purpose: Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), also known as Von Gierke disease is caused&#xD;
      by deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) enzyme affecting 1:100,000 births worldwide.&#xD;
      Therefore, deficiency of this enzyme results in accumulation of glycogen in liver and&#xD;
      inadequate production of glucose leading to fasting hypoglycemia. Dietary treatment for GSD I&#xD;
      is based on supplying complex carbohydrates with small frequent meals, and use of uncooked&#xD;
      cornstarch (UCCS). Glycosade® (modified cornstarch) has shown promise in maintaining normal&#xD;
      blood glucose concentrations in subjects with GSD I. However, the primary dilemma in the&#xD;
      dietary treatment of GSD I is the choice of the exogenous carbohydrate sources to achieve a&#xD;
      desirable metabolic control and prevent hypoglycemia. In addition, the previous studies were&#xD;
      invasive, which required several blood samples, long study days (~10 h) and could not offer&#xD;
      mechanistic details of glucose metabolism in subjects with GSD I. Thus, there is a need to&#xD;
      develop a minimally-invasive method to examine glucose metabolism and measure the utilization&#xD;
      of different carbohydrate sources directly in subjects with GSD I and healthy controls. This&#xD;
      simple breath test will help individualize treatment and tailor carbohydrate supply in&#xD;
      subjects with GSD I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 1) Investigators hypothesize that the oxidation of 13CO2 from U-13C-glucose can&#xD;
      be detected in expired air; and13CO2 oxidation will be a sensitive measure to examine glucose&#xD;
      oxidation/metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Investigators hypothesize that 13CO2 oxidation from Glycosade® will have lower peak&#xD;
      enrichment (Cmax) compared to other carbohydrate source UCCS in patients with GSD I and&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: The difficulty in nutritional treatment of GSD I is determining the best type&#xD;
      of carbohydrate to be given to avoid hypoglycaemia. Therefore glucose metabolism and the&#xD;
      utilization of different carbohydrates need to be measured using minimally invasive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) Our first objective is to establish the use of U-13C-glucose breath test&#xD;
      (13C-GBT) and its oxidation to 13CO2 as a minimally-invasive technique to examine in vivo&#xD;
      glucose oxidation in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Our second objective is to measure the utilization of different exogenous carbohydrate&#xD;
      sources: UCCS and the extended release waxy maize cornstarch Glycosade® in healthy controls&#xD;
      and patients with GSD I using a minimally invasive 13C-GBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: The project consists of two experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1 - Pilot Study to Establish the Use of U-13C-Glucose Breath Test (13C-GBT) in&#xD;
      Healthy Controls A. Pre-study Day Protocol Written informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      participants before participating in the study. All participants will be requested to fast&#xD;
      overnight (~ 12 hours) and will be asked to come to the Clinical Research and Evaluation Unit&#xD;
      for a preliminary assessment (pre-study day) to measure basic anthropometry (weight and&#xD;
      height), body composition and resting energy expenditure (REE). Weight and height will be&#xD;
      measured by using a digital scale and a stadiometer, respectively. REE will be measured by&#xD;
      continuous, open-circuit indirect calorimetry (CareFusion Vmax Encore, VIASYS), which will be&#xD;
      calibrated prior to use. Total energy expenditure (TEE) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) are&#xD;
      associated to fat free mass (FFM); therefore body composition will be determined using&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (Quantum IV RJL systems). BIA measures resistance,&#xD;
      reactance and impedance by applying electrodes placed at the right wrist and right ankle.&#xD;
      Three readings for resistance, reactance and impedance will be taken for each participant -&#xD;
      then the mean of these readings will be used to determine FFM and fat mass (FM). FFM and FM&#xD;
      will be calculated using the manufacturer's software system (RJL Systems, Body Composition&#xD;
      Analysis V.2.1). A general questionnaire will be used during the pre-study day to give a&#xD;
      clear idea about medical history, nutritional status, supplement intake and physical&#xD;
      activity. Finally, 3-day dietary record sheets will be distributed to the participants to&#xD;
      record food consumption for any two days during the week and one day on the weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Two-Day Dietary Standardization During the two days prior to study, subjects will consume&#xD;
      a balanced diet containing at least 150 g of carbohydrate. This diet consisted of everyday&#xD;
      foods, however an outline will be given to subjects to ensure sufficiency based on foods&#xD;
      commonly eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Study day Protocol For pilot study, 10 healthy adults (19-35 y) will undergo 13C-GBT&#xD;
      protocols in two separate study days as a proof-of-principle, once without oral isotope dose&#xD;
      and once with oral isotope dose (U-13C-glucose), each study separated by ≥ 1 week. Thus, 10&#xD;
      healthy adults will be studied for a total of n = 20 studies. After obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent from the subject, the subject will be enrolled in the study. The participant will&#xD;
      arrive for the study day after fast (~4 h) to standardize measurements at the Clinical&#xD;
      Research and Evaluation Unit (CREU) at BC Children's Hospital. Basic anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements (body weight and height) will be collected and a brief study day questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to collect information on medical, diet and physical activity history. 2&#xD;
      Baseline breath samples will be collected to determine natural background 13C abundance.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive on study day 1 glucose (75 g/day) dissolved in sterile water, study day&#xD;
      2 U-13C-glucose (75 mg/day) (99 atom% 13C enrichment, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.,&#xD;
      Andover, MA) with glucose (75 g/day) dissolved in sterile water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will remain fasting and resting in CREU for the entire period of the study to&#xD;
      eliminate variability in CO2 production. Breath samples in quadruplicates will be collected&#xD;
      at 20,40,60,80,100,120,140,160,180, 200, 220 and 240 min after oral administration of&#xD;
      glucose. During the study visit, the rate of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) will be&#xD;
      measured for 20 minutes, two hours (120 minutes) after the oral glucose dose using an&#xD;
      indirect calorimeter (Vmax Encore, Viasys Healthcare Inc. Yorba Linda, CA). Assessment of&#xD;
      body composition will be performed using the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA-Quantum&#xD;
      IV, RJL Systems, MI). BIA calculated resistance, reactance and impedance by applying&#xD;
      electrodes would be placed at the right wrist and ankle. Three readings for resistance,&#xD;
      reactance and impedance will be taken for each subject then the mean of these readings will&#xD;
      be used to determined fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM). FFM and FM will be calculated&#xD;
      using the manufacturer's software system (RJL Systems, Body Composition Analysis V.2.1).&#xD;
      Finger-prick blood glucose samples will be assessed at the beginning and hourly until the end&#xD;
      of the study day using glucometer (One Touch® Ultra®, LifeScan, Inc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection and Analysis: Breath samples will be collected using breath bags (single&#xD;
      use collection bags, EasySampler System, QuinTron Instrument Company, Inc. Milwaukee, WI) in&#xD;
      disposable glass Exetainer® tubes (Labco Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK) using a collection&#xD;
      mechanism that permits removal of dead air space. The breath enrichment of 13CO2 will be&#xD;
      measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Subject characteristics will be expressed as the mean (SD). 13C-glucose&#xD;
      oxidation as 13CO2 will be the primary outcome measured, as this best describes the whole&#xD;
      body oxidation capacity for glucose. Area under the curve (AUC) for each subject's 13CO2&#xD;
      oxidation from t0 to t240, the time to reach maximum 13CO2 oxidation (tmax) and the maximum&#xD;
      peak enrichment in13CO2 oxidation (Cmax) will be calculated. A repeated-measures analysis&#xD;
      using restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be used to get the estimated parameters&#xD;
      with the MIXED procedure using SAS software (SAS/STAT; Version 9.2). A paired t-test will be&#xD;
      used to compare the 13CO2 oxidation at each time point without and with U-13C-glucose. All&#xD;
      values will be presented for individual subjects, and significance is set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2 - Minimally Invasive 13C-Glucose Breath Test to Measure the Utilization of&#xD;
      Different Exogenous Carbohydrate Sources in Healthy Controls and Subjects with Glycogen&#xD;
      Storage Disease Type I For initial set of studies, 10 healthy children (5-18 y) and 10&#xD;
      healthy adults (19-35 y) will undergo 13C-GBT four times. Then, 3 children and 5 adults with&#xD;
      GSD I will be recruited in 4 separate study days from our Pediatric and Adult metabolic&#xD;
      clinic at BC Children's and Vancouver General Hospital, respectively (if recruitment is a&#xD;
      challenge, we plan to approach clinics across Canada). After fast (~ 4 h for healthy controls&#xD;
      and 2 h for GSD I) subjects will receive on study day 1- UCCS (2 g/kg/day), study day 2-&#xD;
      U-13C-glucose (75 mg for adults; 1.5 mg/kg for children) (99 atom% 13C enrichment, Cambridge&#xD;
      Isotope Laboratories Inc., Andover, MA) with UCCS (2 g/kg/day), study day 3- the extended&#xD;
      release waxy maize cornstarch Glycosade® (2 g/kg/day) (Vitaflo International Ltd, Liverpool,&#xD;
      England), and on study day 4- U-13C-glucose (75 mg for adults; 1.5 mg/kg for children) with&#xD;
      Glycosade® (2 g/kg/day) dissolved in sterile water. On each study day, breath samples will be&#xD;
      collected every 20 min for 240 min. The rate of CO2 production will be measured at 120 min&#xD;
      after oral dose using indirect calorimetry. Blood glucose will be measured using glucometer&#xD;
      and finger-prick blood samples will be assessed at the beginning and hourly until the end of&#xD;
      the study day. The percentage of test carbohydrates exhaled, as 13CO2 will be measured over a&#xD;
      4 h period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Subject characteristics will be expressed as the mean (SD). 13C-glucose&#xD;
      oxidation as 13CO2 will be the primary outcome measured, as this best describes the whole&#xD;
      body oxidation capacity for glucose. Area under the curve (AUC) for each subject's 13CO2&#xD;
      oxidation from t0 to t240, the time to reach maximum 13CO2 oxidation (tmax) and the maximum&#xD;
      peak enrichment in13CO2 oxidation (Cmax) will be calculated for UCCS and Glycosade®. The&#xD;
      values obtained from the carbohydrate sources will be compared by using a two-tailed paired&#xD;
      t-test. Significance will be set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc, CA).&#xD;
