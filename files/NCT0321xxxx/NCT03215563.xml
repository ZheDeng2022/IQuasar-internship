  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. In patients with recent&#xD;
      stroke, the 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography-computed tomography highlights&#xD;
      high-risk culprit carotid plaque and is more discriminatory than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.&#xD;
      Using hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging investigators propose to&#xD;
      build upon these findings by prospectively assessing 18F-fluoride uptake in a broad range of&#xD;
      patients with acute transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke. Investigators will&#xD;
      specifically examine the association of 18F-fluoride uptake with multiparametric magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging assessments of atherosclerotic plaque, especially the role of thrombus and&#xD;
      lipid. Finally, using transcranial Doppler and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain&#xD;
      imaging, an assessment of the functional consequences of 18F-fluoride-positive&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque will be performed. If successful, this technique has a number of&#xD;
      valuable translational applications including the better selection of patients for carotid&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability to identify the culprit carotid plaque represents a key goal in carotid artery&#xD;
      imaging. Although an array of non-invasive imaging techniques can detect a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      complementary high-risk characteristics, no single modality can reliably identify vulnerable&#xD;
      plaques associated with future stroke development. Substantial histological data suggests&#xD;
      that specific plaque components identify patients at high-risk for future ipsilateral stroke&#xD;
      and cardiovascular events. This implies that investigators need to look beyond the&#xD;
      traditional paradigm where the basis for carotid endarterectomy were formulated by an&#xD;
      invasive imaging modality that provided no information on the arterial wall composition.&#xD;
      Alternative imaging strategies are therefore required targeting not only in vivo carotid&#xD;
      morphology but also plaque biology and disease activity. This is fundamental to optimal&#xD;
      risk-stratification and appropriate selection of patients for high-risk vascular&#xD;
      intervention. One new approach is to use non-invasive molecular imaging targeted at plaque&#xD;
      biology using hybrid systems such as positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;

        Two cohorts of patients with evidence of an acute stroke, transient ischaemic attack or&#xD;
        amaurosis fugax will be recruited as early as possible, but within 14 days of symptom&#xD;
        onset. All patients will undergo careful clinical evaluation including carotid Doppler&#xD;
        ultrasound assessment and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.&#xD;
