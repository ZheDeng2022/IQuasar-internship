      This study evaluates the effects of using reception staff to prompt patients by providing a&#xD;
      pamphlet and an opportunity to register in the waiting room via a mobile tablet on deceased&#xD;
      organ donor registration rates.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: There is a worldwide shortage of organs available for transplant, leading to&#xD;
      preventable morbidity and mortality. While the majority of the general public in many&#xD;
      countries support organ donation, actual donor registration rates are substantially out of&#xD;
      step with these views. For instance, in Canada most Canadians support organ donation but less&#xD;
      than 25% in most provinces have registered. The family physician office is a promising yet&#xD;
      underused setting in which to address known barriers and facilitators to registration for&#xD;
      deceased organ and tissue donation and to provide an immediate opportunity to register while&#xD;
      in the waiting room for those wanting to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: The investigators aim to evaluate the effects of having reception staff in&#xD;
      family physician offices to prompt patients upon check-in with an educational pamphlet using&#xD;
      a cluster, stepped-wedge randomized design. A mobile tablet will also be added to the waiting&#xD;
      area to provide patients with the immediate opportunity to register. Family physicians are&#xD;
      also provided with an educational booklet and encouraged to discuss organ donation with their&#xD;
      patients. The investigators will use behaviour change techniques designed to address&#xD;
      previously anticipated barriers and enablers to organ and tissue donation registration. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention conducted in six family&#xD;
      physician offices in Ontario, Canada. Following a two-week baseline control period, offices&#xD;
      will cross sequentially into the intervention arm in a random sequence at two-week intervals&#xD;
      until all offices deliver the intervention (baseline + two weeks for each of six offices).&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients that have registered for deceased&#xD;
      organ donation following in the 7 days following their office visit, using routinely&#xD;
      collected registry data (i.e. administrative databases). The investigators will also conduct&#xD;
      a qualitative post-trial process evaluation will assess reception staff and family physicians&#xD;
      experiences with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Promoting organ and donor registration remains an important strategy for organ&#xD;
      procurement organizations and patients worldwide. The results of this trial will inform a&#xD;
      provincial roll-out strategy to promote organ donation in family physician offices.&#xD;
