    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility in patients with mitochondrial disease are increasingly&#xD;
      recognized and often include dysphagia, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth, constipation, and in severe cases surgery. Although the proposed pathological&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the development of GI dysmotility remain diverse, potential mechanisms&#xD;
      include mitochondrial dysfunction of smooth muscle within the GI tract and visceral myopathy.&#xD;
      Moreover, bacteria within the GI tract, termed 'gut microbiota' has also been identified as a&#xD;
      key contributor towards GI dysmotility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the role that the gut microbiota has on clinical&#xD;
      disease expression in patients with mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This is a feasibility study to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does clinical disease severity impact upon the gut microbiota in mitochondrial&#xD;
           patients compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for mitochondrial disease be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a pilot study and is part of the Newcastle Mitochondrial Research Biobank.&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected from patients with a Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy Lactic&#xD;
      Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) phenotype carrier of the m.3243 A&gt;G mutation (N=20)&#xD;
      from the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Mitochondrial Disease&#xD;
      Patient Cohort (RES/0211/7552, the largest cohort of mitochondrial patients in the world) and&#xD;
      the mitochondrial clinic and age and gender matched healthy controls (N=20). DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted from stool samples and the 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) will be sequenced. This data&#xD;
      will be analysed using bioinformatics pipelines and computational biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Goal: To generate novel information relating to how the gut microbiota impacts upon&#xD;
      clinical disease expression. This information could then be used to build a predictive model&#xD;
      designed to optimise diagnosis and therapeutic treatments. This method also holds potential&#xD;
      for use as a model for ageing and diseases associated with mitochondria not working properly,&#xD;
      such as diabetes, cancer and Parkinson's disease. This research has the potential to reduce&#xD;
      costs to the NHS and improve patient care and their quality of life.&#xD;

      Background Mitochondrial diseases are an important group of inherited neurometabolic&#xD;
      disorders that invariably exhibit multi-organ involvement, are relentlessly progressive, and&#xD;
      result in significant morbidity and mortality. They may manifest as discrete clinical&#xD;
      syndromes such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke like episodes&#xD;
      (MELAS), chronic and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), and maternally inherited&#xD;
      deafness and diabetes (MIDD), or more commonly with a wide overlapping spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      features, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility.&#xD;
      Symptoms arising from gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility in patients with mitochondrial&#xD;
      disease are increasingly recognized and often include dysphagia, abdominal pain, abdominal&#xD;
      distention, bacterial overgrowth, constipation, and in severe cases, intestinal pseudo&#xD;
      obstruction mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. The high incidence of this was recently&#xD;
      confirmed when we surveyed 86 mitochondrial patients about GI symptoms. Sixty five percent of&#xD;
      patients experienced GI dysmotility symptoms, including constipation, early satiety,&#xD;
      abdominal pain and abdominal distension (under preparation for publication). Although the&#xD;
      proposed pathological mechanisms underlying the development of GI dysmotility remain diverse,&#xD;
      potential mechanisms include mitochondrial dysfunction of smooth muscle within the GI tract&#xD;
      and visceral myopathy. Moreover, bacteria within the GI tract, termed 'gut microbiota' has&#xD;
      also been identified as a key contributor towards GI dysmotility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale To date, there are few effective treatments for patients with mitochondrial disease&#xD;
      and those available are predominantly supportive in nature with no proven treatment efficacy,&#xD;
      and poor understanding of the links between the gut microbiota, mitochondrial disease, GI&#xD;
      dysmotility and patient health and quality of life. Treatments include various antibiotics&#xD;
      and laxatives which are generic and not disease specific. Long term effects of drugs are&#xD;
      unknown and the impact these have on the GI tract and gut microbiota in mitochondrial&#xD;
      disorders are currently unknown. It is essential to optimise supportive therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies and design novel modalities to improve clinical management. Although advances in&#xD;
      technology now provide more biological information than ever before, the complexity and&#xD;
      volume of data generated exceeds the ability to analyse, interpret and translate this&#xD;
      information back into the clinical management, highlighting the need to increase clinical&#xD;
      analytical capabilities. The use of bioinformatics and computational biology to combine&#xD;
      metagenomics data relating to the gut microbiota and metadata (patient characteristics;&#xD;
      phenotype/genotype) is one approach to identify and predict what factors, such as drugs,&#xD;
      phenotype and genotype, induce gut microbiota dysbiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elucidating the complexity and workings of the gut microbiota in mitochondrial disease&#xD;
      provides a unique approach and deeper understanding of the biology in general, which is&#xD;
      currently lacking in primary mitochondrial disorders. This research will contribute to the&#xD;
      gut microbiome field and provide a novel insight into the complex microbe:microbe and&#xD;
      microbiota-host interactions. The new insights generated here will provide the foundation for&#xD;
      interventional studies aimed at manipulating the gut microbiome and relieving disease burden&#xD;
      in patients with mitochondrial disease and potentially diseases associated with mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction, such as obesity, diabetes and neuro-degenerative disorders such as dementia and&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypotheses is that patients with mitochondrial disease experience GI dysmotility,&#xD;
      and that the gut microbiota accentuates clinical disease severity. This study aims to provide&#xD;
      novel information relating to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does clinical disease severity impact upon the gut microbiota in mitochondrial&#xD;
           patients compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for mitochondrial disease can be improved.&#xD;
