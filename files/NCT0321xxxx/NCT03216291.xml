      Biofeedback therapy is a labor-intensive, multi-disciplinary, team approach for the&#xD;
      management of patients with Fecal Incontinence. It is not easily available to the vast&#xD;
      majority of patients in the community with this problem. It is therefore imperative that a&#xD;
      more pragmatic therapeutic approach that can be administered easily in the community ought to&#xD;
      be developed. However, whether a treatment program that is based on home-training can be just&#xD;
      as useful as office-based training has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess whether having patients train their pelvic floor muscles at home is as effective as&#xD;
      in-office biofeedback training.&#xD;

      The specific hypotheses that will be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Home training produces a similar degree of improvement as office biofeedback in&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. overall number of episodes of fecal incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. normalization of anorectal manometric pressures&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall quality of life and symptom perception on previously validated Fecal&#xD;
           Incontinence questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients with fecal incontinence will be recruited for this eight week therapeutic&#xD;
      investigation. Fecal Incontinence will be defined as at least 1 episode of solid or liquid&#xD;
      stool leakage per week. All patients will provide a detailed history and undergo physical&#xD;
      examination, structural (colonoscopy within 10 years) and anorectal manometry. Once eligible&#xD;
      for screening, they will sign a consent form and maintain a 2-week prospective stool diary.&#xD;
      If the diary confirms Fecal Incontinence and the inclusion criteria are met, they will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, patients will be randomized to receive either office-based biofeedback&#xD;
      therapy or home-training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office-Training: Patients randomized to receive office-based biofeedback therapy will receive&#xD;
      an outpatient treatment of neuromuscular pelvic-floor conditioning using biofeedback&#xD;
      techniques. In order to improve the pelvic floor muscle coordination and abdominal effort&#xD;
      during defecation, patients will be taught pelvic floor and abdominal muscle coordination&#xD;
      exercise. Here, the patients are taught to perform kegal-type exercises as well as distend&#xD;
      the abdomen by inhaling slowly and then to hold their breath for at least 15 seconds. They&#xD;
      are asked to practice this maneuver for 20 minutes, two or three times a day. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to attend the motility laboratory, approximately once every week. Biofeedback&#xD;
      therapy will be performed at these clinic office visits by placing a manometry probe that&#xD;
      consists of three pressure sensors and a balloon into the anorectum. The pressure sensors are&#xD;
      located at 1cm and 2.5 cm from the anal verge and the rectal sensor at 9cm. A 4 cm long latex&#xD;
      balloon will be fashioned around the rectal sensor. After probe placement, the patient will&#xD;
      remain clothed and seated on a commode in front of a monitor throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anal and pelvic floor muscle training: The goal is to improve the strength coordination and&#xD;
      isolation of pelvic floor muscles. Firstly, patients are instructed to isolate the anal&#xD;
      sphincter and puborectalis muscles and improve its strength by using modified Kegel exercises&#xD;
      in the sitting or lying position with a probe inserted. Visual and verbal feedback techniques&#xD;
      are used to reinforce the maneuvers, as they are being performed. The anal and rectal&#xD;
      pressure changes displayed on the monitor provides visual feedback to the patient. The verbal&#xD;
      feedback is provided by the therapist and consists of either complimenting the patient for&#xD;
      performing a correct maneuver or rectifying any errors. The patient is instructed to squeeze&#xD;
      and to maintain the squeeze for as long as possible. During the maneuver, the patient&#xD;
      observes the monitor and is educated about the changes in anal pressure/EMG activity. For&#xD;
      comparison, a normal recording is shown. As the sphincter strength improves, the patient is&#xD;
      encouraged to maintain a voluntary contraction for at least 30 seconds. Patients are&#xD;
      instructed not to use their abdominal or gluteal muscles to achieve a voluntary squeeze.&#xD;
      After a few sessions, the patient is encouraged to perform these maneuvers without visual&#xD;
      feedback. The patient is also instructed to perform squeeze exercises at home for at least 20&#xD;
      minutes, two to three times a day, and to perform about 20 squeeze maneuvers per session.&#xD;
      Training may be discontinued when patients demonstrate: A reduction in the number of&#xD;
      incontinence episodes and improvement in anal squeeze pressure and recto-anal coordination&#xD;
      when squeezing. Patients also receive sensory-motor coordination training. The objective here&#xD;
      is to achieve a maximum voluntary squeeze in less than 1 second after inflation of a rectal&#xD;
      balloon and to control the reflex anal relaxation by consciously contracting the sphincter&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to receive home-training will first receive advice regarding standard&#xD;
      treatment for fecal incontinence as described previously. Also, they will be asked to attend&#xD;
      the motility lab every two weeks to check on the training parameter and recheck the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation intensity if it is still appropriate for the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this session, they will be educated regarding the use of the home-trainer device.&#xD;
      After general instructions, the investigators will place a reusable, manometry attached with&#xD;
      electrical transducer probe into their rectum. Patients will be fitted with Velcro straps&#xD;
      that the research team will assist in fitting the patient for. These Velcro straps will allow&#xD;
      the probe to stay in place so that the patient will not be required to hold the probe in&#xD;
      place throughout the entire training session and thus free up their dominant hand. The probe&#xD;
      will be connected to a hand- held pressure sensing device and battery charged monitor with&#xD;
      color illuminations to indicate the patient's response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an FDA approved device for use in fecal incontinence. Next, the patient will be asked&#xD;
      to lay down on the side of their non-dominant hand, and with their dominant hand they will&#xD;
      inflate the manometry probe to a level they consider comfortable, tolerable and &quot;full&quot;. If&#xD;
      the patient reports this feeling to be tolerable for sustained daily exercise, this volume&#xD;
      level will be recorded and maintained for their first two weeks of at home training. Patients&#xD;
      will then self-stimulate electrical transducers on the probe to a level they consider&#xD;
      tolerable for sustained at-home exercise. This level will also be used for their electrical&#xD;
      stimulation throughout their first two weeks of in-home training. At this time the patient is&#xD;
      ready to begin their first training session. The device will provide voice-guided&#xD;
      instructions for the patients self-directed biofeedback exercise, as well as visual and audio&#xD;
      feedback during these pelvic floor muscle toning exercises. Thus, by observing the number of&#xD;
      lights that are activated, the patient receives instant feedback about their performance.&#xD;
      Initially, the electrical simulations will be set at the highest initial comfortable level&#xD;
      for most individuals. Thereafter, at subsequent office visits, appropriate adjustments will&#xD;
      be made and suitable targets designed for each patient to achieve the desired goal of pelvic&#xD;
      floor strengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be instructed by the InTone device's training paradigm, at least twice a day&#xD;
      and practice a minimum of 20 minutes of 10 second sustained squeezing then follow by 5&#xD;
      minutes of rectal electrical stimulation with the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each use, the probe can be rinsed with soap and water and reused. The training device&#xD;
      is battery powered and can be recharged. Once charged the power lasts for at least 30 days&#xD;
      and should facilitate the use of this device between office follow-up sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient compliance will be automatically monitored and stored in the device recorder. After&#xD;
      two weeks of home-training, the patients will return for a follow up assessment and exercise&#xD;
      compliance will be reviewed. Based on their progress, newer targets will be set by adjusting&#xD;
      the electrical stimulation levels of the training device. During this visit, any other&#xD;
      problems or issues will also be addressed. Four weeks later they will be asked to return&#xD;
      again and during this visit a repeat anorectal manometry assessment will be performed and&#xD;
      patients will complete post-treatment questionnaires.&#xD;
