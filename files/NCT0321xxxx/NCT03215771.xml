    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to document longitudinal outcomes in persons with traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (TBI) or stroke using the myoelectric upper limb orthosis with powered elbow and&#xD;
      grasp in conjunction with motor learning-based therapy using both patient centric performance&#xD;
      and patient reported outcome measures. Longitudinal observation allowed the investigators to&#xD;
      detect both the initial therapeutic effects as well as the later functional outcomes of&#xD;
      orthosis use. The investigators planned to recruit 15 Veterans and non-veterans who had TBI&#xD;
      or stroke and upper limb impairment. The study required 29 visits over 22 weeks and was&#xD;
      divided into three parts: orthotic fitting, therapy/training (9 weeks), and home use (9&#xD;
      weeks). Therapeutic and functional benefits were evaluated every 2 to 3 weeks over 18 weeks&#xD;
      using simple, short clinical tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study had two aims: (1) to evaluate therapeutic and neuroplastic effects of a&#xD;
      myoelectric upper limb orthosis in conjunction with motor learning-based therapy and (2) to&#xD;
      evaluate the functional effects of a myoelectric upper limb orthosis in conjunction with&#xD;
      motor learning-based therapy. The investigators planned to recruit 15 Veterans and&#xD;
      non-veterans who had Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or stroke and upper limb impairment, were&#xD;
      over 18 years of age and a minimum of 6 months from injury. The study required 29 visits over&#xD;
      22 weeks and was divided into three parts: orthotic fitting, therapy/training (9 weeks), and&#xD;
      home use (9 weeks). Therapeutic and functional benefits were evaluated every 2 to 3 weeks&#xD;
      over 18 weeks using simple, short clinical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were enrolled in the study if they met eligibility criteria assessed at a screening&#xD;
      visit. Once enrolled subjects were fit with a custom fabricated MyoPro Motion-G&#xD;
      elbow-wrist-hand orthosis following standard clinical procedures. This process required up to&#xD;
      three visits to cast, trial fit and deliver the orthosis. Subjects then participated in a&#xD;
      standard-of-care motor learning based therapy protocol in conjunction with the PERL (&quot;Push&#xD;
      Eat Reach Lift&quot;) training program recommended by Myomo, which consists of a 9 week, 18&#xD;
      session training plan. Every second week, there was one session that combined&#xD;
      therapy/training and outcomes evaluation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery for Upper Limb (FMA) from Baseline at Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of motor impairment of the upper limb. Thirty-three items of movement coordination and reflex activity are scored with a 3-point Likert scale (0-66 points total) where higher scores represent less arm impairment.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Modified Ashworth Scale from Baseline at Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>Using a 6-point scale, the clinician evaluates resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity as follows:&#xD;
0 No increase in muscle tone.&#xD;
1 Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension.&#xD;
1+ Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM.&#xD;
2 More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved.&#xD;
3 Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.&#xD;
4 Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension. A lower score represents less resistance to passive movement.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI) from Baseline at Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>Used to assess performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Measure consists of 13 functional tasks scores and the score for each functional task are summed to compute the total score. Scoring of each task is based on a 7-point scale (1=unable; 7=normal performance; minimum score is 13 points; maximum score is 91 points), where higher scores represent better performance of ADLs.</description>

    <description>An 11-item patient-reported survey that assesses satisfaction with device using a 5-point Likert scale. Satisfaction with device is the sum of the scores (score range: 11-55), where higher scores indicate better satisfaction with device.</description>

    <description>A life-role participation survey measuring the level of handicap using objectively observable behaviors in five dimensions: physical, social, cognitive, mobility, and occupation. Survey responses are combined using formulas for each domain. The score in each domain is capped at 100 (total score range: 0-500). Higher scores represent better self-reported participation.</description>

    <description>Motor learning-based (MLB) therapy included movement practice as close to normal as possible, high repetition, progression of challenge, part versus whole task practice, and knowledge of results. Treatment was customized to abilities of each subject and consisted of both MyoPro training and MLB therapy without device. Training with device was progressed using a hierarchy of challenge to increase complexity of movement. MLB therapy without device followed the same hierarchy, incorporating training of movements that could not be accomplished with the device and those that were trained with device. Movement quality was monitored and training practice was incrementally progressed as subject demonstrated improved ability to perform a given task/movement component. Subjects performed a custom home exercise program (HEP) on non-clinic days, increasing repetition as tolerated. At conclusion of in-clinic phase, individuals transitioned to a home phase where they continued to use the HEP.</description>

        <description>Using a 6-point scale, the clinician evaluates resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity as follows:&#xD;
0 No increase in muscle tone.&#xD;
1 Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension.&#xD;
1+ Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM.&#xD;
2 More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved.&#xD;
3 Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.&#xD;
4 Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension. A lower score represents less resistance to passive movement.</description>
