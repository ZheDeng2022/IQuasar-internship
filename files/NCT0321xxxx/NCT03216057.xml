  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objetive was to evaluate the safety and efficacy the 3 grams per day of omega-3&#xD;
      in adolescents with obesity and hypertriglyceridemia ( ≥ 150 mg/dl and ≤ 1000 mg/dl) for 12&#xD;
      weeks, compared with placebo. Half of subjects received 3 grams of omega 3, while the other&#xD;
      half received placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First of all, the omega-3 free fatty acids have an important effect for lowering&#xD;
      triglycerides through three potential mechanisms such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of triacylglycerol synthesis as direct inhibition of diacyl glycerol acetyl&#xD;
      transferase and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase results in lowering triacylgycerol&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation of fatty acid oxidation through activation of peroxisome proliferation activated&#xD;
      receptor stimulates hepatic mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta oxidation of fatty acids.&#xD;
      Decreased availability of fatty acids for triacylgylcerol synthesis results in lowering&#xD;
      plasma triacylgycerol levels Lipoprotein Lipase mediated clearance. One of the first&#xD;
      randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trials was managed by Harris in 1997 in&#xD;
      adult subjects with an average age of 46 ± 11 years and severe hypertriglyceridemia (500-2000&#xD;
      mg / dl) 20 subjects received placebo and 22 subjects 4 grams of omega-3. The mean percent&#xD;
      change from baseline in the omega-3 group was -45 ± 23% and in the placebo group was -16 ±&#xD;
      35% (p &lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, more clinical trials have recently been conducted with similar results such as the most&#xD;
      recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that was conducted by&#xD;
      Ta-Chen Su in Taiwan in adults with hypetriglyceridemia (200-1000 mg / dl). The first group&#xD;
      received 4 grams of omega-3 (n = 84), the second group received 2 grams of omega-3 (n = 82)&#xD;
      and the third group received placebo (n = 87). The mean percent change from baseline in the 4&#xD;
      grams of omega-3 group was -32.1%, in the 2 grams group of omega-3 was -29.7% and in the&#xD;
      placebo group was -5.4% (p &lt;0.0001) What is more, the strongest scientific evidence in favor&#xD;
      of supplementation of omega-3 acids fatty was determined by two meta-analysis, the first&#xD;
      study was published by Harris in 1997 that included 72 placebo-controlled clinical trials,&#xD;
      the study showed a reduction of 25-30% triglycerides levels with doses of 3-4 g omega-3&#xD;
      compared with placebo in subjects with triglycerides levels ≥500mg / dl. The second&#xD;
      meta-analysis by Balk that included 17 clinical trials (7,803 patients) with different doses&#xD;
      of omega-3 (0.8-5.4 g). The net reduction in triglycerides levels was -27 mg / dl (IC95%&#xD;
      22-30), p &lt;0.0001 In addition, the American Heart Association based on the meta-analysis by&#xD;
      Harris currently recommends the administration of 2 to 4 grams of omega-3 per day for the&#xD;
      treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500mg / dl) in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the Task Force for the Management of Dyslipidaemias of the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) currently recommends that if&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia is not able to reduce with statins or fibrates the physician will&#xD;
      prescribe 2-4 grams of omega-3 fatty acids to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the Food Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 authorized the administration of 2 to 4&#xD;
      grams of omega-3 per day for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500mg / dl) in&#xD;
      adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is enough evidence that medical literature supports the use of omega-3 in adult&#xD;
      patients for treatment of hypertrigyceridemia even the American Heart Association has made&#xD;
      the recommendation in its Scientific Statement but unfortunately in children the information&#xD;
      about the use of omega-3 for hypertriglyceridemia is insufficient to make clinical decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no specific recommendations and dosages of omega-3 in children and adolescents for&#xD;
      the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials are necessary to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in&#xD;
      children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing the efficacy and safety of supplementation of 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids for 12&#xD;
      weeks on serum triglycerides in adolescents with obesity and hypertriglyceridemia compared to&#xD;
      a control group that received placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing the efficacy and safety of supplementation of 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids for 12&#xD;
      weeks on serum cholesterol, HDL-C, glucose and uric acid in adolescents with obesity and&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia compared to a control group that received placebo.&#xD;
