      This is a randomized phase II open label study of daratumumab, weekly low-dose oral&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone with or without pomalidomide in patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma. The study consists of two arms. Patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      ARM A and ARM B in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment ARM A patients will receive daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and&#xD;
      pomalidomide as per the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daratumumab, IV, at 16 mg/kg, or Daratumumab, SC, at 1800 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for&#xD;
           Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15 for Cycles 3-6, and Day 1 of each cycle for Cycle 7 and&#xD;
           beyond for each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide, orally, at 400 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 28-day cycle. In order to&#xD;
           prevent myelotoxicity and bladder toxicity, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued after&#xD;
           cycle 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone orally at 20 mg on day of daratumumab administration (pre-daratumumab) and&#xD;
           20 mg on the following day. On weeks without daratumumab administration, 40 mg&#xD;
           dexamethasone weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide, orally, at 4 mg on Days 1- 21 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment ARM B, patients will receive daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and&#xD;
      pomalidomide as per the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daratumumab, IV, at 16 mg/kg, or Daratumumab, SC, at 1800 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for&#xD;
           Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15 for Cycles 3-6, and Day 1 of each cycle for Cycle 7 and&#xD;
           beyond for each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide, orally, at 400 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In order&#xD;
           to prevent myelotoxicity and bladder toxicity, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued&#xD;
           after cycle 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone at 20 mg orally on day of daratumumab administration (pre-daratumumab) and&#xD;
           20 mg on the following day. On weeks without daratumumab administration, 40mg&#xD;
           dexamethasone weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide, orally, added at first progression at 4 mg on Days 1- 21 of each 28-day&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subjects will remain on treatment as long as there is no evidence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient/physician decision to discontinue. Disease&#xD;
      assessment as determined by the Site Investigator will be made according to the IMWG response&#xD;
      criteria guidelines for MM.&#xD;
