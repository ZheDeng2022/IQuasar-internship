      In order to help the surgeons to clearly visualize their target operating area and create an&#xD;
      optimal operative field throughout the procedure, the device owners have developed a new&#xD;
      class of inflatable laparoscopic retractors for both bowel and organ specific retraction with&#xD;
      load bearing bore by an inflatable reinforced material that is atraumatic, biocompatible, and&#xD;
      are self-retained, i.e. require no personnel to maintain them post-placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the device owners menu of designs hold a range of 50 - 100 % of the bowels and&#xD;
      support at minimum 6 lbs in the vertical direction. All the device owners devices enter the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity through a conventional 10mm incision. The pressure within the inflatable&#xD;
      tubes of the device will not be above 15 mmHg, which is the current pressure used to&#xD;
      insufflate the patient's abdomen with carbon dioxide (CO2). The devices are able to retract&#xD;
      up to 10 cm of the bowels in any direction within the coronal plane and retract the bowels&#xD;
      10cm upward, towards the abdominal wall. Finally, the invention here-in described can be&#xD;
      manipulated easily to provide retraction of specific organs, including, liver, bladder,&#xD;
      uterus, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device has been approved by the FDA for clinical use (FDA Registered) and the purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the device in laparoscopic operations for safety and feasibility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The field of laparoscopy has been growing exponentially during the past decade because of its&#xD;
      tremendous benefits over open surgery such as minimal incisions, lesser post-operative&#xD;
      trauma, quicker recovery, lesser scarring, reduced hospital stay and lower infection rates.&#xD;
      It is clear that the success of any laparoscopic surgery lies on the optimal exposure of the&#xD;
      operative site. Surgeons and assistants are required to tightly strap the patients on the&#xD;
      surgical bed, continuously change the patient's position in order to use gravity to hold the&#xD;
      bowels out of the way and finally result in manual over manipulation of bowels and organs&#xD;
      using graspers in order to achieve the optimal exposure of their site. However, small bowels&#xD;
      or organs cannot be held back efficiently using these techniques and slide continuously into&#xD;
      the operating area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, the obstruction of the surgeons' visual field and the excessive manipulation of&#xD;
      the bowels cause unintentional injuries, bleeding, bruising, hematoma and perforations that&#xD;
      might require patients to undergo&#xD;
&#xD;
      additional surgeries because of scar tissue formation. The U.S market for scar tissue&#xD;
      prevention products is estimated at a staggering $2-3 billion. Furthermore, the current&#xD;
      standard of clinical care forces surgeons to add procedural steps in the operation in order&#xD;
      to minimize possible complications. However, these extra steps further extend the duration of&#xD;
      the operations, leading to a loss of money and reliability on behalf of the hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device owners bowel retractors eliminate the time-consuming mobilization of the small&#xD;
      intestines while they stabilize the bowels, allowing for a clear view of the operative site.&#xD;
      Given the increased demand of laparoscopic surgeries in which the device owners device is&#xD;
      helpful (approaching 5 million surgeries per year) the time saved after only a few uses of&#xD;
      the device owners device is significant enough to benefit hospitals in allowing them to host&#xD;
      another surgery that is waiting in the backlog. The device owners devices, thus, are not only&#xD;
      beneficial for the patients since they minimize trauma and complications but also highly&#xD;
      profitable for the hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed device contains a variety of novel features, which are enumerated henceforth.&#xD;
      The device owners device will be inflatable and will have inflatable &quot;ribs&quot; at the grasping&#xD;
      terminal of the device. The ribs will work in tandem with the mechanism of inflation in order&#xD;
      to adequately grasp the desired portion of bowel in the abdominal cavity. In addition, the&#xD;
      device owners device will be firmly attached to a solid steel center rod, with which the&#xD;
      surgeon can maneuver the device. The solid rod will also contain a sliding seal, such that&#xD;
      after the device has been inserted into the abdominal cavity, the seal can be slid into place&#xD;
      and will serve to effectively anchor the device on the abdominal wall. On the end of the rod&#xD;
      near the surgeon, there will be an attached handle with a trigger. This handle system will be&#xD;
      used to inflate the device by pulling the trigger and allowing compressed air through the&#xD;
      central rod. The handle will also be the point of contact between the surgeon's hand and the&#xD;
      device owners device, allowing him further maneuverability throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product is a bowl-shaped device that is intended to be used as an organ or bowel&#xD;
      retractor in laparoscopic surgeries. This device consists of a central, hollow rod made of&#xD;
      steel that has a straight proximal end and a curved distal end. The aforementioned distal end&#xD;
      of the device has an inflatable portion, the material for which encircles the central rod.&#xD;
      The inflatable portion also contains tubular projections which emanate from where the&#xD;
      material contacts the central rod out to the edges of the inflatable portion. These&#xD;
      projections are denoted henceforth as &quot;ribs&quot;. The inflatable material is a biocompatible&#xD;
      polymer that can hold sufficient tension and pressure for the application of laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery. The ribs curve inwards, which create a bowl-like structure when fully inflated and&#xD;
      deployed. Each of the ribs are connected to the central rod and to each adjacent rib via&#xD;
      membrane, which is connected medially to the central shaft all along the distal, curved end.&#xD;
      This creates a functional inflatable endoskeleton to support the bowels and organs that will&#xD;
      be in contact with this device during laparoscopic surgery. The amount of inflation of the&#xD;
      device can be modulated by the surgeon, by increasing or decreasing the inflation pressure as&#xD;
      desired by adding more compressed air or withdrawing compressed air, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proximal end of the central rod will have a handle grip with a trigger attached to it.&#xD;
      There will be an inlet for where a canister of compressed air will be positioned, such that&#xD;
      when the trigger is depressed by the surgeon, air will flow down the length of the hollow&#xD;
      central rod and inflate the device. The handle and grip&#xD;
&#xD;
      will be attached such that the surgeon can deftly maneuver and retract the device after it&#xD;
      has been inserted in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central rod will further house a sealing mechanism that can slide along the length of the&#xD;
      rod, from the proximal handle to the distal end. This sliding seal will be affixed in place&#xD;
      to the abdominal wall, allowing for a functional anchor and pivot point about which the&#xD;
      retractor has many degrees of freedom with respect to movement, while still being supported&#xD;
      by the seal to the patient's abdomen. A surgeon can choose to use a trocar in lieu of a&#xD;
      sliding seal, which will have to be placed on the central before the attachment of the handle&#xD;
      grip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the device is in place after being fully inflated, it has the ability to grasp and hold&#xD;
      the bowel in its concave interior region. The ribs help maintain the accurate shape and&#xD;
      rigidity of the inflated portion, and thus will allow the device to remain flush against the&#xD;
      bowel during retraction. The surgeon will then&#xD;
&#xD;
      presumably pull the central rod to a more beneficial location, such that the operative field&#xD;
      is no longer obstructed by the device. The surgeon can then affix the device to a surgical&#xD;
      bed clamp, so as to free the surgeon from holding the device in place throughout the duration&#xD;
      of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of now, the device is to be utilized for laparoscopic abdominal surgical procedures.&#xD;
      However, a similar or slightly modified product could be used for gynecological procedures as&#xD;
      well, and would aid in the retraction or holding of pelvic or lower abdominal organs in those&#xD;
      procedures. In addition, future variations of the design could be applicable to upper&#xD;
      abdominal or cardiothoracic procedures as well. This device could also potentially be used in&#xD;
      organ resection as well as retraction, in that modifications to the device could potentially&#xD;
      allow it to clear the operative field while simultaneously being involved in organ excision.&#xD;
