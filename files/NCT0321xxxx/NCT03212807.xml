      PHASE II STUDY OF DURVALUMAB IN COMBINATION WITH LENALIDOMIDE IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY EBV&#xD;
      ASSOCIATED SUBTYPES OF DLBCL, PRIMARY CNS LYMPHOMA AND PRIMARY TESTICULAR DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with relapsed refractory subtypes of DLBCL who fulfill the inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be recruited to this trial and treated in this open label, phase 2 trial with&#xD;
      the PDL1 inhibitor Durvalumab and Lenalidomide. The combination treatment will be given from&#xD;
      the time of recruitment for 6 months when Lenalidomide will be stopped but Durvalumab will&#xD;
      continue for a total of 2 years. Response will be assessed by PET / CT scans as per standard&#xD;
      lugano criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II study of Durvalumab in combination with&#xD;
      Lenalidomide for treatment of relapsed/refractory EBV associated DLBCL subtypes, primary&#xD;
      testicular lymphoma and primary CNS lymphoma using a Simon's Two-stage Minimax design.&#xD;
      Simon's two-stage Minimax design will be used to investigate if the overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) is at least 45% against a no-interest ORR of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, 13 patients will be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in these&#xD;
      13 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional patients will be accrued for&#xD;
      a total of 21 patients.This design yields a type I error rate of 5% and power of 80% when the&#xD;
      true response rate is 45%.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be ≥ 21 years of age on the day of signing informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically proven relapsed / refractory DLBCL classified under the following WHO&#xD;
             Subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i, EBV Positive DLBCL (of the elderly and immunosuppression associated) ii, T-cell /&#xD;
             histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma iii, Plasmablastic lymphoma iv, Gray zone lymphoma v,&#xD;
             Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma vi, Primary CNS Lymphoma (DLBCL) vii,&#xD;
             Primary testicular lymphoma The biopsy needs to have been obtained within 3 months of&#xD;
             signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have received at least one course (1 - 6 cycles) of Immunochemotherapy&#xD;
             for example Rituximab + Chemotherapy (CHOP or CHOP like) and must have relapsed or&#xD;
             refractory disease at the time of trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients should have been deemed ineligible or failed or refused an autologous stem&#xD;
             cell transplant in situations where stem cell transplant is the accepted standard of&#xD;
             care. In patients with chemo-refractory DLBCL, even if patient is suitable for ASCT,&#xD;
             transplant is extremely unlikely to achieve a response and hence such patients can be&#xD;
             recruited after careful consideration by the investigator in discussion with the&#xD;
             treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have measureable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least two dimensions on a CT scan or MRI scan in PCNSL. Minimum&#xD;
             measurement must be &gt; 15 mm in the longest diameter by &gt;10 mm in the short axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Minimum life expectancy of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate hematological function (unless abnormalities are related to lymphoma&#xD;
             infiltration of the bone marrow) within 30 days prior to signing informed consent,&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by a Study Investigator prior to&#xD;
                  starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the&#xD;
                  course of the study, and after end of study therapy. This applies even if the&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Male patients must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual&#xD;
             contact with a pregnant female or female of childbearing potential while participating&#xD;
             in the study, during dose interruptions and for 30 days after discontinuation of study&#xD;
             therapy, even if he has undergone successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. All patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have an understanding that the study drug could have a potential teratogenic&#xD;

             (dose interruptions), and for at least 30 days after the last dose of the study&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. iii)&#xD;
             Toxicity that has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 is allowed if it meets the inclusion&#xD;
             requirements for laboratory parameters defined in points 8 &amp; 9 under inclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
