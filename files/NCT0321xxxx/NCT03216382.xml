  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive and uncontrollable worry has been associated with deficits in attention control.&#xD;
      The Attention Training Technique (ATT; Wells, 1990) is a 12-minute audio recording that was&#xD;
      developed to train attention control, so that individuals could learn to shift their&#xD;
      attention away from maladaptive cognitive processes such as worry. The technique has shown to&#xD;
      be promising at reducing symptoms across a variety of mental disorders (Knowles, Foden,&#xD;
      El-Deredy, &amp; Wells, 2016) and is recommended for use in people who suffer from chronic worry.&#xD;
      To date, little research has been conducted examining the benefits of using this technique in&#xD;
      such a population. The present study aims to examine the immediate and short term effects of&#xD;
      weekly ATT practice, compared to a control condition, in a population that suffers from high&#xD;
      levels of worry about a variety of topics. About one-hundred participants who suffer from&#xD;
      chronic worry will be randomly assigned to listen to the ATT or a control recording, every&#xD;
      day for a week. Changes in attention control, worry, and cognitive processes will be examined&#xD;
      over the course of the intervention period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who suffer from pathological worry report that they worry to an excessive degree and&#xD;
      that they find it very difficult to control their worry. Deficits in attention control may&#xD;
      help to explain why people who worry pathologically find it difficult to shift their&#xD;
      attention away from their worry, and back to the task at hand. The Attention Training&#xD;
      Technique (ATT; Wells, 1990) was developed to train attentional control, so that individuals&#xD;
      could learn to shift the focus of their attention away from maladaptive cognitive processes&#xD;
      such as worry. Despite being recommended for use in populations that suffer from excessive&#xD;
      worry, there is a dearth of research examining the effects of ATT in such a population. The&#xD;
      study aims to examine the immediate (during the intervention) and short-term (right after&#xD;
      finishing the intervention) effects of listening to the ATT, compared to the control&#xD;
      recording, on attention, worry, and other cognitive processes. This will be the first study&#xD;
      to our knowledge to examine the effects of 1 week of daily ATT practice in a sample of people&#xD;
      who suffer from chronic worry, and will provide important information for optimizing the&#xD;
      treatment of worry in this population.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Baseline outcome measures will be completed at the first visit to the lab. Participants will then engage in a week of reporting on their worry and attention on their own, before coming back to the lab to recomplete the outcome measures. They will then be randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition and will engage in a week of daily listening to the corresponding recording for their condition on their own, while reporting on their worry and attention again during that week. Outcome measures will be completed again at the lab immediately following the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Breathing Focus Task -Negative Intrusions</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered three times over the course of two weeks. Changes will be examined from Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 2 (Preintervention, 1 week following Baseline) and Visit 2 to Visit 3 (1 week following preintervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioural measure of attention control over worry. Number of negative thought intrusions reported during the post-worry breathing focus period (i.e. a period of focused breathing after a period of worry). Scores range from 0-12.

        <description>A daily self-report measure of the frequency, duration, intensity and uncontrollability of worry. Only uncontrollability of worry was used (see Data Analysis Plan for rationale). Scores range from 0-6. Higher scores represent greater uncontrollability of worry.</description>

          <title>Daily Worry Questions</title>
          <description>A daily self-report measure of the frequency, duration, intensity and uncontrollability of worry. Only uncontrollability of worry was used (see Data Analysis Plan for rationale). Scores range from 0-6. Higher scores represent greater uncontrollability of worry.</description>
