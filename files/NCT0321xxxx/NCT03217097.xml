  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare but their incidence is growing. Alkylating agents (ALKY)&#xD;
      are one of the main systemic treatments used, at least for advanced duodeno-pancreatic NETs,&#xD;
      with a response rate of 30 to 40% and a median progression-free survival of 4 to 18 months.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic weapons, along with everolimus, somatostatin&#xD;
      analogs, and metabolic radiotherapy, for lung NETs, called typical and atypical carcinoids,&#xD;
      even if the level of proof of efficacy for these treatments is lower than for&#xD;
      duodeno-pancreatic NETs. Considering the available retrospective data, O6-Methylguanine-DNA&#xD;
      methyltransferase (MGMT) appears to be a predictive factor of the response to ALKY.&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin (OX) has demonstrated an interesting activity, with response rates between 17%&#xD;
      and 30%. In a first retrospective study we showed that Gemox is effective in NET, and more&#xD;
      recently that its activity is similar to that of ALKYs, but without being influenced by the&#xD;
      MGMT status. Prospective studies are needed but our data suggests that ALKY should be offered&#xD;
      first to patients with methylated MGMT tumors while Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be&#xD;
      offered first to patients with unmethylated MGMT tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we wish to evaluate the contribution of the MGMT methylation, evaluated in&#xD;
      the tumor, in predicting the Objective Response (OR) in patients treated with ALKY and to&#xD;
      evaluate a treatment with alkylating agents versus Oxaliplatin in patients with a&#xD;
      duodeno-pancreatic or lung or unknown primitive NET.&#xD;
