  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain is an important cause of neck pain or neck and shoulder pain. Neck shoulder&#xD;
      pain is a common socioeconomic problem that negatively affects the quality of life. Different&#xD;
      treatment strategies with limited effectiveness or application have been implemented.&#xD;
      However, medication remains a widely used approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The levator scapulae is one of the muscles involved in myofascial pain leading to levator&#xD;
      scapulae syndrome. The muscle limits the rotation of the neck. It is innervated by branches&#xD;
      of the third and fourth cervical nerves through the cervical plexus. Hence, performing&#xD;
      superficial cervical plexus block may have some potential effect in reducing myofascial pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomly divided into two equal groups using the computer-based sealed envelope&#xD;
      technique. Group I (Block) will receive superficial cervical plexus block and group II&#xD;
      (Placebo) will receive placebo. The physician, patient and data collector are all blind to&#xD;
      the patients' assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data including gender, age, BMI and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)&#xD;
      physical status will be noted at the initial visit. Moreover, patients' medical history, pain&#xD;
      history, characteristics and type of pain, as well as previous treatment are collected for&#xD;
      each patient. In addition, side effects, pain scores and analgesic consumption will be&#xD;
      recorded after performing the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 14 daily charts to record daily pain scores, symptoms and the use of&#xD;
      analgesics. Patients will be told to take their medications as usual. They will be contacted&#xD;
      via phone calls to ensure that they are recording information in the charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients with score &lt;4 are given 500&#xD;
      mg paracetamol with a maximum of 6 tables per day, or ketoprofen 100 mg tablet to a maximum&#xD;
      of 3 tables per 24 hours. Patients with a score&gt;4 are given tramadol hydrochloride 100 mg&#xD;
      tablet to a maximum of 3 tablets per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superficial cervical plexus block technique A nerve stimulator is used to guide the&#xD;
      superficial cervical block. The nerve stimulator needle is first passed over the skin after&#xD;
      aseptic preparation from the distal to proximal part of the posterior border of the&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid. Upon contraction of the levator scapulae, a mark is placed and the skin&#xD;
      is infiltrated with 1 ml lidocaine 1%. A 22-G, 2.5 cm nerve stimulator needle is subsequently&#xD;
      advanced through the skin by 0.5-1 cm depending on patient's weight while passing 5-8.5 mA&#xD;
      current at 1 Hz. Then, the stimulating current is reduced to 0.5-0.6 mA while maintaining&#xD;
      muscle contraction. At this point, 3-5 ml of the anesthetic mixture is injected. Each 10 ml&#xD;
      of the anesthetic mixture contains: 3ml lidocaine 2%, 3 ml lidocaine 2% with epinephrine&#xD;
      1:200,000, 3 ml bupivacaine 0.5% and 1 ml clonidine 150Âµg/ml. Group II will receive an&#xD;
      equivalent volume of normal saline.&#xD;
