  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unblinded, controlled, non-randomized, mechanistic study to determine whether physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying PVC are sensitive to adenosine. One hundred subjects undergoing&#xD;
      clinically-indicated, standard-of-care cardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) procedure for&#xD;
      PVCs will receive adenosine and/or verapamil to learn if their arrhythmias are inducible&#xD;
      similarly to sustained ventricular tachycardia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cellular mechanism of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is unknown. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously observed that 5% of patients in the investigators&#xD;
      electrophysiology laboratory with ventricular outflow tract PVCs have inducible sustained&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia (VT) that behaves in a manner similar to patients who present&#xD;
      clinically with sustained ventricular tachycardia, i.e., sensitive to adenosine and triggered&#xD;
      activity. This suggests that outflow arrhythmias may be a continuum of a single mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenosine is known to terminate ventricular arrhythmias that are due to triggered activity&#xD;
      (ref Lerman). To study the effects of adenosine on PVC, the investigators will administer&#xD;
      Verapamil to slow down the heart initially and adenosine after catheters are introduced to&#xD;
      patients who are being treated for symptomatic PVC and have consented to treatment with an&#xD;
      invasive electrophysiology study and catheter ablation. The investigators will observe if&#xD;
      there is any effect of reduced PVC following adenosine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that PVC will be suppressed by exogenous adenosine and/or&#xD;
      verapamil. The information from this study will elucidate the underlying cellular mechanism&#xD;
      of this common arrhythmia. Such knowledge could potentially lead to developing therapeutic&#xD;
      targets. Moreover, it will have potential clinical applications for inducing outflow tract&#xD;
      PVCs/VT in patients whose arrhythmia is suppressed at the time of their invasive&#xD;
      electrophysiology study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the Holter recording of premature ventricular contractions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the PVC coupling intervals can be helpful for delineating the mechanism of PVCs.&#xD;
      Holter monitors are being obtained on these patients prior to ablation as part of standard of&#xD;
      care. Holters monitors, if performed at our institution, will be analyzed in detail in a&#xD;
      retrospective fashion. Holter reports from 1/1/2015 - 5/15/2019 will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, evaluating the time intervals between PVCs and normal heart beats may elucidate&#xD;
      potential arrhythmia mechanism as triggered activity or modulated parasystole. Since a&#xD;
      subject has approximately 100,000 heart beats in 24 hours, the Holter data have to be read by&#xD;
      a converter file and outputted to an Excel file for our further analysis. The investigators&#xD;
      do not have access to a converter file and it is not commercially available. The&#xD;
      investigators will send the de-identified data to Dr. Mortara at UCSF. The investigators will&#xD;
      then analyze the timing intervals among PVCs and normal heart beats. It should be noted that&#xD;
      these Holters are obtained as part of a patient's normal evaluation and are not obtained for&#xD;
      the purposes of this study.&#xD;
