  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center Phase I/II clinical trial of GTB-3550 (CD16/IL-15/CD33) tri-specific&#xD;
      killer cell engager (TriKE®) for the treatment of CD33-expressing high risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes, refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or advanced systemic mastocytosis. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that GTB-3550 TriKE® will induce natural killer cell function by targeting&#xD;
      malignant cells as well as CD33+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which contribute to&#xD;
      tumor induced immunosuppression. Because CD16 is the most potent activating receptor on NK&#xD;
      cells, this single agent may induce a targeted anti-CD33+ tumor response.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive a single course of GTB-3550 TriKE® at their assigned dose as 3 weekly treatment blocks. Each block consists of four consecutive 24 hour continuous infusions (over approximately 96 hours) of GTB-3550 TriKE® followed by a 72 hour break after Block #1 and #2. All treatment is given as an inpatient. The assigned dose will be calculated on a weight obtained within 5 days prior to or on day of the 1st dose. The dose is not be recalculated for subsequent treatment blocks.</description>
