  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind comparative study examining the effectiveness of the rTMS&#xD;
      treatment on Freezing of Gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that treatment with rTMS on supplemental motor area will improve&#xD;
      gait quality and decrease the frequency of FOG in PD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD), characterized by sudden and brief episodes of inability to produce effective&#xD;
      forward stepping. FOG is a major risk factor for falls, and greatly contributes to reduced&#xD;
      mobility and quality of daily life. Treatment of FOG has been perceived as a very challenging&#xD;
      task. Although various treatment approaches exist, including pharmacological and surgical&#xD;
      options, evidence is inconclusive for many approaches and no clear treatment protocols are&#xD;
      available until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive neural modulation&#xD;
      technique, has been closely applied as a treatment for various neurologic and psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that rTMS could improve motor symptoms for PD&#xD;
      patients with a moderate effect size. To date, however, only few rTMS studies have focused on&#xD;
      its efficacy on FOG in patients with parkinsonism, and most of them targeted the primary&#xD;
      motor cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Even though some evidence indicates the&#xD;
      involvement of the SMA in FOG, no report has described the SMA rTMS in PD patients with FOG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, few studies combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and rTMS to&#xD;
      unravel the mechanism of its beneficial effects. To address these issues, the investigators&#xD;
      conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study to explore the efficiency of&#xD;
      SMA-rTMS on FOG in PD patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>functional connectivity will be assessed using fMRI, which can help understand the neural mechanism of the rTMS treatment. Using the baseline scans, the imaging biomarkers for freezing of gait and Parkinson's disease were developed by contrasting the connectivity profiles of patients with freezing of gait to those without freezing of gait and normal controls, respectively. These two biomarkers were then interrogated to assess the rTMS effects on connectivity patterns.</description>

        <description>functional connectivity will be assessed using fMRI, which can help understand the neural mechanism of the rTMS treatment. Using the baseline scans, the imaging biomarkers for freezing of gait and Parkinson's disease were developed by contrasting the connectivity profiles of patients with freezing of gait to those without freezing of gait and normal controls, respectively. These two biomarkers were then interrogated to assess the rTMS effects on connectivity patterns.</description>
