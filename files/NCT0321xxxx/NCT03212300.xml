      This is a randomized study to examine whether aerobic exercise training (AET) before total&#xD;
      shoulder replacement (TSR) surgery reduces the incidence of post-operative delirium (POD) and&#xD;
      shorten time to recovery in elderly patients. POD is a form of sudden change in mental&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will determine whether aerobic exercise training (AET) before&#xD;
      total shoulder replacement (TSR) surgery reduces the incidence of post-operative delirium&#xD;
      (POD) and shortens time to recovery in elderly patients. Delayed recovery affects up to 30%&#xD;
      of surgical patients and imposes enormous costs on patients, caregivers, and society.&#xD;
      Patients over 65 are four times more likely to experience POD, a form of sudden change in&#xD;
      mental function that could be experienced after undergoing surgery. POD is associated with&#xD;
      impaired daily functioning, longer hospital stay, more frequent institutionalization, and&#xD;
      increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of POD is a high clinical priority. Evidence suggests that an exaggerated&#xD;
      inflammatory response contributes to POD. Human studies show that AET may exert&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, recent animal data show that AET attenuates the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to surgery and prevents associated cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will enroll elderly patients undergoing TSR surgery to examine whether a low-cost&#xD;
      intervention before surgery can improve clinical outcomes (reduction in POD and decrease&#xD;
      recovery time). The effects of a 4-week AET program, specifically a type known as&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT), on the incidence of POD and time to recovery from&#xD;
      fatigue and functional impairment. We will also analyze patients' immune state before and&#xD;
      after surgery with modern techniques (high-dimensional mass cytometry). Understanding the&#xD;
      immune-modulatory effects of AET will reveal mechanisms that can be targeted by interventions&#xD;
      other than or in addition to exercise, which may benefit patients who are physically disabled&#xD;
      or require urgent surgery, and help identify non-surgical diseases that may benefit from&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
