      Oxidative processes increased in patients with renal failure and especially patients with end&#xD;
      stage renal failure on dialysis. Oxidative stress plays a role in renal damage and also on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, which can accelerate renal damage. Gum Arabic is&#xD;
      claimed to have antioxidant effect and this will decrease the harmful effect of the free&#xD;
      radical on patient on hemodialysis. In this study investigators are aiming to see the effect&#xD;
      of Gum Arabic on Oxidative Stress and inflammatory markers in patients on regular&#xD;
      hemodialysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive&#xD;
      intermediates or to repair the resulting damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells continuously produce free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of&#xD;
      metabolic processes. These free radicals are neutralized by an elaborate antioxidant defense&#xD;
      system consisting of enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase,&#xD;
      and numerous non-enzymatic antioxidants, including vitamins A, E and C and glutathione.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, such as renal&#xD;
      disease, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, arthritis&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), and aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence and incidence of patient suffering from chronic renal failure is increasing&#xD;
      worldwide and locally in Sudan(5). Several publication suggest that oxidative processes may&#xD;
      be increased in patients with renal failure. As oxidative stress plays a role in renal damage&#xD;
      it offers a potential target for therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lot of factors that can lead to oxidative stress in patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) . Intravenous administration of iron is widely prescribed in patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can cause oxidative stress.Hemodialysis is often used for&#xD;
      removal of excessive toxins, metabolic products, and blood components from patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal diseases (ESRD). Clinical studies have confirmed that hemodialysis (HD) is&#xD;
      associated with the development of oxidative stress and disturbance in the enzyme systems&#xD;
      that protect against oxygen free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure receiving renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy is cardiovascular disease . Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the cause of&#xD;
      death in 34% of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Increased lipid peroxidation and depletion of&#xD;
      chain- breaking antioxidants may contribute to increased risk of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antioxidants have been used as therapies to decrease oxidative stress and improve CVD risk in&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD) Patients .Many studies investigated the effects of antioxidant therapies on&#xD;
      biomarkers of oxidative stress or clinical outcomes. The majority were small trials using a&#xD;
      nonrandomized open-label design with a single HD group (no HD controls). The antioxidant used&#xD;
      were Alpha-tocopherol , vitamin c decreased oxidative stress and N-acetylcysteine .&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine was the most efficacious agent. Others studies have used a combination of&#xD;
      antioxidants that decreased oxidative stresses. Most of these intervention studies were done&#xD;
      in HD patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gum arabic is defined by the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee for Food Additives (JECFA) as 'a&#xD;
      dried exudation obtained from the stems of Acacia Senegal tree or closely related species of&#xD;
      Acacia (family Leguminosae).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GA is indigestible for both human and animals; Its fermentation by colonic intestinal&#xD;
      bacteria leads to formation of various degradation products, such as short-chain fatty acids&#xD;
      .Gum Arabic ingestion increases serum short chain fatty acid concentration, mainly butyrate&#xD;
      and propionate. Serum butyrate concentration increased following administration of GA in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. Oral intake of GA has been shown to provide several health benefits, such&#xD;
      as prebiotic effects. GA significantly increases Bifidobacteria, Lactobacteria, and&#xD;
      Bacteriodes in the gut. GA is claimed to have anti-cancer ,anti-malarial immune-modulatory&#xD;
      and antioxidant effects. GA treatment has been shown to favorably influence clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory results in rats with adenine-induced chronic renal failure CRF and in humans&#xD;
      diagnosed with renal failure, reported that GA was able to decrease high levels of several&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma and kidney of rats suffering from adenine-induced CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antioxidant effect of Gum Arabic has been observed in Number of published data .&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently 2017 reported more evidence that GA has potent anti- oxidative effects in&#xD;
      humans as demonstrated by its ability to increase TAC and to decrease oxidative stress&#xD;
      markers in humans, Almost all previous studies were conducted in animal models or in vitro&#xD;
      studies except the last one(17) . the increased intake of dietary antioxidants from GA may&#xD;
      help to maintain an adequate antioxidant defense status . GA can be utilized in other&#xD;
      clinical conditions and diseases caused by increased lipid peroxidation and tissue injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators are aiming to see the effect of Gum Arabic on Oxidative Stress&#xD;
      and inflammatory markers in patients on regular hemodialysis.&#xD;
