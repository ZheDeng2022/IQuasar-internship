  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess the PK similarity between patients receiving&#xD;
      Humira® continuously vs those who alternate between BI 695501 and Humira®, in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this trial are to descriptively compare the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and efficacy profiles between patients receiving Humira® continuously vs those&#xD;
      who alternate between BI 695501 and Humira®.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With a 75% Reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) Response at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 32</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is an established measure of clinical efficacy for psoriasis medications. The PASI is a tool which provides a numeric scoring for patients' overall psoriasis disease state, with scores ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation over four body regions (head, trunk, upper extremities and lower extremities). Higher PASI scores indicate more severe psoriasis. PASI is generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X percent(%) reduction from baseline (or PASIX), where X is 50, 75, 90, and 100. Results are reported for percentage of patients with a PASI75 response at Week 32. Analysis was done on per-protocol analysis set (PPS).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With a Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) Score ≤ 1 (Clear or Almost Clear) at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 32</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is a 5-point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the physician's assessment of the average thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions. The assessment is considered &quot;static&quot;, which refers to the patient's disease state at the time of the assessments, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states (dynamic), whether at baseline or at a previous visit. A lower score indicates less body coverage and a higher score indicates more severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe). Results are reported for percentage of patients with a sPGA score of ≤ 1 (clear or almost clear) at Week 32. Analysis was done on per-protocol analysis set (PPS).</description>

             disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may (i) put&#xD;
             the patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii) influence the&#xD;
             results of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to&#xD;
             participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>This was a 58-week, multiple-dose, active comparator trial of BI 695501 and US-licensed Humira in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The trial consisted of a single-arm run-in period of 14 weeks for all patients, followed by a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm period of 34 weeks. The total treatment period was 48 weeks followed by 10 weeks of safety follow up (SFU).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With a 75% Reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) Response at Week 32</title>
        <description>The PASI is an established measure of clinical efficacy for psoriasis medications. The PASI is a tool which provides a numeric scoring for patients' overall psoriasis disease state, with scores ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation over four body regions (head, trunk, upper extremities and lower extremities). Higher PASI scores indicate more severe psoriasis. PASI is generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X percent(%) reduction from baseline (or PASIX), where X is 50, 75, 90, and 100. Results are reported for percentage of patients with a PASI75 response at Week 32. Analysis was done on per-protocol analysis set (PPS).</description>
        <time_frame>At week 32</time_frame>
        <population>The PPS contained all patients from the TS who did not experience any important protocol violations relevant for efficacy. Missing data were imputed via non-responder imputation for patients who discontinued treatment early and multiple imputation (MI) for missing at random value. There were no cases where it was required to implement MI.</population>

It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation over four body regions (head, trunk, upper extremities and lower extremities). Higher PASI scores indicate more severe psoriasis. PASI is generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X percent(%) reduction from baseline (or PASIX), where X is 50, 75, 90, and 100. Results are reported for percentage of patients with a PASI75 response at Week 32. Analysis was done on per-protocol analysis set (PPS).</description>
          <population>The PPS contained all patients from the TS who did not experience any important protocol violations relevant for efficacy. Missing data were imputed via non-responder imputation for patients who discontinued treatment early and multiple imputation (MI) for missing at random value. There were no cases where it was required to implement MI.</population>

        <description>The sPGA is a 5-point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the physician's assessment of the average thickness, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions. The assessment is considered &quot;static&quot;, which refers to the patient's disease state at the time of the assessments, without comparison to any of the patient's previous disease states (dynamic), whether at baseline or at a previous visit. A lower score indicates less body coverage and a higher score indicates more severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe). Results are reported for percentage of patients with a sPGA score of ≤ 1 (clear or almost clear) at Week 32. Analysis was done on per-protocol analysis set (PPS).</description>
