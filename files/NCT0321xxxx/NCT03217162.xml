  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in neonates has been defined, the role of&#xD;
      surfactant is not clear. This study aimed to determine whether ARDS neonate would benefit&#xD;
      from surfactant when oxygenation deteriorated on mechanical ventilation and to identify any&#xD;
      potential risk factors related to mortality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, surfactant is not recommended to adult and pediatric ARDS. Meantime, systematic&#xD;
      review indicates that surfactant does not demonstrate statistically significant beneficial&#xD;
      effects on reducing the mortality and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) in term and&#xD;
      late preterm infants with meconium aspiration syndrome. Therefore, a reasonable speculation&#xD;
      is that preterm infants with ARDS do not benefit from one dose of surfactant. And the&#xD;
      speculation can explain why not all preterm infants with respiratory distress can be&#xD;
      beneficial from surfactant. In the era of pre-ARDS, the preterm infants fulfilling the&#xD;
      definition of ARDS may have been considered as respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the&#xD;
      first three days after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the diagnostic criteria of neonatal ARDS, a key procedure for diagnosis of&#xD;
      neonatal ARDS is to exclude the newborn infants with RDS. But no detailed procedures are&#xD;
      available to differentiate RDS from ARDS according the guideline of european RDS and&#xD;
      definition of neonatal ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there are two aim in the present study. 1. to proposel a new definition of RDS; 2.&#xD;
      to assess the beneficial effects of surfactant on neonatal ARDS.&#xD;
