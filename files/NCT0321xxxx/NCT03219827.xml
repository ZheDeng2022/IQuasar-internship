  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severity of allergic reactions are highly variable from one individual to another, they can&#xD;
      range from absent to life threatening. Allergic manifestations and specifically those of&#xD;
      anaphylactic reactions are generally attributed to an IgE-dependent activation of mast cells&#xD;
      and/or basophils followed by the release of histamine. Recently however evidence accumulated&#xD;
      that other pathways might similarly contribute or even trigger anaphylaxis. Moreover, while&#xD;
      the variance in human populations is an important subject to scientific research, medical&#xD;
      practices and public health policies typically take a 'one for all' approach to disease&#xD;
      management and drug development. Indeed, individual heterogeneity in the immune response can&#xD;
      have a big impact on the likelihood to respond to therapy. Because of the complexity of&#xD;
      immune responses in the individual and within the population, it has not been possible thus&#xD;
      far to define the parameters (genetic or environmental) that define the immune system of&#xD;
      allergic patients and its natural occurring variability. Thanks to the efforts that have been&#xD;
      made in the framework of the Labex &quot;Milieu Intérieur&quot; study genetic, immunological and&#xD;
      environmental factors have been identified that can be linked to the heterogeneity of immune&#xD;
      responses in healthy individuals. By comparing these already available data from healthy&#xD;
      individuals to a novel cohort of patients with defined severe allergic manifestations, we&#xD;
      will be able to identify for the first time immunological and environmental parameters that&#xD;
      are common to patients with severe allergies and identify those parameters that distinguish&#xD;
      allergic patients from the healthy donor cohort. This analysis will thus open new&#xD;
      perspectives on deregulated immune pathways in allergic patients allowing to orient future&#xD;
      treatment approaches. Furthermore, comparing immune responses before and after&#xD;
      allergen-specific immunotherapy will help understanding, which changes in immune responses&#xD;
      are causal to a successful treatment. Importantly, this analysis will shed light on the&#xD;
      individual differences that may predict the outcome of treatment approaches and propose novel&#xD;
      markers of its success.&#xD;
