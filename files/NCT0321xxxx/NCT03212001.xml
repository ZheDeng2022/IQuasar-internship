  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the overall impact of Telehomecare on COPD and HF&#xD;
      patients and system level outcomes using a comparison group of patients that did not&#xD;
      participate in the program (for up to 18 months). This evaluation study will explore costs,&#xD;
      participants' experiences, perceptions, and patterns of use related to Telehomecare. The&#xD;
      study will include eight Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) across Ontario, Canada.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The key question to answer is how different models of Telehomecare enabled self-management&#xD;
      impacts patient outcomes, experiences and system costs across Ontario. The evaluation study&#xD;
      will also attempt to answer questions on who is benefitting the most from the program and the&#xD;
      quantifiable benefits a patient would experience from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention evaluation study will use a mixed-methods design comprising of four&#xD;
      components (sub-studies), using both qualitative and quantitative research methods: (1)&#xD;
      Comparative Effectiveness Study that evaluates patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g.&#xD;
      hospitalization, ED visits) using administrative data in comparison with usual care; (2)&#xD;
      Economic Evaluation Study that will evaluate costs associated with the program and patient&#xD;
      level outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness of the program in comparison with 'usual care';&#xD;
      (3) Evaluation study of Telehomecare use that will evaluate the patterns of program use and&#xD;
      perceived quality of life, disease management, satisfaction and caregiver strain; and (4)&#xD;
      Adoption study that will use ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews (during and&#xD;
      after program participation) and review of documentary sources to gain understanding of&#xD;
      program adoption.&#xD;
