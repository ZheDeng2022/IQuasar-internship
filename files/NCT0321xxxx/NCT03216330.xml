  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Endometriosis affects 10% of reproductive aged females, and can have a negative&#xD;
      impact on sexual quality of life. Endometriosis can cause pelvic pain with deep penetration&#xD;
      during intercourse, as well as other sexual and non-sexual pains. This study will allow us to&#xD;
      determine if an increase in sexual pain is related to central sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an association between the&#xD;
      severity of sexual pain and central sensitization in women with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement tools: Data will be collected from the Clinic's Data Registry, an online&#xD;
      questionnaire, a quantitative sensory test (QST) to measure pain-pressure threshold (PPT) as&#xD;
      a marker of central sensitization, and daily entry to an online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Central sensitization (measured by lower pain-pressure threshold) will be&#xD;
      associated with an increased severity of deep dyspareunia, as well as a tenderness of the&#xD;
      bladder/pelvic floor and depression, in women with endometriosis.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis results from the presence of endometrial cells growing abnormally outside the&#xD;
      uterus and affects approximately 10% of reproductive-aged females. Endometriosis can be&#xD;
      associated with various types of pain such as: dysmenorrhea (painful cramps with menses),&#xD;
      deep dyspareunia (pelvic pain with deep penetration during intercourse), dyschezia (painful&#xD;
      bowel movements) and chronic pelvic pain. Few studies have explored the association between&#xD;
      endometriosis and deep dyspareunia resulting in a limited understanding of how to treat deep&#xD;
      dyspareunia. Deep dyspareunia is defined as pelvic pain with deep penetration and occurs in&#xD;
      50% of women with endometriosis at some time in their sexual lives. Deep dyspareunia has been&#xD;
      shown to lower or cease intercourse, thus lowering self-esteem and resulting in negative&#xD;
      effects on sexual functioning and interpersonal relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential contributor to deep dyspareunia in women with endometriosis that is largely&#xD;
      under-researched is the concept of central sensitization. Central sensitization is an&#xD;
      amplification of nociceptive signaling that may result from prolonged pain causing&#xD;
      sensitization of the dorsal horn neurons, which results in hyperalgesia (increased response&#xD;
      to pain) and allodynia (response to pain when there normally would not be). A recent study,&#xD;
      comparing cross-sectional data from suspected or surgically diagnosed endometriosis patients,&#xD;
      suggested that bladder and pelvic floor tenderness may be markers of central sensitization.&#xD;
      However, the linkage between the indirect markers of central sensitization and the presence&#xD;
      of central sensitization requires confirmation. This link can be assessed through validated&#xD;
      quantitative sensory testing (QST). Likewise, the association between central sensitization&#xD;
      and deep dyspareunia may also be confirmed through QST. QST is an objective measurement tool&#xD;
      to determine the presence and/or degree of sensory disturbances, by detecting the alterations&#xD;
      in nociceptive pathways. For example, a low pain-pressure threshold (i.e., increased pain&#xD;
      sensation) at healthy unaffected areas, as measured by QST, indicates central sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine if deep dyspareunia is associated with central sensitization in women&#xD;
      with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Is deep dyspareunia associated with central sensitization assessed by&#xD;
      decreased pain-pressure threshold?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the association between central sensitization and severity of deep dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the association between central sensitization and severity of non-sexual pains&#xD;
           and Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the association between central sensitization and tenderness of the bladder and&#xD;
           pelvic floor (determined by physician on physical exam).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the association between central sensitization and psychological measures&#xD;
           (assessed by validated questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Hypothesis: Central sensitization (measured by pain-pressure threshold) is&#xD;
           associated with an increased severity of deep dyspareunia, as well as a tenderness of&#xD;
           the bladder/pelvic floor and depression, in women with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Hypothesis: Women with endometriosis will have greater central sensitization&#xD;
           (indicated by a lower pain-pressure threshold) than women without endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Setting: The Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis program at the BC Women's Health Centre uses&#xD;
           an interdisciplinary approach to managing pain, including: physiotherapy for bladder and&#xD;
           pelvic floor, surgical intervention, pain education and medical management. This program&#xD;
           addresses multiple factors influencing pain through multiple approaches, as opposed to&#xD;
           the traditional approach of surgical removal of the endometriosis to resolve the pain&#xD;
           alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Design: This study is a longitudinal, prospective cohort study, involving cases and&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Outcome: Severity of deep dyspareunia (0-10 numeric rating scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Outcomes: Severity of superficial dyspareunia, severity of non-sexual pains,&#xD;
           and psychological questionnaire scores&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main Independent Variables: Central sensitization measured by pain-pressure threshold&#xD;
           (PPT) determined through QST&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Population: The case population includes women who have consented to the Data&#xD;
           Registry (H16-00264) and who are newly or re-referred to the BC Women's Centre for&#xD;
           Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis, and who have regardless of the severity of deep&#xD;
           dyspareunia, either: 1) previous surgical diagnosis of endometriosis or 2) current&#xD;
           ovarian endometrioma cyst or 3) current endometriosis nodule.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Size: 30 cases and 15 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment and Data Collection prior to Test date:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • At the end of their appointment with one of the endometriosis specialists at the BC&#xD;
           Women's Centre for Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis, the physician will ask the patient if&#xD;
           they are interested in learning more about this research study (if the physician deems&#xD;
           them acceptable to be included based on screening of inclusion and exclusion criteria),&#xD;
           and if so, will tell them a research assistant may call them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • A poster introducing the study will also be available in the clinic waiting rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • During a phone conversation, research team will remind the potential case participant&#xD;
           that they have consented to the data registry, and consent to this study allows us&#xD;
           access to analyze their data registry data. Verbal consent will be given if the&#xD;
           potential case participant would like to participate, and a test appointment will be&#xD;
           booked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Case participants will sign the consent form in-person at the beginning of the test&#xD;
           day appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Recruitment of the control group will be done by poster advertisement, as well as an&#xD;
           in-person information session at the BC Women's Hospital. If they are interested in the&#xD;
           study, potential participants will be asked to contact the research team to learn more&#xD;
           about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Research team will provide the potential control participant with a copy of the&#xD;
           consent form (in person or by email). Each potential control participant will be advised&#xD;
           to carefully read the consent form, and to contact the research team with any questions&#xD;
           about the information contained in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • If the control participant expresses interest in the study after reading the consent&#xD;
           form, a link to access the screening questions will be sent to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Criteria will be assessed by screening questions. If the participants are eligible&#xD;
           based on the screening questions then they will be asked if they would like to consent&#xD;
           to the study (online consent). This online consent allows access to the data from the&#xD;
           screening questions. If they are not eligible, or do not consent to the study their&#xD;
           screening questions will not be analyzed. If the control participant consents online&#xD;
           they will be asked to complete additional questions (height, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Research team will receive an email once the control participant has consented online,&#xD;
           and will contact the participant to book an appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • On the test day, the consent participants will sign the same consent form in-person to&#xD;
           consent to the testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures for Data Collection (on Test day)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Case and Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • An online questionnaire will collect data such as: score of sexual and non-sexual&#xD;
           pains, first day of last menstrual period,etc. The pelvic pain questions asked on this&#xD;
           online questionnaire are modified from the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form. This&#xD;
           questionnaire will be filled out online during the test appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Case and Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After the questionnaire has been completed, the participants will undergo QST to&#xD;
                measure their pressure-pain threshold (PPT), the point where the sensation of&#xD;
                pressure has changed to the sensation of pain. Before testing begins, it will be&#xD;
                made clear that the participants can withdraw from the study even during the&#xD;
                procedure if they find it too uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The PPT data will be written down on a paper copy with the unique study ID, and&#xD;
                entered into an encrypted excel file.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The observation made by this QST is that a lower PPT is suggestive of increased&#xD;
                central sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Feedback Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Case and Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • After the participant's PPT has been measured, they will be given an anonymous&#xD;
           feedback form to assess the procedure mechanisms and specifications, as well as comfort&#xD;
           level before, during and after testing. This will allow investigators to adjust any&#xD;
           necessary procedure details to create a more comfortable environment/test for future&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures for Data Collection (after Test day)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Online Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cases only:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Case participants will be asked to record study data daily for six weeks after&#xD;
                their scheduled test date.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The data collected, will allow for daily prospective pain scores, rather than&#xD;
                retrospective recollections of pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants without email addresses will have the opportunity to complete the surveys&#xD;
           on a printed out copy (given to them on the appointment day) and mail/bring in-person to&#xD;
           the Centre at the end of the 6 weeks.&#xD;
