    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II single-arm clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility of deescalating chemoradiation treatment based onmid-treatment tumor&#xD;
      response. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate progression-free survival at 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives will include 2-year loco-regional control and overall survival,&#xD;
      quality of life, and late toxicity. Quality of life outcomes can be assessed with a&#xD;
      validated, self-reported questionnaire. Late toxicity can be assessed using the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Additionally, the prognostic&#xD;
      value of positive HPV in salivary rinse as well as plasma at mid and post- treatment time&#xD;
      points will be evaluated with a baseline evaluation pre-treatment. Radiomic analysis of&#xD;
      pre-treatment imaging will be correlated with outcomes.&#xD;

                  without contrast)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Note: A CT scan of the neck and/or a PET/CT performed for the purposes of&#xD;
                  radiation planning may serve as both staging and planning tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide their personal smoking history prior to registration. Patients&#xD;
             cannot have a cumulative personal smoking history that exceeds 10 pack-years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a&#xD;
             different cancer is allowable;&#xD;

                  that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to&#xD;
                  exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments&#xD;
                  involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.&#xD;
                  Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immune-compromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Criteria for MRI: Normal MRI exclusion criteria will apply, including those&#xD;
             on the following list. A standard MRI safety form will be used to identify potential&#xD;
             conditions warranting exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrical implants such as cardiac pacemakers or perfusion pumps&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial&#xD;
