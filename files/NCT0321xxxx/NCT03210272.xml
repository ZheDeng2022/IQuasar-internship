    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI&#xD;
      1358894 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK), including dose&#xD;
      proportionality of BI 1358894 after single dosing.&#xD;
