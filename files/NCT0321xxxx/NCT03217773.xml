  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial that aimed to compare the short-term&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, functional outcomes, costs, and recurrence rates between endoscopic&#xD;
      submucosal dissection (ESD) and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) for early rectal&#xD;
      neoplasms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is an effective surgical alternative&#xD;
      to transanal excision for treating early rectal neoplasms not amenable to en bloc resection&#xD;
      by conventional colonoscopic techniques. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a&#xD;
      revolutionary endoscopic procedure that enables en bloc resection of large rectal neoplasms&#xD;
      with low morbidity. To date, no randomized controlled trial can be found in the literature&#xD;
      comparing the two modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare the short-term clinical outcomes, functional outcomes, costs, and&#xD;
      recurrence rates between ESD and TAMIS for early rectal neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients diagnosed with early rectal neoplasms&#xD;
      (&gt;/=2 cm in size and without evidence of deep submucosal invasion) that are not amenable to&#xD;
      en bloc resection by conventional colonoscopic techniques will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either ESD or TAMIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary outcome: 30-day morbidity/mortality defined by the Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
      classification. Secondary outcomes: hospital stay, functional outcomes and quality of life,&#xD;
      overall costs, R0 resection rate, and recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Results of the present study can provide evidence-based clarification of the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ESD in treating early rectal neoplasms. The Investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that ESD is associated with lower morbidity, shorter hospital stay, and similar R0 resection&#xD;
      rate when compared with TAMIS. A faster recovery and earlier discharge after ESD may reduce&#xD;
      financial burden to the hospital/healthcare system. The results of this proposed project may&#xD;
      have a significant impact on the future treatment strategy for early rectal neoplasms.&#xD;

    <description>SF-36 Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>ESD is an endoscopic procedure that enables en bloc resection of large tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, irrespective of the size of the lesion. ESD uses an electrosurgical cutting device to purposely dissect the deeper layers of the submucosa to remove neoplastic mucosal lesions in a single piece.</description>
