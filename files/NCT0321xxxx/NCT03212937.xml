      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor when given in combination with a&#xD;
      standard dose regimen of ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory PTCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the response rates (complete and partial), progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
           overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the feasibility of stem cell collection after selinexor and ICE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Paired tumor specimens pre and post selinexor will be examined ex vivo for&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response to chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin and etoposide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nuclear localization of tumor suppressor proteins (p53, p73, FOXO), drug targets&#xD;
           (topoisomerase II) and mRNA targets&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, open-label, phase I trial with a standard 3+3 dose escalation schema&#xD;
      to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor when combined with ICE. Once MTD is&#xD;
      determined, there will be an expansion phase and tumor biopsies and peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      taken pre and post selinexor to examine the study's biologic objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 0/3 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed, dose escalation will continue to the&#xD;
           next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 1/3 DLT is observed, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled in the same dose&#xD;
           level; if no DLT is observed from the additional 3 patients, then dose escalation will&#xD;
           continue to the next higher dose level. If any DLT is observed from the additional 3&#xD;
           patients, then the previous lower dose will be chosen as the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥ 2/3 DLTs are observed, then the previous lower dose level will be chosen as the MTD&#xD;
           and the dose finding procedure will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility criteria include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologically confirmed aggressive T-cell lymphomas including the following&#xD;
           histologies: PTCL-NOS, AITL, ALCL (independent of ALK status), NK/T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with at least two cycles of one prior regimen administered with curative&#xD;
           intent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate end-organ and bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of known or suspected CNS involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of active viral hepatitis or uncontrolled HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior and existing patient volumes and accrual to clinical trials, we expect to&#xD;
      enroll 1-2 patients per month. We expect to complete study accrual within 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD will be identified using a standard 3+3. A maximum of 18 patients will be required&#xD;
      for this phase I study. An additional 5 patients will be treated at the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose to assess safety and to examine the study's biologic objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSING REGIMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation schedule for selinexor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level -1: 20mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level 1: 40mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level 2: 60mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level 3: 80mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selinexor will be administered on days 3, 5 and 7 of each chemotherapy cycle and ICE will be&#xD;
      administered from day 1. In the expansion phase of the study, selinexor is administered on&#xD;
      days -5 and -3 prior to cycle 1 of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) Standard dose ICE on a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV Etoposide 100mg/m^2 on D1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV Carboplatin AUC 5 on D2 (inpatient) or D1 (outpatient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV Ifosfamide 5g/m^2 on D2 (inpatient) or D1-3 (outpatient)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) Dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20mg QD D3-7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20mg QD D-5 and D-3 (for patients in the expansion phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 2-6 cycles of selinexor and ICE. If determined eligible by their&#xD;
      treating physician, patients who demonstrate response will undergo autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation anytime following the second cycle of selinexor and ICE. Transplant&#xD;
      ineligible patients will complete up to 6 cycles of selinexor and ICE, and those with&#xD;
      responses or stable disease are eligible for maintenance selinexor at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician. Maintenance selinexor will be administered weekly at the dose of 60mg.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone 4-12mg should also be given on the selinexor dosing days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Neck to pelvis or FDG-PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh to be performed repeated after every&#xD;
      2 cycles on days 17 +/- 3 days except after cycle 2 where FDG-PET/CT will be performed&#xD;

        pregnant and men should be advised to not father a child while receiving treatment with&#xD;
        selinexor. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in&#xD;
        this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women that are pregnant&#xD;

          -  Patients must not have any condition, including the presence of laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to&#xD;
             participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
