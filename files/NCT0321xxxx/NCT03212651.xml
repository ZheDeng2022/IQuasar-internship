      monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the&#xD;
      interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2; Recent phase I trial provided&#xD;
      evidence of activity of pembrolizumab in advanced platinum-resistant metastatic urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma; Recent phase 3 trial showed an overall survival benefit in patients treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in a trial comparing pembrolizumab to chemotherapy in patients who failed&#xD;
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical&#xD;
      cystectomy is the standard of care for cisplatinum-eligible non-metastatic MIBC patients;&#xD;
      Many patients with MIBC are unfit for cisplatin-based combination treatment; Given its safety&#xD;
      profile, pembrolizumab may be used in unfit patients; Neo-adjuvant setting is a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to assess mechanisms of action of pembrolizumab in human&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;

             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including&#xD;
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation&#xD;
             or checkpoint pathways).&#xD;

             are eligible. HBV DNA should be obtained in these patients prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR is&#xD;
