    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine provide sedative, sympatholytic and analgesic effect, so it could be used as&#xD;
      an adjuvant to improve analgesia, hemodynamic response to intubation and pneumoperitoneum,&#xD;
      decrease the number of opioid-associated adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine infusion during&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized, single-center, controlled study was carried out from May 2016 to June 2017 at&#xD;
      department of surgery, anesthesiology and intensive care, Postgraduate Institute of&#xD;
      Bogomolets National Medical University. Study design was approved by Ethical Committee at&#xD;
      Bogomolets National Medical University (approval code 56).&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients elected for LCE were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were: age&#xD;
      between 18 and 79 years, either sex, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status&#xD;
      I to II. The exclusion criteria were age outside the specified range, pregnancy or lactation,&#xD;
      severe systemic disease (ASA III physical status), patients on b-blockers or calcium channel&#xD;
      blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the primary patient assessment, eligible participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      either the intervention (Group D) or control (Group C) groups using random assignment in&#xD;
      blocks of four. The randomization sequence was generated using a computer algorithm [19].&#xD;
      Randomization and data analysis were conducted by an independent blinded member of the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D received dexmedetomidine infusion 0,5 mcg/kg/h from induction in anesthesia to&#xD;
      extubation, group C (control) received normal saline infusion. To prepare the infusion,&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 2ml containing 100mcg of the drug was diluted up to 50 ml with normal saline&#xD;
      resulting in final concentration of 4mcg/kg. Dexmedetomidine or normal saline infusion was&#xD;
      given through infusion pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking the patient to the operation room, vital signs monitor Philips and Bispectral&#xD;
      Index (BIS) monitoring were attached (pulse, heart rate, electrocardiography (ECG), arterial&#xD;
      pressure (AP), oxygen saturation). Peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted for&#xD;
      intravenous fluids and infusion pump (separate line). Patients did not receive premedication.&#xD;
      Before induction they receive dexketoprofen 50mg IV and omeprazole 40mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-oxygenation was performed for 2 min, induction in anesthesia - with propofol 2mg/kg IV&#xD;
      and succinyl choline 1,5mg/kg IV. After intubation anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane&#xD;
      and atracurium bromide. The patients were ventilated with circle system with goal CO2 35-45&#xD;
      mm Hg. BIS-monitor target was between 40 and 60. Anesthetics and drug infusion were stopped&#xD;
      with the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy outcomes were number of patients with severe pain, time to first rescue&#xD;
      analgesia and postoperative morphine consumption. Severe pain was estimated as VAS≥7 during&#xD;
      30% or more time in first 48 hours after surgery. Time to first rescue analgesia was&#xD;
      estimated as time from end of anesthesia to the time postoperatively when patient ask for&#xD;
      analgesia or have VAS≥4. Injection morphine hydrochlorides 10mg subcutaneously was used as a&#xD;
      rescue analgesic. NSAIDs (dexketoprofen 150mg per day) were prescribed routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy outcomes included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from end of surgery to extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lengths of postanesthesia unit/general ward stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of chronic postoperative pain During first 48 hours after surgery patients in&#xD;
           both groups were evaluated by the nursing stuff using the Richmond agitation sedation&#xD;
           scale (RASS) for sedation, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment (every 2&#xD;
           hours or prior to rescue analgesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety was assessed by monitoring vital signs and recording adverse events. During anesthesia&#xD;
      all patients receive continuous ECG, BIS, pulse oximetry, capnography monitoring. AP was&#xD;
      measured every 3-5min. Arterial blood gases were checked by doctor prescription. An adverse&#xD;
      event was recorded if systolic blood pressure was &lt;90 or &gt;160 mmHg or if heart rate was &lt;50&#xD;
      or &gt;110 beats/min; desaturation was estimated as peripheral oxygen saturation (or SaO2) &lt;90%.&#xD;
      Interventions for bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension and hypotension comprised titration&#xD;
      or interruption of study agent, or additional drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using R software. Categorical data are presented as&#xD;
      proportions and continuous data as medians with 25-75% interquartile ranges (IQRs).&#xD;
      Chi-square testing demonstrated that all of the study variables were discrete. To assess&#xD;
      significance levels, a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test were used. A&#xD;
      p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
