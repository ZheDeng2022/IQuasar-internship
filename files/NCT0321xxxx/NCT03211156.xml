  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to determine if&#xD;
      amoxicillin will eradicate vaginal colonization/infection with Gardnerella vaginalis (GV)&#xD;
      when administered to women who are colonized/infected with GV but have no clinical evidence&#xD;
      of Bacterial Vaginosis (BV). The study will be conducted at 2 clinics in the United States:&#xD;
      University of Alabama at Birmingham and Wake Forest University Health Sciences. Entire study&#xD;
      duration is approximately 24 months and subject participation duration is approximately 22&#xD;
      days. Approximately 245 healthy adult females, 18 to 45 years of age will be screened to&#xD;
      enroll approximately 98 participants to achieve 82 evaluable participants at the test of cure&#xD;
      (ToC) visit. Participants will be enrolled and randomized to one of two groups, either&#xD;
      amoxicillin (2 x 250 mg capsules by mouth twice daily for 7 days) or placebo. Women who are&#xD;
      enrolled will be asked to return for one further visit, Visit 2 (Day 15 - 21), where a ToC&#xD;
      will be completed. For those not enrolled, participation will end at their post screening&#xD;
      follow up phone call. Women will be asked to use condoms during their participation. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine if treatment with amoxicillin eradicates GV in women who&#xD;
      are colonized/infected with GV but have no clinical evidence of BV.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to determine if&#xD;
      amoxicillin will eradicate vaginal colonization/infection with Gardnerella vaginalis (GV)&#xD;
      when administered to women who are colonized/infected with GV but have no clinical evidence&#xD;
      of Bacterial Vaginosis (BV). The study will be conducted at 2 clinics in the United States:&#xD;
      University of Alabama at Birmingham and Wake Forest University Health Sciences. Entire study&#xD;
      duration is approximately 24 months and subject participation duration is approximately 22&#xD;
      days. Approximately 245 healthy adult females, 18 to 45 years of age will be screened to&#xD;
      enroll approximately 98 participants to achieve 82 evaluable participants at the test of cure&#xD;
      (ToC) visit. Women who consent to screening participation will undergo pelvic examination on&#xD;
      entry and vaginal specimens collected for pH, whiff test and wet prep microscopy (Amsel&#xD;
      criteria with the exception of evaluation of vaginal discharge), Nugent score, nucleic acid&#xD;
      amplification test (NAAT) for trichomonas, quantitative NAAT for GV, and microbiome analysis.&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (Enrollment - Day 1), women who tested positive for GV by NAAT, negative for BV by&#xD;
      Nugent, and negative for trichomonas by NAAT will be enrolled and randomized to one of two&#xD;
      groups, either amoxicillin (2 x 250 mg capsules by mouth twice daily for 7 days) or placebo.&#xD;
      Women who are enrolled will be asked to return for one further visit, Visit 2 (Day 15 - 21),&#xD;
      where a ToC will be completed (a pelvic exam completed with the same specimens taken as those&#xD;
      at baseline with the exception of the trichomonas NAAT). For those not enrolled,&#xD;
      participation will end at their post screening follow up phone call. Women will be asked to&#xD;
      use condoms during their participation. The primary objective is to determine if treatment&#xD;
      with amoxicillin eradicates GV in women who are colonized/infected with GV but have no&#xD;
      clinical evidence of BV. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of amoxicillin compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>The Proportion of Participants With Eradication of Gardnerella Vaginalis (GV) in Each Study Arm at Visit 2 (Day 15-21) as Assessed by Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15 to 21</time_frame>
    <description>Eradication of GV is defined by a negative NAAT result for GV at Visit 2. Participants who have a missing GV NAAT result at the test of cure (TOC) visit were classified as treatment failures. The denominator for proportions is based on the number of subjects who were randomized to the specified treatment group.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 15 to 21</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product. SAEs included any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death; was life threatening; was a persistent/significant disability/incapacity; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs and SAEs were collected from participants following the first dose of treatment through Visit 2 (Day 15-21). Events are included if deemed by the investigator to be related to the study product.</description>
