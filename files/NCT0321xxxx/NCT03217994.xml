      The present study investigates whether it is possible to achieve equally satisfactory results&#xD;
      between 37.5% hydrogen peroxide gel and 6% gel for teeth bleaching. A prospective,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized clinical trial was carried out. A total of 33 patients were selected&#xD;
      from the clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Chile. The patients included&#xD;
      men and women over 18 years old without prior tooth whitening treatments, tooth decay, or&#xD;
      restorations of the upper front teeth. The patients had tooth colors of A3 or less according&#xD;
      to the Vita Classical scale, which was determined with a Vita Easy® Shade spectrophotometer.&#xD;
      The study was carried out with a &quot;split-mouth&quot; design. One side of each mouth was randomly&#xD;
      treated with 37.5% hydrogen peroxide, and the other side was bleached with 6% hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide. Each group received 3 to 12 minutes of treatment with the respective gel&#xD;
      applications. Two sessions of bleaching were carried out each week. Color was assessed at 7&#xD;
      different sessions for 3 months. The spectrophotometer was used to measure the total&#xD;
      variation of color (ΔE) between the baseline (session 1) and different measurement times&#xD;
      (sessions 2-7). We compared ΔE for both agents using the Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;

      2. Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Study design This study was a double-blind, randomized, prospective clinical trial. The&#xD;
      study was conducted according to the recommendations of CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials) while following the principles of the Helsinki Convention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Description of the sample 2.2.1. Selection of the sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 33 patients were selected from the clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry at the&#xD;
      University of Chile. The patients had been seeking whitening treatment and volunteered to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The selected patients had to meet all the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      signed informed consent forms (appendix 1) adopted by the Ethics Committee of Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry. The inclusion criteria were the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age over 18 years (both sexes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 present upper front teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No caries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No restorations (anterosuperior group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous whitening treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth color value of A3 or less (Vita Classical scale), which was determined with a&#xD;
           spectrophotometer (Vita Easy Shade® Compact) on the middle third of the vestibular&#xD;
           surface of the maxillary lateral incisors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were excluded based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or nursing mothers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In pharmacological treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bruxopatas and patients who reported prior tooth sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous tooth whitening (either at home or professionally)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visible dental cracks, developmental defects (hypoplasias enamel, hipomineralizaciones,&#xD;
           etc.), or teeth stained by tetracycline or fluorosis in the anterosuperior group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with fixed appliances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal disease or cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of non-carious cervical lesions, or endodontics in the anterosuperior group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experienced any pathologies that prevented them from entering the study (such as&#xD;
      caries, periodontal disease, or dental sensitivity) were directed for treatment to the dental&#xD;
      clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2. Sample size The sample size n was determined based on similar previous studies&#xD;
      (Bortolatto et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2015; Fernandez et al., 2016). A minimum n of 25&#xD;
      patients per group was determined. A significance level of 5% was considered at (1-β) 0.80&#xD;
      with a drop-out rate of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.3. Study location Treatments were carried out at the clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry&#xD;
      of the University of Chile. During this period, volunteers were supervised by the&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Procedure 2.3.1. Determination of study groups The study was carried out with a&#xD;
      &quot;split-mouth&quot; design. Bleaching agents (hydrogen peroxide) were randomly assigned to each&#xD;
      hemiarcade. The operators (R.H. and M.P.) were unaware of the product being used. To achieve&#xD;
      this, automixed syringes from a Polaoffice+ whitening kit were used (SDI Limited, Bayswater,&#xD;
      Australia). The syringes contained hydrogen peroxide in the form of thixotropic gel at a&#xD;
      concentration determined by the manufacturer and marked properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each gel syringe was re-labeled with a key number depending on the concentration of the&#xD;
      agent, which was determined by an operator (G.Z.) who was unaware of the procedures. All&#xD;
      color measurements were performed on the upper lateral incisors by different operators from&#xD;
      those mentioned (C.A. and C.A.). In one group, the hemiarcade was bleached with 37.5%&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide (Polaoffice + 37.5% SDI Limited, Bayswater, Australia). In the other group,&#xD;
      the hemiarcade was bleached using 6% hydrogen peroxide (Polaoffice + 6% SDI Limited,&#xD;
      Bayswater, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2. Preliminary phase We first verbally explained the procedures to perform and asked each&#xD;
      volunteer to read and sign an informed consent form (appendix 1). A clinic card (appendix 2)&#xD;
      was completed for each patient. In each case, a heavy silicone matrix (Speedex® Putty) was&#xD;
      prepared for both maxillary lateral incisors. These matrices were drilled at the height of&#xD;
      the union of the cervical third with the middle third of the vestibular tooth face to&#xD;
      standardize the color measurements with the spectrophotometer (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad&#xD;
      Säckingen, Germany). Another reason was to create a perfect fit with the nozzle of the&#xD;
      spectrophotometer to help control the passage of light to the measurement site. The color of&#xD;
      each upper lateral incisor was measured using the spectrophotometer, which was previously&#xD;
      calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions using arrays of heavy silicone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.3. Bleaching protocol Two whitening sessions were carried out with intervals of one week.&#xD;
      At the beginning of each session, dental prophylaxis was done with a brush at low speed.&#xD;
      Stone pumice and water were used in the upper front to remove the layer from the surface of&#xD;
      the teeth enamel so that it would not alter the effectiveness of the gels. We used a plastic&#xD;
      lip separator, a blue gingival barrier syringe, and light-curing (Polaoffice + SDI Limited,&#xD;
      Bayswater, Australia) to protect the soft tissue. We homogeneously applied the different gels&#xD;
      on the vestibular surfaces of each hemiarcade. One hemiarcade was treated with 37.5% hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide, and the other was treated with 6% hydrogen peroxide (Polaoffice + SDI Limited,&#xD;
      Bayswater, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol included 3 applications of 12 minutes each. The gels were in full contact with&#xD;
      the tooth surface and then were removed between each application with cotton rolls, which&#xD;
      were moistened with water and dried carefully. At the end of the third application, we&#xD;
      removed the gels, washed off all excess with plenty of water, and removed the gingival&#xD;
      barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.4. After bleaching All patients were instructed to avoid consuming foods with a high&#xD;
      content of pigments, such as coffee, tea, wine, and beets during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.5. Controls At the end of the first session, we measured the color of each lateral&#xD;
      incisor with the calibrated spectrophotometer. A week later, the same protocol was repeated.&#xD;
      The time to control sessions was considered from the last session of whitening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 3: Measurement times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.6. Tabulation of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained in each period were tabulated according to the three axes of the CIELAB system&#xD;
      (L *, a *, and b *). We also calculated ΔE using the Pythagorean theorem as follows (Westland&#xD;
      et al., 2003):&#xD;
&#xD;
      ΔE = [(ΔL)2 + (Δa)2 + (Δb)2]1/2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variation of each parameter in different times was always calculated in relation to the&#xD;
      initial values (the color measurement prior to the first session of whitening).&#xD;
